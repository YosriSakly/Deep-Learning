53,"Dec 05, 2018 05:21PM ET",Exclusive: Blackstone plans IPO of U.S. benefits manager Alight - sources,nan,"By David French and Joshua Franklin(Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) is readying an initial public offering (IPO) of Alight Solutions LLC, a U.S. provider of healthcare and retirement benefits services that could be valued at more than $7 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.The IPO could come in the first half of 2019, the four sources said, almost two years after Blackstone acquired Alight from insurance broker Aon Plc (N:AON), in a deal that valued it up to $4.8 billion. It would allow Blackstone to turn a profit by gradually selling its Alight stake in the stock market.Blackstone has hired Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) to underwrite Alight's IPO, the sources said. Blackstone will also consider any acquisition offers it may receive for Alight, even as it is focused on taking the company public, the sources added.The IPO could raise between $500 million and $750 million, one of the sources said, cautioning that its exact timing depended on market conditions.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Blackstone, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Alight and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Buyout firms have been prolific investors in businesses that help companies cut costs by outsourcing large parts of their administrative functions, since such operations can generate strong cash flows. Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Alight offers benefits administration and cloud-based human resources services to 22 million people, and generated revenue of $2.3 billion in 2017, according to its website.Before selling Alight to Blackstone last year, Aon had taken ownership of it as part of its acquisition in 2010 of Hewitt Associates Inc for $4.9 billion.Dealmaking has heated up in the benefits sector this year, as some of these companies turn to dealmaking to counter fierce price competition for their services.In October, French IT services company Atos SE (PA:ATOS) completed a $3.4 billion cash deal to buy Michigan-based IT services provider Syntel Inc, and last week payroll processor  Paychex Inc  (O:PAYX) agreed to buy Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp for $1.2 billion in cash.In another deal by a private equity firm,  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) said in September that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc, the largest U.S. insurance claims service provider, for $6.7 billion.(This story was refiled to replace the word 'some' with 'come' in second paragraph)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"Jul 23, 2018 06:32AM ET",France's Atos boosts U.S. presence with Syntel acquisition,nan,"(Reuters) - French IT services company Atos (PA:ATOS) is boosting its North American operations with a $3.4 billion cash deal to buy Michigan-based IT services provider  Syntel  Inc (O:SYNT).Atos' shares traded 7 percent lower by 1020 GMT on Monday on disappointment at its results when the French company reported revenue growth of only 1.5 percent for the second quarter.Atos, which provides IT services to sectors ranging from aerospace to retail, said the deal to buy Syntel will strengthen its activities in banking, finance and insurance and allow it to provide complete IT solutions to its U.S. customers.""[The deal] will significantly enhance [the Business & Platform Solutions Division's] growth and profitability profile through an extended digital services offering, cutting-edge India-based delivery platforms, as well as revenue and cost synergies,"" Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said in a statement.The acquisition of Syntel, a 38-year-old company with 23,000 employees, comes after last year's unsuccessful attempt by Atos to buy  Gemalto  (AS:GTO).Syntel provides technology and IT services utilising a network of software development centres in India. Atos will pay $41 per share, a premium of 4.78 percent to Syntel's closing price of $39.13 on Friday. Including net debt, the transaction is valued at about $3.57 billion.Atos said it expects the deal to provide double digit earnings per share (EPS) growth from 2019, with Syntel bringing the group around $1 billion in revenue and an operating margin of around 24 percent.Analysts at Invest Securities said the price was ""not excessive"", but a Paris-based trader pointed to the funding of the deal as a cause for concern.""They are financing it through debt, which is becoming a source of concern among investors with rising interest rates and a high level of debt among companies,"" he said.Analysts and traders also pointed to the company's first half results as a source of concern.""Atos’ H1 release suggests to us a deteriorating underlying picture, particularly in North America, against hopes that by this time its organic growth trajectory should have been improving,"" said Ameet Patel, Senior Analyst for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets.Atos' payments division Worldline (PA:WLN) on Monday reported half-yearly organic revenue growth of 5.8 percent and announced a deal to process payments for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), sending its shares up over 4 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

105,"Feb 12, 2018 06:46AM ET",France's Thales sees more cybersecurity sales after strong 2017,nan,"By Mathieu RosemainPARIS (Reuters) - French defense electronics group  Thales  (PA:TCFP) enjoyed a jump in sales at its cybersecurity business in 2017 and expects further strong growth in the coming years, said executive Laurent Maury. Maury said the business generated about 900 million euros ($1.10 billion) in sales over 2017, up from 700 million euros a year earlier. He added it is expected to grow by about 10 percent annually in the coming years.Governments and companies are behind a surge in demand for services and products aimed at better protecting data and information systems, in the wake of several global cyber attacks last year.""We're only at the dawn of a world in which this kind of risk emerges, constantly evolving with increased virulence,"" Maury told reporters on Monday. ""Every additional interconnection represents a potential vulnerability,"" he added. Last December, research firm Gartner published a report which forecast that worldwide enterprise security spending would total $96.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8 percent from 2017.Thales has strengthened its range of cybersecurity products over the last few years.In 2016, it bought data protection services provider Vormetric for 375 million euros ($460 million) - a deal which Maury said had enabled Thales to win a data security contract with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), France's biggest bank.Thales, led by chief executive Patrice Caine, is also expecting its 4.8 billion-euro ($5.9 billion) takeover of digital security group  Gemalto  (AS:GTO), due to be finalised later this year, to reinforce its cybersecurity expertise further. On the cybersecurity front, Thales' competitors include the likes of telecoms operator Orange (PA:ORAN), digital consulting firm Atos (PA:ATOS) and Raytheon (RTN).($1 = 0.8151 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The planned merger highlights the increasingly blurred lines between industrial and software companies as they try to grab a share of the fast-growing digital security market. ""In terms of DNA, the two companies look much more alike,"" said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co. ""It's not a financial deal, which was the case for Atos. They gave it a try, it was opportunistic.""The takeover ends a difficult year for Gemalto, which has made a series of profit warnings that hurt its shares and overshadowed its attempt to shift from a slowing market for phone SIM cards toward security services such as data encryption and biometric passports.""Our intention is to keep all of the assets in Gemalto's portfolio,"" Caine said in a call with analysts, suggesting that SIM card operations remained core alongside Gemalto's growing focus on cybersecurity.Thales forecast that Gemalto's revenues would grow 5 percent annually and said it expected Gemalto's EBIT margin to exceed its own within two or three years of the merger.Under the deal, unanimously recommended by the boards of both companies, Thales will merge its digital assets with Gemalto to create a business headed by Gemalto CEO Philippe Vallee.Vallee on Monday said he would stick to a plan to cut 288 jobs in its struggling SIM card business in France. ""This plan is maintained,"" he told BFM business radio, adding that he would try to redeploy staff internally where possible.Caine later told a news conference that Gemalto's staff would have the opportunity to get jobs at Naval Group, part of Thales.Atos said it would not engage in a bidding war but would be open to further discussions with Gemalto should the Thales deal collapse.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

114,"Dec 14, 2017 05:03AM ET",Banks drag European shares down as investors await Draghi,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Weakness in bank stocks dragged European shares lower on Thursday as the financial sector caught the cold from U.S. and Asian trading after a less hawkish than expected tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve.The Fed raised rates, as widely expected, but banks fell in Europe as cautious comments from Chair Janet Yellen on persistently low inflation shook investor confidence in financial stocks. They dragged Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) down 0.2 percent, while euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) fell 0.1 percent. ""It's really the Fed driving the movement today. It was a pretty dovish rate hike and wasn't voted through unanimously,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.""Bond yields all dropped on the back of it, which is bad for banks.""HSBC (L:HSBA), Santander (MC:SAN),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) were the biggest drags to the STOXX. The weakness in financials put the brakes on a developing shift in investors' preferences from tech stocks into sectors more likely to benefit from rising rates. ""I don't think the rally in tech is over, but tech is up 20 percent more than the next best sector so you're getting profit-taking,"" said McPherson. ""Banks are just a lot cheaper in a world where everything is quite expensive.""Tech was the worst-performing sector, with chipmakers Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and ASML (AS:ASML) down 2.9 and 0.5 percent.The sector was also weighed by French technology consultancy Atos (PA:ATOS) which fell 2.8 percent after  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) rebuffed a takeover offer.Despite being heavily weighted towards financial stocks, Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) rose 0.3 percent, bouncing back after heavy losses in the previous session due to resurfacing political worries.Attention was turning to central bank meetings later on Thursday, with the Bank of England and European Central Bank both expected to keep rates on hold. Investors will be scrutinising forward guidance from ECB chief Mario Draghi.""Any suggestion that (the ECB's) bond buying program is running out of steam, or that September is going to be targeted as an end... all the language around that will be quite key,"" said Psigma's McPherson.On the corporate front, the latest twist in South African retailer Steinhoff's accounting woes sent its Germany-listed shares down 6.7 percent as it said it would have to restate 2016 financial results.Among gainers, wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) jumped 5.9 percent, with its Spanish peer Siemens Gamesa (MC:SGEN) up 2.9 percent, with a change to the U.S. tax reform package giving the sector a boost.An original Senate proposal for an Alternative Minimum Tax, which would have jeopardized a tax credit renewable energy firms benefit from, was scrapped as a deal between congressional Republicans was reached on Wednesday.Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) shares fell 2.2 percent after the firm said it planned to axe and relaunch its Falcon 5X jet after engine delays. Safran  (PA:SAF), which provides the Silvercrest engines, fell 2.4 percent. (For a graphic on 'European benchmarks performance 2017' click http://reut.rs/2ksTtxV)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"Dec 12, 2017 12:40PM ET",M&A 'boom' dominates Europe share trading as oil leads gains,nan,"By Helen Reid and Danilo MasoniLONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions dominated European share trading on Tuesday, while strength in oil stocks after a pipeline shutdown helped lift a key regional benchmark index to five-week highs.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index climbed 0.7 percent to its highest level since Nov. 9, while euro zone blue chip stocks (STOXX50E) rose 0.4 percent, helped by a late drop in the euro . Gemalto  (AS:GTO) surged 34.6 percent after French tech consultancy Atos (PA:ATOS) tabled an all-cash bid valuing the Dutch cybersecurity company at 4.3 billion euros.Gemalto shares, which have been dented by four profit warnings in a year, led gainers on the STOXX on Tuesday and helped the tech sector (SX8P) bounce 1.7 percent. Gemalto's shares ended at 45.6 euros - just below the bid price.Gemalto has until Friday to review the unsolicited bid, which Atos hopes will boost its digital security credentials. Atos shares rose 7.1 percent to the top of the CAC 40. In other deal-driven moves, Unibail-Rodamco (AS:UNBP) declined 4.1 percent after the French commercial real estate group offered to buy shopping mall owner Westfield Corp for $16 billion. ""Year ends with M&A boom on French market,"" wrote Kepler Cheuvreux analysts. ""While the acquisition of Gemalto is not the straightforward one we expected, Atos's management has a strong track record for turning around companies,"" they added.Unibail's acquisition of Westfield would help it ""finally"" get U.S. and UK exposure, Kepler said. Oil stocks (SXEP) rallied after oil prices rose above $65 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 following a shutdown of the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline. The oil and gas sector (SXEP), which has been the worst-performing this year, jumped 1.6 percent. Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) rose 4.6 percent, with one trader pointing to a report that the company's chips were to be used in Huawei's Mate 10 Android smartphones. Dialog's shares have plummeted this year due to concerns over its reliance on top customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which could in-source its power chip production. ""The power chip in Huawei is a fast charging solution, and it's a new play for (Dialog) as far as a new customer,"" said Lee Simpson, analyst at Stifel.""But it's a difficult story to fully embrace given your 75 percent customer is leaving the building,"" he added. Stifel downgraded Dialog to ""hold"" from ""buy"" earlier on Tuesday.  Genmab  (CO:GEN) fell 6.2 percent after it flagged 2018 expense growth of 40 to 50 percent due to pipeline investments. South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) meanwhile jumped 22.8 percent, which still left its shares at around a quarter of their price before accounting irregularities emerged.

143,"Jan 29, 2016 11:01AM ET","Xerox to split into two companies, Icahn to get board seats on one",nan,"By Kshitiz Goliya and Liana B. Baker(Reuters) -  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) will split into two companies, one holding its legacy printer operations and the other its business process outsourcing unit, it said on Friday, in a bid to be more nimble after years of trying to integrate the businesses.Activist investor Carl Icahn, who first revealed a stake in Xerox in November, will get three board seats on the outsourcing company. He tweeted on Friday that ""the separation will greatly enhance value for Xerox Corp shareholders."" Xerox shares rose nearly 6 percent to $9.78.Xerox Chief Executive Officer Ursula Burns said in an interview on Friday that the strategic review had been underway before Icahn publicly revealed he had bought Xerox shares.""The reason why it was easy to get to a decision is because we do have two businesses that rotate around two different axes,"" Burns said.Xerox also posted fourth-quarter results, with profit rising 42.5 percent and costs and expenses falling 7.3 percent.The company, whose shares had fallen more than 30 percent in the past 12 months, has tried to turn itself around by focusing on software and services as customers cut printing costs. The document technology company, which will make printers and copiers, will have annual revenue of $11 billion, while the business process outsourcing company will have $7 billion in revenue.Regarding the two companies potentially attracting interest from buyers, Burns acknowledged that Xerox's board and executives would speak to anyone interested.""They are both strong and both large companies. But this would not be a small buy at $11 billion and $7 billion,"" she said.Susquehanna Financial Group LLP analyst James Friedman said he thinks Xerox's services business once it separates is ""an easy acquisition for someone but they will try and grow it themselves.""Xerox had been trying to turn itself around, shifting focus to software and services as corporate customers cut printing costs and consumers shift to mobile devices.Burns, who took the helm in 2009, said on Friday the leadership and names of the new companies were yet to be decided.Xerox also increased its quarterly dividend 11 percent to 7.75 cents per share, payable on April 29 to shareholders of record on March 31.Under Burns, Xerox took a leap into the services market in 2010 with its $6.4 billion acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services Inc.Burns said the services business has changed over the years and is not just the old ACS asset. In December 2014, it sold its informational technology outsourcing arm, previously part of ACS, to France's Atos SE (PA:ATOS) for more than $1 billion. The split, expected to be complete by the end of 2016, will deliver $2.4 billion in savings over the next three years, Xerox said.Lazard and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) were advisers to Xerox while Centerview Partners advised the board of directors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

149,"Oct 22, 2014 08:22AM ET",Lufthansa close to deal with IBM for IT infrastructure unit,nan,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is close to a deal to sell its IT infrastructure unit to IBM (N:IBM), including an outsourcing agreement for the services, as part of a shake-up of its technology activities, it said on Wednesday. Europe's largest airline by revenue is undergoing restructuring and cost-cutting efforts to better position itself to compete with low-cost carriers and Gulf rivals. It earlier this year said it was seeking a buyer for the unit, which provides data centers, networks and telephony, because it requires a high level of investment and economies of scale, which the airline could not provide. Under the planned deal, Lufthansa will outsource all of its IT infrastructure services to IBM under a seven-year deal and the U.S. firm will take over the airline's IT infrastructure division, currently part of Lufthansa Systems. The partnership announcement comes two days after IBM, a company undergoing a stark transition of its own, shocked the markets with lower quarterly results and by suspending its full-year forecasts. IBM, now largely a computer services supplier, said it suffered a marked slowdown in September as many customers stopped buying new services due in part to macroeconomic concerns but also the rapid pace of changing client demand for the latest technologies delivered as Internet-based services. Lufthansa shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading, the top gainer among German blue-chips (GDAXI), as analysts welcomed the progress in the restructuring of the division, The deal will result in a one-off pre-tax charge of 240 million euros for Lufthansa, which will not impact its operating result for 2014. It will allow Lufthansa to reduce its annual IT costs by around 70 million euros a year. A final price for the sale is still being negotiated, a spokeswoman told Reuters. The sale is part of plans to reorganize the Lufthansa Systems business into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and Industry Solutions, with the latter two to be kept within the Lufthansa group as independent companies. The infrastructure business, which employs 1,400 people, accounted for 40 percent of Systems' total turnover of 640 million euros ($883.45 million) in 2013 but it made up only 25 percent of the unit's profit. The Lufthansa Systems restructuring is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2015, with the deal to sell the IT infrastructure unit due to complete by March 31, 2015. Other parties reportedly interested in the unit were Hewlett-Packard (N:HPQ) and France's Atos (PA:ATOS).  (Reporting by Victoria Bryan, Harro ten Wolde and Eric Auchard; Editing by Thomas Atkins) "

152,"Oct 19, 2009 03:39AM ET",ANALYSIS-Indian outsourcers shy of blockbuster M&A,nan," * Dealmaking could help Indian firms take on bigger rivals * IBM, Dell, Cognizant expand offerings through
acquisitions * Indian firms set for nuts-and-bolts buys outside U.S. * Companies shy of big deals; lack of risk-taking appetite * Infosys, TCS shares double in '09 on growth view By Sumeet Chatterjee & Anshuman Daga BANGALORE/SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - In an industry
where size matters, India's showpiece software services firms
need to be bold and acquire firms or risk playing second fiddle
as bigger IT players emerge as one-stop shops for
cost-conscious clients. Oracle and Dell have snapped up targets to grow beyond
their core areas, while Xerox is buying Affiliated Computer
Services for $5.5 billion to jump into the outsourcing sector. By acquiring players with a wide client base, India's top
three IT firms -- Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys
Technologies and Wipro -- can leapfrog in size and clout,
helping them win multi-million dollar deals. So far, India's near-$60 billion IT sector has shied from
blockbuster deals and instead focused on acquiring smaller IT
divisions to tap opportunities in areas such as utilities and
healthcare. ""For good measure these companies have been conserving
their resources and as competitive pressure grows now is the
time to fill up some of their skill gaps through acquisitions,""
said Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, managing director at Tata Asset
Management. India's top three IT firms each has a market value of
between $18 billion-$27 billion and boasts a global footprint. These exporters individually employ about 100,000 staff,
mostly in low-cost India centers with manicured lawns, pizza
and Subway outlets, auditoriums, fitness centres and golf carts
to move around the sprawling campuses. IBM, Accenture and Hewlett-Packard have also expanded their
India-based workforce, enabling them to move more of their
overseas work to these lower-cost centres. IBM stole a march in 2004 when it swooped on Daksh, an
early local backoffice outsourcer, for $170 million, and now
employs over 70,000 staff in India. Accenture has over 40,000. India's two-decade-old IT sector already faces cut-rate
competition from the bigger players and is struggling to retain
experienced staff, usually lured away by global rivals. ""What might happen in the long-term is customers might work
with large all-services-under-one-roof kind of vendors, which
Indian vendors do not offer,"" said Gartner India's principal
research analyst Diptarup Chakraborti. Global clients are increasingly keen to partner vendors
offering an array of IT services -- from managing complex
computer networks and call centres to software coding. Infosys and Tata Consultancy shares have doubled in 2009,
versus a 45 percent rise in IBM and 19 percent in Accenture.
Infosys trades at 20 times forward earnings versus 14 for IBM. Firms such as Citibank, General Electric, BT, Ferrari and
British Airways count on Indian firms to help keep their
operations ticking. This month, Infosys' improved outlook failed to cheer
markets, suggesting a recovery will take time. RADAR ON SMALL BUYS For now, Indian IT firms are content with smaller buys. ""Looking for strategic buys that allows them to play on the
grand global stage, that's really the next step that these
Indian companies are in the process of taking,"" said Mark Mayo,
partner and president at advisory and research firm TPI. Analysts see them as potential acquirers in Europe as local
firms look to expand sales in markets other than the United
States to cut their big exposure to the world's largest
economy. However, they are unlikely to be keen to swoop on large
European IT players such as Capgemeni and Atos Origin due to
the potential risks arising from adding large headcount to
their existing base of low-cost staff. Instead, they may be keen to buy Indian backoffice
operations of banks such as BofA-Merrill Lynch and American
Express. Firms that specialise in consulting or offer services
to healthcare and energy firms are also targets. Cognizant Technology last week bought the Indian backoffice
unit of UBS for about $75 million. Infosys, which walked away from a bidding war with a
smaller local rival to acquire British IT firm Axon last year,
has built up a cash pile of $2.8 billion and is now looking for
buys to establish its presence in new markets and add new
service lines. HCL Technologies paid about 440 million pounds ($720
million) for Axon, marking the biggest overseas acquisition by
an Indian IT firm. Infosys CEO Kris Gopalakrishnan said: ""Our focus on
acquisitions is very different and that's a reason why we are
looking at an acquisition typically 10 percent of our revenue
-- that's about $400 million."" Cultural and integration risks associated with large M&A
are also a barrier and Indian firms are unlikely to shed their
cautious approach. ""They do not want to acquire a big-ticket player and maybe
they feel the integration issues will be too tough a challenge
to manage in the short to medium term,"" Gartner's Chakraborti
said.

153,"Oct 15, 2009 01:00PM ET",European stocks edge higher; Nokia tumbles,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 ends roller-coaster session up 0.1 pct * Nokia tumbles 11 percent on surprise loss, big writedown * Sainsbury surges 10 percent on renewed takeover talk * Index's P/E ratio at highest since May 2006
 By Blaise Robinson PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European stocks ended slightly
higher on Thursday, helped by takeover fever in the retail
sector, but gains were limited by Nokia's surprise loss and big
writedown that knocked down tech shares. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed the
roller-coaster session 0.1 percent higher at 1,017.26 points,
after rising to as high as 1,024.34, a level not seen since Oct.
7, 2008. Retail stocks rose, with J Sainsbury Plc jumping 10 percent
on market talk that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund was planning a
renewed offer for the British grocer, after a previous bid
attempt failed in 2007. Volume on Sainsbury shares represented 1,081 percent percent
of the stock's 90-day average daily volume. The M&A buzz propelled shares of UK retailers, with Tesco up
1.7 percent, Wm Morrison Supermarkets up 1.8 percent and
Kingfisher up 2.1 percent. Banks ended the session mixed, with HSBC down 2.1 percent
and Deutsche Bank up 0.7 percent, after results from Goldman
Sachs and Citigroup failed to impress investors a day after
JPMorgan posted forecast-beating profits that fuelled earnings
hopes. Citigroup posted a quarterly per-share loss as it suffered
$8 billion of credit losses, while Goldman's quarterly earnings
rose, but its shares dropped on Wall Street on disappointment
that so much of the profit came from trading gains that might
not be sustainable. The big credit losses at Citigroup revives concerns over the
health of the U.S. economy, said Victor Peiro Perez, head of
strategy at Caja Madrid Bolsa. ""Negative earnings, especially if it's coming from the
banks, could prompt a sector rotation on the market,"" he said. ""Financial stocks have already priced in an economic
recovery and could reach a plateau, while other stocks, such as
shares of software makers, still have room on the upside."" Banking stocks, hammered in 2008, have surged 175 percent
since the stock market hit a floor in early March. Nokia tumbled 11 percent after the world's top cellphone
maker unveiled a big writedown at its struggling networks unit
and posted a drop in its smartphone sales from the previous
quarter.  TECH SHARES TAKE A BEATING ""Profit margins are under pressure ... Nokia needs to do
some serious cost cutting to adjust to weaker demand,"" said
Christian Blaabjerg, chief equity strategist at Saxo Bank. ""We expect sales to drop more because consumers are
debt-haunted in Europe and in the U.S., making it very unlikely
that they will replace their cellphone with a newer model any
time soon,"" he said. Tech shares took a beating, with Alcatel-Lucent down 2.3
percent, Infineon down 3.7 percent and Atos Origin down 4.5
percent. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index fell 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX index shed 0.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 inched
0.03 percent higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 has surged 57 percent since reaching a
record low in early March, but is still down 38 percent from a
multi-year peak reached in mid-2007. The sharp seven-month rebound has propelled European stocks
to their highest valuation levels in nearly 3-1/2 years. Stocks
in the FTSEurofirst 300 index currently trade at 14.19 times
expected earnings, the index's highest price-to-earnings ratio
since May 2006, according to Thomson Reuters data.

154,"Sep 18, 2009 09:27AM ET",PAI prepared to cut buyout fund in half-sources,nan," * PAI could reduce fifth fund by 2.7 bln eur * Fund frozen as investors consider future commitment  By Simon Meads LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - French private equity firm PAI
Partners would be ready to scale down its 5.4 billion euro
($7.94 billion) buyout fund by half, following a recent
management bust-up, two sources familiar with the situation
said. Any shrinking of the fund, which bought stakes in IT
services company Atos Origin and building materials firm Xella
last year, would echo similar moves by peers TPG and
Permira, who have faced pressure from investors keen to reduce
their exposure to private equity. The move, which the sources said was outlined in a letter to
investors, follows the shock early retirement of Dominique
Megret as chief executive last month, twinned with the departure
of his right-hand man, Bertrand Meunier, last month, after a
boardroom battle with other partners. Megret's exit triggers a so-called ""key-man"" clause,
allowing investors to renegotiate their commitments to the PAI's
fifth European buyout fund. In extreme situations, the clause
allows for investors to withdraw all commitments and call for
the wind-up of a fund. ""The one thing that investors have made clear is that they
want everything to be done as quickly as possible,"" said one of
the sources. The clause has frozen PAI's ability to make new investments
as investors decide whether they want to reduce commitments and
support the new management team. It was PAI declined to comment.  INDUSTRY REELING PAI suffered a blow in July when it lost control of roofing
materials group Monier to a consortium of Apollo Management,
TowerBrook and York Capital backed by senior lenders. PAI's woes are echoed across a buyout industry struggling
with underperforming and over-leveraged companies, causing rifts
to appear among firms' management and with their investors. Jon Moulton earlier this month left Alchemy Partners
following an acrimonious bust-up with one-time protege Dominic
Slade, citing planned changes in strategic direction and reduced
deal capacity and activity. Moulton's public exit from Alchemy followed the more orderly
planned departure of industry veteran Colin Buffin from Candover
, as the British private equity firm looks to salvage its
suspended 2008 fund. Lionel Zinsou, who joined PAI from Rothschild last year,
succedeed Megret as chief executive. Before the boardroom
shake-up he was head of PAI's consumer goods group and a member
of the firm's executive committee. He advised PAI on a number of deals while at Rothschild,
including food producers Panzani, William Saurin and United
Biscuits. No formal proposal on the scale of the fund reduction has
been made to investors, one of the sources said.
