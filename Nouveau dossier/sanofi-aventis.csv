5,"Jun 07, 2019 10:20AM ET",France's Sanofi bets on new CEO to drive sluggish drug sales,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - In veteran drug salesman Paul Hudson, Sanofi's 100,000-plus employees are getting a new chief executive who relishes a good commercial fight.The French firm said on Friday it had poached 51-year-old Hudson from Novartis, betting on him to rejuvenate a business hit by sluggish cholesterol drug sales and a diabetes unit facing growing competition for its top seller. Hudson, the latest of several Novartis executives to exit the Swiss firm, has nearly 30 years of industry experience, including a stint as AstraZeneca's top U.S. manager.The Englishman, a skilled public speaker and fan of his hometown soccer team Manchester United, will replace Olivier Brandicourt, 63, who is retiring in September.At Novartis, Hudson kick-started sales of heart failure medicine Entresto that the firm expected to generate $5 billion but whose sales began at a glacial pace after its 2015 launch.After heavy marketing investment and a sales push, Hudson turned the drug into a Novartis blockbuster.""We're now starting to see the fruits of all the effort we put in,"" Hudson told analysts on a Novartis call in April. ""Will it continue? We believe it does continue.""At Sanofi (PA:SASY), one of Hudson's challenges will be to turn around the fortunes of Praluent, a cholesterol medicine that has failed to meet original expectations due to concerns about its price and a bitter patent dispute with rival Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).""The departure of Paul Hudson is regrettable for Novartis, due to his industry experience in the United States,"" said Michael Nawrath from Zuercher Kantonalbank.But his knowledge of the world's biggest drugs market will be Sanofi's gain. Hudson, awarded an honorary doctorate at his alma mater Manchester Metropolitan University, also has to defend Sanofi's patent-expired insulin Lantus, a top earner at 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) even after a 20 percent drop in sales.Competition will come from Mylan's generics and even Novartis, which in 2018 signed a deal with China's Gan & Lee to make Lantus copies.Hudson has proved a tenacious salesman at Novartis, winning approval for the world's costliest medicine, gene therapy Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, at $2.1 million per patient.Novartis said Hudson's replacement would be Marie-France Tschudin, 48, who has led the Swiss firm's European cancer unit after joining the company in 2017. She previously worked at Celgene's cancer business.It marks another change at the top of Novartis, where most of its executive committee was appointed in the last two years.""The turn-over at the Novartis executive committee continues at high speed,"" Bank Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said.This week, Samit Hirawat, head of oncology drug development, left for Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), while Novartis's cancer chief, Susanne Schaffert, has only been in her post since January. In March, the Swiss firm hired a new generics head, Richard Saynor, from GlaxoSmithKline.A Novartis spokesman said Novartis had a deep bench of global experts to fill talent gaps left by Hudson and others.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Jobs report on watch for impact on ratesThe U.S. Labor Department will publish its monthly employment report for May at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) Friday.Analysts forecast that the U.S. economy created about 185,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.Investors will keep a close eye on the data as Wednesday’s ADP release showed that job creation hit a nine-year low in May. Despite the worse-than-expected number, markets cheered the “bad news” as fuel for the Federal Reserve to embark on policy easing.2. Pence confirms tariffs on Mexico will go into effect ahead of further talksTalks between the U.S. and Mexico over the border issue will continue in Washington on Friday after Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard confirmed that his country will deploy 6,000 National Guardsmen to its southern border with Guatemala in an attempt to stop the flow of immigrants from Central America.U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said that he was “encouraged” by the efforts but that the 5% tariff increase scheduled for Monday was still on the table.“At this point the tariffs are going to be imposed on Monday,” Pence said, adding that the final decision would depend on U.S. President Donald Trump.3. Global stocks extend rally on hopes for U.S.-Mexico negotiationsGlobal stocks traded higher on Friday, extending a rally on hopes that negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico could avoid escalating tariffs.With stock markets in China and Hong Kong closed for a holiday, Asian shares ended higher on expectations global central banks will soon embark on an easing cycle to combat the slowdown in the global economy.France’s CAC 40 led gains in European bourses as investors cheered news that Sanofi (PA:SASY) had appointed Swiss rival Novartis' executive Paul Hudson as its new boss.While investors looked ahead to trade negotiations and jobs data, U.S. futures pointed to a higher open.

Blackout period to see Fed officials debate rate cutsWith the blackout period ahead of the Fed’s June 18-19 policy meeting set to kick off on Saturday, markets will brace for a lack of further comments from officials on the possibility of interest rate cuts.The June meeting will include updated economic projections that will reveal policymakers’ outlook on the economy and interest rates in the face of escalating trade tensions.After Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a willingness to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion”, markets are pricing in a 70% chance that rates are a quarter point lower after the July meeting and a more-than-50% chance that rates will be a half point lower following the September decision, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.5. Yuan drops as China’s central bank promises willingness to ease policyThe offshore yuan fell the most in more than three weeks against the U.S. dollar, as People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang hinted that there is no lower bound for the currency and indicated he was prepared to embark on further policy easing to combat economic fallout from the trade dispute with the U.S.The Chinese currency fell as much as 0.5% against the dollar.

Investors have largely favored defensive sectors such as utilities and healthcare in a week that has seen stock markets globally gain despite uncertainties over trade and monetary policy.Signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that interest rate cuts are on the cards have been at the heart of those moves, and monthly U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday are likely to set the tone for the next week. European stocks, however, were hit by a stronger euro on Thursday after the European Central Bank refrained from providing as dovish an outlook as hoped.""Major central banks are prepared to do what is necessary, should the situation warrant it. That reassurance is what has been holding equities up this week,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at London-based City Index.In fresh evidence that the trade friction and uncertainty over Britain's chaotic Brexit process were taking a toll, data showed German industrial output fell more than expected in April.However, the broader recovery in the region helped Germany's DAX rise 0.6%.Automakers, sensitive to trade headlines, gained 0.2% after a report that U.S. President Donald Trump could delay the tariffs he had threatened to put on Mexican goods as soon as this coming Monday.A 4.3% fall in German car parts maker Hella after a downgrade by brokerage BHF kept gains in check for the sector.The energy sector was the biggest gainer among the major subsectors with oil majors Total and  BP  (LON:BP) PLC up more than 1% as crude prices jumped.

Novartis named Marie-France Tschudin, president of Novartis unit Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA), to replace Hudson with immediate effect.""Hudson has been chosen because of his reputation. He is known as a solid manager and has digital expertise relating to pharmaceuticals,"" a Sanofi source said on Thursday.Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help to revive the fortunes of Sanofi and has been actively reshaping the business.Under his tenure, the company swapped its animal health unit with Boehringer Ingelheim for the German company's consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. Sanofi also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost-cutting measures and new priorities in research and development enabled Sanofi to return to profit in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters.Brandicourt's teams, however, failed to land two strategic acquisitions, losing out to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation in 2016 and failing to acquire Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017.NEW MEDICINESAt Novartis, Tschudin takes over a main drugs business with $35 billion in annual sales and a stable of medicines including newly approved $2.1 million-per-patient gene therapy Zolgensma, the world's most expensive one-time therapy, for children with spinal muscular atrophy.Hudson's departure follows the exit of Samit Hirawat, head of oncology drug development, who is to become chief medical officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) in a move announced on Wednesday.Novartis is being watched for how successfully it can roll out Zolgensma as well as several other new medicines including Mayzent in a crowded multiple sclerosis field.Tschudin, a Swiss citizen who speaks six languages, joined Novartis in 2017 after working at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) where she ran its Hematology-Oncology business for Europe, Middle East and Africa.Answering to Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, Tschudin's brief will be continuing the Swiss drugmakers' push into cell and gene therapy for rare diseases, while also building out a diverse portfolio of medicines for heart disease, immunology, liver disease, neuroscience and respiratory ailments.""Marie-France has a strong record of accomplishments in driving commercial excellence and a culture of inclusiveness and integrity,"" Narasimhan said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

9,"Jun 07, 2019 03:20AM ET",StockBeat: Markets Rise as Miserable German Data Boost QE Hopes,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened higher on Friday after data showing that German economic weakness continued into the second quarter encouraged speculation that the European Central Bank may have to follow through on its hints of resuming its bond-buying program to keep the economy on track.Germany’s statistics office Destatis said exports fell by 3.7% on the month in April, while industrial production fell 1.9% - the most in over two years - and manufacturing output fell 2.5%.At 03:20 AM ET (0720 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 2.1 points, or 0.6% at a two-week high of 376.12.“This is a horrible start to the second quarter for German industry, as global trade tensions as well as temporary problems in the automotive sector and chemical industry have left their marks,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING in Frankfurt.Separately, the Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, slashed its growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% from 1.6%.Germany’s automakers, in particular, are bracing for further trouble ahead as the U.S. prepares to levy its first import tariffs on Mexico over its perceived unwillingness to stop illegal immigration into the U.S. All of the big three names have either assembly plants on Mexico, or vital suppliers to their factories in the U.S.U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said overnight that the U.S. still intends to impose a tariff of 5% on Mexican goods on Monday, despite an offer from Mexico to assign 6,000 police to the issue. The proposed tariffs, which have taken some 3% off the peso in little more than a week, also have negative implications for Spain’s largest banks,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), which have large operations there.Elsewhere, French pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 3.8% on news that it has chosen Novartis’ Paul Hudson to replace Olivier Brandicourt. Hudson has been CEO of  Novartis  '(SIX:NOVN) pharmaceuticals unit since 2016. That helped the CAC 40 to outperform with a 0.9% rise, while Germany’s Dax and the U.K. FTSE both gained 0.6%."

He is known as a solid manager and has an expertise in digital relating to pharmaceuticals,"" the source said.A spokeswoman with Sanofi had no comment. Officials at Novartis AG could not be reached for comment.Reuters had reported on March 18 Sanofi was working to find a successor to Brandicourt.Hudson, born in 1967 according to Novartis' website, has been CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals unit since 2016. He is a member of Novartis' executive committee. According to his corporate biography, Hudson joined Novartis from AstraZeneca Plc where he held several senior positions in Japan and the United States.Back in March, sources had told Reuters talks over the future of Sanofi's management were intensifying. The group has an age limit of 65 for its CEO and Brandicourt will be 65 in February 2021.Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help revive the fortunes of France's biggest drugmaker and has been actively reshaping the business since.Under his tenure, the company swapped its animal health unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm’s consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. It has also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.14 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost cutting and new priorities setting in research and development have also enabled Sanofi to return to profits in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters due to falling diabetes sales. Brandicourt's teams, however, failed to land two strategic acquisitions, losing out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and failing to snatch up Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017. But Sanofi regained some momentum last year with the purchase of Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. That followed the acquisition of U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years.Brandicourt said he hoped the two transactions will help Sanofi build a strong franchise in rare blood disorders.In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.Sanofi has made rare diseases a top priority since it bought Massachusetts biotech firm Genzyme in 2011.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"May 07, 2019 01:52PM ET","StockBeat: Mylan Slumps on Revenue Miss, Strategic Review No Show",nan,"Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) slumped on Tuesday after delivering mixed quarterly results and failing to provide an update on its long-running strategic review.Mylan reported first-quarter earnings of $0.82 a share, beating estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $0.79, but revenue of $2.5 billion missed estimates of $2.7 billion, sending the shares down more than 18%. Because of the stock price slump, Mylan shares are now down nearly 16% for the year and are off 46% from their 52-week high.The company also revealed that attorneys general from several states intend to file a complaint against the drug maker alleging anticompetitive practices concerning some of its generic drugs.But it's not the first time Mylan has ended up on the wrong side of antitrust laws.The drugmaker is facing a class-action suit over its EpiPen allergy treatment as plaintiffs claim the rebate program ""blocked Sanofi (PA:SASY) from accessing a significant portion of the market for epinephrine autoinjectors,"" U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken ruled late last year.There was more drama to come as the company, during the post-earnings call, said that conclusions from its strategic view should be available in the ""near-term,"" after previously announcing last quarter that the review was in the final stages.That seemingly has sparked speculation among investors that the company is still undecided on the best way forward amid falling sales of generic drugs in North America and slowing sales of its EpiPen.Analysts have touted three possible options available to drug maker, including a classic restructuring, a leverage buyout or an acquisition or merger.Sales in North America fell 6% to $922.9 million in the first-quarter ""primarily driven by changes in the competitive environment and the impact of the Morgantown plant remediation activities,"" Mylan said.Yet, there are some on Wall Street who continue to back the drug maker.""While Q1 sales growth was well below our expectation, we still think 2019 revenue can increase about 5% vs. 2018 on strong ramps of generic Advair, biosimilar Neulasta and several other new launches in 2H 2019,"" said CFRA, the independent research provider.""We continue to think shares are an attractive value with the low end of 2019 (free cash flow) guidance representing a 16% yield on current market cap, and FCF growth expected over the long-term.""Mylan reaffirmed a full-year adjusted free cash flow range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion."
16,"May 02, 2019 09:41AM ET","Half-time: Europe Inc scores to avert first-quarter disaster, hopes of a rebound rise",nan,"By Helen Reid and Thyagaraju AdinarayanLONDON (Reuters) - European investors breathed a sigh of relief as more than half the region's major companies reported first-quarter earnings above market expectations, even if the bar was set very low ahead of results season, underscoring hopes the worst is behind Europe Inc.As the mid-way mark of the Q1 reporting season approaches, companies' stronger performance and the diminishing mentions of risks related to China and a global trade war are encouraging signs.Make no mistake: European earnings overall are still predicted to shrink by 4.2 percent from a year ago, the worst showing since the third quarter of 2016.But numbers for the pan-European STOXX 600 companies have been better than feared: some 58 percent of them beat expectations, compared to a long-term average of 50 percent and tracking its best quarter in two years, Refinitiv data showed.Industrials, a sector very closely geared to European and global economic growth, have been a success with earnings delivering a 5 percent surprise.The sector is also one of the furthest along in reporting with more than 40 percent of companies' results through.The data also showed Swedish truck maker Volvo, engineering group Alfa Laval and Airbus topped the charts in terms of positive surprises, while Lufthansa had the biggest negative surprise.That spells a much stronger performance than dire manufacturing data would suggest. Euro zone factory activity contracted for a third month in April.Technology and healthcare also contributed to a higher number of beats in the March quarter, although only about a dozen companies from each of those sectors have reported so far.SAP, Europe's biggest tech company, reported robust results and raised its outlook, helping the shares soar 12.5 percent.A stellar sales increase at Sanofi (PA:SASY)'s rare diseases Genzyme unit boosted the French drug maker's shares.With ""short European equities"" cited as the most crowded trade globally for two consecutive months in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey, it's clear many investors think negativity on the region may be close to a peak.""Consensus suggests the region is significantly challenged, but it has performed better than many realize,"" said Graham Secker, head of European equity strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Europe's STOXX 600 has outperformed even the main emerging markets benchmark year-to-date.https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wh07sNGraphic: US versus Europe earnings growth May 2 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WlTx4CMANAGING EXPECTATIONSBut this may not be reason enough to rejoice just yet.It is a reflection, partly, of companies in Europe becoming more savvy with their guidance and managing expectations ahead of results.Investors have thus been cautious about extrapolating this to a stronger underlying economy. There has however been a marked shift in the pressure points for companies.China was mentioned as a positive driver much more than a negative, according to BAML strategists, a sign massive stimulus in the world's second biggest economy may have had an impact.Luxury group LVMH said demand had picked up in mainland China, boosting its first-quarter sales and driving its shares up nearly 5 percent to a record high.Britain's pending exit from the European Union and the U.S.-China trade war were also blamed less often for poor performance.Another area of improvement has been the frequency of cuts to profit forecasts: so far this quarter has seen the fewest profit warnings at the start of earnings season in a year.""The number of profit warnings (so far) is well below that of the past earnings seasons, which should be seen as a positive development,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at Tradition.Graphic: Europe heads for strongest quarter in 2 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WpW51HDELAYED GRATIFICATIONCompanies across sectors have guided investors to a stronger second half.Earnings growth expectations, having already fallen significantly, should stabilize at this level, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).""The bulk of the EPS downgrades is behind us and (we) expect earnings momentum to improve as we move into H2,"" he said.After a blistering start to the year for global stocks, investors are finding it hard to make head or tail of a rally that caught many by surprise as they recovered from a harsh sell-off late last year.Mixed economic signals do not help paint a clearer picture.Stronger earnings from industrial companies fly in the face of data points like euro zone industry sentiment, which fell for a fifth consecutive month in March and was well below market expectations.But better reports from the companies most sensitive to growth could be an early sign of a pick-up in activity.""The recession might have been priced out but the recovery has not yet been priced in,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.Still, Milligan stopped short of outright positivity on Europe, saying the possibility of an escalation in a trade dispute with the United States is part of his decision to stick with a neutral position in his global portfolio.Politics aside, the holy grail for investors in Europe remains economic improvement - and that could still be a while away.""Is Europe going to be a top pick? Only if we start to see some very definite signs that the European economy is turning and turning up very sizeably. We're just not seeing that,"" added Milligan.Graphic: EUROPE EARNINGS GROWTH ESTIMATES MAY 2 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DUbfoH"
17,"Apr 29, 2019 12:40PM ET",European shares end higher as Spanish stocks recover poise,nan,"By Susan Mathew and Agamoni Ghosh(Reuters) - European shares closed marginally higher on Monday led by gains for  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), as investors chose to focus on the positives of a weekend win for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's ruling socialists in Spain's third election in four years.The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.08 percent stronger, with most regional indices ending in positive territory.Spain's IBEX, down nearly 1 percent earlier in the session, finished up 0.12 percent as losses for utilities were outweighed by the rally in the shares of the country's major lenders.Sanchez's pro-European PSOE won Sunday's election, but was short of a parliamentary majority, meaning it will need the help of regional parties, or the centre-right, to form a coalition government. ""It looks like we are going to be able to continue with a government under PSOE,"" said Bert Colijn, a euro zone-focused senior economist at ING. ""I would say it's quite a positive story. I think that in general being pro-European is good for reform and policy and his being pro-euro zone would help markets.""  Jitters around the result of the poll, added to weak euro zone economic sentiment data, had pushed markets lower in morning trade in Europe. But the gains for Santander, leading banks across Europe higher, along with a dip in Spanish bond market yields, pointed to a more positive take on the events from investors.Europe's banking sector index rose almost 1 percent, with HSBC,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) all among the top ten boosts to the broader STOXX 600 index.French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) also rose 1.7 percent after positive U.S. and European regulator decisions on cholesterol and diabetes drugs co-developed by the company.Airbus gained 0.95 percent as Middle East carrier Flydubai's chairman said the airline could order Airbus A320neos as replacements for Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets.A fall in German drug-maker Bayer (DE:BAYGN), as well as oil majors tracking a decline in crude prices, kept gains in check.Bayer shares, which were trading ex-dividend, fell as a majority of shareholders rejected the management's actions on Friday, fuelling market talk the company could become a takeover target.About 30 billion euros have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which the company finished taking over last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. Market participants will watch out for a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Chinese factory data this week for further clues on policy direction in the world's largest economies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Banks-heavy Italian and Spanish indices were laggards.The banking index fell for a fourth day, at the end of a heavy earnings week for lenders. Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) tumbled after posting lower first quarter profit, hurt by intensifying competition and Brexit uncertainty, while its investment bank also registered poor returns.Weakness in investment banking also dented Deutsche Bank's quarterly trading revenue and sent its shares lower a day after the German bank abandoned merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).""The current interest rate environment makes it challenging for banks to make proper earnings because of their intermediary function,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist eurozone, at Rabobank.Since the start of April, all country indexes were on pace to rise between 1.8 percent and 3.4 percent, their fourth month of gains, while Germany was strongly outperforming with 6 percent growth.""For now the current sentiment is very cautious as markets wait for the first estimates of the U.S. GDP growth which could see a surprise,"" Mevissen said.U.S. economic data for the first-quarter is due at 1230 GMT. Growth worries outside the United States resurfaced this week after South Korea's economy unexpectedly contracted at the start of the year and weak German business sentiment data for April also disappointed.Among the biggest drags on the benchmark index in Europe were the basic resources sector and the oil and gas sector, weighed down by Britain's Glencore and France's Total, respectively.Glencore dropped after reports that U.S authorities were investigating whether the company and its subsidiaries violated certain provisions of the commodity exchange act.Energy major Total said its net profit for the first three months of the year fell compared with a year ago due to volatile oil prices and debt costs.Chip stocks in the region including Siltronic, Ams and STMicroelectronics lost more than 1 percent after  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) reduced its full-year revenue forecast, adding to concerns that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019.Meanwhile, healthcare, which is also seen as a defensive sector, was a bright spot. It was helped by French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) after it returned to growth with higher profits and revenues for the first-quarter.Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES led media stocks higher after it maintained its full-year outlook on the back of the company's Networks division.Automakers in the region rose 0.4 percent, led by Valeo's 6 percent jump as the French parts maker said its performance would improve in the second half of the year.  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) advanced after it backed its outlook for the year despite reporting a fall in first-quarter earnings. Renault  (PA:RENA) rose more than 3 percent as it clung to full-year targets and pursues merger talks with its Japanese partner Nissan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

23,"Apr 04, 2019 10:52AM ET","U.S., China key to GSK's consumer venture with Pfizer",nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - The United States and China will be key focuses for the consumer healthcare venture being formed by GlaxoSmithKline and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), as the companies look to build on strong existing positions in those markets. GSK and Pfizer are on track to create the world's biggest consumer health business - with brands from Advil painkillers to Chapstick lip balm - by the second half of 2019, Brian McNamara, CEO of GSK Consumer Healthcare, told Reuters on Thursday. The venture, to be 68 percent owned by GSK, will become a stand-alone company within three years of closing the deal, and McNamara will lead it.""The U.S. and China are really two of the key value drivers of the deal because it's where Pfizer has critical mass and a significant amount of their key brands,"" he said in an interview, noting the new entity will be the No.1 player in the United States and No.2 in China. ""U.S. and China are must-win markets.""The consumer health sector, which spans vitamins, non-prescription medicines and other drug store purchases, is buoyed by ageing populations, a growing interest in health, wellness and self-care, and growing middle classes. It has slowed at times in recent years, due to emerging market fluctuations or weak flu seasons. The new, yet-to-be-named company will have annual sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.9 billion) and more than 7 percent of the global consumer health market, with brands also including Centrum vitamins and Sensodyne toothpaste. That puts it ahead of rivals Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY).Pfizer's Centrum is already the leading multivitamin in China, while Caltrate is the No.2 calcium supplement in what is one of the world's most calcium-deficient populations, McNamara said. He said vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) would be a major focus, alongside oral care and over-the-counter pain medicine, and respiratory treatments like cold and flu tablets. ""It gives us the presence globally but it really strengthens our China position,"" he said about VMS.GSK has said it is aiming to make divestments worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in 2019/2020, but McNamara declined to comment on them. GSK in December announced plans to separate into two companies - one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products - after agreeing the deal with the consumer health business that Pfizer tried, and failed, to sell previously.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

26,"Mar 18, 2019 12:35PM ET",Exclusive: Sanofi says working on CEO succession plan,nan,"By Matthias BlamontPARIS (Reuters) - Pharmaceuticals group Sanofi (PA:SASY) is working on a plan to find a new CEO in agreement and consultation with current chief executive Olivier Brandicourt, a spokesman for the French drugmaker told Reuters on Monday.Sanofi has an age limit of 65 for its CEO. Brandicourt will be 65 in February 2021.""It is the responsibility of any company's board of directors to consider and plan for the succession of its CEO and executive committee members by identifying the next set of future leaders,"" a spokesman told Reuters.""With this perspective, the board has been considering this succession plan for some time now, in agreement and consultation with our CEO,"" he said, without elaborating on a specific time frame.Sources told Reuters talks over the future of the group's management had intensified in recent weeks.Sanofi is to hold an annual meeting next month during which shareholders will be asked to vote to renew the mandate of the board's chairman, Serge Weinberg. Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help revive the fortunes of France's biggest drugmaker and has been actively reshaping the business. He was previously the head of Bayer's healthcare arm.Under his management, the company swapped its animal health unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm’s consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. It has also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.15 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost cutting and new priorities setting in research and development have also enabled Sanofi to return to profits in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters due to falling diabetes sales.Brandicourt's teams failed to land two strategic acquisitions, loosing out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and failing to snatch up Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017.But the company regained momentum last year with the purchase of Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. That followed the acquisition of U.S. group Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years.Brandicourt hopes the two transactions will help Sanofi build a strong franchise in rare blood disorders.Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.Sanofi has made rare diseases a top priority since it bought Massachusetts biotech firm Genzyme in 2011.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

29,"Mar 01, 2019 07:35AM ET","Philippines to charge officials of Sanofi, gov't over deaths linked to vaccine",nan,"By Karen LemaMANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine Department of Justice said on Friday it has found probable cause to indict officials from French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and former and current Philippine health officials over 10 deaths it said were linked to use of a dengue vaccine.It recommended charges be filed in court for multiple counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, due to what it said were procedural lapses and irregularities in implementing a Philippine dengue immunization program using Sanofi's Dengvaxia.It recommended that six Sanofi officials, mostly country representatives of the firm, and 14 current and former Philippine health officials be charged, including former Health Minister Janette Garin. Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective. The drugmaker on Friday rejected the justice department's recommendations.""We strongly disagree with the findings made against Sanofi and some of its employees and we will vigorously defend them,"" a spokesman said, adding it was not appropriate to comment further as proceedings were ongoing.The justice department statement did not say Dengvaxia had caused the deaths, but it quoted excerpts from a resolution by prosecutors that said the 20 individuals had exhibited an ""inexcusable lack of precaution and foresight"".It said the government registered and bought Dengvaxia for its immunization program with undue haste.Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease that kills about 20,000 people a year and infects hundreds of millions.The Philippines started rolling out the vaccination program in 2016 in a bid to dramatically reduce as many as 200,000 domestic dengue cases a year. It spent 3.5 billion pesos ($67.7 million) on the program during which it immunized 800,000 children with Dengvaxia. But that drive came under heavy scrutiny the following year, with critics and some lawmakers voicing suspicion about the speed at which the government sought to register, procure and distribute Dengvaxia among schools and clinics.SAFETY CONCERNSThat suspicion was compounded by concerns about the safety of the vaccine after Sanofi in late 2017 said Dengvaxia could increase the risk of severe dengue in children who had never been exposed to the virus.A criminal investigation and two congressional inquiries have taken place, and the Philippines last month permanently halted the sale, distribution and marketing of Dengvaxia, after concluding Sanofi had failed to meet directives issued by regulators. Justice undersecretary Markk Perete told Reuters that there were 35 deaths under investigation, 10 of which were the basis for the charges announced on Friday.Perete said the 20 individuals faced up to six years in prison for each of the alleged offences. All but two officials could be charged with eight counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, he said.A Sanofi source with knowledge of the situation said the Philippine prosecutors' criticism was vague and they were more interested in the processes in which the product was approved.Separate to the case announced on Friday, the Philippines has tasked a panel of medical experts to investigate the deaths of scores of children who received the vaccine, to establish whether or not Dengvaxia was a contributing factor.The panel's head, Juliet Aguilar, told Reuters that medical records of 119 victims were being looked into as of Friday.The 20 officials named by the justice department on Friday had shown neglect in having ""totally disregarded the identified risks and adverse effects of the vaccine"", the resolution said.The department said those risks ""materialized with the death of the victims"".It also said Sanofi had failed to closely monitor the recipients of Dengvaxia, nor did it extend medical assistance to victims or their families, even after reports of ""serious adverse reactions"" surfaced.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

30,"Feb 26, 2019 02:10PM ET",U.S. senators tell drug company executives pricing is 'morally repugnant',nan,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Michael ErmanWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. senators called drug pricing practices ""morally repugnant"" and told drug company executives they do not want to hear them blame others for the high prices, taking an aggressive stance at a Senate hearing on the rising costs of prescription medicines. Senators took aim in particular at Abbvie Inc Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez and his company's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira - the world's top-selling prescription medicine.Executives from AstraZeneca PLC, Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co also answered questions from members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.The executives pointed to their companies' records of developing lifesaving medications, saying profits generated in the lucrative U.S. market help them fund expensive research and development of future treatments. ""American research-based companies are leading the next wave of biomedical innovation to help patients whose diseases cannot be adequately treated with today's medicines. We should work to ensure policies that support and reward these investments,"" said Bristol-Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio.The executives also voiced support for plans to reform the industry-wide system of rebates that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers receive from drugmakers in exchange for preferential coverage of their medicines. In his opening statement, Senator Ron Wyden, the Finance Committee's top Democrat, tore into each company one-by-one for ""profiteering and two-faced scheming.""""Drugmakers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the customers they value above all else,"" Wyden said. Senators from both parties targeted AbbVie's Gonzalez, with Wyden noting that the CEO's bonus was partially tied to Humira sales, which reached nearly $20 billion globally last year. Republican Senator John Cornyn criticized the company's web of more than 130 patents that protects Humira's exclusivity.The drug has a list price of more than $60,000 a year, nearly double what it was in 2014, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines. ""I support drug companies recovering a profit based on their research and development and development of innovative drugs. But at some point, that patent has to end, that exclusivity has to end, to be able to get it at a much cheaper cost,"" said Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican from Texas.Cornyn suggested that the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee should examine the U.S. patent system under which drug companies protect the exclusivity of their medicines.Congress has already held several hearings on rising prescription drug prices in both the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led Senate, but Tuesday's hearing is the first time drug company executives, most of them CEOs, will face lawmakers in more than two years.U.S. President Donald Trump has said drugmakers are ""getting away with murder,"" and his administration has made bringing down prescription medicine costs for U.S. consumers a top priority.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year rolled out a plan to lower drug prices and has introduced several modest proposals to curb medicine costs, but Democrats have said the Trump administration is not doing enough.HHS has proposed a rule to eliminate rebates for drugs paid for by Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance programs.Several drugmakers temporarily froze price increases last year after criticism from Trump, but they raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs at the start of this year, albeit at lower levels than in years past.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I don’t think any actual policy is going to be implemented, but I think the rhetoric is going to be an overhang.""Chief executives and other top officials are expected at Tuesday's hearing from  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), AstraZeneca Plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck & Co Inc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA.""We expect the hearing to be negative for the group, and continue to believe investors are under-pricing the risks,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst David Maris said in a research note.Kevin Gade, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor focusing on pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, said he expects the executives to point the finger for high drug prices elsewhere in the drug-supply chain, such as at pharmacy benefit managers or insurance companies.""I don’t think pharma is going to be able to win them over,"" Gade said, adding that ""you can only hope...that anything disastrous is avoided.""So far this year, the S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 7 percent against a nearly 12 percent gain for the overall S&P 500, which is the benchmark index for large U.S. companies. S&P 500 pharmaceutical companies are up only 4 percent with S&P 500 biotech companies overall up 4.8 percent.Investors said healthcare has underwhelmed this year largely because it was the best-performing major S&P 500 sector last year, as investors sought healthcare as a relative safe-haven when the market became more volatile at the end of 2018.(GRAPHIC: U.S. health stocks lag in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2BU892P)But they added that the political concerns also could be weighing on the group.Although Republicans control the Senate committee running Tuesday's hearing, drug pricing and the cost to U.S. consumers is expected to get a fresh spotlight with Democrats having taken control of the House of Representatives in January.Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, last week recommended that investors underweight healthcare stocks in part because the companies ""are in the sights of both Democrat and Republican lawmakers, an important point as the 2020 presidential campaign cycle gets under way.""""They are an easy target because the electorate really dislikes the American healthcare system,"" Colas said in a note.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

34,"Feb 11, 2019 07:52AM ET",Sanofi and Regeneron cut list price of cholesterol drug by 60 percent,nan,"By Michael ErmanNEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) said on Monday that they will slash the U.S. list price of their potent but expensive cholesterol fighter Praluent by 60 percent, as the drugmakers follow a similar move by rival  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) in hopes of increasing use of the drug.The new list price for Praluent will be $5,850 a year, matching the price Amgen set when it lowered the list of its competing drug, Repatha, in October.Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers.Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year.In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients.A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), now part of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), to make the drug available to that company's customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year.The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.Executives from at least six drugmakers plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

38,"Feb 04, 2019 05:49PM ET","Senator Sanders asks why drug, once free, now costs $375k",nan,"By Yasmeen AbutalebWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders sent a letter to  Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  (O:CPRX) on Monday asking it to justify its decision to charge $375,000 annually for a medication that for years has been available to patients for free. The drug, Firdapse, is used to treat Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), a rare neuromuscular disorder, according to the letter, made available to Reuters by the senator's office. The disorder affects about one in 100,000 people in the United States.The government is intensifying its scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry and rising prescription drug prices, a top voter concern and a priority of President Donald Trump's administration.Both the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, controlled by Republicans, have begun holding hearings this year on the rising costs of medicines. Sanders is an independent who usually votes with Democrats.In the letter dated Feb. 4, Sanders asked Catalyst to lay out the financial and non-financial factors that led the company to set the list price at $375,000, and say how many patients would suffer or die as a result of the price and how much it was paying to purchase or produce the drug.Catalyst declined to comment on Sanders' letter.Catalyst shares fell nearly 8 percent to $2.31 For years, patients have been able to get the same drug for free from Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, a small New Jersey-based drug company, which offered it through a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) program called ""compassionate use."" The program allows patients with rare diseases and conditions access to experimental drugs outside of a clinical trial when there is no viable alternative.Florida-based Catalyst received FDA approval of Firdapse in November, along with exclusive rights to market the medication for several years. The company, which bought rights to the drug from a company called BioMarin in 2012, develops and commercializes drugs for rare diseases.BioMarin and FDA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In December, Catalyst announced it would price Firdapse at $375,000 a year. ""Catalyst's decision to set the annual list price at $375,000 is not only a blatant fleecing of American taxpayers, but is also an immoral exploitation of patients who need this medication,"" Sanders wrote in his letter.Sanders joins other U.S. lawmakers in investigating the pricing practices of pharmaceutical companies this year. Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, in January wrote to 12 pharmaceutical firms asking for detailed information on how they set drug prices. Democratic Representatives Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette wrote to the heads of Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY),  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), the long-time leading manufacturers of insulin, requesting information on why the drug's price has skyrocketed in recent years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Democratic Representatives Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, the chairman and a top-ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, respectively, wrote to the heads of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co,  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), the long-time leading manufacturers of insulin. The drugmakers have all raised the price of insulin at similar rates over the last several years. ""Despite the fact that it has been available for decades, prices for insulin have skyrocketed in recent years, putting it out of reach for many patients,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""As one of the few manufacturers of insulin in the United States, your company is well-suited to shed light on these issues and offer potential solutions,"" the letter to the three companies said. The committee has not set a date for a hearing, a spokesman for DeGette said. It has the power to subpoena the drugmakers if they do not answer the committee's request. The annual cost of insulin for treating a type 1 diabetes patient in the United States nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016 to $5,705 from $2,864, according to a recent study.The lawmakers' letters come amid intensifying scrutiny from Congress over the high cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers. Both the House Oversight Committee and Senate Finance Committee held hearings on prescription drug prices on Tuesday, with a focus on insulin.Sanofi confirmed receipt of the letter and said it would work with the committee on its request. Neither Novo nor Lilly immediately responded to requests for comment.High prescription drug costs have consistently polled as a top voter concern and have been a top priority of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican. U.S. prescription drug prices are far higher than in other developed nations that either directly or indirectly control medicine costs. Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings earlier this month wrote to 12 pharmaceutical companies asking for detailed information on their pricing practices, including the makers of insulin.About 1.2 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, requiring daily insulin. Type 2 diabetes, which affects nearly 30 million Americans, according to the American Diabetes Association, is treated with a variety of other medicines. But those patients may also eventually become dependent on insulin.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

42,"Jan 30, 2019 01:20AM ET","Undeterred by Sanofi's stumble, Takeda takes similar path with dengue shot",nan,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - A new vaccine for the dengue virus is taking a potentially risky road to prevent the mosquito-borne disease that infects nearly 400 million people each year.Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd plans to seek approval for the experimental vaccine first in countries where the virus is endemic, rather than starting with the United States or Europe, whose rigorous reviews are often used as a benchmark worldwide, company executives told Reuters.The strategy mirrors one used by Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, which licensed the world's first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, in endemic markets in 2015 before attempting to get approval from Western regulators, and forecast up to $1 billion in annual sales. But the drugmaker failed to hit that target. In late 2017, Sanofi disclosed that Dengvaxia could increase the risk of severe dengue in children who had never been exposed to the virus, triggering a government investigation in the Philippines where 800,000 school-age children had already been vaccinated. Fallout from Sanofi's vaccine has raised the bar for demonstrating the safety of future dengue vaccines.Takeda officials are banking on a different result, hopeful that their approach will help avoid the setbacks that Sanofi experienced. On Tuesday, Takeda said its vaccine was effective at preventing all four types of dengue, meeting the main goal of its late-stage clinical trial. The company said no significant safety concerns have emerged, raising hopes it may be the next viable vaccine for the tropical virus that kills up to 25,000 people each year.Takeda will first seek approval in each of the eight countries where its clinical trial took place: Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka.""We're still expecting to go first to dengue-endemic countries with a dossier because we think this is where the vaccine's most important use is,"" Derek Wallace, who runs Takeda's global dengue vaccine program, told Reuters.VACCINE FUTUREThe success of TAK-003 is crucial to Takeda's vaccine ambitions as the Japan-based drugmaker integrates its $59 billion purchase of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP). ""The global business was predicated on global products and a global pipeline,"" Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's vaccines business, said in a telephone interview.Under pressure to cut costs after the Shire deal, Takeda needs a strong performance from both its dengue and norovirus experimental vaccines to prove the viability of the global vaccines business. ""Once those two programs declare themselves, we’ll then map out what our future looks like,"" Takeda research chief Andy Plump said in an interview last month. Venkayya said he is encouraged by the results so far.Dengue experts have questioned whether Takeda's vaccine may pose similar risks to Dengvaxia, and the results released on Tuesday were not detailed enough to provide answers.Takeda executives said they had taken steps to ensure their vaccine did not run into the same issues.Takeda's TAK-003 is based on a dengue 2 virus, with genes from the remaining three dengue viruses added in. Dengvaxia is based on a yellow fever virus with dengue genes added in. Takeda hopes the all-dengue design will trigger a more robust immune response.Unlike Sanofi, Takeda researchers took blood samples from all 20,000 trial participants before they received the vaccine. That should allow them to see differences in the vaccine's performance in people who had a previous dengue infection versus those who had not, according to dengue experts. Takeda delayed the release of its trial results for several weeks to characterize the immune responses of all participants. The company expects some of that data will soon be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.SANOFI'S REGRETEarlier this month, Sanofi vaccines chief David Loew told FiercePharma that the company regretted launching Dengvaxia in emerging markets before it was reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency. It was the first time Sanofi had taken such an approach with a vaccine, he said.""Other regulatory authorities often look to the FDA and EMA for their own guidelines,"" Loew told Reuters via email. To share its data with endemic countries and answer questions on Dengvaxia, Sanofi took part in a three-day meeting hosted by the World Health Organization and the Dengue Vaccine Initiative in July 2015. Regulators from seven countries where dengue poses the biggest threat, including the Philippines, were there.Dengvaxia has since won European approval for people living in endemic areas who have a documented prior infection. The vaccine is also under FDA review.Dr. Joachim Hombach, senior health adviser in WHO's vaccine department, said that governments in dengue-endemic countries in Latin America and Asia are now ""highly sensitized"" to the potential risks in the wake of Dengvaxia.""We will be looking at this very carefully,"" Hombach said of Takeda's data.Takeda is undeterred. The company plans to file in the U.S. and Europe within a year of filing in dengue-endemic countries, Venkayya said. Takeda and dengue experts are already planning ways to review the latest vaccine data with those regulators.The Global Dengue & Aedes-Transmitted Diseases Consortium (GDAC), a group funded in part by drugmakers that works closely with WHO, scheduled a meeting for early March in Bangkok with regulators from at least six countries to take a first look at Takeda's results, said Dr. In-Kyu Yoon, director of GDAC. Yoon said the meeting will be paid for by the International Vaccine Institute, funded largely by charities and the Korean government. He plans to ask countries whether they want a joint regulatory review similar to the one Sanofi attended in 2015.""Right now, there is clearly some caution,"" Yoon said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

45,"Jan 14, 2019 07:00PM ET",U.S. lawmaker launches investigation into pharma drug pricing,nan,"By Yasmeen AbutalebWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. lawmaker launched an investigation into pharmaceutical industry pricing practices on Monday, less than a week after he and fellow Democrats introduced legislation aimed at lowering medicine prices. Representative Elijah Cummings, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, sent letters to 12 drugmakers seeking information on price increases, investment in research and development, and corporate strategies to preserve market share and pricing power, his office said in a statement.  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV),  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), AstraZeneca PLC,  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) PLC, Novartis AG,  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) all received letters seeking information about their pricing practices. Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Celgene, and Novartis said they were reviewing the request. The other drug companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Cummings' letters focused on drugs that are the costliest to Medicare Part D, a program that helps beneficiaries of the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled pay for self-administered medicines like those purchased at drugstores, as well as drugs that have had the largest price increases over a five-year period. They include AbbVie's Humira, the world's top-selling medicine that had a price increase at the start of the year, Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster cancer drug Imbruvica and several diabetes medications. President Donald Trump made high prescription drug prices a top issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and said that drug companies were ""getting away with murder."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year rolled out a plan to lower drug prices and has introduced several modest proposals to curb medicine costs, but Democrats have said Trump and his administration are not doing enough. Several pharmaceutical companies temporarily froze prices on select drugs last year after being criticized by Trump on Twitter. But drugmakers raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs to begin 2019.Cummings, along with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, introduced three bills last week aimed at lowering drug prices.That legislation would peg U.S. prescription drug prices to the median price from five countries - Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan - where drug costs are typically far lower because of government price controls. It would also allow Americans to import medication from Canada and other countries, as well as allow the HHS secretary to negotiate prices in Medicare Part D.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

46,"Jan 10, 2019 09:26PM ET",J&J raises U.S. prices on around two dozen drugs,nan,"By Michael ErmanNEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) raised U.S. prices on around two dozen prescription drugs on Thursday, including the psoriasis treatment Stelara, prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood thinner Xarelto, all among its top-selling products.J&J joined many other companies that raised U.S. prices on hundreds of prescription medicines earlier this month.Most of the J&J increases were between 6 percent and 7 percent, according to data from Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines.The increases came on the same day that Democratic members of Congress introduced proposed legislation aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs for American consumers.J&J said the average list price increase on its drugs will be 4.2 percent this year. However, it expects the net price it actually receives for its medicines to drop. That is because drugmakers negotiate rebates and discounts off the list price with payers in order to ensure patient access to their products.The company does not plan to raise prices on any more drugs this year, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said. Drugmakers kicked off 2019 with U.S. price increases on more than 250 prescription medicines by Jan. 2. That total has almost doubled, with pharmaceutical companies hiking prices on nearly 490 drugs by Jan. 10, according to Rx Savings.This includes insulin price hikes of between 4.4 percent and 5.2 percent by Sanofi (PA:SASY) and 4.9 percent by  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb).Sanofi said its increases were below the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services projections for medical inflation, and that it expects net prices to drop in 2019. Novo Nordisk said its raised list prices help offset increases in rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.With pressure from lawmakers and the administration of President Donald Trump intensifying, the pace of drug increases has been slower than last year, when drugmakers raised prices on around 650 drugs over the first 10 days of 2018. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed policy changes aimed at lowering drug prices and passing on more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers to patients. Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short-term, however, and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

51,"Dec 19, 2018 05:36AM ET",Drugmaker GSK to split after striking Pfizer consumer health deal,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline plans to split into two businesses -- one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products -- after forming a new joint venture with Pfizer's consumer health division.The revamp is the boldest move yet by GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year.It will lead to the creation of a consumer health giant with a market share of 7.3 percent, well ahead of its nearest rivals Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), all on around 4 percent.Walmsley has previously played down the idea of breaking up the group, something that a number of investors have called for over the years.On Wednesday, however, she announced that GSK and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 percent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction. GSK said the deal laid the foundation for the creation of two new UK-based global companies focused on pharma/vaccines and consumer healthcare within three years of the transaction closing.For Pfizer, the deal resolves the issue of what to do with its consumer health division, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, after an abortive attempt to sell it outright earlier this year.GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, had withdrawn from that earlier Pfizer auction process but Walmsley said the opportunity to strike an all-equity deal cleared the way for the new agreement.""It's something we've been able to do quickly and quietly,"" she told reporters in a conference call.""What this deal is all about is the opportunity to strengthen two businesses -- a world-leading consumer healthcare business and a new GSK that is focused on pharma and vaccines.""CRYSTALLIZING VALUEShareholders welcomed the news and the shares jumped 7 percent, with Jefferies analysts saying the future separation could crystallize value. The new joint venture with Pfizer is expected to generate total annual cost savings of 500 million pounds by 2022 for expected total cash costs of 900 million and non-cash charges of 300 million. GSK plans divestments of some 1 billion pounds.Walmsley said there would be an inevitable impact on jobs but there was also an opportunity for cost savings in procurement and across the supply chain.The Pfizer deal is expected to boost adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closing, which GSK anticipates will occur in the second half of 2019.Pfizer, which already has a long-standing HIV medicines joint venture with GSK, said the transaction would be slightly accretive in each of the first three years after it closed.The consumer tie-up follows a deal by GSK earlier this year to buy Novartis's stake in their consumer joint venture for $13 billion and comes as Walmsley tries to reshape Britain's biggest drugmaker, which has seen its shares move sideways for years.Earlier this month, she agreed to buy cancer drug specialist Tesaro for $5.1 billion to try to revitalize its pharmaceuticals business, a high-priced acquisition that was poorly received by the market.GSK has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rivals under previous CEO Andrew Witty.Seeking to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019.GSK was advised by Citi, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Greenhill, while Centerview, Guggenheim and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) acted for Pfizer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

54,"Dec 07, 2018 02:26PM ET",Exclusive: Activist investor Elliott has stake in Germany's Bayer - sources,nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Greg RoumeliotisFRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott has taken a position in Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn), adding to the slew of investments the fund has made in German companies, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.Elliott has held shares in Bayer for more than a year, two of the sources said, declining to specify the size of the stake. A holding of more than 3 percent would trigger mandatory disclosure under German securities trading rules. While Elliott has tried to talk to Bayer's top management it has not been able to get a meeting with Chief Executive Werner Baumann or his colleagues, one of the sources said, adding that Baumann also declined to talk to other hedge funds invested in the company.News of the Elliott stake comes in the aftermath of Bayer's $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). The German company faces thousands of lawsuits over a suspected cancer link to the U.S. company's Roundup weedkiller. Elliott, founded and run by Paul Singer, declined to comment, as did Bayer. Elliott also owns stakes in steelmaker ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG), utility Uniper (DE:UN01) and food processing machinery maker GEA Group (DE:G1AG). The presence of such activists on shareholder registers can raise pressure on company management to change strategy and improve shareholder returns. In the case of Thyssenkrupp for instance, where Swedish investor Cevian holds a larger stake, a new CEO was appointed who announced the company would be broken up into two parts.Bayer shares, which had been down 0.8 percent before the news, closed 1.7 percent higher in Frankfurt.But the stock has lost 38 percent so far this year, mainly due to risks relating to the more than 9,000 lawsuits brought over Roundup.Investors have also urged Bayer to strengthen its drug development pipeline, even though its financial firepower was depleted by the Monsanto deal.Chief Executive Werner Baumann last week unveiled plans to sell businesses, including the animal health operations and two consumer healthcare brands, and cut around 12,000 jobs, vowing to revive earnings growth.PLANNED AUCTION Bayer will kick off the planned auction of consumer brands Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone early next year, people close to the matter said.The auction of footcare brand Dr. Scholl's, on which Bayer is working with investment banking boutique Sawaya, is expected to start at the end of January, they said.The Coppertone sale, led by Citi (N:C), is likely to start towards the end of the first quarter, one of the people said.The two brands could fetch a combined 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), analysts have estimated.Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) are likely to be among potential suitors for the consumer brands, for which they vied with Bayer when the German company bought them with other assets from Merck & Co (N:MRK) in 2014, people close to the matter have said.Bayer is also selling its animal health division and Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) are working on the sale, people close to the matter said.The animal health business, which could fetch between 6 and 7 billion euros, has whetted the appetite of several private equity groups. Bayer's rivals in veterinary medicine may face antitrust issues if they tried to buy the whole business. But some of them are expected to express interest either in the part of the business which makes drugs for livestock or the part that focuses on companion animals.Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis (N:ZTS), the former  Pfizer  (N:PFE) unit, Elanco (N:ELAN), formerly of Eli Lilly (N:LLY), unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY), and drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK).Bayer's animal health business, the largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs, needs to grow to compete with larger rivals but Bayer lacks the financial firepower to sponsor big moves, sources have said.Bayer and the banks declined to comment, except for Sawaya which was not immediately available to comment.Bayer earlier this week reduced its combined sales estimate for its most promising experimental drugs, acknowledging it needs to do more to replenish the development pipeline.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In addition, 80 IT jobs are to be outsourced, he said. The group had said in September it would continue to implement cost savings after having reached a 1.5 billion euros ($1.70 billion) cost reduction target a year ahead of expectations.A Sanofi spokesman confirmed the company's intention to shed 670 jobs out of a 25,000 workforce in France and said the plan was to be completed by the end of 2020.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sales from eye drug Eylea, its second-best selling drug, are expected to suffer from competing drugs before that.Bayer said it halted trials testing its experimental uterine fibroids treatment vilaprisan, which it previously expected to generate peak annual sales of more than 1 billion euros, citing the risk of side effects.It also no longer included a peak sales estimate for anetumab ravtansine, a drug for asbestos-linked cancer type mesothelioma, previously seen generating more than 2 billion euros in annual revenues.The group's former head of pharmaceuticals, Dieter Weinand, said a year ago there was still hope for anetumab despite a setback in a Phase II trial in 2017, but Weinand quit and was replaced by Sanofi (PA:SASY) executive Stefan Oelrich last month.Bayer added to the tally an annual peak sales potential of more than 750 million euros for larotrectinib against a variety of cancers driven by a rare genetic mutation. The drug, co-developed with Loxo Oncology (O:LOXO), won U.S. market approval last week.Bayer said in presentation slides that it plans to supplement its existing pipeline with in-licensing and bolt-on takeover deals.""We need to fill our mid-term pipeline furthermore"" over the next few years, Oelrich told investors at the event, adding that the early- and late-stage pipeline was strong.Bayer also said it aimed to increase adjusted group core earnings to 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) in 2022, up from an expected 12.2 billion euros this year, but that target does not yet take into account the planned divestment of its animal health unit or the effect of currency swings.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Nov 29, 2018 11:56AM ET","Bayer to sell businesses, cut jobs after Monsanto deal",nan,"By Ludwig BurgerFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn), the German drugmaker that bought U.S. seed company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), announced on Thursday the sale of a number of businesses, around 12,000 job cuts and 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in impairments.Chief Executive Werner Baumann is under pressure to boost Bayer's share price after a drop of more than 35 percent so far this year, dragged down by concern over more than 9,000 lawsuits it faces over an alleged cancer-causing effect of Monsanto's Roundup weed killer.The group said it was looking at options - that could include a sale - for the Coppertone sunscreen and Dr. Scholl's foot care products from the consumer healthcare division it bought from Merck & Co (N:MRK) in 2014 for $14 billion.It will also divest its animal health division, the number five player in the industry, which analysts have said could fetch 6-7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).The unit, the largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs and a supplier of livestock veterinary drugs, had sales of 1.57 billion euros in 2017, accounting for about 4.5 percent of group revenues.There has already been consolidation in animal health, with  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Eli Lilly (N:LLY), successfully floating their veterinary medicine units on the stock market as independent entities. Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis (N:ZTS), the former Pfizer unit, Elanco (N:ELAN), unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY), and drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK). Bayer will also seek a buyer for its 60-percent stake in German chemical production site services provider Currenta.All three possible transactions were previously flagged by Reuters.Its shares were down 0.8 percent in late trade. Markus Mayer, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s could fetch 1 billion euros and the Currenta stake could fetch 1.5 billion euros. Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) will likely be among the suitors for the consumer brands, said investment bankers, who asked not to be named.JOB CUTSUnder a cost cutting program that will also target synergies expected from the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto, Bayer will cut around 12,000 of its 118,200 jobs worldwide.At the Consumer Health and Pharmaceuticals divisions, Bayer will take about 3.3 billion euros in impairments and write-offs the fourth quarter.Consumer Health brands acquired with the Merck & Co. and Dihon businesses will account for 2.7 billion euros of that, while about 600 million euros impairments and write-offs are due to a decision not to utilize a hemophilia drug factory in the German city of Wuppertal and to concentrate production in Berkeley, United States. The consumer healthcare unit, which sells non-prescription treatments, has faced falling revenues as U.S. consumers went from established drugstores to online shops, often switching to cheaper brands.In the first nine months of 2018, Bayer consumer health products' sales declined by 0.4 percent when excluding currency swings, following a drop of 1.7 percent in the full year of 2017.The company said it was targeting core earnings per share of 6.80 euros in 2019, up from an expected 5.70 to 5.90 euros this year, with a 2022 target of around 10 euros, when discounting the effect of currency swings and portfolio changes. The group's margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and special items over sales should increase to over 30 percent by 2022, up from 26.5 percent last year, it added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Nov 20, 2018 08:40PM ET",Trump's Sanctions Are Proving a Bitter Pill for Iran's Sick,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Leila Koochaki’s health has become collateral damage as the U.S. extends its economic offensive against Iran.The 47-year-old had to contact 15 pharmacies across Tehran before she finally secured the anti-fatigue medication she takes to cope with multiple sclerosis. “I found a small drugstore that could give me a little, just two strips of 10 tablets each,” Koochaki said. “I begged them to keep it for me until I got there.”On paper, U.S. sanctions permit Iranian purchases of humanitarian goods like medicines. To avoid accidentally triggering penalties, however, foreign drug companies and international banks are taking extra precautions even when dealing with permitted business. The new legal complications, along with panic buying and hoarding, mean some drugs are increasingly difficult to find.Making things worse, a collapse in the rial had already pushed up prices of imported medicines and active ingredients used in locally-made generics.The scarcities are forcing patients to make potentially life-altering decisions. “I might start taking halves or skipping doses so I don’t run out,” Koochaki said of the Modafinil tablets that keep her going.ToxicWhen the U.S. increased pressure on Iran on Nov. 5, it was sanctions on critical oil exports that dominated headlines. But the penalties went much further. The Treasury sanctioned more than 700 individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels, including Iran’s central bank and many of its commercial lenders. Some of those banks lost access to the Swift international payment system -- rendering them even more toxic to overseas counterparts.Why U.S.-Iran Divide Is Widening Again Under Trump: QuickTakeDoug Jacobson, a sanctions attorney at Jacobson Burton Kelley in Washington, said it’s becoming difficult to find foreign banks willing to do even permitted business with Iran.U.S. officials say they’re “not going to sanction humanitarian payments, but banks have to make a risk-based, cost-benefit decision on whether it’s worth it for them and many are taking the position that it’s not worth it,” he said.European drug companies contacted for this story said they continued to deal with Iran. A spokesperson for French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY), the only global pharmaceuticals firm with a production plant in the Islamic Republic, said sanctions changes didn’t affect its ability to sell medicines there. Roche said in a statement it’s “continuously assessing” the effect of penalties and remains committed to serving Iranians.But Iran won’t be able to import drugs at pre-sanctions levels if it can’t pay for them.Can’t PayUntil recently, four private banks facilitated nearly all of Iran’s humanitarian trade: Parsian Bank, Middle East Bank, Saman Bank and Pasargad Bank.All four are now targeted with primary U.S. sanctions that bar American firms and citizens from doing business with them. Parsian also faces secondary penalties which pressure foreign companies to comply by threatening to sever access to the U.S. financial system.In a recent tweet, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif attached two letters he said were sent by European drug suppliers to Iranian importers terminating trade due to sanctions. Attempts to confirm the contents of the letters weren’t successful.Iran’s Medical Council also appealed to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres to take action. U.S. sanctions had “seriously affected our ability to access drugs, healthcare services, treatments and necessary medical care,” the council said, according to a copy of the letter published on its website.Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran policy, told reporters after the latest measures were announced that the U.S. has never targeted medicine or medical devices. The ""regime’s attempts to mis-characterize these humanitarian exemptions are a pathetic effort to distract from its own corruption and mismanagement.""Quality ConcernsUnder President Donald Trump, the U.S. has sought to curb Iran’s influence in the Middle East, withdrawing in May from the 2015 nuclear deal. European and other signatories back the accord as the best way to prevent Iran producing a nuclear weapon, and are seeking to maintain channels for trade and investment.Tale of Two Economies: IMF Tallies Up Sanctions Wreckage in IranThe main medication Koochaki takes now is an Iranian version of MS treatment Avonex, and a Health Ministry helpline assists her in finding supplies. For some illnesses, however, patients rely on foreign medication as local alternatives don’t exist or aren’t as effective.“The efficacy of Iranian medicines is inadequate,” said Maziar Mostafavi, a family physician and former emergency-ward doctor. That’s partly because difficulties obtaining active ingredients over the years led some manufacturers to lower dosages, especially with antibiotics, he said. “Failures in treatment have increased.”#SanctionsTargetMeMedicines used to treat critical or rare illnesses are most likely to be affected as the sanctions and currency crisis hit profits at local pharmaceutical companies, said Seyed Abdolreza Hejazi Farahmand, chief executive of two Tehran-based companies that produce plasma-derived hemophilia treatments.Five Tehran pharmacies surveyed said the imported anticoagulant Warfarin, used in post-operative treatments for heart conditions, is now virtually impossible to find and there’s no reliable locally-made alternative.Iran’s Health Ministry has vowed to help domestic drugmakers produce medicines equal to those sold by multinationals, and officials have cracked down on hoarding, which has exacerbated the situation.Etemaad newspaper in August reported medicines worth $300,000 had been found stashed in warehouses.

65,"Nov 14, 2018 06:59PM ET","Berkshire invests in JPMorgan, Oracle as Buffett puts cash to work",nan,"By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc deepened its commitment to the U.S. financial industry, announcing a $4.02 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and new investments in PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Companies Inc, plus a stake in  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).The investments were disclosed in a Wednesday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stocks as of Sept. 30, following a quarter when the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate spent $17.7 billion on equities.According to the filing, Berkshire owned $829 million of PNC stock, $460 million of the insurer Travelers, and $2.13 billion of Oracle, the database software company.It also added to its sizable stakes in two earlier Buffett investments, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).“While nervous investors fear the end of the economic recovery, Mr. Buffett is buying economically sensitive bank stocks,"" said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle and owns Berkshire stock. ""It makes owners like us not mind sitting through a correction with them.""Though the filing did not say which individual purchases Buffett or his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were responsible for, investors watch Berkshire's quarterly stock listings for signs about where the trio sees value.Shares of JPMorgan, PNC and Travelers each rose at least 1 percent in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure of its new stakes, while Oracle shares rose 2.4 percent.JPMorgan and Travelers declined to comment. PNC, Oracle and Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The investment in JPMorgan, where Combs is a board member, closes a notable hole in Berkshire's portfolio.Berkshire had already been the largest investor in several companies, including  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, according to Refinitiv data.Buffett has long praised the leadership of JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and over the last year partnered with him and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to create a new company aiming to cut U.S. employee healthcare costs.Atul Gawande, a surgeon and critic of medical industry practices, was named in June to lead the venture.Buffett and Dimon also teamed up in June to call on companies to stop giving quarterly earnings forecasts, because they encourage an unhealthy focus on short-term profit at the expense of sustainable long-term growth.Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.Buffett, however, has not made a major acquisition since buying aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.He often buys stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in which Berkshire previously disclosed a $57.6 billion stake, when buying whole companies appears too expensive.Berkshire also spent $928 million repurchasing its own stock in the quarter.Despite the stock purchases, Berkshire ended September with $103.6 billion of cash and equivalents.Berkshire also reported other portfolio changes, including the shedding of holdings in Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and reduction in its stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We expect to see legislative deadlock for the next two years, with an uptick in House hearings and political posturing while President Trump continues to push his agenda through executive action and the judiciary,"" Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. Humana Inc  (N:HUM) shares hit an all-time high of $354.33, while fellow health insurers UnitedHealth (N:UNH) and Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) also touched records. Another attempt to repeal or replace former President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act (ACA) could now be off the table, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Zack Sopcak.Shares of Molina Healthcare (N:MOH) and  Centene  Corp (N:CNC), which have significant Obamacare business, were up more than 8 percent. Voters in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska approved expansion of Medicaid programs for low-income people, helping shares of Medicaid-focused insurers like WellCare Health Plans (N:WCG). Collectively, the three states could add 150,000 to 200,000 new Medicaid-covered lives, said BMO analyst Matthew Borsch.The U.S. healthcare sector (SPXHC) was leading the rally on Wall Street, up 2.8 percent in midday trading.Wall Street analysts had cautioned that a Democrat sweep of both the House and Senate could have sparked a sell-off in pharma, biotech and drug supply chain stocks, while full Republican control could have hurt health insurers that rely on Obamacare business.Shares of German-based dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) and U.S. rival  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA) rose as California rejected a proposal that would have limited rates dialysis clinics can charge commercially insured patients.Shares of U.S. drugmakers  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and AbbVie (N:ABBV) were up more than 3 percent, while Merck & Co (N:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) SASY), Roche (S:ROG), AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) also rose.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York, said Republicans' solidifying their hold on the Senate makes legislation to lower drug pricing less likely.""I don't see it getting through a Republican Senate,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

67,"Nov 05, 2018 11:11AM ET","Gene study reveals secrets of parasitic worms, possible treatments",nan,"By Kate KellandLONDON (Reuters) - The largest study to date of the genetic makeup of parasitic worms has found hundreds of new clues about how they invade the human body, evade its immune system and cause disease.The results point to potential de-worming treatments to help fight some of the most neglected tropical diseases - including river blindness, schistosomiasis and hookworm disease - which affect around a billion people worldwide.""Parasitic worms are some of our oldest foes and have evolved over millions of years to be expert manipulators of the human immune system,"" said Makedonka Mitreva of Washington University's McDonnell Genome Institute, who co-led the work with colleagues from Britain's Wellcome Sanger Institute and Edinburgh University.She said the results of this study would lead to both a deeper knowledge of the biology of parasites and a better understanding of how human immune systems can be harnessed or controlled.Parasitic worm infections can last many years and can cause severe pain, physical disabilities, retarded development in children and social stigma linked to deformity. Current medicines to combat them - including drugs made by Sanofi (PA:SASY), GSK and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - can be moderately effective and are often donated by drugmakers or sold at cut-down prices to those who need them. But the spectrum of drugs to treat worm infections is still limited.To try to improve the potential drug pipeline and to understand how worms invade and take up residence inside humans and other animals, the research team compared the genomes of 81 species of roundworms and flatworms, including 45 that had never previously had their genomes sequenced. The analysis found almost a million new genes that had not been seen before, belonging to thousands of new gene families, and identified many new potential drug targets and drugs. ""We focussed our search by looking at existing drugs for human illnesses,"" said the Sanger Institute's Avril Coghlan, who worked on the team. She said this offered a possible fast-track route ""to pinpointing existing drugs that could be repurposed for deworming"".The study's findings were published in the journal Nature Genetics on Monday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The euro zone stocks index (STOXXE) remained on course for its worst month since August 2015.Analysts and investors said month-end repositioning was part of the reason for the strong bounce on Wednesday. ""Ultimately I'm still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.

Finnish tire maker Nokian (HE:NRE1V) sank 13.3 percent after it cut its profit outlook, blaming unfavorable currency moves, high inventory levels in Russia, and lower new car sales in the Nordics for a surprise fall in quarterly earnings.Nokian was the latest in the autos sector to report weaker profits due to slowing car sales.Eutelsat (PA:ETL) shares dived 10.6 percent after the satellite firm cut its revenue guidance.Drugmaker  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  (ST:SOBIV) dropped 13.6 percent after it cut its full-year outlook due to development costs, even though it lifted its sales forecast after a strong performance by haemophilia drug Elocta.M&A also drove some big moves. Shares in British gambling firm  William Hill  (L:WMH) jumped 8.3 percent after it offered to buy Swedish gaming company Mr Green (ST:MRG) for 2.82 billion crowns ($307 million).Shares in the acquisition target surged 47 percent in early deals after the offer, a near 49 percent premium to Mr Green's last closing price.Investors were licking their wounds after a testing October for global stock markets which saw U.S. stocks sell off sharply, joining in the already bearish trend of other developed markets.

70,"Oct 31, 2018 05:37AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Wednesday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, October 31:1. Dow Set for Triple-Digit Gains in Final Day of Grim OctoberU.S. stock index futures pointed to a positive conclusion to what has been a brutal October for shares, with the Dow set for triple-digit gains, ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data.At 5:35AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 125 points, or about 0.5%, the S&P 500 futures rose 16 points, or around 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 71 points, or roughly 1%.U.S. stocks closed higher in the previous session, as markets pared some of the month's losses before the end of a brutal October for equity markets.After Tuesday's comeback, the Dow is down 5.9% this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&P 500 is off by 7.9% in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. The Nasdaq has shed 11% and is on pace for its worst monthly performance since September 2008.Elsewhere, in Europe, the region's major bourses staged a strong rally, as strong results from L’Oreal (PA:OREP), Sanofi (PA:SASY), and banks  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and Santander (MC:SAN) eased investors' nerves.Earlier, Asian stocks clawed up from 20-month lows, as a tumultuous October drew to a close.The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.3% as weaker-than-expected factory activity data reinforced views that Beijing will roll out more support measures for the economy.In Japan, the Nikkei advanced 2%, reassured by the Bank of Japan's signal that it will keep its ultra-easy policy for some time to come.2. GM Highlights Another Busy Day of EarningsIn earnings, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Sprint (NYSE:S), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC), and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) are among the major companies due to publish their latest quarterly figures before the opening bell.AIG (NYSE:AIG), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) and  Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure  (NYSE:SOI) are among the major companies set to report earnings results after Wednesday's market close.3. Facebook Results Calm NervesFacebook relieved investors by forecasting that margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease up, sending shares higher in pre-market trade despite a second-straight quarter with record-low user growth.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg repeated the company's warning that growing user interest in private messaging, video and safer content would cause costs to rise faster than revenue for “some time.”Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) traded up about 4% ahead of the opening bell. They reversed course several times in volatile after-hours trade on Tuesday after the social media giant released a mixed third-quarter earnings report.The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share, beating estimates for $1.47 per share. Facebook missed expectations on revenue, however, reporting $13.73 billion compared to the $13.78 billion estimated by analysts.4. ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Payrolls DataOn the data front, the market’s attention will shift to the U.S. labor market with the ADP’s report on private payroll growth, which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government nonfarm payrolls report.Economists expect the ADP report, due at 8:15AM ET, to show that private payroll growth totaled 189,000 during October.Elsewhere on the economic calendar on Wednesday, investors are likely to keep an eye out for third-quarter employment cost index data at 8:30AM ET, as well as Chicago PMI data for October at 9:45AM ET.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was at 96.75, having hit an overnight peak of 96.85, the most since August 15.5. EIA's Weekly Oil Supply ReportIn commodity markets, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended October 26 at 10:30AM ET.Analysts expect the EIA to report a climb of around 4.1 million barrels in crude supplies. If confirmed, it would be the sixth straight weekly climb in domestic oil inventories.After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude supplies rose by 5.7 million barrels last week.Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days, drawing support from upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are due to come into force from next week.U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures were up 52 cents, or 0.8%, at $66.70 a barrel. They dropped 1.3% the day before, after hitting their lowest since Aug. 17 at $65.33 a barrel.International Brent crude oil futures tacked on 74 cents, or 0.9%, to $76.69 per barrel.

73,"Oct 17, 2018 07:20AM ET","Exclusive: Express Scripts covers Amgen, Lilly migraine therapies, excludes Teva drug",nan,"By Deena BeasleyLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), one of the largest U.S. prescription benefits managers, will cover new migraine drugs from Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), but is excluding a rival medication made by Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) after price negotiations with all three manufacturers. The decision represents a setback for Teva, which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring and had hoped to capture a sizable stake of the multibillion-dollar migraine market. Express Scripts is also taking steps to limit use to the patients it says are most likely to benefit from the new Amgen and Lilly migraine drugs. Pharmacy benefits managers like Express Scripts are taking more aggressive action to lower the cost of prescription drugs for their clients, large employers who pay for health benefits for their workers. The new migraine drugs were approved for the U.S. market within a few months of each other this year. That gave Express Scripts more leverage in demanding a discount in exchange for putting a therapy on its “formulary,” or list of covered drugs. ""These products are fairly interchangeable,"" Harold Carter, clinical solutions director at Express Scripts, told Reuters. ""It comes down to manufacturers providing the best value to be on the formulary."" He acknowledged that price rebates played a role in determining coverage status, but declined to comment on the level of rebating.In May, Amgen and marketing partner  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) won U.S. regulatory approval for Aimovig, an injected drug designed to interfere with a process that helps kick off migraine headaches. Teva's Ajovy and Lilly's Emgality were approved last month. The three drugs work in a similar manner and represent an improvement over existing treatments: in clinical trials they significantly reduced migraine frequency in about half of patients.Wei-Li Shao, vice president of neuroscience at Eli Lilly, told Reuters last month that discounts and rebates for the migraine drug would be negotiated with insurers and other payers. Brendan O’Grady, head of Teva's North America commercial operations, declined to comment on talks with payers, while executives at Amgen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.All three drugs have a list price of $575 a month, or $6,900 a year. Geoffrey Porges, biotech analyst at Wall Street investment bank Leerink Partners, told Reuters he expects the drugmakers will need to offer rebates of at least 30 percent for the new migraine class to be covered by insurance. Express Scripts already lists Amgen's Aimovig as a preferred treatment on its largest formulary, but requires that patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine. Lilly's Emgality will be covered under the same terms. Amgen and Lilly will also begin next April to refund part of the drug cost if a migraine patient stops treatment within 90 days, indicating that the medication does not work for them or causes too many side effects. That refund, between 25 and 30 percent of the drugs' list price, would be returned to clients of Express Scripts, and comes in addition to the rebates the pharmacy benefit manager has already negotiated.39 MILLION MIGRAINE SUFFERERS ""Everyone in the chain is taking some accountability for the cost of the drug,"" Carter said, adding that the refund means the manufacturers are sharing financial risk if the drugs do not work as well as claimed. Around 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Worldwide migraine drug sales could reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to analytics firm GlobalData. But Carter estimated that only about 128,000 of the 83 million people who get their prescription drug benefits through Express Scripts will be good candidates for the migraine-prevention drugs. Under the Migraine Care Value program that will launch next April, Express Scripts will have its specially trained pharmacists, nurses and other staff assess appropriate care and access to therapies for patients. The pharmacy benefit manager, which is being acquired by  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), created a similar program in 2015 that sharply limited the use of two novel, and expensive, cholesterol drugs - from Amgen and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY). For the new migraine drugs ""the challenges will likely be right out of the gate, seeing if patients are responding to the therapy,"" Carter said. The drugmakers have already tried to pre-empt efforts to limit access to the new migraine treatments. Amgen and Lilly are providing two months’ supply of the drug for free directly to patients. All three companies have plans to pay nearly all of an individual’s out of pocket costs under a commercial insurance plan. In addition, Amgen and Lilly have temporary programs to supply the treatments to patients who are covered by commercial insurance, but are still having trouble getting reimbursed. Some large health insurers, such as Anthem Inc (N:ANTM), have similar coverage terms for Aimovig, requiring patients to document how they suffer from a defined number of headaches each month, and show that they have tried older migraine drugs first. Others, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in states like Pennsylvania and Kansas, only cover prescriptions for the new drugs from - or in consultation with - a neurologist or headache specialist, and not a primary care doctor. Some plans have not yet determined coverage terms, meaning each prescription has to go through a lengthy review process.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

81,"Oct 03, 2018 02:10AM ET","With Hemlibra, Roche seeks to break into tight hemophilia circle",nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) is breaking into hemophilia A treatment, a $10 billion global market dominated by rivals who have cultivated close ties to sufferers of the genetic bleeding disorder.Roche's Hemlibra, on sale since late 2017 for patients with resistance to existing treatments, is widely expected to win the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's blessing for use in nearly all patients this week. The FDA declined to comment.First-half sales were just 57 million Swiss francs ($58 million).To hit $5 billion global annual sales that some analysts forecast, Hemlibra must wrest business away from hemophilia giants like  Shire  (L:SHP), Bayer (DE:BAYGn),  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Octapharma, whose ""clotting factors"" are now standard for people who lack proteins that stop bleeding.These companies have long sponsored patient groups, summer camps, even kayak trips on the Pacific Ocean, as part of efforts to build loyalty they hope will slow an exodus from their products once new drugs like Roche's arrive.Roche is convinced word of mouth in the hemophilia community, backed up by its studies showing that Hemlibra shots may be more effective and must be administered less frequently than infusions of clotting factors, will overcome any current allegiances.""I'm not familiar with what the other companies are telling the patients,"" said Dr. Gallia Levy, who heads Roche's Hemlibra program.""What I do know is that I've seen a lot of patients telling other patients what is happening in their lives. Those sorts of stories mean the most to the patients.""As part of Roche's initial marketing campaign for Hemlibra, it has produced videos of hemophilia patients participating in daily activities, including riding bikes, in spite of their serious illness.One video shows the consequences of failing to get appropriate treatment, featuring a Serbian man who suffered joint bleeds as a child and now must use crutches.Hemophilia A has become one of medicine's most lucrative diseases, despite just 20,000 patients in the United States and several hundred thousand worldwide. It almost always affects men, passed down by a mutation on the X chromosome from their mother. In 2016, the U.S. government alone spent some $2 billion on hemophilia A therapies, data from its Medicaid and Medicare insurance programs show. Shire's Adynovate clotting factor runs at $537,000 annually, although costs for severe patients can hit several million dollars. Roche has priced Hemlibra at $482,000, hefty but a level the independent U.S. pricing group ICER has said could cut overall hemophilia treatment costs significantly.Traditionally a cancer drugs maker, Roche is turning to rare diseases like hemophilia to replace revenue from its older medicines whose expiring patents have exposed the company to unprecedented generic competition.Hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7 percent per year through 2022, Evaluate Pharma has forecast.'RELUCTANT TO SWITCH'In August, Roche defeated a challenge from Shire aimed at delaying Hemlibra's broad introduction. Shire fears losing 30 percent of its $2.4 billion annual clotting factors sales to Hemlibra in the short term, court documents show. However, it also indicated it expected patient allegiances to at least mitigate losses.""Patients have loyalty to the brand and to manufacturers, and physicians are reluctant to switch due to risks,"" according to Shire testimony cited in the U.S. federal court judge's ruling.Clotting-factor makers have fostered this loyalty, in part, by sponsoring summer camps for patients and their families. Camp Red Sunrise in Idaho's Rocky Mountains, sponsored by Shire and Bayer, among others, is free. Another Shire-sponsored retreat, Missouri's Camp Notaclotamongus, costs $25.In September, Switzerland-based Octapharma sponsored a free sea kayaking expedition for 10 hemophilia patients on Washington State's Puget Sound, offering a chance to see pods of orca killer whales.Shire, Bayer and Octapharma did not respond to requests for comment on their efforts to boost ties to patients.Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, runs PharmedOut, a project that scrutinizes the influence the drug industry has on the practice of medicine. A 2016 paper she co-authored described hemophilia's corporate-patient links and how companies use gifts, financial opportunities and one-on-one marketing to advance their commercial interests. Hemophilia is unique, Fugh-Berman said, since patients play a bigger role in their treatment decisions than elsewhere in medicine where doctors more often call the shots.""Industry's relationship with individual patients or health care providers is always about selling specific targeted products,"" Fugh-Berman told Reuters, adding tight corporate links to patients could hamper discussion including over drug prices, even among patient groups with the best of intentions.""Taking money from industry prevents them from asking hard questions,"" she said. The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), like nearly all hemophilia patient groups, gets money from companies including Roche to pay for education, research and programs.But a spokesman said the group had strict rules that forbid advocating for a given product. ""We are focused on ensuring patients receive access to the treatment that their physician determines to be the most appropriate,"" he said by email. Michelle Rice, the NHF's head of external affairs and the mother of a hemophilia patient, said convincing everyone in the hemophilia community to quickly switch therapies will be difficult, despite benefits promised by new drugs.That is in part because of the disease's tragic history. Many hemophilia patients died after acquiring HIV and hepatitis through tainted blood products in the 1980s.""We lost about 10,000 people in our community,"" Rice said. ""They're not inclined to just jump to the next bright shiny thing, unless they see a real potential advantage.""When her son was born 28 years ago, Rice said, there were just a handful of therapies available. Now, there are some two dozen approved products, with more in the pipeline as hemophilia's potentially rich returns lure companies to pursue new approaches.France's Sanofi (PA:SASY), which this year bought Biogen's (O:BIIB) hemophilia business, is working with U.S.-based Alnylam (O:ALNY). Novo Nordisk has an alternative to clotting factors in the works, too. And experimental one-time gene therapies now being tested by BioMarin (O:BMRN), Spark Therapeutics (O:ONCE) and Sangamo (O:SGMO) would be very expensive, but could end indefinite infusions or injections.This could threaten reliable cash flows for clotting factor makers as well as pose a challenge to Hemlibra.Despite existing relationships between patients and companies, Spark's Chief Operating Officer John Furey said scientific and financial arguments should win the day.If gene therapy helps patients and reduces overall costs for insurers, Furey said, ""we'll be able to persuade the community this is a very good option for them.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"Oct 01, 2018 12:33PM ET",Scientists behind game-changing cancer immunotherapies win Nobel medicine prize,nan,"By Simon Johnson and Kate KellandSTOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday for game-changing discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune system to fight cancer.The scientists' work in the 1990s has since swiftly led to new and dramatically improved therapies for cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer, which had previously been extremely difficult to treat.""The seminal discoveries by the two Laureates constitute a landmark in our fight against cancer,"" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said as it awarded the prize of nine million Swedish crowns ($1 million).Allison and Honjo showed releasing the brakes on the immune system can unleash its power to attack cancer. The resulting treatments, known as immune checkpoint blockade, have ""fundamentally changed the outcome"" for some advanced cancer patients,"" the Nobel institute said.Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901.The literature prize will not be handed out this year after the awarding body was hit by a sexual misconduct scandal. A Swedish court on Monday found a man at the center of the scandal guilty of rape and sentenced him to two years in jail.REVOLUTIONIZED CANCER TREATMENT Allison's and Honjo's work focused on proteins that act as brakes on the immune system - preventing the body's main immune cells, known as T-cells, from attacking tumors effectively.Allison, a professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, worked on a protein known as CTLA-4 and realized that if this could be blocked, a brake would be released.""It immediately occurred to me, and some of the people in my lab, that maybe we can use this to unleash the immune system to attack cancer cells,"" Allison told a news conference after getting the prize.Honjo, a professor at Kyoto University since 1984, separately discovered a second protein called PD-1 and found that it too acted as an immune system brake, but with a different mechanism.The discoveries led to the creation of a multibillion-dollar market for new cancer medicines.Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) CTLA-4 therapy Yervoy was the first such drug to win approval, in 2011. However, it is medicines targeting PD-1 blockade that have proved a bigger commercial hit, led by Merck & Co's (N:MRK) Keytruda in 2014.These and rival drugs from Roche (S:ROG), AstraZeneca (L:AZN),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) now offer new options for patients with melanoma, lung and bladder cancers.Sales of such medicines, which are given as infusions, are expected to reach some $15 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters consensus forecasts. Some analysts see eventual revenues of $50 billion.Honjo, who is now 76, told a news conference in Tokyo he was honored to get the Nobel, but his work was not yet done.""I would like to keep on doing my research ...so that this immune treatment could save more cancer patients,"" he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated Honjo in a phone call, telling him: ""I believe the achievements of your research have given cancer patients hope and light.""Allison told a news conference he was in a ""state of shock"" hours after learning from his son that he had won a Nobel prize.""As a basic scientist, to have my work really impact people is just one of the best things,"" he said. ""I think it's everybody's dream. And I've been lucky enough to do work that is benefiting people now."" Commenting on the award, Kevin Harrington, a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the work had revolutionized cancer treatment.""We’ve gone from being in a situation where patients were effectively untreatable to having a range of immunotherapy options that, when they work, work very well indeed,"" he said in a statement. ""For some patients we see their tumors shrink or completely disappear and are effectively cured.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The French drugmaker did not detail drug prices separately for adults and children.The list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. ""Out-of-pocket"" costs vary based on the duration of the treatment and individual healthcare plans.Galafold is an oral therapy for Fabry disease, a sometimes fatal genetic condition in which accumulation of fat damages several organs. An estimated 3,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease.Galafold will not have the additional costs of administering an infused drug like Fabrazyme, Amicus says.The company is committed to keeping new treatments priced at parity with or slightly below existing treatments, it said on Monday.""If we're going to have more medicines for people living with rare diseases, we've got to bend the cost curve,"" Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview before Friday's approval.In Europe, where each country negotiates drug pricing, Galafold costs between $200,000 and $250,000 annually.Amicus does not expect to raise Galafold's U.S. price at a rate higher than consumer inflation, and has said it will use part of the drug's revenue to develop new Fabry disease therapies.Amicus shares rose 3.5 percent to $15.88 in trading before the bell on Monday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

97,"Jul 31, 2018 05:03PM ET",Sanofi has been stockpiling drugs for no-deal Brexit: WSJ,nan,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has been making drug-shortage contingency plans for more than a year to prepare for Britain and the European Union failing to reach a Brexit transition deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing a source.Stocks have been increased for all therapeutic areas by about four weeks to a total of 14 weeks' supply, excluding medicines that are in constant shortage. The stock for vaccines, of which Sanofi is a large producer, has also been increased where possible, the WSJ report said. Quality control, for which Sanofi sends batches of medicine back to the continent from its two plants in Britain, would no longer be possible in the case of a hard Brexit and some reductions to its 1,800 strong UK workforce would become necessary, the report said. Sanofi's Brexit-related preparations began about a year ago and its UK division began building up its stocks about six months after, the report added.More than 2,600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the United Kingdom to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.Brexit threatens the free flow of these goods, given stringent medicine regulations that will require the retesting of drugs shipped across borders in the absence of an agreed trading arrangement.The European Medicines Agency has warned drugmakers they needed to be ready for a possible hard Brexit in 2019 and said it had ""serious concerns"" about preparations in the case of 108 medicines made only in the UK.Earlier this month, British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) said it was increasing stockpiles of those medicines in Britain and continental Europe that could be affected by Brexit by around 20 percent.Sanofi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

103,"Jun 20, 2018 02:15AM ET",Latecomer Sanofi looks to catch next wave of cancer therapies,nan,"By Matthias BlamontPARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) missed the boat on immune system-boosting cancer drugs. Now it's trying to catch up. The French drugmaker has hired John Reed, the former top scientist at oncology market leader Roche to head its group research operations. And it is now focusing on a pipeline of 10 medicines that it hopes will help it get a piece of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market.Dmitri Wiederschain, head of Sanofi's immuno-oncology research, acknowledged the company had failed to capitalize on the takeoff of immunotherapy - drugs that activate the body's immune system to attack tumor cells - in the early 2010s. But he said the group could now gain an edge in the next waves of immunotherapy treatments, which include combining different drugs to better target cancer.""It is of course a very competitive space but we now have 'foundation assets' to form a better rationale for combinations,"" he told Reuters in an interview, citing immunotherapy approaches known as PD-1, TGFBeta and the antibody CD38. ""If you look across the biopharmaceutical landscape, Sanofi is the only company which has all three assets in its own pipeline or partnered with Regeneron,"" Wiederschain said. Sanofi teamed with U.S firm Regeneron in 2007 to increase its presence in biotech medicine. Immunotherapy is the fastest-growing part of the cancer drug segment, with sales expected to top $25 billion-a-year by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.Frederic Ponchon, a manager at Sycomore Asset Management which holds 6.7 million Sanofi shares, said the French company was unlikely to rival cancer leaders like Switzerland's Roche and U.S. firm Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co soon.""They could enjoy occasional breakthroughs but it won't carry a lot of weight in their overall sales,"" he said. ""We can see that Sanofi takes cancer seriously but you must remember R&D cycles are very long. So I would say Sanofi won't be a great player in oncology but it may have some successes from time to time."" Sanofi's main business areas include drugs for diabetes, heart diseases and vaccines, with cancer treatments making up only about 4 percent of sales. Its cancer drug sales totaled $1.7 billion last year, compared with Roche's $25.9 billion.CROWDED MARKETSanofi has not always been behind the curve in oncology; in the 1990s, it produced top-selling cancer drugs such as Taxotere and Eloxatin. However it has been seven years since the company launched its last one, Zaltrap, which targets metastatic colorectal cancer and had sales of 75 million euros ($87 million) last year.In the meantime, companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co have developed their immunotherapy blockbusters. New treatments, if successful, can fetch more than $100,000 a year.In Sanofi's current cancer pipeline, only one has made it to regulatory review in the United States and the European Union: immunotherapy agent cemiplimab to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Regeneron is its partner on the project. The company expects to submit for U.S. regulatory review another of its cancer candidates, isatuximab, to treat multiple myeloma later this year or in early 2019. With over 2,000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs.""There is clearly huge market potential but also a very large number of players, it is the toughest issue here,"" Nicolas Baudouin, a director at ratings agency Standard & Poor's said of immunotherapy.Many of the immunotherapy drugs work in only a minority of patients, which companies hope to improve by combining drugs that target tumors in different ways.This area, where Sanofi says it can be successful, has proven a challenge for drugmakers so far. Earlier this year, a study showed an experimental drug developed by U.S Incyte had failed to bolster the effectiveness of Merck's blockbuster Keytruda to treat skin cancer patients.Roche also failed a key combination trial last month in colorectal cancer.ACQUISITIONSWiederschain said molecular oncology, which targets a tumor based on its genetic makeup, would also be a future differentiator.""It is about understanding better what drives the growth of cancer tissues, how the cells works and proliferation in the body.""This has led Sanofi to launch early-stage trials in breast cancer using molecular oncology technology.Newly appointed research chief Reed will start the job on July 1, when industry veteran Elias Zerhouni retires. Under Zerhouni's leadership, Sanofi has tried to improve research and development productivity but still struggled to find enough new products to offset the impact of weak diabetes drug sales. It has also been looking to acquisitions to fill its pipeline. It struck two big deals in January, agreeing to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium's Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The first order of business is bringing global shareholders around to Japan’s biggest-ever outbound takeover.The Takeda chief executive officer is facing a 21 percent drop in the stock price since the company disclosed its interest in March, while Shire is trading 9 pounds ($12) below the offer price of roughly 49 pounds a share. He’s also contending with some domestic shareholders who are averse to expansion as Weber looks to create a global pharmaceutical giant.In an interview at Takeda’s new Tokyo headquarters, the French-born CEO discusses his push to sell the deal overseas -- and in Japan -- and plans to integrate the 237-year-old drugmaker with a London-listed company with mostly U.S.-based operations.The following excerpt has been edited for clarity and brevity.Bloomberg: Is there a difference dealing with investors in Japan vs. the U.S.?Weber: They all want to better understand our vision for the combined company -- what the new business will look like, when it will be combined. I think investors are starting from very different points. In Japan, many didn’t know Shire at all; it’s more difficult for them to understand the combination of the two. In the U.S., many people in the health-care investment sector know about Shire; some of them know about both companies.Q: Shire still trades below the offer price. What is the market missing?A: It’s not that they don’t see the benefit of the combination, it’s that there is no precedent. And so people don’t know exactly how it will happen. For example, there is no precedent for a Japanese company buying a foreign company with its own shares. There is no precedent for de-listing, so U.K. shareholders will have to exchange its shares with either Japanese shares or an ADR in New York.Q: How are you approaching the issue of integration?A: This is an area we’re quite comfortable with, otherwise we wouldn’t have done the deal. My team is truly global. There are eight nationalities and a majority of my team is not based in Japan. The other element is that Shire’s operational headquarters are in Boston and in Zurich, where we have our two hubs outside of Tokyo. So I think this proximity will help greatly. It will not be easy but we really analyze that, because most mergers are not super successful because of integration.Q: What will be the hardest part of integration?A: I think M&A or integration in the pharmaceutical industry is often highly disruptive for R&D. And this is where we have a big advantage because Shire has not invested strongly in research. We don’t have to go through the disruption of closing a research site or merging a research site, which takes a long time and has some impact on the pipeline and is so complicated. The R&D integration is relatively simple because of that.Q: What do you need to do to bridge the cultural gaps?A: We’ll have to build a new business organization and we’re actively starting to work on that. Takeda has a much longer history and stronger culture in terms of value system. We are very patient-centric -- it’s do the right thing for the patient, reinforce trust with society, develop the reputation of the company and develop the business, in that order. I think Shire is also patient-centric because in rare diseases you need to have this mindset. I think their business organization is not too dissimilar from Takeda’s.Q: How will you determine if integration has been a success?A: In three years we will have to look at Takeda and where it is positioned in the global pharma market. We’ll look at what type of pipeline and science it is generating, the type of resilience the company has, its growth and its ability to innovate. ... We will design a new company which will be very R&D driven, very very science driven. But also very fit for the future environment that we will face.Q: Many say your legacy will hinge on the success of the Shire deal.A: I don’t have any personal agenda. I don’t have any ego to feed. I’m doing this deal because I think this is a unique opportunity for Takeda to be much more competitive. And this is a unique opportunity for Japan, because Japan doesn’t have a global champion and might never have one if we don’t do this deal. The countries that have one, they all built it by M&A -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi (PA:SASY). It’s easy to say their M&A has been bumpy along the way, but what would those companies be if they had not done it?(Updates with additional quote in next-to-last Q&A.)"

Barr wrote in a now-deleted message that if the Islamist political movement ""muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj."" The tweet led the ABC network, owned by Walt Disney Co, to cancel its hit revival of her ""Roseanne"" sitcom. Trump has cited the program's popularity as evidence that his supporters, who include Barr, want shows that speak to their concerns.Jarrett said on Tuesday that Disney CEO Bob Iger called her before ABC announced the show's cancellation.""Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?"" Trump said on Twitter. Trump has been a persistent critic of the news media throughout his election campaign and presidency.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated on Trump's comments at a media briefing.""The president is simply calling out the media bias. No one is defending what she said,"" Sanders said.She brought up several examples of what she called a media slant against Trump. These included comments made by ABC's ""The View"" host Joy Behar about Vice President Mike Pence's Christian faith, comedian Kathy Griffin's comments about Trump on the same television program and ESPN's recent hiring of television personality Keith Olbermann, who called Trump a white supremacist. ESPN is majority owned by Disney. Iger last year quit a Trump advisory council because of the president's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Iger told Vogue magazine last month that he had considered running for president but decided against it to focus on business.ABC and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.ROSEANNE BLAMES AMBIENBarr blamed her late-night message on the sleep aid Ambien.""It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible,"" she wrote in a message that has since been deleted. ""I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please.""Ambien's maker, Sanofi (PA:SASY), responded.""While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication,"" its U.S. arm said on Twitter.On Tuesday, Barr had apologized ""for making a bad joke"" about Jarrett. ""Don't feel sorry for me, guys!!,"" Barr said in a tweet on Tuesday. ""I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet.""But on Wednesday she was in a feisty mood, saying on Twitter she did not know Jarrett was black.In another tweet, Barr suggested she was being unfairly treated: ""One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities...""She also responded to supportive comments on her Twitter feed, saying, ""you guys make me feel like fighting back. I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U.""The original ""Roseanne"" ran from 1988 to 1997, featuring a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life.The current ""Roseanne"" was ABC's biggest hit of the 2017-2018 season, drawing an average 18.7 million viewers, second only to CBS's ""The Big Bang Theory,"" according to Nielsen data through May 20.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

And Emmanuel Macron, though busy with climate change, Europe, Iran, reforming the French economy and trade tensions with the U.S., will see to it.France’s president wants to become the go-to head of state for global tech and will host the bosses of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google to Uber in Paris next week to talk about social responsibility, eyeing an opening as the industry’s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump proves complicated.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg is also on the guest list, according to the French presidency.Macron, France’s youngest president at 40, will meet with chiefs of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Uber and others in Paris on May 23 at the Elysee presidential palace. And expects the likes of Satya Nadella and Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt to make proposals on how the tech sector can have a positive impact on consumers and society, on matters like privacy, artificial intelligence and robots in the workplace.Soul SearchingIf anything, Macron is good at seizing the moment: after years of disrupting established industries and testing the limits of rule-breaking, companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Uber are now doing some intense soul searching, prompted by scandals about data privacy, sexual harassment and fake news influencing elections.Further, Trump’s track record with the technology sector has been mixed -- from fluctuating declarations on Chinese suppliers to singling out U.S. players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in tweets. France meanwhile has attempted a balancing act that includes a tougher stance on taxes and privacy while applauding local investments such as Samsung’s in artificial intelligence labs.Tech For GoodAbout 50 people will join to debate education, the future of work, as well as gender equality and diversity, Maurice Levy, chairman of the supervisory board at Publicis and co-organizer of the event, told reporters at a briefing Wednesday. The huddle, dubbed “Tech for good,"" will take place the day before Macron, as well as many of the executives, attend the Viva Technology industry conference in Paris.By trying to get the industry to volunteer for more responsibilities and accountability, the French president is feeding into a habit of trying to crack complicated relationships. With mixed results: Macron becoming one of the few European leaders to develop a strong relationship with Trump didn’t stop the U.S. from pulling out of the Iran nuclear accord.Over a lunch and one-on-one meetings, Macron wants to make a point: companies with global outreach and sizes should be treated like any country, with comparable responsibilities, according to two advisers to the president who briefed reporters ahead of the meeting. France wants to engage executives in a conversation over behavior considered as predatory, as well as lure investments, the aides said.Zuckerberg One-on-oneZuckerberg will get a bilateral meeting with Macron, the aides said. Macron will ask the Facebook CEO about privacy, content moderation and hate speech. Facebook representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.That meeting --Zuckerberg’s first with a head of state since the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal-- will be one of several stops in a European tour for the social media CEO, including at the European Commission, the aides said.Facebook founder ""has accepted our invitation and will be in Brussels as soon as possible, hopefully already next week,"" European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said Wednesday in a statement posted to Twitter.Macron’s guests also include CEOs and executives of Samsung (KS:005930), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Palantir and French companies from bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) to defense supplier Thales and pharmaceutical giant Sanofi (PA:SASY).

The answer is no,"" Le Maire told reporters.""Do we accept that the United States is the economic gendarme of the planet? The answer is no.""Do we accept the vassalization of Europe in commercial matters? The answer is no.""Both he and Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz had spoken to their U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin, urging him to consider exemptions or delays for companies already present in the country.Le Maire said he was seeking concrete exemptions for countries already present in Iran, including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Total, Sanofi (PA:SASY), Danone and Peugeot. Scholz had also asked for concrete measures to help German companies, Handelsblatt newspaper reported.The 2015 agreement between major powers and Iran set limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Europeans fear a collapse of the deal could intensify conflicts in the Middle East.Germany, France and Britain want talks to be held in a broader format to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional military activities, including in Syria and Yemen.""The extent to which we can keep this deal alive ... is something we need to discuss with Iran,"" said Merkel, who earlier spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue.Divisions in Iran over how it should respond to the U.S. pullout were illustrated as senior cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran University on Friday that European nations could not be trusted.President Hassan Rouhani had said on Tuesday that Tehran would remain in the deal, provided its benefits stayed in force with its remaining signatories.Iran's foreign minister will travel to Moscow on May 14 and meet his Russian counterpart, Russia's RIA news agency said, citing a Russian foreign ministry official.""DAMAGE LIMITATION""Iran said it had asked Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) to announce whether it would go ahead with a plane deal with Tehran following the U.S. pullout.That appears unlikely after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that licenses for the planemaker and rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sell passenger jets to Iran would be revoked.Le Maire said Paris would seek to strengthen Europe's ability to block sanctions and provide investment finance to companies. He called for the creation of a body to monitor the implementation of EU sanctions rules.Some fear Europe's room for maneuver is limited. ""The Europeans are in the weaker position because they are not united,"" said Peter Beyer, Germany's commissioner for transatlantic relations. Trump's strength was that he did not need unity, Beyer added.French exports to Iran doubled to 1.5 billion euros ($1.79 billion) last year, driven by sales of aircraft and automobile parts, according to customs data.Exports of German goods to Iran rose by around 400 million euros to 3 billion euros. Around 120 German firms have operations with their own staff in Iran, including  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), and some 10,000 German companies trade with Iran.""We are ready to talk to all the companies concerned about what we can do to minimize the negative consequences,"" Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio.

113,"May 08, 2018 08:48AM ET",Japan's Takeda clinches $62 billion Shire deal as pharma M&A rolls on,nan,"By Ben Hirschler, Paul Sandle and Sam NusseyLONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical agreed to buy London-listed Shire for 45.3 billion pounds ($62 billion) on Tuesday, the biggest yet in a wave of deals sweeping the drugs industry.Assuming it wins the backing of shareholders, the deal will be the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers. The tie-up crowns a hectic few months of M&A activity as big drugmakers, including Novartis and Sanofi (PA:SASY), have brought in promising medicines developed by younger firms.The enlarged group will be a Japanese national champion in pharmaceuticals and a leader in gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and blood-derived therapies, used for serious conditions such as hemophilia.Shire has profitable businesses selling drugs for hyperactivity and rare disorders but the size of the deal will make Takeda one of the most indebted drugmakers, prompting Standard & Poor's to warn of a potential credit downgrade.To pay off debts quickly, Takeda plans to slash thousands of jobs and cut back on duplicated drug research.The deal, struck on the last day Takeda had to make a firm bid, is around 46 percent cash and 54 percent stock, leaving Shire shareholders owning around half of the combination.Shire had rejected four previous offers, due to price concerns and the fact that the Japanese company is proposing to pay for much of the acquisition in stock.Shire investors will receive $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary shares for each share, valuing the offer at 48.17 pounds a share based on the latest price and exchange rate.That is a 60 percent premium to the price before Takeda first declared its interest six weeks ago.Shire's shares were trading 4 percent up on the previous close at just over 40 pounds by 1230 GMT, still well below the agreed price and indicating that some uncertainty remains.""I think it is a good deal for Shire shareholders but not everybody may think that. However, the risk is that if shareholders vote this down then the shares are going to go down a lot,"" said Polar Capital fund manager Dan Mahony, who owns both Shire and Takeda stock.The deal must get the support of 75 percent of Shire's voting shareholders. While some of them do not want to hold Takeda paper, Weber told reporters he believed most would accept.""Their board and our board is confident that both shareholders will see the benefit of the acquisition,"" he said.Jefferies analysts said they expected the shares to trade at a relatively wide discount to the offer, given the large stock component and the fact the deal is not expected to close until the first half of 2019. The transaction also needs two-thirds approval from Takeda shareholders. GOING GLOBALWeber became Takeda's first non-Japanese CEO in 2015 and has been hunting for acquisitions to make the company more global and reduce its exposure to a mature Japanese pharmaceutical market.Prior to his arrival, Takeda bought Nycomed for $14 billion in 2011 in its previous biggest deal. Last year Weber bought U.S. cancer specialist Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion.Buying Shire is a big financial stretch for Takeda but Weber believes it will generate substantial cash flow, enabling the enlarged group to pay down its borrowings quickly. Takeda said $30.1 billion in bridge loan financing would be replaced with a combination of long-term debt, hybrid capital and available cash ahead of completion, without providing a breakdown.The Japanese company predicts annual cost synergies of at least $1.4 billion three years after completion, including $600 million in research and development costs, and the deal is expected to boost underlying earnings significantly from the first full year after closing.Jobs will go, with the group's combined 52,000 workforce likely to be reduced by 6-7 percent. The companies have a number of commercial, research and manufacturing overlaps, particularly in the United States.Takeda said it would maintain its global headquarters in Japan and evaluate consolidating Shire's operations into Takeda's in the Boston area, Switzerland and Singapore.Up to three Shire directors will join the board when the deal is completed and Takeda will retain the services of key staff, including Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov, who will get 200 percent of his 2018 annual salary and target bonus.Weber argued Takeda would be able to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a target of achieving a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0 times or less in the medium term. ""The commitment to get down to two times EBITDA in three to five years really shows how cash-generative Shire is,"" said Polar Capital's Mahony. Some analysts have suggested Takeda could sell off certain Shire businesses to make the deal more manageable but Weber said gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and blood products were all important areas to be retained.There may, however, be opportunities to divest certain medicines falling outside these fields.""There is 25 percent (of the portfolio) which is more isolated products. Some are doing very well, some less well. That's where you could have some portfolio assessment and potentially some disposals,"" Weber said.Shire said last month it would be willing to recommend an offer from Takeda after it rejected four previous approaches.The company traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire, southern England. Since then, it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.But it has been under pressure in the past 12 months due to greater competition from generic drugs and debt from its widely criticized $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.Takeda was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Nomura, while Shire worked with Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ($1 = 0.7366 pounds)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported last month hits to their results from the strong euro.In April however the single currency has fallen rapidly to a four-month low against the dollar, with the greenback buoyed by the U.S. Treasury yields topping three percent and expectations the Federal Reserve will further raise interest rates.That in turn helped euro zone stocks rise 4.4 percent in April, outperforming Wall Street for the second straight month, and shrug off slower earnings growth and weeks of disappointing data that signaled slowing economic growth.""For the moment we've seen the headwind peak and that may stabilize this quarter,"" said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy, International Wealth Management at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Wealth Management.""We've already seen a very significant amount of the euro's appreciation take effect on earnings so at this point in time what matters most is just how much more hawkish people become on the ECB,"" he added.(Euro boom hurts exporters: https://reut.rs/2rihADY)Bose however said markets appeared to underestimate the speed at which the European Central Bank would tighten policy, saying the euro would eventually strengthen again.German companies listed in the broad HDAX (GDAXHI) index, whose U.S. dollar sales exposure is estimated by DZ Bank at 28 percent of total turnover, also rose 4 percent last month. The U.S benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) instead gained just 0.3 percent. In a note this week, Deutsche Bank strategists said they would lift their 2018 European earnings growth forecast to seven percent from 4.5 percent should the euro fade back to end-2017 levels. Manulife's Hamlyn agreed that a further fall in the euro could be welcome news for European companies, although the initial impact of the April decline was likely to be limited.""It needs to come back down to 1.15 really to create relief for a lot of these companies,"" he said. The last time the euro traded at that level against the dollar was in July 2017. On Thursday the euro rose off four-month lows as the dollar's recent rally came to a halt after the U.S. Federal Reserve did little to alter market expectations for further interest rate rises this year. Even though the euro remained more than four percent below the peak hit in February, that dampened investor appetite for European stocks on Thursday, highlighting how sensitive shares in the continent are to currency swings. But for Gerhard Schwarz, Head of Equity & Cross Asset Strategy at Baader Bank in Munich, the currency outlook for corporate Europe looked favorable, even though overall earnings growth was set to slow compared to 2017 due the slowing economic growth.""There is a good chance the euro would weaken again,"" he said, saying the currency could reach $1.12-1.15 during the second half of the year, likely bolstering corporate earnings, although any lift could be delayed by hedging policies. ""The euro has certainly has been profiting from expectations the ECB will tighten policy following the Fed's path but this, I think, will be subdued and take place much later that consensus expects,"" he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"May 02, 2018 07:38AM ET",Too many cancer drugs? Crowded market gives investors pause,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - In London's world-famous Great Ormond Street children's hospital, Dr. Karin Straathof is excited about a new cell-based medicine that offers hope for toddlers with incurable nerve tissue cancer.Her progress with a handful of children for whom standard care does not work reveals the promise of modern cancer drugs, an increasingly crowded pharmaceuticals field from which investors must try to select future winners.The new therapy using engineered white blood cells has shown anti-tumor activity in the hardest to treat neuroblastoma patients.""The beauty is that it is very specific in targeting the cancer cells, while leaving healthy tissue unharmed,"" Straathof told Reuters, after presenting her early findings at a science meeting in Chicago in April. ""It's an important step forward."" Autolus - the small British biotech company developing the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell or CAR-T treatment - is equally excited, and is planning a potential IPO on Nasdaq.But Autolus is far from alone in pursuing CAR-T therapy. In fact, CAR-T treatment - part of the wider field of cancer immunotherapy - is one of the hottest areas of drug research today, with multiple firms piling in.The biotech dollars are flooding in not only in Europe and the United States but also in China which, with 162 clinical trials, now boasts more CAR-T studies than the United States, according to a Reuters analysis of the latest data.With over 2,000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs.Overall, researchers are working on more than 5,200 cancer drugs, up 7.6 percent from a year ago, according to the Pharmaprojects database. The sheer number is stretching the ability of scientists to find enough patients to test them on.Cancer now makes up 34.1 percent of the total drug industry pipeline, up from 26.8 percent in 2010, as companies divert resources into a promising sector where new treatments can often fetch more than $100,000 a year. 'MORE CIRCUMSPECT' With the first two CAR-T treatments from  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) winning U.S. approval last year for rare blood cancers, the promise of such smart medicine is real and life-changing - especially if it can be made to work in solid tumors, as Straathof's work suggests is possible.However, the wholesale rush by pharmaceutical and biotech companies into the cancer area poses a dilemma for investors. A flood of similar products makes it hard for investors to pick those companies that will achieve commercial success.""More competition means you should be more circumspect,"" said Nooman Haque, head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London, which provides financing for start-ups and venture capitalists.""The traditional investment thesis in biotech is to have a differentiated medicine with not many competitors, which helps drive value. Here the problem is that even if there is a big patient benefit, there are questions as to how long your advantage lasts and what your commercial edge will be.""Pharmaceutical executives are not blind to the issue, although each hopes to find a winning formula in immunotherapy - the fastest-growing part of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market, with sales expected to top $25 billion by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.Roche (S:ROG) CEO Severin Schwan, head of the world's top cancer company, says he expects ""an enormous drop-out"", while Sanofi's (PA:SASY) outgoing research head Elias Zerhouni warned analysts last week that duplication of effort would shrink the time available for drugmakers to recoup their R&D investments.""The cycle of innovation has been shortened significantly,"" agrees Aiman Shalabi, chief medical officer at the non-profit Cancer Research Institute. ""There is no doubt we are seeing fast follow-on and many identical agents hitting the same targets.""The good news for society is that patients will find out much faster than in the past if new approaches work. But that means doctors can rapidly switch to alternatives, leading to increased product churn and uncertainty over future sales. COMBINATION STUDIESTwenty years ago, when Roche launched its state-of-the-art cancer drugs Herceptin and Rituxan, it enjoyed years without rivals. Today, there are multiple versions of new drugs targeting molecular pathways with acronyms such as PD-1/L1, PARP and CDK, as well as CAR-T.""You're either first or you're best or you're nowhere because it has become such a race,"" said Paul Major, an investment manager at BB Healthcare Trust (L:BBH), who is cautious about investing in cancer immunotherapy.Lydia Haueter at Pictet Asset Management is also wary, pointing out there are already five PD-1/L1 drugs on the market - from Merck (N:MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY), Roche, AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and  Pfizer  (N:PFE) - and more are coming.""It seems everybody has a PD-1, so we especially don't go for those kind of cancer companies,"" she said.Some drugmakers like GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Novartis that missed the initial PD-1/L1 wave are trying to make a virtue of looking ahead to the next phase of cancer immunotherapy, particularly drug combinations.Yet last month's failure of a combination study using a next-generation drug from Incyte (O:INCY) with Merck's PD-1 Keytruda shows that adding a new agent is no slam dunk for expanding the reach of immune-boosting medicine.At Great Ormond Street, Straathof is less concerned about doubling up on research and more focused on getting effective, affordable cures - and she hopes automated processes will eventually bring down today's sky-high drug prices.""I'm not too worried about duplication. It's important to not ask the same question in two trials but I think there are a lot of questions to be addressed because there is a lot of nuance in the system.""

117,"May 01, 2018 02:10AM ET",Euro's boom spells corporate gloom for region's exporters,nan,"By Alasdair Pal and Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A strong euro has helped U.S. companies extend their sales outperformance over Europe to multi-year highs in the first quarter, according to Reuters data - though experts expect the trend to begin to reverse later this year.Renewed confidence in the European economy and persistent weakness in the dollar have driven the euro up 16 percent against the U.S. currency from the first quarter last year to the end of March 2018.That means euro zone companies reporting first-quarter earnings for 2018 have seen dollar revenues shrink by roughly a sixth in a year. Some 74 percent of companies on the U.S. S&P 500 that have reported in first quarter have beaten analysts' estimates for sales, compared with just 22 percent on Europe's Stoxx 600, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.The spread between the two is the highest since I/B/E/S/ began collating comparable data in the first quarter of 2011.(Graphic: Euro boom hurts continent's exporters - https://reut.rs/2JGfoNp)Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported hits to their results from the strong euro in the last week.Euro zone exporters suffer from a strong currency as they make large chunks of their sales and revenues in foreign currencies, which are then worth less when translated back into euros.The rising euro also results in higher costs and a pressure to raise prices, potentially making exporters less competitive.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) said the strong euro would dampen revenue growth this year, while Sanofi said a stronger euro had a negative effect of 8.3 percent on sales in the first quarter. [nL8N1S40Z4]Euro zone industrials, and consumer cyclicals, sectors dominated by exporters, have been delivering weaker than expected first-quarter revenues, Reuters data shows, with some of the biggest negative earnings surprises.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said currency effects were to blame for a disconnect between earnings growth beats and stocks' performance. ""We believe this has been a direct consequence of investors' concerns about FX downgrades causing further downside risks to earnings,"" they said. Some of the region's biggest drinks makers all said the strong euro would crimp profits. Heineken  (AS:HEIN) said the strong euro would wipe 200 million euros ($247 million) off operating profit this year based on current exchange rates. In mid-February, it had put the figure at 190 million euros. [nL8N1RV1JR] Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) also increased its estimate of the euro's negative impact, to 200 million from its previous estimate of 180 million, and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) said foreign exchange movements would knock 17 to 18 million euros off full-year operating profit. [nL8N1RV1PM] [nL8N1RW0TB]Overall each 10 percent move higher in the euro takes around 6 percent off earnings per share (EPS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said, and 70 percent of the time the euro has strengthened, euro area equities have underperformed in local terms. The strong euro is also part of the rationale for some brokers recommending investors shift from the more cyclical parts of the market to defensives, as cyclical sectors are both more exposed to global growth and to the negative currency effect.The worst could be over for Euro zone exporters, however.The biggest upward surge in the euro was in the second quarter last year when French President Emmanuel Macron was elected, and Q2 earnings will thus be compared with a higher euro base a year ago.In addition, the euro has fallen from its mid-February peak, suggesting the pressure could ease.Analysts at JP Morgan said while the U.S. is strongly outperforming Europe in terms of sales delivery in the first quarter, ""the worst of the Euro headwind happened in Q1, and in the second half positive sales surprises should shift from the U.S. to (the) Euro area."" Some investors were reluctant to make any bets on a reversal of the currency effect, however, arguing the euro alone could not be responsible for the extent of Europe's underperformance of the United States.""For us it's neither here nor there. Even net of any currency effects European markets have been a bit disappointing in the last year or so,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

119,"Apr 27, 2018 04:45AM ET",French first-quarter growth slowdown tests ECB optimism,nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - French economic growth slowed slightly more than expected at the start of the year, official data showed on Friday, a day after the European Central Bank played down concerns of softness in the broader euro zone economy.The INSEE statistics agency said in a first estimate that the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months - the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016.That marked a slowdown from 0.7 percent growth recorded in the final three months of last year and was slightly below economists' average forecast for 0.4 percent in a Reuters poll.Slower business investment and exports in the face of a stronger euro were the main drags on the economy in the first quarter, a breakdown of the data showed.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the growth slowdown came as no surprise after the exceptionally strong end to 2017.""I think growth is solid in Europe and sustainable but we all know their are some clouds on the horizon,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting with EU counterparts in Bulgaria, citing the risk of a trade war and interest rate increases.The European Central Bank sought to calm concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy on Thursday with sources telling Reuters policymakers were keen not to upset investors' expectations that its stimulus program would end this year.French inflation data offered ECB central bankers some relief on Friday, showing consumer prices rose the most in five and a half years in April to 1.8 percent, just below the ECB's 2.0 percent target. Weak inflation had been the main justification for the ECB's 2.55 trillion-euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus program.SOFT PATCHCapital Economics economist Jessica Hinds said that the slowdown was likely to prove a blip, forecasting the French economy would grow 2.3 percent this year and next after expanding 2.0 percent in 2017.""Granted, the activity surveys have softened since the start of the year. But they are still consistent with quarterly GDP growth of about 0.6 percent,"" Hinds said in a research note.""And investment is set to grow at a decent pace thanks to President (Emmanuel) Macron’s pro-business approach. Meanwhile, the continued improvement in the French labor market points to solid growth in consumer spending,"" she added.Consumer spending growth, traditionally the main motor of the French economy, grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter despite exceptionally cold temperatures boosting energy consumption in February.Meanwhile businesses slowed investment growth to 0.5 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous three months while overall production of goods and services slowed to only 0.3 percent from 0.9 percent.Manufacturing production fell particularly sharply, down 1.1 percent as companies such as carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and pharmaceutical group Sanofi (PA:SASY) said the euro's strength had hit their sales.As a result, exports swung from a sharp increase in the fourth quarter to a slight decrease in the first three months of 2018. Since imports were flat, foreign trade had no impact on overall growth, INSEE said.($1 = 0.8286 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don't work within a defined timeframe.The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as ""middlemen"" in the drug supply chain. The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs.""If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don't do that to patients who have high co-pays,"" Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals.

Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with  Novartis  (S:NOVN), declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model. Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said. ""It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,"" Harper said.

Lilly declined 0.5 percent. TAKING OUT COSTS Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs. To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), while PBM rival CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) plans to buy insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) . In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment. Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years. The biotech company's last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year. Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN), launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million. ""If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,"" said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca. Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency's decision on Teva's treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues.

123,"Apr 12, 2018 04:04AM ET",Takeda sounds out banks for loans as it moves towards Shire bid: sources,nan,"By Taro FuseTOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) has sounded out its major creditors for loans, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, as it moves closer to a bid for London-listed rare disease specialist  Shire  (L:SHP) that could hit $50 billion. Expectations that Japan's largest drugmaker by sales will bid for Shire before an April 25 deadline have mounted since its chief executive Christophe Weber discussed the strategic case for the deal at a briefing with analysts last week.Buying Shire would be transformational for Takeda but would be a huge financial stretch, since the company is worth around $10 billion more than the Japanese group.Weber said at the briefing, which was closed to the media, that Takeda was weighing a deal for all of Shire and there was scope to increase debt, according to analysts. Takeda has sounded out creditors including its main bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, the two sources said on Thursday, declining to be identified as the matter was confidential. Japan's Kyodo News reported earlier that Takeda was looking for loans of several trillion yen (tens of billions of dollars) in total from multiple banks. Shares in Shire rose another 2 percent on Thursday. They have now gained 19 percent - valuing the company at more than $47 billion - since the Japanese firm said on March 28 that it was considering an offer.Takeda shares ended down 1.2 percent in Tokyo on Thursday, valuing it at around $37 billion.A successful bid for Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, helmed by Frenchman Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid. Representatives for Takeda, Shire and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, the core banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316), were not immediately available for comment. Takeda's shares have fallen more than 9 percent since it was first reported it was considering bidding.Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.Weber told analysts at last week's briefing that size was no obstacle for any ""mindful"" acquisition and Shire could accelerate his company's transformation.The drugs industry has seen a surge in deal-making this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines, but a Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest yet.Well priced and high-margin treatments for rare diseases have been a particular focus for several multi-billion-dollar acquisitions.On Monday, Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) agreed to acquire gene therapy specialist AveXis (O:AVXS) for $8.7 billion, following similar purchases by the likes of France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) and U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

124,"Apr 09, 2018 06:38AM ET",Novartis bets big on gene therapy with $8.7 billion AveXis deal,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) is moving further into gene therapy by buying AveXis (O:AVXS) for $8.7 billion, adding a rare-disease treatment that could reap billions in sales.The acquisition reflects a surge of interest in biotech deal-making as large pharmaceutical companies seek promising new assets to boost their pipelines.The $218-per-share cash deal announced on Monday represents a 72 percent premium to AveXis's 30-day volume-weighted average stock price. The transaction is seen closing in mid-2018.Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who took over on Feb. 1, is flush with cash, having just agreed to sell his company's stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture to GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) for $13 billion.Narasimhan is now counting on AveXis's main drug, AVXS-101 for deadly spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), as well as the Illinois-based company's gene therapy expertise and manufacturing capabilities, to bolster Novartis's neuroscience business, a focus for the Swiss company. This is Novartis's second notable gene therapy deal this year after it agreed to pay $105 million upfront and up to $65 million in milestone payments for rights to Spark's blindness treatment Luxturna outside the United States.""We believe the medicine would have a multi-billion dollar peak sales potential,"" Narasimhan told reporters of AVXS-101, which has so-called breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and is expected to be submitted to regulators this year.""It also provides us capabilities in gene therapy,"" he added. ""We have a robust internal portfolio of gene therapies in ophthalmology and neuroscience in Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research. And we look forward to using AveXis's capabilities and technical development capabilities to be able to advance that portfolio."" Novartis shares were up 0.8 percent at 0830 GMT.The company said the acquisition would slightly dent core operating income in 2018 and 2019, due to research and development costs, before strongly contributing to profits in 2020 as sales accelerate.Adding promising drugs from outside to boost sales growth down the road is a strategy being pursued by several of Novartis's rivals.France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) agreed to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium's Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bagged cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion.Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) is also considering a deal for London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP), which has a market value of about $47 billion.""WHO'S NEXT?""Novartis's second bet on gene therapy in four months will fuel speculation of mergers and acquisitions as large pharmaceuticals and biotech companies remain on the prowl for smaller targets, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.""Clearly Novartis is building out in gene therapy,"" Yee said. ""Who's next?""Narasimhan, who said the patient population for SMA was 23,500 people in established markets, plans to use proceeds from the GSK transaction to help pay for AveXis. SMA affects the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement, and commonly leads to death in young children. So far, a study of AVXS-101, which replaces a faulty gene, shows children achieved many important motor nerve milestones after getting treatment. Additional data is due for release this month, Narasimhan said.There are existing treatments for SMA - Biogen's and Ionis's RNA-splicing Spinraza, approved in 2016, generated $363 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 - as well as therapies under development by Roche (S:ROG) and  Cytokinetics  (O:CYTK).""Novartis is taking the view that AveXis's ... transgene approach trumps Biogen/Ionis' approved Spinraza and other agents in development,"" UBS analysts wrote.Narasimhan said the transaction reflected Novartis's strategy of hunting for new medicines and technologies to buttress medicines it is developing in-house.""Our goal is to continue to build on our core medicines,"" he said. ""With the exit of the GSK stake, our intention was to re-deploy capital into our core.""AveXis is also developing gene therapy candidates in other rare diseases, Rett Syndrome and inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, that Novartis also sees as good prospects.Novartis's financial adviser on the deal was Dyal Co LLC, while AveXis's was Goldman Sachs (N:GS).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The impression left by the news is that the acquisition would be an overreach,"" said Mizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Tanaka in a note to clients.Any deal is expected to involve some form of equity, whether that be a share swap or a share issue, analysts also said, noting a share issue could be highly dilutive for Takeda shareholders.Takeda said an acquisition of Shire, which also sells treatments for attention deficit disorder, could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boost its position in the United States and in the fields of oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience.But some analysts also doubted whether Shire's treatments for haemophilia and other rare diseases would benefit Takeda and thought that any deal should be more targeted.""We think neuroscience assets alone, which Shire said are under strategic review, would be a realistic target, but we find it hard to imagine Takeda acquiring all of Shire,"" said UBS analyst Atsushi Seki. ""We think the possibility of it making a proposal is very low, but its share price will likely be under pressure from concern over potential dilution.""Takeda's potential bid for Shire, most of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry.In recent months, France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) agreed to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ  for $11.6 billion and Belgium's  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX) for 3.9 billion euros ($4.8 billion). Before that, U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bought cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics . Japanese companies, faced with a rapidly shrinking population, are seen as particularly acquisitive.

Takeda said on Wednesday it was ""at a preliminary and exploratory stage"" of considering a bid, sending Shire's shares up as much as 26 percent. They were 17 percent higher at 1215 GMT, valuing the group at 32.7 billion pounds ($46.3 billion).Shire sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. Takeda said buying it could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boosting its position in the United States, oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience.The drugs industry has seen a surge in dealmaking as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. In recent months, Sanofi (PA:SASY) beat  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) in the race for Belgian biotech company  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX), while U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bagged cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics . The prospect of a bid for Shire, 57 percent of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for a takeover battle. ""Takeda publicly saying it is considering an approach for Shire inevitably means that other big pharma players including AbbVie, Novartis,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) et al will equally be running the numbers with a very high likelihood of leading to a competitive M&A multi-bidder situation,"" said Michael Wegener, managing partner at hedge fund Case Equity Partners, which has a stake in Shire.Takeda said it had not approached Shire's board. Under UK takeover rules, it has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid.Shire said it noted Takeda's statement, and confirmed it had not received an approach.Shire has been under pressure in the last year, with its shares down 24 percent, due to greater competition from generic drugs and a debt pile that stems from its biggest ever deal, the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.The company announced in January a plan to split into two separate businesses to boost performance.FRENCH CEOTakeda, Japan's largest drugmaker by sales, focuses its research on developing treatments for cancer and diseases of the digestive and nervous systems.It has made no secret of its ambition to become a more global company through acquisitions, although buying Shire would be the boldest move yet by its French CEO Christophe Weber.""Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda's disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established,"" Takeda said in a statement.""Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria.""The statement came after Takeda's shares had closed 1.9 percent lower on the Tokyo stock exchange.""An acquisition would likely have to include a considerable quantum of equity,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a research note. ""As such, it remains to be seen as to if/how a transaction could be structured or whether today's news will stimulate other potential acquirers in to action.""Weber, a former GSK executive, was appointed CEO in April 2015 and has already done a number of deals. In January, Takeda agreed to buy Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV (BR:G9U) for 520 million euros, funding the deal with cash on hand, and last year, it bought U.S. cancer drug specialist Ariad for $5.2 billion.

127,"Mar 25, 2018 07:21PM ET",Singapore pharma on recovery path after worst output in decades,nan,"By Masayuki Kitano and John GeddieSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's pharmaceuticals business, among the pillars of the city-state's manufacturing sector, is set to return to strength this year as big global drugmakers ramp up output and advance automation at their production sites across the country.A recovery from dismal 2017, which marked the sector's worst contraction in two decades, would underpin Singapore's economic growth. Pharmaceuticals is the No.2 contributor to the country's manufacturing output and accounts for 3 percent of its GDP.The sector will see a ""robust"" 2018, Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) told Reuters.""The opening of new sites like AbbVie's (N:ABBV) biologics manufacturing facility and the ramp up of others including Amgen (O:AMGN) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) reflect strong fundamentals ... we expect the manufacturing activity to remain robust for 2018,"" said Ho Weng Si, director of biomedical sciences for EDB.""Outlook for the industry as a whole remains positive for the next few years,"" Ho added, citing the pace of new drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that hit a 21-year high in 2017.Singapore is well placed to benefit from this uptick in approvals as it hosts facilities of eight of the world's top 10 drugmakers - such as Roche (S:ROG), GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY). Sanofi, which in Singapore mainly produces ingredients for blood-thinning drugs shipped globally, told Reuters it expects production ""to be relatively stable to slightly increasing in coming years"" as it invests to upgrade capacity.A quarterly EDB survey of the manufacturing sector shows the pharmaceuticals industry is the most optimistic about production over January-March, with a net weighted balance of 56 percent of firms expecting output to rise from the preceding three months.EDB's Ho and the survey did not provide a specific forecast.Data for January shows pharmaceutical production dropped, albeit at a milder pace. Output shrank 15.6 percent in 2017, the largest annual contraction since at least 1993.Singapore's pharmaceutical output has risen more than three-fold since the start of this century, with the sector generating S$17 billion ($13 billion) worth of products last year. (For a graphic on 'Singapore's pharmaceuticals output coming off a weak year' click http://reut.rs/2FZ60ms)ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY, AUTOMATION The outlook for recovery, however, is not free of headwinds.Output in pharmaceuticals is inherently volatile because production happens in batches, which can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to make.But thanks to advancements in technology, industry players are hoping to achieve more consistent production levels.GSK, which has been manufacturing in Singapore for nearly 50 years, has been pioneering a technology called continuous manufacturing where instead of making products in batches, materials are constantly added and products removed. Last year, for the first time products were commercially made using this technology.""The pharma industry has to progress on the technology front ... to ensure we increase productivity,"" said Lim Hock Heng, a site director in Singapore for GSK.Mundipharma hopes to start commercial production of antiseptics at its new plant in Singapore as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 - which according to CEO Raman Singh ""will be the most automated plant in the world compared to any other competitors"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Patients will be able to refuse the use of their information for research, the statement said. Digital health records are valuable. Big data analytics - comparing information provided by large numbers of patients - give some of the world's biggest drugmakers indications of how medicines perform in the real world. Netanyahu said world leaders and international firms have already shown interest in the project and that the potential revenue for Israel could be in the billions of dollars.All the world's major drug companies now have departments focused on the use of real-world data across multiple diseases. Several have completed scientific studies using the information to delve into key areas addressed by their drugs.They include diabetes studies by AstraZeneca and Sanofi (PA:SASY), joint research by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb into stroke prevention, and a Takeda Pharmaceutical project in bowel disease.

129,"Mar 23, 2018 07:47AM ET",GSK pulls out of $20 billion race for Pfizer consumer assets,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Ludwig BurgerLONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) has quit the race to buy Pfizer's (N:PFE) consumer healthcare business, endangering an auction the U.S. drugmaker hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion.It was not immediately clear whether there were other offers for the business, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, following this week's deadline for binding bids.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which announced its withdrawal on Friday, was seen as the frontrunner to buy the assets after  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) left the race late on Wednesday. Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) stepped away from the auction in January.A source familiar with the matter said GSK declined to make a final bid for the assets in the end. ""While we will continue to review opportunities that may accelerate our strategy, they must meet our criteria for returns and not compromise our priorities for capital allocation,"" GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in a statement.GSK shares rose nearly 4 percent, as investors' concerns about a potential dividend cut eased.  Pfizer  said on Friday it continued to evaluate potential alternatives for the business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, as well as retaining it.""We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,"" a spokesman said. Sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday it was possible there were other bids. On Friday, a source said that if not, Pfizer could try to tap private equity funds. Pfizer is the world's fifth-largest player in consumer health with 2.5 percent of a market bolstered by aging populations and growing interest in health and wellness. The business, which also includes Chapstick lip balm and Caltrate supplements, is seen as attractive but has come to market at a bad time. GSK and Reckitt are under shareholder pressure to exercise financial discipline, while other potential suitors, such as Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) are busy with other projects.What is more, the global consumer health market has slowed, from 4-6 percent like-for-like sales growth to 0-3 percent growth,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in December. Major players in the over-the-counter market have been grappling with pricing pressure stoked by online players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and private label competitors. Pfizer's hope of fetching around $20 billion translated to a multiple of about 20 times the unit's core earnings, according to Bernstein analysts, in line with past deals in the sector during faster growing times. Differences in price expectations also hobbled German drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) attempts to sell its consumer products unit, where a price tag of up to 4 billion euros ($5 billion) deterred initial suitors such as Nestle (S:NESN), Perrigo (N:PRGO) and a private-equity consortium. Reckitt's early interest in the Merck assets also waned as the Pfizer auction gained momentum.SPLIT OPINION Buying the Pfizer business would have been the boldest move to date for Walmsley, who took over at GSK last April. But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.Acquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.That is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal (PA:OREP) - since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.Last month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelt out that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.The overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields. GSK runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with  Novartis  (S:NOVN), which complicates any acquisitions. Novartis has the right to sell down its 36.5 percent stake, valued at around $10 billion, from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Hot areas for such studies include cancer, heart disease and respiratory disorders.Historically, it has been hard to get a handle on how drugs work in routine clinical practice but the rise of electronic medical records, databases of insurance claims, fitness wearables and even social media now offers a wealth of new data.The ability to capture the experience of real-world patients, who represent a wider sample of society than the relatively narrow selection enrolled into traditional trials, is increasingly useful as medicine becomes more personalized.However it also opens a new front in the debate about corporate access to personal data at a time when tech giants Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) are seeking to carve out a healthcare niche.Some campaigners and academics worry such data will be used primarily as a commercial tool by drugmakers and may intrude upon patients' privacy. DRUGMAKERS DELVELearning from the experience of millions of patients provides granularity and is especially important in a disease like cancer, where doctors want to know if there is a greater benefit from using a certain drug in patients with highly specific tumor characteristics.In the case of the Flatiron deal, Roche is acquiring a firm working with 265 U.S. community cancer clinics and six major academic research centers, making it a leading curator of oncology evidence. Roche, which already owns 12.6 percent of Flatiron, will pay $1.9 billion for the rest.But interest in such real-world data goes far beyond cancer.All the world's major drug companies now have departments focused on the use of real-world data across multiple diseases and several have completed scientific studies using the information to delve into key areas addressed by their drugs.They include diabetes studies by AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), joint research by  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY) into stroke prevention, and a Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) project in bowel disease.""It's getting more expensive to do traditional clinical trial research, so industry is looking at ways it can achieve similar goals using routinely collected data,"" said Paul Taylor, a health informatics expert at University College London.""The thing that has made all this possible is the increasing digitization of health records."" Significantly, the world's regulators are taking notice.U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb - the gatekeeper to the world's biggest pharmaceutical market - believes more widespread use of real-world evidence (RWE) could cut drug development costs and help doctors make better medical choices.Under the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has been directed to evaluate the expanded use of RWE. ""As the breadth and reliability of RWE increases, so do opportunities for FDA to also make use of this information,"" Gottlieb said in a speech last September.The European Medicines Agency, too, is studying ways to use RWE in its decision making. (GRAPHIC: Drug research gets real - http://tmsnrt.rs/2otRk8g) WHOSE DATA IS IT ANYWAY?But the growth of real-world evidence also raises questions about data access and patient privacy, as Britain's National Health Service (NHS) - a uniquely comprehensive source of healthcare data - has found to its cost.An ambitious scheme to pool anonymized NHS patient data for both academic and commercial use had to be scrapped in 2016 after protests from both patients and doctors. And last year a British hospital trust was rapped by the Information Commissioner's Office for misusing data, after it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to artificial-intelligence firm Google DeepMind.Sam Smith, a campaigner for medical data privacy at Britain's MedConfidential, is concerned drugmakers' RWE studies are just a cover for marketing. ""How much of this is really for scientific discovery and how much is it about boosting profits by getting one product used instead of another?""Some academics also worry RWE studies could be susceptible to ""data dredging"", where multiple analyses are conducted until one gives the hoped-for result.AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos, whose company has struck several deals with tech start-ups and patient groups to gather real-world data, acknowledges ensuring privacy and scientific rigor is a challenge.""It's a real problem but I don't think it's insurmountable,"" he told Reuters. ""As people get more comfortable with real-world evidence studies I think it will be much more widely used. I would like to see a world where real-world data can be used to help change drug labels and be used much more aggressively than it is today."" NEXT FRONTIERRoche Chief Executive Severin Schwan believes data is the next frontier for drugmakers and he is betting that the Swiss group's leadership in both cancer medicine and diagnostics will put it in pole position.""There's an opportunity for us to have a strategic advantage by bringing together diagnostics and pharma with data management. This triangle is almost impossible for anybody else to copy,"" he said in a December interview.Still, even Roche cannot work alone in this new world.""You can have a big debate about whose data it is - the patient's, the government's, the insurer's - but one thing for sure is the pharmaceutical company does not own it. So there's no choice but to do partnerships,"" Schwan said.With Apple's latest iPhone update including a new feature allowing users to view their medical records, Amazon teaming with Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) on a new healthcare company, and numerous start-ups flooding in, the partnering opportunities are plentiful.""You are going to see more deals,"" said Susan Garfield, a partner in EY's life sciences advisory practice. ""Data already has tremendous value and it is going to have increasing value in future. The question is who is going to own and capture it.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That was just above the reported $27.8 billion stake in Wells Fargo.Berkshire may have funded the Apple purchases by selling roughly $5 billion of  IBM  stock, reducing that stake to just 2.05 million shares worth about $314 million.Buffett began selling IBM in the first quarter of 2017, and has admitted he did not value the company as highly as when he began buying six years earlier.Berkshire at one time owned roughly 81 million IBM shares, for which it paid about $13.8 billion. Berkshire was close to break-even on IBM when the selling began.Berkshire on Wednesday also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK),  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) and US Bancorp (N:USB), and lower stakes in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), General Motors Co (N:GM), France's Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) and Wells Fargo.On Tuesday, Berkshire agreed to sell more than 43 percent of another big holding, Phillips 66 (N:PSX), back to the oil refiner for $3.3 billion.

The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines, where more than 800,000 school-age children had been vaccinated in 2016.Sanofi officials were not immediately available for comment on the government announcement.The Philippine Health Ministry halted Dengvaxia immunizations in November. It formed a 10-member panel of experts to determine if the drug was directly connected to the deaths of 14 children after they were given the vaccine.It found it may have been connected to the deaths of three.""Three cases were found to have causal association. They died of dengue even (though) they were given Dengvaxia. Two of them may have died because of vaccine failure,"" Health Undersecretary Enrique Domingo told a news conference.""These findings strengthen the decision of the Department of Health to stop the vaccine. It has failed in some children. Dengvaxia is not ready for mass vaccinations and we would need three to five more years to watch and monitor if there would be other adverse reactions from the vaccine.""Mosquito-borne dengue is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide, causing half a million life-threatening infections and killing about 20,000 people, mostly children, each year. Domingo said the panel's findings would be shared with the justice department, which is considering cases against those responsible for the mass immunization program.Pediatrician and panel member Juliet Sio-Aguilar, from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, said the team was recommending further studies as it was difficult to directly connect the three deaths to Dengvaxia.No vaccine has a 100 percent success rate, she said. The dengue death rate in the Philippines was 60 times higher than global rate, Sio-Aguilar said.The Philippines spent 3.5 billion pesos ($68 million) on the Dengvaxia program to reduce the 200,000 dengue cases reported every year. The Philippines has already fined Sanofi a symbolic $2,000, citing violations in product registration and marketing.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

145,"Jan 29, 2018 12:15PM ET",Sanofi beats Novo to buy Ablynx for $4.8 billion in biotech M&A boom,nan,"By Matthias Blamont and Ben HirschlerPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros ($4.8 billion), beating  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and marking its second big deal this month after buying Bioverativ.The transaction is a further sign of accelerating merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the global biotech sector and comes after Ablynx rejected a 2.6 billion euro offer from Denmark's Novo Nordisk.Sanofi said on Monday it would pay 45 euros per share in cash for Ablynx, a premium of 21 percent over its closing price on Friday, and more than double the price before Novo went public with its initial bid.Novo Nordisk conceded defeat, saying it could not justify the knock-out price being paid by Sanofi for Ablynx, which is developing a prized experimental drug for a rare blood disorder.This month has seen a spike in multibillion-dollar deals in biotech, with U.S.-based Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) paying $9 billion for cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics, and several experts predicting a bumper year for M&A.Total biotech M&A so far this month now stands at $26.3 billion, or more than 80 percent of the value of all deals in 2016 and far ahead of any comparable January tally in over a decade, according to Thomson Reuters data.Such deals are being driven by the need for large drugmakers to tap the promising new medicines being developed by smaller rivals to help revive flagging growth.Last week, Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years and a major play to strengthen its presence in treatments for rare diseases.Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Olivier Brandicourt said the deals expanded the French company's late-stage pipeline and strengthened its line-up of treatments for rare blood disorders - but did not necessarily mark the end of its M&A ambitions.""We have a strong balance sheet. We generate significant cash flow. We are going to look at opportunities on a case-by-case basis,"" he told reporters.""We also identified CHC (consumer healthcare) previously as an area where we want to sustain a leadership position and therefore you can expect us to evaluate opportunities.""Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA are currently looking to divest consumer health businesses.Sanofi, which expects the cost of debt to finance the deal to be around 1 percent, said Ablynx would boost long-term shareholder value, while being neutral for business earnings per share in 2018 and 2019. The Belgian group specializes in the research of novel drugs based on so-called nanobodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas, for which it partners with several of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.EXPERIMENTAL DRUG Sanofi is already one of Ablynx's big pharma partners, after striking a deal in July 2017 to find new treatments for inflammatory diseases.By buying the company outright it will now get access to Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.Brandicourt said caplacizumab would complement Sanofi's line-up of blood products, following the acquisition of Bioverativ and an earlier deal to obtain global rights for fitusiran from Alnylam.Sanofi will be able to use its existing infrastructure and the recently acquired platform from Bioverativ to help to commercialize caplacizumab. It will also benefit from some of the other drugs Ablynx is working on, such as an infant anti-viral treatment, that would not have fitted within Novo Nordisk.Berenberg analysts said Ablynx was a good fit but they estimated the deal would generate no more than a 4 percent return on invested capital, assuming caplacizumab sales of around 400 million euros by 2023.Ablynx itself has forecast peak caplacizumab sales of 1.2 billion euros, but Sanofi said it was too early to comment.The rare blood drug was also the main attraction for Novo Nordisk.The Danish group has sat out previous rounds of M&A in the drugs sector to focus on its core diabetes business but it now needs to find new products for its struggling smaller biopharmaceutical unit, where Ablynx would have been a good fit.That remains a challenge for CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago, and has previously stated that Novo Nordisk needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up.Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters Novo Nordisk would continue to hunt for promising assets to boost its blood products business.Shares in Sanofi were little changed, with pricing considerations offset by relief that Sanofi was finally taking action to improve its drugs portfolio, following its past failure to land big deals.Sanofi lost out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal while JP Morgan advised Ablynx.($1 = 0.8055 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The data will form part of the key last ingredients for the Federal Reserve to decide on its next policy move at its two-day meeting this week.The U.S. central bank is forecast to hold steady on interest rates when it announces its decision on Wednesday, keeping it in a range between 1.25%-1.50%. This week's meeting will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen, before she is replaced by current Fed governor Jerome Powell.Powell is widely anticipated to represent a continuation of policy with the majority of economists forecasting that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another increase in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.Also a key protagonist on this week’s economic calendar, the U.S. Labor Department will release its January nonfarm payrolls report at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT) on Friday.The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 184,000, after rising by 148,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.1%. Most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.3% after gaining 0.3% a month earlier.Ahead of the releases, the U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Monday, recovering somewhat from six straight weeks of losses. At 6:43AM ET (11:43GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.25% to 89.09, extending its rebound from a three-year nadir of 88.25 set on Thursday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked up the benefits of a weaker currency.Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note hit its highest level in almost four years on Monday. Specifically, the 10-year yield rose to an intraday high of 2.724%, a level not seen since April 2014 and was last at 2.718%, up 5.6 basis points, or roughly 2.1% by 6:44AM ET (11:44GMT).The benchmark yield has not been above 3% since late 2013 and some investors believe that level will be tested in the months ahead amid expectations that an economy boosted by tax reform will compel further policy tightening from the Federal Reserve this year.On the earnings front, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be the major focus on Monday in what will be another big week for the fourth quarter reporting season. Heavy-weights such as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), AMD, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) will all release earnings this week.The fourth quarter earnings period has been strong thus far. With 133 of the S&P 500 firms having already reported 81% beat consensus on profit thanks to 18% growth in earnings, while 85% topped sales estimates on 8.5% growth, according to calculations from The Earnings Scout who proclaim these to be the best numbers in five years.Meanwhile, crude oil prices headed lower on Monday, but remained near their strongest levels since 2014. Prices have been supported by optimism that OPEC-led output cuts would continue to drain the market of excess supplies.However, concerns remain that high prices will only push U.S. shale producers to jump into production. In fact, the number of oil drilling rigs climbed by 12 to 759 last week, Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report late Friday. That marked the biggest weekly increase in the rig count since March.U.S. crude futures 0.54% to $65.78 by 6:46AM ET (11:46GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.83% to $69.57.Elsewhere, European stocks struggled in midday trade, showing mixed signs across the major benchmarks as investors digested earnings and kept an eye on merger news.Tech stocks were on the rise, getting a boost from the fact that Swiss chipmaker Ams (SIX:AMS), a key supplier for U.S. giant Apple, reported a doubling of its 2017 revenues and raised its earnings guidance far in excess of expectations.Also grabbing headlines on the Old Continent, French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx (BR:ABLX) for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion), beating  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and marking its second big deal this month after buying Bioverativ.At 6:56AM ET (10:56GMT), the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.74%, Germany’s DAX lost 0.75%, while London's FTSE 100 broke the trend, trading up 0.24%.Earlier, Asian shares closed with mixed signs with benchmarks in Seoul and Australia ending higher, while Shanghai dropped nearly 1% and Tokyo ended flat, supported by a weaker yen."

148,"Jan 29, 2018 01:10AM ET",How Sanofi's setback could lead to better dengue vaccines,nan,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - New dengue vaccines being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd and U.S. government scientists are poised to provide a safer alternative to Sanofi's Dengvaxia, according to vaccine experts, because they already take into account some of the issues that sidelined the product last year.Sanofi (PA:SASY) revealed in November that Dengvaxia - the world's first dengue vaccine - might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus. The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines, where more than 800,000 school-age children had been vaccinated.Next-generation vaccines by Japan's Takeda and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, in conjunction with Brazil's Butantan Institute, are now in late-stage testing. They both differ significantly from Dengvaxia, which may increase the chances for a stronger, more durable immune response, according to more than a dozen dengue experts interviewed by Reuters. They expressed especially high hopes for the NIH vaccine, which protected 100 percent of volunteers who received it in a small study. Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co Inc holds an exclusive license for the NIH vaccine in the United States, Canada, China, Japan and the European Union, and plans to begin its own trials in the first half of 2018.It's too early to say whether either candidate will ultimately succeed, and experts await data from large, late-stage clinical trials.And while Sanofi's early safety troubles may delay licensing of new vaccines for a few years as global regulators seek assurances from longer-term data, the increased scrutiny should result in a better, safer product, they said.""We've learned a tremendous amount about dengue from the Sanofi vaccine,"" said Dr. Anna Durbin, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who helped develop the NIH vaccine. ""There is hope the two candidates coming down the pike can provide the benefit of a good dengue vaccine without the risk.""LESSONS LEARNEDDengue is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide, causing half a million life-threatening infections and killing up to 25,000 people, mostly children, each year. An effective vaccine could be worth more than $1 billion globally, according to industry analysts. There are four distinct types of dengue. A first infection with any one of them can increase the chances of severe disease when exposed to a second. Experts say an effective vaccine must protect against all four types at once. A weak response to one of them could act like a first infection and leave a person vulnerable to severe disease when exposed a second time.That is what appears to have happened with Sanofi's Dengvaxia, according to vaccine experts.""It wasn't a uniformly high level of response to all four subtypes (of dengue) simultaneously,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.Sanofi's late-stage clinical trials, which were designed in 2009, only collected blood samples from 10 to 15 percent of study participants before they were vaccinated. As a result, it was impossible to know when the studies were published in 2015 whether risks were greater in children who had never been exposed to dengue, said Dr. Su-Peing Ng, Sanofi's global medical head, in an interview.To answer this question, Sanofi developed a special test to re-analyze its results, leading to the November 2017 disclosure. ""We've been extremely transparent with our data,"" Ng said, adding that the company consulted with the field's leading experts as it was developing its vaccine.Clinical trials testing the two new vaccines both require blood samples for all participants before they are vaccinated so they can quickly identify any similar risks.Dr. Stephen Whitehead, who developed the NIH vaccine, said in a 2016 review that the long-term follow up from Sanofi's studies ""was instrumental in identifying safety concerns that are currently being investigated.""    IMMUNE RESPONSEDengvaxia uses a widely effective yellow fever virus vaccine as its genetic backbone. To induce an immune response to dengue, certain yellow fever genes were swapped out for dengue genes.""It seemed like a bright idea 20 years ago,"" said dengue expert Dr. Scott Halstead, an adjunct professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.In hindsight, Halstead said, simply splicing select dengue genes into a yellow fever vaccine may not present enough of the virus to the immune system to induce full protection.Instead of yellow fever, Takeda's vaccine, TAK-003, is based on a weakened version of a live dengue 2 virus. ""We've taken a dengue 2 virus backbone and inserted elements of dengue 1, 3 and 4,"" said Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's global vaccine business unit.That's important, Venkayya said, ""because it exposes an individual that is immunized to a broad range of proteins on the outside and the inside of the virus, which allows individuals to generate a broad immune response.""Data published in November in Lancet Infectious Diseases showed Takeda's vaccine produced responses against all four virus types, regardless of previous dengue exposure. There were no safety concerns. Takeda's vaccine is being tested in 20,000 children aged 4 to 16 in Asia and Latin America. Initial data are expected in late 2018.Venkayya said the company's research has shown the vaccine, given in two doses, can produce both antibodies to dengue as well as a second type of response in which immune cells - known as CD8-positive T cells - recognize and kill virus-infected cells.Several researchers suspect exposure to the full spectrum of dengue proteins is key to developing a fully protective vaccine. Johns Hopkins' Durbin said the presence of T-cells triggered by non-structural proteins in dengue 2 could help clear the virus before people become sick. But, like Sanofi's Dengvaxia, the Takeda vaccine appears to produce an unbalanced antibody response, with the highest protection offered against dengue 2. In a July 2017 paper published in Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, Halstead said that it is also not clear whether Takeda's vaccine will provoke T-cell immunity to the other three dengue viruses, clouding its potential to succeed.The NIH vaccine, called TV003/TV005, also features weakened versions of live dengue, but three of the four components - dengue 1, 3 and 4 - are based on whole dengue viruses. The fourth component is based on a dengue 4 backbone with dengue 2 genes spliced in. It has been shown to provoke a strong antibody response to all four types of dengue in a single shot, as well as producing T-cell immunity.""It appears to be a true, protective, one-dose vaccine,"" Halstead said.Brazil's non-profit Butantan Institute is testing the vaccine in some 17,000 participants in 14 areas with widespread dengue. ""Though you never, ever, definitively predict until after everything is completely over, everything we've seen on the preliminary work on that looks pretty good,"" Fauci said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The SEC said the options purchase orders originated through a foreign brokerage firm located in Zurich in the name of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) (Switzerland) Ltd and were cleared through Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, which executed the orders through a domestic options exchange.Bioverativ agreed to be acquired by Sanofi for $105 a share, which represented a premium of 64 percent over Bioverativ's closing share price on the last trading day ahead of the announcement. Its shares closed up 61.9 percent on Jan. 22, the day the deal with Sanofi was announced, the lawsuit noted.The SEC said it seeks an order to freeze the assets of the traders, require the identification of the defendants and the repatriation of assets.

153,"Jan 22, 2018 11:09AM ET",Biotech M&A takes off as Sanofi and Celgene spend $20 billion,nan,"By Ben Hirschler, Sudip Kar-Gupta and Michael Erman(Reuters) - Biotech deal activity exploded on Monday with French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and U.S.-based Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) spending a combined total of more than $20 billion to add new products for hemophilia and cancer to their medicine cabinets.The acquisitions will fuel expectations for a busy year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as large drugmakers snap up promising assets from smaller rivals to help revive growth.Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, while Celgene is paying about $9 billion for the 90 percent of cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics it does not already own.The two cash deals were agreed at a prices of $105 and $87 per share respectively. Shares in Bioverativ leaped 63 percent in early U.S. trading and Juno jumped 27 percent, reflecting the offers, while Sanofi fell 4 percent. Celgene was little changed.Other biotech stocks were driven higher by the takeover news, with rivals to Juno including Bluebird Bio , Sangamo Therapeutics and Cellectis each gaining around 10 percent.""The signs are good for biotech deal activity in 2018,"" said Chris Stirling, head of KPMG's global life sciences practice.Big companies are under pressure from declining sales of older treatments and many are struggling to find sufficient high-value replacements from within their own laboratories, making buying in products and know-how an attractive option.""It takes a long time to introduce technology that makes a significant difference, and in the interim CEOs are looking at any way to get their hands on product where they believe they can make a decent return,"" Stirling said. ""They've got to be seen to be doing things, otherwise they really struggle to convince investors.""Both Sanofi and Celgene had been seen as likely multibillion-dollar acquirers.BUSY STARTThe French group, which faces mounting competition in its key diabetes unit, lost out on buying U.S. cancer firm Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss-based Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.Celgene, meanwhile, needs to dilute its reliance on cancer drug Revlimid. It had been widely tipped as a buyer for Juno, whose technology is at the cutting edge of cancer treatment.Juno is one of several pioneers of a system to modify immune cells to fight tumors and its JCAR017 product is likely to reach the market in 2019, behind rival approval treatments from Novartis and Gilead.Gilead only recently jumped into the space after acquiring Kite Pharma last year for $12 billion in one of the few standout deals during a relatively subdued year for biotech M&A.Despite the late start, Celgene believes JCAR017 could have peak annual sales of $3 billion and it sees the acquisition being ""incrementally additive"" to net product sales in 2020. Following setbacks at Juno, Celgene is paying less than the $93 a share it stumped up for just under 10 percent of the company in 2015. Sanofi expects Bioverativ, which was spun off from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) last year, can deliver commercial success despite rapid changes in the $10 billion hemophilia market posed by a novel drug from Roche and the potential of gene therapy to provide a one-time cure.Those changes have spooked some investors but Sanofi is betting that the factor replacement therapies made by Bioverativ will remain the standard of care for many years and it expects the deal to boost earnings immediately.Monday's two big acquisitions build on an already busy start for 2018 biotech M&A, with Celgene earlier agreeing to acquire privately-held Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, including $1.1 billion upfront, and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) bidding $3.1 billion for Belgium's Ablynx.Separate reports this month by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predicted a significant rise in life sciences M&A in 2018, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies' appetite for deals.Lazard advised Sanofi on its deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan worked for Bioverativ. J.P. Morgan also worked for Celgene and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) for Juno.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

154,"Jan 22, 2018 08:30AM ET",New drugs recast $10 billion hemophilia market as Sanofi swoops in,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) is placing a big bet on the $10 billion-a-year hemophilia market at a testing time, as scientific advances overhaul traditional approaches to treating the rare uncontrolled bleeding disorder.The French drugmaker's decision to buy U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion exposes it to competition from Roche's new drug Hemlibra and looming threats from gene therapy. It also offers a potential launchpad for Sanofi's own experimental medicine fitusiran.Patients with the genetic blood disorder have traditionally depended on receiving factor replacement therapies, sometimes as often as every other day.Today that standard approach to therapy is changing with the development of long-acting treatments - of which Bioverativ's Eloctate and Alprolix are successful examples - and other non-factor approaches.Roche's recently approved Hemlibra will shake up the market by providing a once-weekly antibody injection for patients with hemophilia A who have developed inhibitors, or resistance, to other treatments.And several drug companies hope to take things to a whole new level with gene therapy, in which a harmless virus is used to introduce DNA to fix the faulty genes behind the disease, offering a possible one-off cure.Excitement about the potential of gene therapy has been spurred by recent promising clinical trial data from the likes of Biomarin and Spark Therapeutics, prompting the New England Journal of Medicine to declare in an editorial last month that a cure was ""within reach"". The recasting of the hemophilia landscape poses a threat to players reliant on factor replacement therapies, notably market leader Shire, which has been out of favor since buying hemophilia specialist Baxalta two years ago.Also being challenged by new hemophilia medicines are Bayer (DE:BAYGN), CSL and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), the last of which has responded by trying to buy Ablynx to shore up its own blood disease business.Bioverativ's factor-dependent business is also at risk, although its longer-acting products, which are sold in Europe by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, give it a relative advantage.Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt argues that factor replacement therapy will remain the standard of care for many years, given its established safety profile and the advances Bioverativ has made with long-acting products.He is also banking on Bioverativ to leverage commercialization of fitusiran, a new kind of so-called RNA interference treatment for hemophilia A and B that Sanofi is developing with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.However, despite a solid strategic rationale and a predicted boost to earnings,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said Brandicourt's decision to invest in an ""out-of-favor therapy area"" would detract from investor enthusiasm.Sanofi shares fell more than 3 percent on Monday after the company announced its acquisition of Bioverativ, while Kepler Chevreux said the parallel with Shire's unpopular acquisition of Baxalta raised ""a host of questions"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sanofi has agreed to buy all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for $105 per share in cash, marking a premium of 64 percent to Bioverativ's closing price on January 19.Bioverativ, a maker of haemophilia drugs, was separated from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc early last year.The agreed transaction marks Sanofi's successful return to deal-making after its failure to land major takeovers in recent years. It is its biggest acquisition since the 2011 takeover of U.S. biotech company Genzyme for around $20 billion.Sanofi lost out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.""With Bioverativ, we welcome a leader in the growing haemophilia market,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said.The market dealing with treatments for haemophilia is an important one that is evolving rapidly as new drugs change the landscape. Further ahead, gene therapy promises to disrupt traditional approaches to tackling the inherited condition.Sanofi said the sector had around $10 billion in annual sales, dealing with 181,000 people affected worldwide. It added that haemophilia represented the largest market for rare diseases and was set to grow by more than 7 percent per year through to 2022. MORE DEALS?Sanofi expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its business earnings per share in the full 2018 financial year and up to 5 percent accretive for the following year.However, some analysts questioned the cost.""Bioverativ looks a relatively expensive acquisition. It is logical in terms of building around Sanofi's presence and pipeline in rare diseases and haemophilia, though management may have to argue against concerns on competition,"" analysts with Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.""The obvious parallel is Shire's highly unpopular acquisition of Baxalta; but Sanofi's 2011 acquisition of rare disease specialist Genzyme was also unpopular at the time, yet has it turned into a major success story,"" analysts with Kepler said.Sanofi added it would fund the takeover with a mixture of existing cash resources and a debt issue.""We have the means to make further takeovers,"" added Brandicourt on a conference call, without going into further details.Brandicourt has said in the past he was ready to do deals of a similar size to the $20 billion purchase of Genzyme to help accelerate growth at France's biggest drugmaker. One asset analysts and bankers believe could be of interest is Pfizer's consumer health unit, although competition for this business is likely to be fierce. Sanofi said it expected to achieve a return on its invested capital (ROIC) in excess of the cost of capital within three years. The French group also expects to preserve its strong credit rating.This month Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) agreed to pay up to $7 billion to take over Impact Biomedicines and the U.S. company is also said to be circling Juno Therapeutics.In Europe,  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) has offered $3.1 billion for Ablynx and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical plans to buy TiGenix for $630 million.The spate of deal-making follows a relatively subdued 2017 for biotech M&A.Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P.

163,"Dec 13, 2017 07:10PM ET",Bumper crop of new drugs fails to lift big pharma R&D returns,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - It is shaping up to be a bumper year for drug approvals, with U.S. officials clearing twice as many novel medicines as in 2016, yet returns on research investment at leading pharmaceutical companies are down.In fact, projected returns at 12 of the world's top drugmakers have fallen to an eight-year low of only 3.2 percent, consultancy Deloitte said on Thursday.The disconnect reflects the rising cost of developing new drugs, meager peak sales expectations for individual products and the fact that younger biotechnology companies are accounting for a growing proportion of new products.So far this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, gatekeeper to the world's biggest drugs market, has approved 41 novel drugs compared with 22 for the whole of 2016. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2hGom21) The strong biotech sector is good news for investors like Daniel Koller, head of investment management at Swiss-based BB Biotech, which has money tied up in fast-growing U.S. and European companies.""It's been a great year for approvals in 2017 and we assume another very positive year for biotech in 2018,"" he told Reuters. ""It is a confirmation of the health of the industry.""But for the giants of the pharma world tracked by Deloitte, things are not so rosy. This decade has seen shrinking profitability in their research labs, with the average internal rate of return (IRR) down sharply from 10.1 percent in 2010 to 3.2 percent this year.A separate group of four large biotech companies are projected to enjoy an IRR nearly four times higher at 11.9 percent. The calculations are based on long-term sales forecasts.""The biotech companies are seeing more success,"" said Mark Steedman, one of the report's authors.Steedman said biotechs typically had a leaner cost structure, although there were signs of big pharma beginning to streamline R&D operations and deploy new technologies in drug discovery, such as artificial intelligence.""There are reasons for optimism,"" he said. ""It's going to take a little bit of time but we the think the impact could be monumental in terms of increasing productivity.""$2 BILLION PER DRUGToday, the average cost of bringing a new drug to market at a large company is nearly $2 billion, up from $1.2 billion in 2010, while forecast annual peak sales per drug have fallen from $816 million in 2010 to $465 million.The figures highlight a dilemma as R&D resources are shifted from mass-market treatments to more specialist therapy areas.This year's haul of new drugs does include some likely blockbusters designed for relatively wide use, such as Roche's multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus and Novo Nordisk's Ozempic for diabetes. But many new drugs are for rare diseases, including very specific sub-types of cancer.A few are truly ground-breaking, such as the first gene-modified cell therapy against a type of leukemia from Novartis, and next year is expected to see the first U.S. approval of a gene therapy for a rare inherited eye condition. Such pioneering drugs come at a huge price, with Novartis' cell therapy Kymriah costing $475,000, while gene therapy could fetch around $1 million per patient.""The insights from human genetics and the insights from an understanding of the immune system are finally being translated in medicines, and very new technologies are now starting to pay off,"" Roche CEO Severin Schwan said in a recent interview.The 12 big drugmakers analyzed in the Deloitte study were  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Roche, Novartis, Sanofi (PA:SASY), GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), AstraZeneca, Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).The four large biotech companies were Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and AbbVie.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

164,"Dec 12, 2017 09:30PM ET","Did Sanofi, WHO ignore warning signals on dengue vaccine?",nan,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Ben HirschlerCHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - When French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) published the results of clinical trials of children given its dengue vaccine two years ago, the overall findings were that it protected against the world's biggest and fastest growing mosquito-borne disease.But the trial also showed that in the third year after receiving the Dengvaxia inoculation, younger children were more likely to end up in hospital with a severe case of dengue than those who didn't get the vaccine.The study's authors cited two main possibilities: the children had immature immune systems that made the vaccine less protective, or the vaccine itself made them more susceptible to severe disease if they had never had dengue and later became infected.More than two years later, it turns out the latter was the primary factor - a revelation at the end of last month that has triggered alarm among hundreds of thousands of anxious parents in the Philippines, where the vaccine has been given to over 830,000 children.It has also torpedoed initial expectations by analysts and the company that Dengvaxia, the first dengue vaccine to be developed, might become a $1 billion-a-year blockbuster product. Sanofi says it will take a charge of around 100 million euros ($118 million) for the fourth quarter.Initially, to address the issue seen in younger children, Sanofi had recommended that the vaccine only be given to those aged 9 and older in areas where the disease was widespread. The World Health Organization analyzed Sanofi's data and came to the same conclusion. It made a conditional recommendation to use the vaccine.But after a new analysis of data from the trials, Sanofi confirmed last month the vaccine could increase the risk of severe dengue in some cases in people who had not been previously exposed to the disease. The WHO has now backed a decision by the Philippines government to suspend a mass immunization program and said it has begun reviewing safety data.In Sanofi's large-scale trials, blood samples were not collected from all the children before they were vaccinated, which would have identified prior exposure to the disease by showing the presence of antibodies.""The development process around the first dengue vaccine led to a degree of momentum and judgments being made that we should learn lessons from,"" Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College London and an unpaid adviser to both Sanofi and the WHO, told Reuters.The case raises questions whether Sanofi and the WHO, in their pursuit of a new weapon to fight a deadly disease, should have foreseen the risk. Their decisions on how the vaccine was rolled out could set back efforts to combat dengue by a generation, some disease experts say.REJECTED SUGGESTIONSSanofi has rejected suggestions it ignored any risks or took any short-cuts. However, it has acknowledged that clinical tests of the vaccine did not fully investigate whether a previous dengue infection could influence the outcome. ""When you are the first in class, we're the ones having to develop and understand the science as we go,"" said Dr. Su-Peing Ng, the global medical head of Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of the drugmaker. ""We don't have another vaccine to follow the lead on. ""The findings we have today, we would have loved to have (earlier),"" she told Reuters. ""Now that we have these findings, of course it's our responsibility again to ... share this information.""The protocols for the tests, devised in 2009, were ""thoroughly vetted by many dengue experts, including with WHO's technical advisory group and various regulators"", Ng added.The WHO said it acted promptly to address concerns when they arose. It has also said its recommendations on use of Dengvaxia were conditional and confined to children aged 9 and older in areas where dengue was endemic.Complicating matters, scientists were sharply divided about the risks of the vaccine.Four decades ago, Dr. Scott Halstead, a leading figure in dengue research, first proposed that antibodies from an initial exposure to one of four types of the disease could increase the risk of a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue when a person was infected a second time, a process know as antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE. This phenomenon could make development of a dengue vaccine tricky. Rather than being protective, a shot given to someone who had never had dengue could act like a first infection, increasing their risk of severe dengue when they were exposed a second time. Halstead, an adjunct professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, said when he saw Sanofi's 2015 paper, he was convinced the increased risk that some children would contract severe dengue was evidence of ADE. Halstead wrote a series of papers published in Vaccine, the Journal of Infectious Diseases and other journals urging Sanofi and the WHO to proceed with caution in rolling out the vaccine. ""It was not obvious to Sanofi and the World Health Organization, but it was obvious to me,"" he told Reuters.CONDITIONAL GUIDANCE Dr. Joachim Hombach, senior health adviser in WHO's vaccine department, said he understood Halstead's concerns but the organization could only work with data generated by research.He told Reuters that WHO ""strongly encouraged"" Sanofi to conduct follow-up studies to clarify whether children who had never had dengue before being vaccinated were more prone to severe dengue. ""It was recognized it was something that would be important to follow as part of our long-term program,"" said Sanofi's Ng. ""This is exactly what we've done with our recent analysis.""In the end, WHO issued its conditional guidance on Dengvaxia in July, 2016, after a year of deliberations, favoring use of the vaccine only in countries with a high burden of dengue, and stipulated that it only be given to children aged 9 and older. Ferguson, at Imperial College, also raised concerns about the vaccine in a paper published in the journal Science in September 2016, suggesting the vaccine could increase severe dengue in some places with low transmission of dengue. But until last month, many other scientists were on the fence about whether the signals in Sanofi's trials were evidence of true ADE.""I'm not sure it was nailed down until now,"" Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity who has served on WHO's working group on dengue vaccines, told Reuters. A paper in PLOS Medicine in November 2016 described a ""split"" among dengue experts between those like Farrar who supported the WHO recommendations on cautious use of Dengvaxia and those such as Halstead who said it was too risky. To do the follow-up study, Sanofi had to solve a major problem. The company said it had only collected blood samples that would have revealed prior exposure to dengue in 10 percent of the more than 30,000 children in its clinical trials before they had been vaccinated. Sanofi did have blood samples from nearly all of the children but only after they had been vaccinated. So it would be hard to tell from those samples whether the antibodies in their blood were produced in response to a natural dengue infection or the vaccine itself.Responding to questions from Reuters, the company said in an email it would have been considered 'unethical' to take blood samples from all the kids prior to vaccination, because there wasn't a clear reason to do so when it set up the protocols for the trial.SHEER MOMENTUMIn 2014, Sanofi had entered into a scientific collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh Center for Vaccine Research to measure responses to the vaccine in its trials. At the time, the company had no reason to suspect that the vaccine would increase risks in children who had never had dengue, Ng said, but this test ultimately proved critical in allowing the company to differentiate those who had been infected before vaccination from those who had not. That test only became ready to use this past July, said Dr. Ernesto Marques, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, who helped develop the test. Sanofi used the test to re-analyze blood samples collected in its trials and alerted public health officials last month that there was an increased risk of severe dengue in people who had not been previously infected, even among the children 9 and older who had been recommended for the vaccine. By the time Sanofi announced findings from its follow-up study at the end of last month, the vaccine had been given to over 830,000 children in the Philippines, and about 300,000 people in Brazil. One factor in decision-making was the sheer momentum behind the project, said Ferguson, the unpaid adviser, referring to the surge in the incidence of dengue and the fact that Dengvaxia was the first vaccine developed to contain the disease. The WHO says dengue is now endemic in more than 100 countries, up from 9 countries before 1970.

165,"Dec 12, 2017 06:50AM ET",Sanofi investors hungry for drug progress and deal news,nan,"By Matthias BlamontPARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) still needs to convince markets it can deliver on an exciting and sustainable growth path as it contends with fresh difficulties in its vaccines arm and looks set for another gloomy year in diabetes, investors told Reuters.The French drugmaker holds an ""innovation day"" on Wednesday to discuss its pipeline of new drugs while it attempts to overcome fallout from a safety row in the Philippines over its dengue vaccine.Already irked by the lack of a large acquisition since Olivier Brandicourt was appointed as chief executive in 2015, some investors are losing patience that has been stretched for months.Shares in Sanofi are trading close to a 10-month low and are down more than 4 percent this year after a 2.2 percent decline last year.Over the past five years they have lagged the sector, rising about 3 percent against a 49 percent gain for the STOXX Europe 600 Healthcare index (SXDP).""Nothing is happening in terms of business development and there is very little news in the pipeline. What just happened with dengue is negative and shocking,"" said Rudi Van Den Eynde, of asset management firm Candriam. DENGVAXIA BLOW The Philippines suspended a national immunization program last week after Sanofi's recent findings that its Dengvaxia vaccine could, in some cases, increase the risk of severe dengue in recipients not previously infected by the virus.Manila launched an investigation and halted the sale of the medication.Once touted out as a potential $1 billion-a-year blockbuster product, Dengvaxia's initial sales last year were only 55 million euros ($65 million) and industry analysts have been dialing back expectations.The Dengvaxia blow follows two other snags at Sanofi Pasteur, the group's vaccines unit.The division ended the development of an experimental vaccine for clostridium difficile infection this month and pulled out of a Zika vaccine program with the U.S. military this summer.PRESSURE AHEADLast month Sanofi said that currency-adjusted sales at its diabetes franchise were likely to have shrunk by 6-8 percent a year between 2015 and 2018 after third-quarter results below expectations.It had previously forecast a 4-8 percent drop owing to persistent pricing pressure in the United States, the world's largest healthcare market, where its blockbuster insulin drug Lantus has lost its patent. ""What is frustrating is that we constantly feel Sanofi is one step behind the competition,"" another London-based investor said, asking not to be named.""We are not expecting anything magical during the innovation day. Management is likely to talk at length about its monoclonal antibody candidate in multiple myeloma, isatuximab, but  Genmab  (CO:GEN) and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (N:JNJ) already have a drug on the market, Darzalex, that sells well.""NO CHEAP TARGETS Sanofi has said several times this year that it has felt no urge to engage in a large acquisition and that investors were lauding its financial discipline.The group has, however, failed to land major deals after losing California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (N:PFE) in 2016 and Swiss biotech company Actelion to U.S. drugmaker J&J in January.""Looking back, Sanofi would maybe have overpayed for Medivation. In that regard, their discipline is healthy, yet we see that the company is struggling at laying out a strategy and getting us excited,"" Moneta Asset Management's Gregoire Uettwiller said.Moneta and Candriam are both long-term investors with small stakes in Sanofi of around 0.1 percent, Reuters data shows.Candriam's Van Den Eynde, meanwhile, says Sanofi needs to shed its qualms about splashing out on a big deal. ""Once you see that your pipeline is not paying off, you cannot be naive, you must engage in M&A,"" Van Den Eynde said.""Hiding behind the fact that targets are expensive is not doing it. In the modern world, no interesting firm will be available at low valuations.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

166,"Dec 10, 2017 10:32PM ET",Exclusive: Philippines defied experts' advice in pursuing dengue immunization program,nan,"By Tom Allard and Karen LemaMANILA (Reuters) - As she announced in January 2016 that the Philippines would immunize one million children with a new dengue vaccine, the nation's then health secretary Janette Garin boasted it was a world-first and a tribute to her country's ""expertise"" in research.At the time, it seemed the Philippines could be on the cusp of a breakthrough to combat a potentially lethal tropical virus that had been endemic in large parts of the Southeast Asian nation for decades.Almost two years later, the program lies in tatters and has been suspended after Sanofi (PA:SASY) Pasteur, a division of French drug firm Sanofi, said at the end of last month the vaccine itself may in some cases increase the risk of severe dengue in recipients not previously infected by the virus.Documents reviewed by Reuters that have not been disclosed until now, as well as interviews with local experts, show that key recommendations made by a Philippines Department of Health (DOH) advisory body of doctors and pharmacologists were not heeded before the program was rolled out to 830,000 children.After Garin's announcement, the Formulary Executive Council (FEC) of advisers urged caution over the vaccine because it said its safety and cost-effectiveness had not been established.After twice meeting in January, the panel approved the state's purchase of the vaccine on Feb 1, 2016 but recommended stringent conditions, minutes of all three meetings show.""Based on the available scientific evidence presented to the Council, there is still a need to establish long-term safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"" the FEC told Garin in a letter on that day. The letter was reviewed by Reuters.The FEC said Dengvaxia should be introduced through small-scale pilot tests and phased implementation rather than across three regions in the country at the same time, and only after a detailed ""baseline"" study of the prevalence and strains of dengue in the targeted area, the FEC letter and minutes of the meetings said.The experts also recommended that Dengvaxia be bought in small batches so the price could be negotiated down. An economic evaluation report commissioned by Garin's own department had found the proposed cost of 1,000 pesos ($21.29) per dose was ""not cost-effective"" from a public payer perspective, the minutes from the meetings reveal. For reasons that Reuters was unable to determine, these recommendations were ignored.""VERY ANGRY""The DOH purchased 3 million doses of Dengvaxia in one lot, enough for the required three vaccinations for each child in the proposed immunization program and paid 1,000 pesos per dose, a copy of the purchase order reviewed by Reuters shows.It did conduct a ""limited baseline study"" in late February and March 2016, but the survey looked at ""common illnesses"" rather than the prevalence of dengue, according to guidelines issued by Garin's office at the time and reviewed by Reuters.Garin, who was part of the government of former president Benigno Aquino and replaced when President Rodrigo Duterte took power in June, 2016, did not respond to requests for comment on why she ignored the local experts' recommendations.A physician, Garin has defended her conduct and a program that she said was ""implemented in accordance with WHO guidance and recommendations"".""I understand the concern,"" she told Philippine TV station ABS-CBN on Friday. ""Even us, we're also very angry when we learned about Sanofi's announcement about severe dengue. I'm also a mother. My child was also vaccinated. I was also vaccinated.""DOH spokesman Lyndon Lee Suy also did not respond to text messages or questions emailed to him.Sanofi Philippines declined comment on the Philippines government decision. However, Dr. Su-Peing Ng, Global Medical Head of Sanofi Pasteur, told Reuters: ""We communicated all known benefits and risks of the vaccine to the Philippines government."" Rontgene Solante, former president of the Philippines Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, said health officials were motivated to end the debilitating impact of dengue on the Philippines, where there are about 200,000 reported cases each year and many more unreported.Over 1,000 people died of the disease in the country last year.Two months after the FEC wrote to the health secretary, the DOH began immunizing one million students around the age of 10 in all three target areas in April 2016, in accordance with its original plan but at odds with the FEC's recommendations to conduct a slow roll-out of the vaccine. ""The usual process for the DOH that has protected our children for so many decades was not followed. That's a fact,"" said Susan Mercado, a former Philippines health department undersecretary and former senior official at the World Health Organization (WHO).WHO said in April 2016 that the Philippines' campaign appeared to meet its criteria for using Dengvaxia because the targeted regions had high levels of dengue exposure; the vaccine would be provided to children 9 years and older; and they would each receive three doses.WHO was not involved in the deliberations of the FEC, according to the minutes. It said in a statement last week that a position paper on the dengue vaccine it published in July 2016 did not include a recommendation for countries to introduce it. Now, after Sanofi's warnings, WHO has said it agrees with the government's decision to suspend the immunization program.SHOULDN'T IGNORE EXPERTISEThe current secretary of health in the Duterte administration, Francisco Duque, said he would carry out a ""thorough analysis"" of the FEC's recommendations and the program before passing judgment. He said the Council's recommendations were not legally enforceable.""At the end of the day, the final decision is made by (the)secretary of health,"" he told Reuters. ""But because of the expertise that the members of the FEC have, it is something that you don't want to ignore.""Underpinning the concerns in 2016 about Dengvaxia, since confirmed by Sanofi, were fears that the vaccine would act like a primary infection for those who had never had dengue.If they were bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus after the vaccination, it could be akin to getting dengue a second time, which often leads to far more severe symptoms and potentially death if bad cases are not treated quickly.The concerns were first raised by noted U.S.-based tropical disease expert, Dr. Scott Halstead, who urged both Sanofi and the WHO to proceed with caution.In the Philippines, Dr. Antonio Dans, an epidemiologist from the University of the Philippines, led a delegation of physicians to the DOH in March 2016 where, citing Halstead's research, they pressed for the campaign to be aborted.""The data was not definitive but it was clear there were uncertainties and risks. Why not wait for the complete studies to be finished before endangering so many children?"" Dans told Reuters.In a Senate hearing late last year, Garin said she was aware of Halstead's assessment but dismissed it. ""This is a theory ... it has not been proven,"" she said at the time.FEAR AND CONFUSIONTwo sources involved in the program said no antibody testing was undertaken, as recommended by the FEC. Antibody testing, while not 100 percent accurate, indicates whether an individual has had dengue before.Duque, the current health secretary, is demanding the company refund the 3 billion pesos ($60 million) paid for the vaccinations and has threatened legal action against Sanofi if it is proven to have withheld information.A criminal probe is underway into how a danger to public health came about and two Congressional inquiries have been convened in the Philippines.Duque told Reuters he was concerned that the program was paid from an ""off-budget"" allocation, meaning it bypassed Congressional scrutiny. Reuters was unable to confirm this.Until now, one child out of the 830,000 vaccinated, a girl who was hospitalized with severe dengue, has been linked definitively by the DOH to the campaign. But the department of health says it still does not have complete data on those who fell ill after taking Dengvaxia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

169,"Dec 04, 2017 06:09AM ET","Philippines orders probe into Sanofi dengue vaccine for 730,000 children",nan,"By Manolo Serapio Jr and Neil Jerome MoralesMANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines ordered a probe on Monday into the immunization of more than 730,000 children with a vaccine for dengue that has been suspended following an announcement by French drug company Sanofi (PA:SASY) that it could worsen the disease in some cases.Amid mounting public concern, Sanofi explained its ""new findings"" at a news conference in Manila, but it did not say why action was not taken after a World Health Organization (WHO) report in mid-2016 that identified the risk it was now flagging.A non-governmental organization (NGO) said it had received information that three children who were vaccinated with Dengvaxia had died and a senator said he was aware of two cases.However, Department of Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo told Reuters that the three referred to by the NGO died due to causes not related to the vaccine, and Sanofi said no deaths had been reported as a result of the program.""As far as we know, as far as we are made aware, there are no reported deaths that are related to dengue vaccination,"" said Ruby Dizon, medical director at Sanofi Pasteur Philippines.Last week, the Philippines Department of Health halted the use of Dengvaxia after Sanofi said it must be strictly limited due to evidence it can worsen the disease in people not previously exposed to the infection.In a statement, Sanofi said the long-term safety evaluation of the vaccines showed significantly fewer hospitalizations due to dengue in vaccinated people over 9 years old compared with those who had not been vaccinated.Nearly 734,000 children aged 9 and over in the Philippines have received one dose of the vaccine as part of a program that cost 3.5 billion pesos ($69.54 million).The Department of Justice on Monday ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to look into ""the alleged danger to public health ... and if evidence so warrants, to file appropriate charges thereon.""There was no indication that Philippines health officials knew of any risks when they administered the vaccination.However, the WHO said in a July 2016 research paper that ""vaccination may be ineffective or may theoretically even increase the future risk of hospitalized or severe dengue illness in those who are seronegative at the time of first vaccination regardless of age."" Singapore's Health Sciences Authority said last week that it flagged risks when Dengvaxia was approved there in October 2016, and was working with Sanofi to strengthen risk warnings on the drug's packaging.According to Sanofi in Manila, 19 licenses were granted for Dengvaxia, and it was launched in 11 countries, two of which – the Philippines and Brazil – had public vaccination programs.""A SHAMELESS SCAM""A spokesman for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday the government would hold to account those responsible for the program.""We will leave no stone unturned in making those responsible for this shameless public health scam, which puts hundreds of thousands of young lives at risk, accountable,"" spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement.Former Health Secretary Janette Garin, who implemented the program under the administration of then-President Benigno Aquino, said she welcomed the investigation.""In the event that there will be authorities who will point culpability to me, I am ready to face the consequences,"" she told ANC TV. ""We implemented it in accordance with WHO guidance and recommendations.""Roque said there had been no reported case of ""severe dengue infection"" since the vaccine was administered and urged the public ""not to spread information that may cause undue alarm"".Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, an NGO, said it was checking a report that three children on the northern island of Luzon had died since being vaccinated in April 2016, but the Department of Health said the deaths were not due to Dengvaxia.""When we evaluated the clinical records, it was not related to the dengue vaccination,"" Undersecretary Bayugo said.A prominent senator, Richard Gordon, told Reuters he was aware of two deaths - but gave no details - and said approval and procurement for the program was done with ""undue haste"". Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease. Although it is not as serious as malaria, it is spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, killing about 20,000 people a year and infecting hundreds of millions.While Sanofi's Dengvaxia is the first-ever approved vaccine for dengue, scientists already recognized it was not perfect and did not protect equally against the four different types of the virus in clinical tests.A new analysis from six years of clinical data showed that Dengvaxia vaccine provides persistent protective benefit against dengue fever in those who had prior infection.But for those not previously infected by the virus, more cases of severe disease could occur in the long term following vaccination, Sanofi said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But several Democratic lawmakers questioned whether he would tackle changes that cut into pharmaceutical profits.If confirmed, Azar also would take the lead in implementing Trump's campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare overhaul that extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said Trump's pick of a former pharmaceutical executive was ""like a fox guarding the hen house.""Trump, who is in the Philippines on a diplomatic trip, announced the nomination on Twitter by saying Azar would ""be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.""Trump's first health secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned in September amid a public furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel. Azar worked at Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and Co for a decade, including five years as president of its Lilly USA unit, and left the company in January, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page. Cummings and Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, last year called for a federal probe into whether Eli Lilly, Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) and  Novo Nordisk  A/S (CO:NOVOb) colluded to set prices on insulin and other diabetes drugs.""This is a slap in the face to millions of Americans who are waiting on (the President) to take action to lower drug prices,"" Cummings wrote on Twitter. He also pointed to Eli Lilly raising drug prices by double digits while Azar was an executive at the company.Azar, though a spokesman, declined to comment.Other Democrats were more cautious in their response to Trump's announcement, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for the health agency to turn over a new leaf with Azar.Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who has been working on bipartisan healthcare legislation, tweeted, ""Given Alex Azar's professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families.""Republicans were supportive with Senate health committee head Lamar Alexander of Tennessee describing Azar as a qualified, experienced nominee.Azar also drew praise from PhRMA, the largest pharmaceutical industry trade group and America's Health Insurance Plans, the key lobbyist for the insurer industry.Azar served several years on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobbying group, and earlier was general counsel and deputy secretary for Health and Human Services under former Republican President George W. Bush.Patient advocacy organization Public Citizen said Azar has made it clear he is opposed to measures ""to restrain prescription companies' profiteering and limit improper marketing"" and that he favors weaker safety approval standards.As head of HHS, Azar would have oversight responsibility for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the drug industry including approving new treatments. Azar's nomination must be approved by the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

176,"Oct 31, 2017 01:02PM ET",Pfizer Consumer Unit's Sales Fall Ahead of Divestiture Call,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales fell for a third straight quarter at the consumer-products business that  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) may offload, a slump that could pressure the price that the drug giant could get for the division. The drugmaker plans to decide next year what to do with the consumer business, which sells brands including Advil, ChapStick, Centrum. The decision could impact a bigger, later deal that investors have been speculating about since Pfizer’s failed attempts to buy Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc and AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN).While third-quarter adjusted earnings of 67 cents beat the 65 cents average of analysts’ estimates, Pfizer’s quarterly results have been overshadowed by speculation about its larger strategic plans.“We see nothing remarkable about the quarter either way and believe the market will be most focused on management M&A commentary,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies. He has a hold rating on the shares.At the consumer unit, third-quarter sales dropped to $829 million from $846 million in the previous three months.Drugs PerformanceIts pharmaceutical business -- which makes up more than 90 percent of the company’s sales -- is doing better. Sales from its innovative health segment, which includes the company’s newest drugs, rose 11 percent from a year prior. The New York-based drugmaker raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to $2.58 to $2.62 a share.Holford mentioned Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. as the target on investors’ minds. Bristol-Myers has been at the center of takeover speculation as it awaits data from a highly-anticipated lung cancer trial, and analysts have mentioned Pfizer as a potential suitor. Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said the drugmaker needs clarity about U.S. tax reform in order to figure out which potential targets are worth buying.Pfizer shares were up 0.3 percent to $35.25 at 8:11 a.m. in New York.The company’s biggest challenge may be its own size, and finding ways to replace past blockbusters that are losing patent protection, like the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. Pfizer has made a number of large deals, such as the $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016, to add new assets, though none as large as the failed attempts for AstraZeneca or Allergan.There are several potential buyers who could value the consumer unit at around $13 billion to $17 billion, according to Rosie Edwards, an analyst with Berenberg. Companies like  Reckitt Benckiser  Group Plc (LON:RB), Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have been mentioned by analysts as possible suitors.Pfizer plans to start the auction for the sale of its consumer business in November, Reuters reported last week. GlaxoSmithKline CEO Emma Walmsley told reporters last week that she plans to take a look at the consumer business. Reckitt Benckiser has also expressed interest, according to Reuters.(Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)"
177,"Oct 25, 2017 02:42PM ET",Exclusive: Pfizer to launch consumer health sale in November - sources,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Martinne Geller and Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) -  Pfizer  (N:PFE) plans to kick off an auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November, paving the way for a potential $15 billion-plus sale of the headache pill to lip balm business, sources close to the matter told Reuters.Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit.But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year.GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look ""carefully"" at the business. Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi (N:C) to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available.Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble (N:PG), Sanofi (PA:SASY), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Nestle (S:NESN), several sources said.Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said. The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said.Germany's Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan (N:JPM) to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins.Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction.One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick.As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.But the industry remains fragmented and GSK's Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a ""consolidator"".Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group.GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs.For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer's strategic review resulted in a sale.Nestle could also enter the fight and use the Pfizer consumer business as a platform to expand the intersection of food and healthcare, sources said. The Swiss group has previously identified consumer healthcare as a sector of interest.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

180,"Oct 19, 2017 02:20AM ET",China biotech's 'coming out party' masks long road ahead,nan,"By Ben Hirschler and Adam JourdanLONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors are betting on China's potential to feed the global pharmaceutical pipeline, putting a multi-billion-dollar price tag on a handful of stocks, even as the country struggles to close a huge R&D gap with the West.Shares in firms such as Chi-Med, Beigene and Zai Lab have soared on international markets this year, fueled by hopes for their drugs and recent reforms to China's regulatory system that should speed up approvals.""It's almost a coming out party for China biotech,"" said Christian Hogg, chief executive of Hutchison China MediTech or Chi-Med, which presented promising data at a global medical congress this week on a lung cancer drug it discovered in China and is developing with AstraZeneca.""China is in vogue because of the positive moves on the regulatory side, as well as advances at companies. It's a big, big change versus 10 years ago and it is accelerating.""Importantly, national and provincial authorities are also moving faster to agree payments for innovative drugs, albeit after negotiating price discounts in many cases.Yet amid the euphoria it is easy to lose sight of the fact that China still has far to go. It contributes just 4 percent of global drug innovation - as measured by the number of products in development and recent launches - against 50 percent from the United States, according to an October 2016 report from four Chinese pharmaceutical associations.""It is very apparent they are trying to transition to being more of a novel drug development environment and bring in more innovative research,"" Scott Gottlieb, head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), told Reuters. ""I think it's going to be a long transition ... we built up an ecosystem in this country over decades and decades.""China's traditional strengths lie in generic drugs and the bulk production of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are found in pills in pharmacies worldwide.The shift in focus to original research is a change in mindset, although it builds on the success of contract research and manufacturing company WuXi Biologics, which does much of the legwork for China's budding biotechs. REFORMING DRUGS WATCHDOGBi Jingquan, the reformist bureaucrat who has led China's drugs watchdog the CFDA since 2015, views innovative - and affordable - drugs as the key to meeting the country's growing clinical demands.China is now the world's second-biggest drugs market after the United States, with more cases of cancer and diabetes than any other nation, fueled by fast food, smoking and pollution.But the CFDA head lamented in a recent speech that Chinese domestic drug industry R&D investment was only 42 billion yuan ($6.3 billion) last year, a small slice of the $157 billion spent worldwide by drug companies in 2016, according to market intelligence group EvaluatePharma.Redressing the balance is a priority.""We want to make our pharma industry big and strong, make our drug companies more competitive, so that we can shift our country's long-standing reliance on imported new drugs,"" said Bi Jingquan's deputy Wu Zhen.A big part of that involves overhauling regulation, with a new system now in place to accelerate full and conditional drug approvals as the CFDA strives to narrow a typical five to seven year lag between how long new drugs reach the market in China compared with Western countries.Plans announced last week mean the agency will now accept data from overseas clinical trials. That was applauded by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), the top foreign drugmaker in China, highlighting the stiff competition still facing local biotechs.So far many of the new drugs discovered in China are follow-on medicines in established therapeutic classes rather than ground-breaking first-in-class treatments.Some global companies like Swiss-based Novartis and Roche, with deeper institutional scientific knowledge, are also tapping into China's science base to discover their own promising new drugs in the country.Still, Chinese firms are notching up their first home-grown successes, particularly in cancer, with Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences winning a CFDA green light for the first modern oncology drug, used to treat a rare lymph-node cancer, in 2015. Now Chi-Med, working with Eli Lilly, hopes for approval of what would be a broad-use bowel cancer medicine, fruquintinib, around the end of this year.On the international stage, Beigene and Chi-Med are also racing to be first to bring China-discovered cancer drugs to U.S. and European patients, often doing deals with global firms that can provide marketing expertise outside China.In July, Beigene signed a deal worth up to $1.4 billion with Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), licensing a promising cancer immunotherapy drug candidate to the U.S. group in the largest ever transaction involving a Chinese medicine. LONG-CYCLE BUSINESSBeigene CEO John Oyler is convinced Chinese drug discovery is on a roll, backed by powerful interests in Beijing who want to forge a leading position in the sector, just as China has done in energy, finance and telecoms.""The day you see a China-grown company that is one of the five major global pharmaceutical companies is approaching,"" he said, though he admitted recent big share price rises were ""not commensurate with clinical data being reported"".Others pointed to an under-developed academic ecosystem in China and the fact most big local drugmakers were deeply rooted in generics, despite outward talk of innovation.""It's easy to say I want to do new drug development, but then it's harder to see yourself spending $100 million and then fail,"" Samantha Du, chief executive of Zai Lab, told Reuters at the company's headquarters in Shanghai. Du was also a co-founder and chief scientific officer of Chi-Med until 2011.Zai Lab, which listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in September, has a drug discovery program focused on immuno-oncology, though for now its pipeline is dominated by molecules bought in from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Tesaro.Du hopes to change that one day but says it won't happen overnight.""It's such a long cycle, if you want to discover and develop drugs from ground zero, that's 12-15 years,"" she said. ""It's going to take time.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the business was under consideration. Established consumer health companies that may be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Abbott.They could be joined by Nestle, which is exploring the boundaries between food and healthcare. Nestle's new CEO Mark Schneider told investors last month it would keep identifying new opportunities and that 10 percent of group sales could be ripe for portfolio adjustment. A second person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a ""broadening"" of buyer interest to include Nestle.Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) may be less likely to bid, despite their consumer health presence, given they are busy absorbing Monsanto (NYSE:MON) and Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer business respectively.In explaining the thinking behind the review, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business.""Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company,"" he said.Options to be considered include a full or partial separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business.The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum. It also has 10 brands that each exceeded $100 million in 2016 sales.'IRRELEVANT' TO POTENTIAL BRISTOL BID A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan (NYSE:AGN) last year. It also tried and failed to buy AstraZeneca in 2014.Since then there has been persistent speculation that Pfizer is scouting for another major deal, with a bid for cancer specialist Bristol-Myers Squibb widely tipped as an option.However, the first source said the consumer healthcare review and the amount of cash it would raise was ""irrelevant"" to a possible takeover of Bristol-Myers, which has a market value of $105 billion.Pfizer has hired Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as financial advisers for the review, Germany's Merck KGaA had hired JP Morgan to sell its consumer health business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Both Sanofi and Nestle rose around 1 percent.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.1 percent by 0805 GMT. Miners (SXPP) were the biggest sectoral faller, down 1.4 percent, as escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and China's rating downgrade hit metal prices. North Korea said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to destroy the reclusive country.Among top fallers on the STOXX were London-listed miners BHP Billiton (L:BHP),  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), which dragged UK's FTSE (FTSE) down 0.2 percent. Germany's blue chip DAX index (GDAXI) was little changed, close to a two-month high on the last trading day before the general election in Europe's biggest economy.The DAX has outperformed euro zone peers over the past four years to hit a record high in June and there are expectations that a victory of Merkel could further support the country's equities, regardless of the makeup of her coalition.Yet some investors believe that German stocks, especially industrials like carmakers, are too highly priced and could be severely hit by a possible correction in key export market China on the back of a growing pile of debt.""The risks in a lot of the German companies are being under appreciated,"" Luiz Sauerbronn, who helps manage $30 billion at global investment advisory firm Brandes Investment Partners.Sauerbronn however said he was more optimistic about prospects for European equities as a whole given their attractive relative valuations versus the U.S. and sees opportunities in British grocers or European oil companies. Among German blue chips, utilities RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn), which are seen sensitive to possible policy changes in their country following the vote, rose 0.7 and 0.6 percent.Among other top movers on Friday was British engineer  Smiths Group  Plc (L:SMIN). Its shares fell 3.9 percent after full-year revenue growth fell short of analyst expectations even though its pretax profit rose 17 percent helped by growth in its security scanners business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The president wants to show that Europe must be rebuilt democratically,"" the official said.Macron will promote his campaign proposal to launch ""democratic conventions"" - or public debates - in European countries to discuss the future of the EU.The president, whose popularity ratings have slumped at home following a series of unpopular measures including proposals to cut public spending and welfare benefits, also wants to make institutions governing Europe's single currency more democratic.He wants a euro zone finance minister to manage a common budget that would be accountable to a euro zone parliament, but that proposal has met with robust resistance abroad, notably in Berlin.During a two-day trip ending on Friday, Macron will be accompanied by around 40 French business leaders, including from blue-chip firms Total, L'Oreal, Sanofi (PA:SASY), Engie and Vinci.After a German-French consortium won a majority stake in Thessaloniki Port last June, France is keen to push its companies to invest in Greek infrastructure, energy and the agri-food business.French officials also want to avoid more strategic sectors of the Greek economy from falling into non-European hands after China's COSCO Shipping bought a 51 percent stake in Piraeus Port, Greece's biggest, for 280.5 million euros.""It poses a sovereignty problem, it's kind of a European failure,"" the French official said. In June, Macron urged the European Commission to come up with a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from third countries, something some other western European nations have supported.But smaller eastern and southern European economies that have benefited from Chinese investments have rejected any steps against Beijing.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch sent the letters to  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc, Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's EMD Serono unit, Novartis AG, Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG, Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Inc.The lawmakers on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in the letters that they were looking to determine whether drug companies were raising prices for MS drugs in lockstep with their competitors.The average annual cost of MS therapy rose to $78,000 in 2016 from $16,000 in 2004, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.Drugmakers have faced a global pushback from regulators and lawmakers about high prices. President Donald Trump has said the companies are ""getting away with murder"" and has pledged to lower the cost of prescription drugs. He met with Representative Cummings to discuss the issue in March.Previous congressional investigations and hearings into drug pricing practices have had far-reaching effects. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV sharply reduced the cost of EpiPen after the Oversight Committee began looking into the increases that drove the list price of the life saving allergy treatment to around $600 a pair. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) International and Turing Pharmaceuticals have also faced congressional pressure over high prices.Roche said it plans to work with the lawmakers to address their questions, and said the industry needs to reverse the trend of sharp increases in MS drug prices.It said its treatment Ocrevus is priced around 20 percent below the current average cost of treatment and does not plan to aggressively raise its price.A Bayer spokeswoman said the company had received the letter and planned to reply directly to the congress members. Novartis said it was reviewing the letter to determine how to address the request.Sanofi did not immediately have a comment on the probe.

197,"Aug 17, 2017 02:10PM ET","Mylan, U.S. finalize $465 million EpiPen settlement",nan,"By Nate RaymondBOSTON (Reuters) - Mylan NV (O:MYL) has finalized a $465 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, resolving claims it overcharged the government for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, which became the center of a firestorm over price increases.The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts revealed the accord on Thursday, 10 months after Mylan said it reached a deal resolving claims it misclassified the EpiPen as a generic rather than a branded product to reduce the rebates it pays to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor.""Taxpayers rightly expect companies like Mylan that receive payments from taxpayer-funded programs to scrupulously follow the rules,"" Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said in a statement.Under the deal, Mylan did not admit wrongdoing. It will reclassify EpiPen and pay the rebate applicable to its new classification as of April 1, 2017.""Bringing closure to this matter is the right course of action for Mylan and our stakeholders to allow us to move forward,"" Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch said in a statement.The deal followed a False Claims Act whistleblower lawsuit filed by French rival Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) in 2016, two years after it first raised the matter with authorities, Weinreb's office said.Sanofi, which formerly marketed a rival product called Auvi-Q, will receive nearly $38.8 million as a reward from the government.Sanofi in a statement called pursuing the matter ""the right thing to do."" It has a separate antitrust lawsuit pending alleging Mylan engaged in illegal conduct to squelch competition to EpiPen.Mylan shares rose 2.10 percent to $31.11 on the Nasdaq. The EpiPen, which Mylan acquired in 2007, is a handheld device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine.Mylan came under fire last year after raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to $600, from $100 in 2008, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines.Mylan has since offered its own generic version for about $300. The settlement resolved claims that Mylan avoided higher rebates to state Medicaid programs by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic product, even through it was marketed and priced as a brand-name product.Some congressional members previously criticized the $465-million settlement as too small.A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis released in May found the U.S. government may have overpaid for EpiPens by up to $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

About 140,000 new cases are diagnosed a year globally and there is no cure for the disease, famously suffered by cosmologist Stephen Hawking.""Many doctors call it the worst disease in medicine and the unmet need is huge,"" said Richard Mead of the Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience, who has found artificial intelligence (AI) is already speeding up his work.Such robots - complex software run through powerful computers - work as tireless and unbiased super-researchers. They analyze huge chemical, biological and medical databases, alongside reams of scientific papers, far quicker than humanly possible, throwing up new biological targets and potential drugs.One candidate proposed by AI machines recently produced promising results in preventing the death of motor neurone cells and delaying disease onset in preclinical tests in Sheffield.Mead, who aims to present the work at a medical meeting in December, is now assessing plans for clinical trials.He and his team in northern England are not the only ones waking up to the ability of AI to elucidate the complexities of ALS.In Arizona, the Barrow Neurological Institute last December found five new genes linked to ALS by using IBM's Watson supercomputer. Without the machine, researchers estimate the discovery would have taken years rather than only a few months.Mead believes ALS is ripe for AI and machine-learning because of the rapid expansion in genetic information about the condition and the fact there are good test-tube and animal models to evaluate drug candidates.That is good news for ALS patients seeking better treatment options. Famous sufferers include Lou Gehrig, the 1923-39 New York Yankees baseball player; actor and playwright Sam Shepard, who died last month; and Hawking, a rare example of someone living for decades with the condition.If the research goes on to deliver new medicines, it would mark a notable victory for AI in drug discovery, bolstering the prospects of a growing batch of start-up companies focused on the technology.Those firms are based on the premise that while AI robots won't replace scientists and clinicians, they should save time and money by finding drug leads several times faster than conventional processes. BRITISH 'UNICORN'Mead from Sheffield is working with BenevolentAI, one of a handful of British ""unicorns"" - private companies with a market value above $1 billion, in this case $1.7 billion - which is rapidly expanding operations at its offices in central London.Others in the field include Scotland's Exscientia and U.S.-based firms Berg, Numerate, twoXAR, Atomwise and InSilico Medicine - the last of which recently launched a drug discovery platform geared specifically to ALS.""What we are trying to do is find relationships that will give us new targets in disease,"" said Jackie Hunter, a former drug hunter at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) who now heads Benevolent's pharma business.""We can do things so much more dynamically and be really responsive to what essentially the information is telling us.""Unlike humans, who may have pet theories, AI scans through data and generates hypotheses in an unbiased way.Conventional drug discovery remains a hit-and-miss affair and Hunter believes the 50 percent failure rates seen for experimental compounds in mid- and late-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy is unsustainable, forcing a shift to AI.A key test will come with a Phase IIb study by Benevolent to assess a previously unsuccessful compound from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in a new disease area - this time for treating Parkinson's disease patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.Big pharmaceutical companies like GSK, Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) are now exploring the potential of AI through deals with start-ups.They are treading cautiously, given the failure of ""high throughput screening"" in the early 2000s to improve efficiency by using robots to test millions of compounds. Yet AI's ability to learn on the job means things may be different this time.CPR Asset Management fund manager Vafa Ahmadi, for one, believes it is a potential game-changer.""Using artificial intelligence is going to really accelerate the way we produce much better targeted molecules. It could have a dramatic impact on productivity, which in turn could have a major impact on the valuation of pharmaceutical stocks,"" he said.Drugmakers and start-ups are not the only ones chasing that value. Technology giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also setting up life sciences units to explore drug R&D.For Benevolent's Hunter, today's attempts to find new drugs for ALS and other difficult diseases marks an important test-bed for the future of AI, which is already being deployed in other high-tech areas such as autonomous cars.""The aim is to show that we can deliver in a very difficult and complex area. I believe if you can do it in drug discovery and development, you can show the power of AI anywhere.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The No.2 U.S. drug store chain, however, reported quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates on strength in its pharmacy benefits management business (PBM), which helped to more than offset a 2.6 percent drop in same-store sales. ""Retail side of the business is struggling even if PBM was better than expected and actually pretty strong for what was expected,"" Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.CVS Health forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of $1.47 to $1.50 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $1.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.LEGAL ISSUESThe company said the attorney general for the Southern District of New York has sought information on possible false claims submitted in connection with reimbursements for Medicare Part D prescription drugs.  Minnesota's attorney general has also sought information from it regarding a probe into pricing of insulin and epinephrine drugs, CVS Health said. Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, Eli Lilly and Co and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) were named in a proposed class action lawsuit, which alleged the firms simultaneously hiked insulin prices by over 150 percent in the past five years.Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV, the maker of emergency epinephrine injectors EpiPen, is facing investigations after it doubled the cost of its syringes used to treat severe allergic reactions.On Monday, a class-action lawsuit was filed against CVS Health, which alleged the company colluded with third-party PBMs to raise generic drug prices.""The allegations against us made in this proposed class action suit are built on a false premise and are completely without merit,"" CVS Health spokesman Michael DeAngelis said in a statement on Tuesday.Net income attributable to drug store chain rose about 19 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, the company earned a profit of $1.33 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.31.Net revenue rose 4.5 percent to $45.69 billion, beating expectations of $45.37 billion.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3 percent by 0833 GMT, while blue chips gained 0.2 percent. Britain's commodity-heavy FTSE 100 index was up 0.5 percent while Germany's DAX rose 1 percent.Financials gave a big boost to the STOXX, with banks up 0.5 percent, led higher by a 2.8 percent gain in HSBC, which rallied after the lender posted a forecast-beating 5 percent rise in first half pretax profit and announced its third buyback in a year.Results also helped shares in French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) gain around 2 percent, after it raised its 2017 outlook on the back of strong sales growth in its second quarter.As the European second quarter earnings season gathers pace, so far around 45 percent of MSCI Europe firms have reported results, 58 percent of which have either met or beaten analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.This figure is slightly lower for euro zone firms, of which just over half have met or beaten expectations.""Earnings season so far has been above average, both in Europe and the UK, although I think there's a bit of distraction - you can see that in the share prices, particularly for the DAX,"" Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.""Regardless of the fact that you've got a strong business outlook and ... more than satisfactory earnings, shares were falling because investors are trying to factor in the potential impact of this galloping euro on the quarters to come,"" City Index's Odeluga added.The STOXX 600 was on track to end the month flat, hampered in July by a stronger euro which has weighed on euro zone firms, especially exporters. Mining firms were also strong performers on the day, jumping 1.8 percent as copper prices rose on the back of manufacturing data from China, the world's biggest consumer of metals. Elsewhere upgrades from RBC on  Severn Trent  (LON:SVT) and United Utilities helped the firms trade at the top of the STOXX, with European utilities gaining 1 percent.British tobacco firms Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) and  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) extended losses from the previous session, however, down 3.8 percent and 1.5 percent respectively following Friday's sell-off after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes.Shares in Rolls Royce (LON:RR) came under pressure following reports that the company told investors that it may not hit its target of 1 billion pounds sterling in cashflow by 2020.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Food sales appeared to be the major disappointment given the 0.1% decline. Analysts had penciled in a 0.6% increase for the first quarter.

Increasing production by U.S. shale firms and Nigeria and Libya who are exempt from the production cut agreements have continued to spark concerns over the global supply glut.European energy stocks traded mostly lower, as French oil and gas major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) lost 0.28%, Norwegian rival  Statoil  (OL:STL) traded down 0.51% but Italy’s  ENI  (MI:ENI) was unchanged.Financial stocks traded mostly higher, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) rose 0.24% and 0.39%, respectively, while Germany’s Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) gained Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) traded up 1.09% and 0.90%, respectively.Among peripheral lenders, Italian banks  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and rival Unicredit (MI:CRDI) rose 0.28% and 0.06%, respectively, but Spanish banks BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) fell 0.12% and 0.15%, respectively.In London, the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 lost 0.68%, despite support from mining stocks.Shares in  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) gained 1.18%,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) advanced 1.59%, BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) inched up 0.08% and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) advanced 0.37%.Energy stocks were under downward pressure, as  BP  (LON:BP) fell 0.84% and rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) lost 0.88%.Financial stocks saw mixed trade, with shares in  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) up 0.85% but rivals Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) traded down 0.58%, 0.41% and 0.55%, respectively.In the U.S., stock futures pointed to a flat open with mixed signs.

208,"Jul 04, 2017 02:00PM ET","Pfizer receives token payment to exit Brazil venture, sources say",nan,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) has agreed to exit Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro SA for a token amount after failing to find a buyer for the 40 percent stake it held in the Brazilian generic drugmaking joint venture, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.According to one of the people, the heirs of Teuto founder Walterci Melo will pay Pfizer 1 real ($0.30) for the stake acquired by the U.S. pharmaceutical company seven years ago for $240 million. The other person said the price tag for the stake was ""small enough"" for the Melos to avoid spending their cash substantially.In a statement, Pfizer confirmed the transfer ""after careful consideration,"" but said the terms of the deal were confidential. In a separate statement, the Melos confirmed the deal, without elaborating.Pfizer's exit comes as Teuto's management is negotiating the refinancing of 600 million reais in loans, two of the people said. The people did not comment on Teuto's ongoing refinancing.The sources requested anonymity because terms of the deal remain private.The situation underscores challenges facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where a weaker currency has lifted raw material costs and the harshest recession on record has slowed sales. It puts an end to a year-long process that produced no firm bidders despite initial interest from private-equity and several pharmaceutical firms.BACKPEDALINGPfizer backpedaled on previous plans to exit the generic drugs segment late last year. Still, performance of the business in Brazil, the world's No. 3 market for generics, has been mixed. Rivals including France's Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) have recently dealt with excess inventory at their local units.The recession has put the brakes on the sale of generic medicines, which expanded by 12 percent last year, compared with 15 percent growth two years ago.Pfizer's Teuto decision was reported earlier in the day by O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper.Both the Melos, who owned 60 percent of Teuto, and Pfizer had hired the investment-banking units of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Grupo BTG Pactual SA (SA:BBTG11) to find a buyer. The failure to sell the company to a third party rekindled a dispute between both partners over the venture, the sources added. The rift stems from an option held by Pfizer to buy out the family between 2014 and 2016. The Melo family tried unsuccessfully to force Pfizer into exercising the option, the people said.

209,"Jul 01, 2017 08:43PM ET","Big pharma turns to AI to speed drug discovery, GSK signs deal",nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - The world's leading drug companies are turning to artificial intelligence to improve the hit-and-miss business of finding new medicines, with GlaxoSmithKline unveiling a new $43 million deal in the field on Sunday.Other pharmaceutical giants including Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) are also exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to help streamline the drug discovery process. The aim is to harness modern supercomputers and machine learning systems to predict how molecules will behave and how likely they are to make a useful drug, thereby saving time and money on unnecessary tests. AI systems already play a central role in other high-tech areas such as the development of driverless cars and facial recognition software.""Many large pharma companies are starting to realize the potential of this approach and how it can help improve efficiencies,"" said Andrew Hopkins, chief executive of privately owned Exscientia, which announced the new tie-up with GSK.Hopkins, who used to work at  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), said Exscientia's AI system could deliver drug candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time and at one-quarter of the cost of traditional approaches.The Scotland-based company, which also signed a deal with Sanofi in May, is one of a growing number of start-ups on both sides of the Atlantic that are applying AI to drug research. Others include U.S. firms Berg, Numerate, twoXAR and Atomwise, as well as Britain's BenevolentAI.""In pharma's eyes these companies are essentially digital biotechs that they can strike partnerships with and which help feed the pipeline,"" said Nooman Haque, head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London.""If this technology really proves itself, you may start to see M&A with pharma, and closer integration of these AI engines into pharma R&D.""STILL TO BE PROVENIt is not the first time drugmakers have turned to high-tech solutions to boost R&D productivity.The introduction of ""high throughput screening"", using robots to rapidly test millions of compounds, generated mountains of leads in the early 2000s but notably failed to solve inefficiencies in the research process.When it comes to AI, big pharma is treading cautiously, in the knowledge that the technology has yet to demonstrate it can successfully bring a new molecule from computer screen to lab to clinic and finally to market.""It's still to be proven, but we definitely think we should do the experiment,"" said John Baldoni, GSK's head of platform technology and science.Baldoni is also ramping up in-house AI investment at the drugmaker by hiring some unexpected staff with appropriate computing and data handling experience - including astrophysicists.His goal is to reduce the time it takes from identifying a target for disease intervention to finding a molecule that acts against it from an average 5.5 years today to just one year in future.""That is a stretch. But as we've learnt more about what modern supercomputers can do, we've gained more confidence,"" Baldoni told Reuters. ""We have an obligation to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the time it takes to get medicines to patients.""Earlier this year GSK also entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and National Cancer Institute to accelerate pre-clinical drug development through use of advanced computational technologies.The new deal with Exscientia will allow GSK to search for drug candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets. GSK will provide research funding and make payments of 33 million pounds ($43 million), if pre-clinical milestones are met.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

211,"Jun 19, 2017 12:28PM ET",GSK's new pharma head to join in September after AstraZeneca tussle,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has struck a deal for Luke Miels to start as its new head of pharmaceuticals in September, following a lengthy dispute over his contract with his former employer AstraZeneca.Britain's biggest drugmaker poached Miels in January in the first major appointment by incoming GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley. But his arrival was stalled by an AstraZeneca lawsuit disputing when he could join.GSK said on Monday it had now struck an agreement with AstraZeneca for Miels to start on Sept. 4, avoiding the need for a court case over his contract.Miels had headed AstraZeneca's European business and his defection was a blow to the company, which has seen a number of senior management departures.For Walmsley, his appointment is viewed as pivotal, since he will be a key lieutenant as she tries to steer GSK's core pharmaceuticals business towards improved productivity and higher profits.Originally, GSK had hoped for a lengthy handover period during which Miels would work alongside outgoing pharma head Abbas Hussain. However, the delay in his arrival means this will not now be possible.Miels, who has both commercial and scientific experience after working at AstraZeneca, Roche and Sanofi (PA:SASY), will arrive as GSK is looking to a new wave of drugs to offset the decline of lung treatment Advair.Walmsley, who became GSK CEO on April 1, worked in marketing and management at L'Oreal for 17 years before joining the drugmaker and has her roots a long way from the pharmaceutical lab bench.That has raised doubts among some investors about her insight into prescription drugs and she is expected to rely heavily on advice from Miels, as well as GSK's research boss Patrick Vallance.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor.""We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,"" Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. ""We want to be part of the solution.""Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications.Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version.""With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note.Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc's Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp's drugstore chain for about $110 a pair.Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500.Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights.Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Verily already has deals with GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), Sanofi (PA:SASY), Novartis and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to apply novel technology in areas ranging from diabetes management to robotic surgery. Last month it landed former U.S. Food and Drug Administration head Robert Califf as part of its team.Another Google offshoot, Calico, is working on treatments to fight ageing, while the group's arms-length GV venture capital operation has invested in dozens of healthcare start-ups, mostly in the United States.The latest initiative will now see it delving deeper into drug development by investing in late-stage European biotech companies. The new fund will back both private and public firms with products that have already reached mid-stage Phase II clinical development, providing them with a new source of growth capital.""There is a funding gap because there is a maturing class of biotechnology companies now in Europe,"" said Francesco De Rubertis, co-founder and partner at Medicxi.The fund is a first for Medicxi, the former life sciences arm of Index Ventures, which has so far invested in early-stage biotech.It also reflects the redrawing of traditional industry borders as tech companies take a hands-on role in healthcare innovation, as highlighted by the fact that Verily will appoint two members to the new fund’s scientific advisory board. Other tech companies, including Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), are also investing in healthcare in the belief that modern computing capabilities and miniaturization can help accelerate advances in medical treatment.Europe boasts world-class universities and scientists, but its biotechnology sector has long been a poor relation to the bigger U.S. industry, where emerging life sciences firms are able to access a much deeper pool of capital.By providing funds for late-stage drug development, the hope is that more firms will be able to stay independent and continue to build up the value of their experimental medicines, rather than selling out prematurely to larger players.De Rubertis said much of the investment was likely to be channeled to companies in Britain, Switzerland and a region spanning Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam.Europe has only a small roster of successful biotechs, such as Danish cancer specialist  Genmab  (CO:GEN), currently worth $13 billion, and Switzerland's Actelion.Actelion was Europe's top biotech firm for many years, thanks to its market-leading position in pulmonary arterial hypertension, before it was bought by J&J this year for $30 billion.Total revenues for Europe's biotech industry were $25 billion in 2015 against $108 billion for the U.S. industry, according to consultancy EY.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

217,"Jun 08, 2017 04:50AM ET","Small is lucrative for Wachtell, corporate America's legal defense force",nan,"By Greg RoumeliotisNEW YORK (Reuters) - Every Tuesday, partners and associates at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz gather for a communal lunch in the dining room of the law firm's Manhattan offices.Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served, but the real attraction is Martin Lipton, one of the firm's co-founders and corporate America's most famous consigliere.The father of the 'poison pill' – a key defense strategy used against hostile takeovers – Lipton has helped build the firm into the most lucrative legal outfit in the world, a go-to shop for companies seeking to seal complex deals or repel suitors and activist investors.The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85-year-old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm's close-knit culture, where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals.Partners say a flat structure and relatively small size - Wachtell's lawyer headcount of about 260 is roughly half of its closest rival Cravath, Swaine & Moore – is key to the firm's success. The firm's concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one-stop shops for deals, from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs.Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high-stakes corporate situations will persist, according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm. This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire. ""Wachtell's business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all,"" said Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor. ""They know that in the big M&A cases, legal fees, no matter how big they are, are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal."" When French drug giant Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) threatened U.S.cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a $9.3 billion hostile bid last year, for example, Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser, Cooley. Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits. Cooley and Medivation declined to comment.MOST LUCRATIVE With some U.S. companies domiciled overseas, Wachtell's partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions. Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done, Wachtell's lawyers fly out to advise, staying weeks in some cases to see a case through, and turn to other law firms to assist them. Wachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years, but decided against it, partner at the firm said. The feeling among the firm's senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture, which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations, all from the one office in Manhattan. Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world, with the average partner making a profit last year of $5.8 million, according to trade publication American Lawyer. The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of $1.66 million.Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto. ""We work harder on average than other places, the work is very partner-heavy. It's the type of work where vast experience is critical,"" said Daniel Neff, co-chairman of Wachtell's executive committee. No one is more experienced than Lipton, referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues. He continues to work on high-profile cases including, most recently, advising General Motors Co's (N:GM) board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital, as well metal parts maker  Arconic Inc  (N:ARNC) on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. Besides Lipton, two of the other three founding partners, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, have died. However, like Lipton, founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law, focusing on corporate litigation, which is the firm's other major area of strength.M&A ROYALTYLipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door. They include Neff and Edward Herlihy, who formally lead the firm as co-managing partners, as well as Andrew Brownstein, David Katz, Steven Rosenblum, Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum, among others. When  Perrigo Co  Plc (N:PRGO) turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a $35 billion offer from Mylan NV (O:MYL), it was a 45-year-old partner, Igor Kirman, that the Irish-domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents. Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company's shareholders.""It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice. But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo's board could understand,"" said Joseph Papa, Perrigo's former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) International Inc (TO:VRX).Lipton remains influential, fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st-floor office, which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s. ""Lipton is royalty in the M&A bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved,"" said Gillers. ""The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A complex U.S. supply chain has led to a blame game between drugmakers, health insurers and intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers.""This complexity is undermining the reputation of an entire industry whose purpose is to make a positive change in patients’ lives,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement on the group's website announcing the pricing policy.Sanofi will take as its pricing benchmark the national health expenditures (NHE) growth projection, which is calculated by the Department of Health and Human Services and covers spending by all U.S. payers, including individuals.""By limiting our price increases to the NHE growth projection, we ensure that Sanofi is not contributing to further medical inflation,"" Brandicourt said.This would cap price increases for any product to 5.4 percent in 2017, but Sanofi said there might be times when there was a ""sound reason"" for a higher increase, in which case it promised to demonstrate publicly the rationale for such a rise.Sanofi also said it would disclose the gross and net prices for its medicines in future, adding that in 2016 its average aggregate list prices increased by 4.0 percent but net prices fell by 2.1 percent. The company is being hit hard by competition in its core diabetes treatment business, which is driving down prices.Responding to criticism about high drug prices, other firms such as AbbVie (N:ABBV), Allergan (N:AGN) and Danish diabetes specialist  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) have promised to keep all drug price increases in 2017 under 10 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today,"" O'Reilly said in the statement, which was emailed by crisis communications expert Mark Fabiani.O'Reilly will be replaced in his prime-time lineup by Fox host Tucker Carlson. Carlson's show had been moved earlier this year to replace ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly, another Fox News star who left for NBC in January.The New York Times reported on April 1 that Fox and O'Reilly paid five women a total of $13 million to settle harassment claims. The five women who received settlements either worked for O'Reilly or appeared as guests on his program, according to the New York Times story.O'Reilly said in a statement at the time that he had settled only to spare his children from the controversy.O'Reilly's show, ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" is the top-rated show on Fox News. According to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media, it brought in $147.13 million in advertising revenue in 2016. By comparison, Twenty-First Century Fox’s last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2016, brought in a total of $7.65 billion in advertising revenue.""The O’Reilly Factor"" has been the most watched program on Fox News and was coming off the highest-rated first quarter in its history, averaging 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen.But after the New York Times report, advertisers including BMW of North America, Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and T. Rowe Price, pulled their advertising from O'Reilly's show.O'Reilly's exit, which was first reported by New York magazine, follows that of former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign in July after being accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women, including former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Kelly was also one of the accusers and detailed Ailes' behavior in her best-selling book, ""Settle for More."" Ailes has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.. Twenty-First Century Fox had tapped the law firm Paul, Weiss Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which also looked into the allegations against Ailes, to investigate O'Reilly's conduct. Investors seemed to take the news in stride. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox ended Wednesday's trading on the Nasdaq down less than 1 percent at $30.39 and analysts said the network's viewers would likely remain loyal.O’Reilly’s departure will not affect Twenty-First Century Fox’s overall profitability, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.“They could literally go dark during the time his program airs and they would still be profitable,” said Wieser.A bigger issue for investors is what the Murdochs will do to prevent the company being in the headlines again just a few months from now, Wieser said. “That’s bigger than O’Reilly,” he said. “The cultural issue is a big issue.”  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need,"" the president said. ""If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.""Trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging ""astronomical"" prices, while acknowledging how ""complicated"" the nation's healthcare system is.Representatives of the Trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for Pompe disease is fair. Trump's comments on Tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors - the potential for deregulation of the FDA, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products.""I think Trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,"" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. ""The FDA's standards actually promote innovation because patients don't want just any old drug - they want drugs that work.""Megan's father, John Crowley, now chief executive at Amicus Therapeutics Inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for Pompe disease. In 2006, the FDA - after a nine-month review - approved infused enzyme replacement therapy Myozyme for patients born with the condition. A similar drug, Lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late-onset Pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient's age. The average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to Paris-based Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, which now owns the drugs.Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases - defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients - are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity. ""Pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don't for mainstream diseases,"" said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California.The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauded Trump's recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul. ""Our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,"" NORD said in a statement on Wednesday. Pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. When glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death.NORD estimates that around 30 million Americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

239,"Jan 26, 2017 12:16PM ET",Johnson & Johnson refills drug cabinet with $30 billion Actelion deal,nan,"By John Miller and Paul ArnoldALLSCHWIL, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) will buy Swiss biotech company Actelion (S:ATLN) in a $30 billion all-cash deal that includes spinning off Actelion's research and development pipeline, the companies said on Thursday.The biggest European drugs takeover in 13 years gives J&J access to the Swiss group's range of high-price, high-margin medicines for rare diseases, helping it diversify its drug portfolio as its biggest product, Remicade for arthritis, faces cheaper competition. The offer to pay $280 per share, following weeks of exclusive talks, was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.The deal represents a 23 percent premium to Actelion's closing price on Wednesday and is more than 80 percent above the Nov. 23 closing price before reports emerged that Europe's biggest biotech company had attracted takeover interest.Actelion shares jumped 20 percent to 273.30 francs by 1350 GMT as investors welcomed the deal.""The structure is very attractive,"" said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, a fund manager at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva, a top-40 Actelion investor.The price vindicates the strategy of cardiologist Jean-Paul Clozel, who co-founded the company with his pediatrician wife Martine and friends in 1997, and has fended off bids over the years in the belief he could increase Actelion's value by keeping it independent.""The price is quite high at around 30 times price to estimated 2018 earnings. J&J is paying a lot and R&D is not even included, just a substantial minority stake,"" one Zurich-based trader said.""But it represents only 10 percent of (J&J's) market capitalization and they are finally investing the cash they hold in Europe."" Jefferies analysts said they did not expect any counterbids or competition concerns, while Berenberg analysts called it ""a fantastic deal for Actelion and its shareholders"" given concerns about the long-term growth prospects for its main products.Actelion has been the subject of takeover speculation for weeks after J&J launched and then halted discussions with the Swiss company. French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) had also been interested, sources said, but was sidelined after J&J returned and began exclusive negotiations in December.Sanofi's failure to come away with a big deal for a second time has added to pressure on its management.Clozel said the J&J offer -- putting Actelion's established drugs into its bigger commercial organization while leaving riskier early-stage R&D assets in the new 600-employee company for Clozel to develop -- convinced him this was the right one.""With this structure it was not difficult,"" he told Reuters after a news conference. ""It's always emotional but it's not difficult. Because frankly it's a good solution for everybody."" The deal makes the Clozels billionaires. R&D BUSINESSJ&J said it expected the transaction to be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share and accelerate its revenue and earnings growth rates although synergies were set to play just a small role. The U.S. group, which reported disappointing quarterly results this week, will fund the transaction with cash held outside the United States.""We believe this transaction offers compelling value to both Johnson & Johnson and Actelion shareholders,"" Alex Gorsky, J&J chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Actelion will spin out its research and development unit into a standalone company based and listed in Switzerland, under the working title of R&D NewCo and led by Clozel. The break-up plan was first reported by Reuters last month.The shares of R&D NewCo will be distributed to Actelion's shareholders as a stock dividend and the new unit will be launched with 1 billion francs in cash.Urs Beck, fund manager at EFG Asset Management that holds Actelion shares, hailed the transaction.""J&J is a good partner with a huge distribution network. For Actelion's founders that is certainly a good solution. Mr and Ms Clozel can do research for another 20 years and J&J has gained an interesting indication,"" he said.""It's a huge deal and J&J plays in a different league from Sanofi, they can finance that without difficulties. I don't see Sanofi stepping in with a higher offer at some point, that doesn't make sense any more,"" he added.J&J will initially hold a 16 percent stake in R&D NewCo and will have rights to an additional 16 percent of the company's equity through a convertible note. It agreed not to sell its stake on the open market for two years. It will also get an option on ACT-132577, a product within R&D NewCo being developed for resistant hypertension and now in phase 2 clinical development. Lazard acted as lead financial advisor to J&J, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) was Actelion's lead advisor. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, with J&J commencing the tender offer by mid-February. It needs to win at least 67 percent of all Actelion shares, regulatory approvals and Actelion shareholder approval of the distribution of shares of R&D NewCo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

241,"Jan 20, 2017 03:19AM ET",Sanofi's M&A misses frustrate some investors in drugmaker,nan,"By Matthias Blamont, Noëlle Mennella and Ben HirschlerPARIS/DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - For the last year, Sanofi's chief executive has made clear his quest for deals to help revive the fortunes of France's biggest drugmaker.The market is still waiting. Olivier Brandicourt's failure to land two big biotech acquisitions he was chasing has led to growing impatience among some investors.""The company needs a growth driver and must make an acquisition. Time is running out,"" said Olivier David of Vega Investment Managers, who holds shares in the company.In an interview at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos this week Brandicourt defended his track record, citing an unwillingness to overpay for pricey assets and a paucity of good opportunities.""We can grow without M&A. However, it is a tool which we do continue to consider and which can help growth potentially, only if it makes sense strategically,"" he said. ""The reason why it is so competitive is that you don't have a very, very large number of potential targets."" Sanofi's misses underscore the race for assets as the world's top drugmakers try to replenish their medicine cabinets.After entering exclusive talks, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) appears to be closing in on a deal to buy Actelion for some $28 billion, edging out Sanofi (PA:SASY), which also tried to buy the Swiss company, according to people familiar with the matter.It marks a second setback for Brandicourt's M&A ambitions after he was beaten by Pfizer's $14 billion bid for U.S. cancer specialist Medivation last August.Brandicourt said he had to tread a fine line between delivering and overpaying, arguing many shareholders appreciated the financial discipline needed to walk away from deals.""Shareholders being frustrated after one year is not automatically what I'm hearing, to be honest, because when I see investors they seem to be very happy for us not to have spent $14 billion on Medivation,"" he said.""On Actelion, I'm not making any comment but you will understand that a company like ours will continuously look at what's happening in the world of potential mergers and acquisitions.""The global pharmaceutical industry has seen a flurry of acquisitions in recent years as leading players build their drug pipelines by snapping up young biotech firms. Sanofi has a particular need to do this because its core U.S. diabetes business has stalled.Brandicourt - who joined the company in April 2015 after the ousting of former CEO Chris Viehbacher - insisted Sanofi was delivering effectively on a plan set out to 2020.The drugmaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings in October, helped by a surge in flu vaccine sales, but it stuck to its guidance for currency-adjusted sales at its embattled diabetes business to shrink by 4-8 percent per year on average from 2015 to 2018.Despite a rally since October, over the last five years Sanofi shares have lagged the sector, rising around 37 percent, against a 61 percent gain for the STOXX Europe 600 Healthcare index.""A lot of fund managers and historic shareholders are fed up with Sanofi and tired of seeing the stock in this 'vegetative' state,"" said Frederic Rozier, a Sanofi investor and fund manager with Meeschaert.""Cost cutting is not enough, we want to see growth in sales, that's where we need to see progress."" ""CONSTANT SCREENING MODE"" Sanofi is due to publish annual results on Feb. 8 and its 2016 financial performance is expected to hinge on cost savings.The fear is that with few potential new blockbusters in development, with the notable exception of dupilumab for eczema and asthma, Sanofi may find itself stuck with no meaningful growth for a while.""Sanofi is looking for a pipeline and for this very reason it must engage in external growth,"" said Rudi Van den Eynde, with asset management firm Candriam.""At the moment, the company is being overtaken by other groups that are offering more money. One can applaud that Sanofi is financially disciplined but it is a pity that it misses its targets ... it doesn't help in terms of credibility.""Sanofi's failure to land either Medivation or Actelion has raised questions over its acquisition strategy, even as the group insists it is in ""constant screening mode"".""Is Sanofi not too rigid when it comes to pricing? At the end, they lose to someone else,"" said a Paris-based banker who asked not to be identified.Another banking source said Sanofi's hostile approach in the Medivation process had been a mistake. Weeks before losing out to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Sanofi tried to oust Medivation's board members to replace them with new directors.""Everyone knows that 95 percent of hostile approaches go wrong,"" the source said, adding that in the final stage Pfizer and Sanofi were only a few hundred millions apart.Brandicourt said he simply stuck to his guns on price and he noted that Sanofi, with a relatively small oncology business, may have had fewer potential cost savings than competitors.IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, SWAP ITSanofi has signaled its readiness to do deals of a similar size to its $20 billion purchase of Genzyme in 2011 but finding the right large biotech to fit is not that easy.""Alternatively, Sanofi could purchase smaller companies, along the lines of the strategy pursued by Japan's Takeda. It would be more realistic,"" Van den Eynde said.Sanofi may also look at more asset swaps, after agreeing to hand its animal unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm's consumer healthcare operations, a business strand it is keen to grow.""A number of healthcare companies are looking at Pfizer's consumer health unit. Sanofi is one of them,"" said one healthcare banker. A Sanofi spokesman declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

245,"Jan 02, 2017 03:40AM ET",New drug approvals fall to six-year low in 2016,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - Last year turned out to be a disappointing one for new drug approvals with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearing just 22 new medicines for sale, the lowest number since 2010 and sharply down on 2015's tally of 45.Across the Atlantic, the European Medicines Agency recommended 81 new prescription products against a 2015 total of 93. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic drugs in its list.The slowdown suggests the pharmaceuticals industry may be returning to more normal productivity levels after a spike in approvals in 2014 and 2015, when the haul of new drugs reaching the market hit a 19-year high.Several factors led to the fall in the approval rate in 2016, John Jenkins, the FDA's director of the office of new drugs, told a conference last month.Notably, five new drugs that had been scheduled for approval in 2016 ended up winning an early green light at the end of 2015. There was also a decline in drugs being filed for approval and the FDA rejected or delayed more applications in 2016 than in the previous two years.Some of the delayed drugs may yet go on to win approval in 2017, including Roche's multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus and Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Regeneron's sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis.Most industry executives remain upbeat about the hunt for new medicines, given recent advances in fighting cancer and an improved understanding of the genetic basis of other diseases, which has resulted in full development pipelines at many firms.But it remains challenging to get new drugs through the approval process and to secure a decent financial return once they are launched, given resistance from healthcare insurers and governments to the rising cost of medical treatment.According to consultancy Deloitte, returns on research and development investment at the top 12 pharmaceutical companies fell to just 3.7 percent in 2016 from a high of 10.1 percent in 2010.Increasing political pressure over the high prices of many modern medicines is a growing challenge at a time when biotech and pharma companies are developing more drugs targeted at niche patient populations.The issue is exemplified by the last drug to win FDA approval in 2016. Spinraza, from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is the first medicine to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and often fatal genetic disease. It comes at a huge cost of $125,000 per dose.That price, implying a total cost of $625,000 to $750,000 for patients in the first year and $375,000 in subsequent years, is likely to invite ""a storm of criticism, up to and including Presidential tweets"", according to Leerink analysts.President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down drug prices.For a graphic on U.S. FDA drug approvals, click: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-DRUGS/01M0110L20G/USA-DRUGS-01.jpg  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

246,"Dec 28, 2016 10:37PM ET",U.S. FTC requires divestitures in $13.53 billion Boehringer-Sanofi deal,nan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim agreed to divest five types of animal health products to settle charges that a proposed asset swap with Sanofi (PA:SASY) would harm competition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.The proposed asset swap involved Boehringer Ingelheim's acquisition of Sanofi's $13.5 billion animal care subsidiary and Sanofi's obtaining the Germany company's consumer health care business unit, valued at nearly $8 billion, plus $5.5 billion in cash, the FTC said in a statement.Without the divestitures, the proposed swap ""would harm competition in the U.S. markets for various vaccines for companion animals (pets) and certain parasite control products for cattle and sheep,"" the commission said.The sale of the U.S. pet vaccine assets will occur shortly after the closing of the BI-Sanofi swap transaction, which the company anticipates to close by early 2017, Boehringer spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. Sanofi was not immediately available for comments.The FTC said that without the divestitures the proposed transaction would reduce the number of suppliers of canine and feline vaccines from four to three. It would combine the two top rabies vaccine suppliers.It would also reduce competition among suppliers of products to prevent parasites in cattle and sheep, the FTC said.In November the companies agreed to divestitures to allay European Commission concerns that the deal would harm competition and possibly result in price hikes.""The two companies offered to divest a number of Merial's marketed and pipeline products, including its existing vaccines Circovac, Progressis, Parvovax, Parvovurax and Mucossifa and pharmaceuticals Ketofen, Wellicox, Allevinix, Genixine, Equioxx Injectable and Equioxx Paste,"" the EU said at the time.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Actelion was in talks with Sanofi about a deal after U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) abandoned efforts to buy the company.Actelion's share price was up 8.35 percent at 214 Swiss francs ($208) by 1328 GMT, when Sanofi's was down 2.42 percent at 74.17 euros, underperforming a 0.6 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index <0#.SXDP>.Sources familiar with the situation have said that Sanofi is likely to offer Actelion shareholders cash plus contingent value rights, a type of security that pays out only if experimental drugs reach certain commercial targets, keeping their owners exposed to some risk of failure.Several investors in Actelion told Reuters they would push for more information.Sanofi and Actelion declined to comment.A deal would mark Sanofi's largest transaction since 2011, when it bought rare disease specialist Genzyme for $20.1 billion.At the time Sanofi had also proposed cash plus payments tied to the success of the U.S. biotech group's drugs.In recent years Genzyme has delivered a double-digit percentage growth in sales thanks to robust demand for its multiple sclerosis treatments.Actelion makes drugs treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening form of high blood pressure in arteries connecting the heart and lungs. It also plans to expand in drugs for multiple sclerosis and clostridium difficile - a condition which can lead to life-threatening inflammation of the colon - but regulatory approvals are still some years away.However, Actelion has repeatedly maintained that it is better off staying independent and five years ago successfully fended off an attempt by activist hedge fund Elliott Management to put it up for sale.Meanwhile Sanofi has been attempting to diversify as it faces pressure on prices for its insulin products for treating diabetes in the United States and has repeatedly expressed an interest in making more acquisitions.Earlier this year it lost out to Pfizer's (N:PFE) $14 billion bid for cancer drug company Medivation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Analysts have previously identified Sanofi as a potential buyer for Actelion, whose portfolio would supplement the French drugmaker's Genzyme rare disease unit. Sanofi declined to comment on the WSJ report.Actelion informed Johnson & Johnson that it was confident it could attract an offer significantly higher than the approximately 250 Swiss francs per share that the U.S. company had offered, according to a person familiar with the matter.There were also disagreements about the structure of the deal, the person added.Actelion shares closed at 208.50 Swiss francs on Tuesday before the company gave the update on the talks, giving it a market capitalization of 22.5 billion Swiss francs ($22.2 billion).Acquiring lung disease specialist Actelion would have boosted J&J's drug pipeline and given it more pricing power, at a time when its popular arthritis drug Remicade faces cheaper competition from  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE).Clozel and his wife, Chief Scientific Officer Martine Clozel, have built up a world-leading drug portfolio at Actelion to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. They aim to expand in drugs for multiple sclerosis and clostridium difficile, but regulatory approvals for those are years away.The company is also counting on its new pulmonary arterial hypertension treatments Opsumit and Uptravi, which combined are forecast to bring in nearly 4.5 billion francs in annual sales by 2020.Clozel has faced pressure from some shareholders to do a deal. Five years ago, he successfully defended against an effort by activist hedge fund Elliott Management to put Actelion up for sale, questioning his strategy.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

258,"Nov 28, 2016 07:50AM ET",Actelion's ambitious independent-minded CEO will drive up takeover price,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel's desire to keep Europe's biggest biotech company independent after building it from scratch, means Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will have to pay a steep premium if a takeover is to succeed.The U.S. healthcare titan on Friday confirmed talks with the Swiss maker of medicines for deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). While Actelion confirmed the courtship, it said there was no guarantee of a deal.Actelion's rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target, since its drugs face less price pressure than other more widely used medicines. Analysts estimate a deal could be as high as 250 Swiss francs ($247) per share, valuing Actelion at around $26 billion, or $6 billion more than its current price even after the share's 17 percent surge on Friday.Having fended off reported approaches by Shire in 2015 and hedge fund Elliott Advisors in 2011, Clozel, a French-born cardiologist, has repeatedly asserted his desire to go it alone, with his three main PAH drugs and with pipeline medicines he hopes will create a broad-based biotech company.This hard-to-get approach, coupled with the high value of recent deals in the sector, will drive up Actelion's takeover price, analysts said. ""Similar deals have been at a 40-plus percent premium and we view 240 Swiss francs as a possible floor takeout value,"" Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said.Analysts at Bryan Garnier suggested a bid price of up to 250 francs.In another recent biotech takeover,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) paid $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, or double its pre-deal value. Switzerland's Roche in 2014 paid $8.3 billion for InterMune, a 63 percent premium. Clozel and his pediatrician-wife, Martine Clozel, Actelion's chief science officer, own 5 percent of the company they founded in 1997. Close ties with Actelion's Swiss shareholder base suggest they can mobilize support, should an offer not live up to their expectations, Welford said.If J&J fails to strike a deal, a rival like Sanofi (PA:SASY) could well step in, analysts said. Actelion's PAH portfolio is a potentially nice fit for the French drugmaker's Genzyme rare disease unit.Sanofi, which lost out to Pfizer in the battle for Medivation, has said it is still looking for deals. A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment on the company's possible interest in Actelion.NEW DRUGSWhile the patent for Actelion's PAH blockbuster Tracleer expired last year, Clozel's two newer PAH drugs, Opsumit and Uptravi, are expected to take up the slack. Opsumit's annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data. Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs.Clozel plans to use the cash to fund his late-stage pipeline, which includes medicines for treating diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, as well as the multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod.Stefan Schneider, a Bank Vontobel analyst in Zurich, doubts a deal will go through and said any sign that a potential buyer will tinker with Clozel's prized pipeline to cut costs could be a deal killer. ""We don't see how the CEO would part from the pipeline where he sees the value for Actelion to transform into the first European large-cap biotech company,"" Schneider said.Actelion's shares have risen six-fold to nearly 190 francs since the start of 2012, just after Elliott tried to wrest control - on the grounds the company's stock should fetch 70 francs. As retirement edges closer, analysts said it is possible Clozel is more receptive to handing over the reins, especially if a buyer agrees to retain Actelion's presence in Basel where the company, however successful, still plays second fiddle to giants Roche and Novartis.""Actelion's shares have risen 400 percent based on the strength of the PAH portfolio alone,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said. ""Even when Clozel has always made the case for independence, it's possible a stock price at its zenith, combined with his 61 years, could prompt a change of heart.""

259,"Nov 22, 2016 08:55AM ET","Currency drop hits Egypt's medicine supplies, angering public",nan,"By Arwa Gaballa and Eric KnechtCAIRO (Reuters) - Pharmacies across Egypt are running short of medicines, some of them life-savers, as a plunge in the value of the Egyptian pound coupled with strict government price caps has made scores of products unprofitable to produce or import.The shortages include some cancer treatments as well as basic items like insulin, tetanus shots and contraceptive pills.Unable to raise prices above levels set by the Health Ministry but now paying roughly twice as much to import drugs or active ingredients, pharmaceutical firms say they have been forced to phase out certain medicine to stay in business.""We aren't a charity. We have expenses and production costs, and if a company isn't making profit it will have to halt production,"" said Said Ibrahim, factory manager at EIPICO, one of Egypt's largest pharmaceutical companies.That brings no comfort to pharmacists and sick Egyptians.Out of insulin for weeks, Ali Etman said he was recently forced to turn away eight diabetes patients from his Cairo pharmacy in a single day.""Patients who come looking for insulin ask me: 'What am I supposed to do? Die?' and I don't know what to tell them. I don't have the drugs they need,"" Etman said.Egypt floated its currency on Nov. 3, abandoning a peg of 8.8 pounds to the U.S. dollar and allowing the currency to roughly halve in value to about 17.50 on Tuesday. The float helped the cash-strapped government clinch a $12 billion IMF loan it hopes will unlock investment and revive growth that has been hampered by political uncertainty since the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak.But the medicine shortages are piling pressure on the government of general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been at pains to reassure a populace already struggling with double-digit inflation and intermittent shortages that they would be shielded from the worst effects of economic reforms.Talk of a looming healthcare crisis has dominated popular evening chatshows, with doctors calling in nightly to report rapidly depleting stocks and patients being turned away from hospitals for lack of supplies.The Health Ministry has blamed the problem on panicking Egyptians hoarding medicines and said it would not raise prices.Drug shortages are not new to Egypt. More medicines had already begun disappearing from shelves early this year as a severe shortage of dollars in the banks meant pharmaceutical firms could not pay for the necessary imports.Egypt has struggled to earn enough dollars since the 2011 uprising scared off foreign investors and tourists and the central bank drained its reserves defending the currency peg.The Health Ministry set up a Drug Shortages Directorate in 2012 to minimize the impact by suggesting suitable substitutes for missing medicines. But the situation has only worsened.EIPICO's vice president told Reuters about 1,600 drugs had gone short in recent months, including 35 that have no alternatives and would disappear from the market if price caps were not eased.""Distributors are now telling pharmacies nothing imported is available. The problem has been going on for a while, but has only turned into a crisis in recent weeks,"" Etman said.SITUATION WORSENINGEgypt's drugs market is 40 percent multinational - big suppliers include  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi (PA:SASY) - and 60 percent domestic. Nearly all of it is in private hands, with annual sales worth a total of about 50 billion pounds before the float.Ahmed al-Ezaby, head of the medicine industry division at Federation of Egyptian Industries, said Egypt imports about $600 million in finished medicines per year and $1.8 billion in active ingredients.Officials at multinationals said they were concerned at the worsening situation. One industry source said companies were now in talks with Egyptian ministries on the possibility of restoring some prices to pre-Nov. 3 levels, in dollar terms, to ensure supplies of the most critical medicines.The multinationals have local factories set up but 15-20 percent of drugs are imported, while 80-85 percent are produced locally. About 70 percent of all drugs in Egypt are generic and domestic-made.A spokesman for Sanofi said the French group was ""actively engaging local authorities to define a sustainable pricing mechanism"".Egypt's supply problems echo those in Venezuela, where a lack of dollars has also created drug shortages and left manufacturers nursing big losses.   Before the flotation, Egypt faced a dollar shortage that saw imported goods ranging from electronic equipment to sugar disappear briefly from shelves in the past year.The central bank rationed supplies via weekly auctions, earmarking the little it had for essential items like medicine.Dollar supply is less of an issue since the flotation. But the cost of buying the greenback is because companies import active ingredients they need to make generic medicines.The government, which already raised prices on a slew of medicines this year, is under pressure to keep drugs affordable for tens of millions of poor Egyptians.It has blamed the crisis on hoarding and greed.  ""It's an orchestrated crisis. The decision to float the pound was taken...and two hours later people began saying we have a crisis and we don't have meds,"" Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Mogahed told the Egyptian TV channel Mehwar.""It's a way to push for a rise in medicine prices, which will not happen.""Mogahed did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.The companies want the government to remove the price caps entirely or re-adjust them to ease their losses.The Health Ministry met last week with drug industry leaders to discuss an emergency plan. It has offered to subsidize pharmaceutical companies to the tune of $165 million to support imports of life-saving drugs that have no viable substitutes, including some cancer treatments.Companies said the amount was not nearly enough while rolling out a new subsidy program would take time.""There's no way of knowing how long this amount will last because cancer drugs are expensive and it depends on the shortages, but the amount is not enough to solve the problem,"" said Adel Abdel Maksoud, head of the pharmacy division at the Cairo Chamber of Commerce.TWITTER PHARMACYIn the meantime the companies say they have to stop offering the drugs which most cut into their profits. Some have already sent back shipments that were ordered before the float but arrived after, as selling them at the fixed prices would have created big losses. They all say they have to downsize and cut out certain drugs.""We're working on a strategy to eliminate any product that's not profitable. But companies that depend on unprofitable products will be forced to shut down now given the new currency rate,"" said ITO Pharma's deputy general manager Mohamed Geoushy.More life-saving drugs will soon disappear, he said.His company is one of only two suppliers of cyclosporine, a drug used to prevent organ rejection during transplants. It recently stopped importing the drug, he said. Pharmacists say patients have no choice but to resort to a black market for once-common items like saline and glucose at prices often 10 times higher than the official caps and far beyond the reach of most.On Twitter, resourceful Egyptians have set up the hashtag ""Twitter_Pharmacy"" to swap medicines they cannot find in shops. Hospitals are using social media to advertise their needs.""Every minister should have sat down with the government after the float and discussed an emergency plan because it's a crisis if patients can't find life-saving medicines,"" said Osama Tahoon, general manager of medicine producer Julphar Egypt.""We can give up sugar or tea, but we can't give up medicine."""

(http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF)A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem.They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago.Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that ""Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently.""Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices ""independently"" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin.Merck makes other products to treat diabetes.Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. ""The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive,"" the pharmaceutical company said.Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan (NYSE:AGN_pa) Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent.""We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion,"" A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter.Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis.A spokesman from Teva said the company ""is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.""Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year.An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015.In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases.Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection.Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year.The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

275,"Nov 01, 2016 11:06AM ET","Pfizer scraps cholesterol fighter, trims profit forecast",nan,"By Ransdell Pierson(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said it halted development of a costly new type of cholesterol fighter because disappointing clinical trial data and an unfavorable market for similar approved drugs bode poorly for its injectable medicine.The largest U.S. drugmaker trimmed the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast on Tuesday due to costs of scrapping the experimental drug, called bococizumab, which works by blocking a protein called PCSK9.Pfizer said bococizumab gradually lost its potency in reducing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and caused more irritation at the injection site than similar recently approved drugs. Shares of Pfizer were down 1.3 percent in early trading. Pfizer was trying to catch up with two other PCSK9 inhibitors approved by U.S. regulators more than a year ago, Amgen Inc's (O:AMGN) Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY). The drugs can slash LDL cholesterol almost 60 percent, above and beyond reductions achieved with statins, but large ongoing trials have not yet determined whether they can actually cut the incidence of heart attacks. And Repatha and Praluent each have annual sales of only about $100 million, far below initial expectations, in part because insurers have blocked reimbursement due to annual costs of more than $14,000 each. ""The totality of clinical information now available for bococizumab, taken together with the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents, indicates that bococizumab in not likely to provide value to patients, physicians or shareholders,"" Pfizer said in a news release.Pfizer cut the upper end of its 2016 earnings forecast to $2.43 per share from $2.48 while retaining the lower end at $2.38. The drugmaker, which in September decided not to split itself into two, said it earned 61 cents per share in the third quarter, excluding special items. The results missed the analysts' average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly sales of $13.05 billion matched Wall Street expectations.One of Pfizer's most important new drugs is breast cancer treatment Ibrance, which has a list price of about $10,000 a month and blocks two enzymes known as CDK-4 and CDK-6. Its sales of $550 million trailed forecasts of $576 million, and competition looms from similar drugs being developed by  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) and Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY). Pfizer raised the lower end of its full-year revenue forecast to $52 billion from $51 billion, while keeping the upper end at $53 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

279,"Oct 04, 2016 07:23AM ET",Zika vaccine race spurred by crisis and profit potential,nan,"By Bill BerkrotNEW YORK (Reuters) - The race to find protection against the Zika virus is fueled by something often missing from tropical disease research: the potential for big profit.The prospect of a blockbuster vaccine against a mosquito-borne virus has accelerated the pace of development and attracted the interest of big drugmakers, including Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) and Takeda Pharmaceuticals (T:4502).Although Zika infections are mild or asymptomatic in most people, demand for a vaccine is expected to be strong because it can cause devastating birth defects, pharmaceutical executives and disease experts said.The most lucrative market is seen in travelers seeking inoculation against the virus that has moved rapidly across the Americas and is the only mosquito-borne disease also spread through sex.""It scares people,"" said Scott Weaver, a virologist with the University of Texas and chairman of the Zika task force for the Global Virus Network. ""Europeans and Americans can pay a pretty high price for these kinds of vaccines.""A vaccine could come to market in as little as two years. Even if the current outbreaks in Latin America and the Caribbean burn out by that time, people living in those regions are expected to want protection against a return of Zika.Tens of millions of travelers from United States and other wealthy nations, including people on business trips with corporate-sponsored health coverage, are expected to get vaccines before visiting areas where Zika is circulating.""If you consider just a portion of the U.S. traveler population, we can conservatively envision a Zika market opportunity exceeding $1 billion"" a year, said Joseph Kim, chief executive of Inovio Pharmaceuticals (O:INO), a Pennsylvania company that is farthest along in the development path with human testing of a vaccine candidate underway in hard hit Puerto Rico.Drugmakers and disease experts also envision the vaccine becoming standard care for girls before puberty to guard against birth defects in future pregnancies. Boys also could be candidates to protect eventual sexual partners.""Hopefully a vaccine can be developed that's sold for a low cost in endemic areas,"" Weaver said.ZIKA'S DIFFERENCE Blockbuster sales for vaccines against mosquito-borne viruses are unheard of. Sanofi's dengue vaccine, approved in nine countries, is generating near-blockbuster expectations, the biggest in the market by far. Analysts forecast annual sales for Dengvaxia reaching about $900 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Efforts to find a malaria vaccine are purely philanthropic. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has contributed significantly to GSK's decades-long effort to produce a vaccine for children in Africa. Development is ongoing, and GSK expects no profit.The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a potential vaccine for West Nile virus, but it failed to find a commercial partner because the virus did not inspire enough public alarm to generate big sales. West Nile leads to serious complications in less than 1 percent of people infected.In February, the World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency because of Zika's apparent link to microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small heads and serious developmental problems. That, and evidence of other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to Zika, have galvanized efforts to speed vaccine development.The NIH is negotiating with companies to produce Zika vaccines but has its own pilot plant that can make enough for early clinical testing, which began with its first candidate in August.""We're not dependent on a company until you prove it works and then you need somebody to manufacture millions of doses,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The first NIH candidate is a DNA vaccine containing no actual virus, in which genetically engineered cells produce an antigen that triggers an immune response, similar to the West Nile vaccine. By early 2017, the agency expects to be able to decide whether to begin enrolling thousands of patients in an efficacy study, or move on to the next candidate.The size of the Zika outbreak may help development efforts. If it remains widespread, it will be easier to tell if a vaccine is effective.""If the infections die down, then it's going to take much longer to find out if it works,"" Fauci said.A second NIH candidate contains inactivated viral material, while a third utilizes attenuated, or weakened, live virus.DNA-based candidates are most likely to prove safe, but they typically require multiple doses to work. Vaccines that contain live virus are considered most effective with one dose, but have a far higher safety hurdle, particularly if they are intended for pregnant women, and so they take longer to get to market.INDUSTRY PILES INInovio's DNA vaccine is injected along with a brief low voltage electronic pulse that induces cell membranes to open, making them more receptive, in theory, to accepting the vaccine's genetic material.Privately-held Protein Sciences Corp built its Zika vaccine using technology similar to its already approved Flublok flu vaccine. The drugmaker has partnerships with companies in Argentina, Brazil, Japan and Mexico and plans to seek funding from Brazil and the NIH. It expects to start human trials by January.Chief Executive Manon Cox estimated the cost of developing and securing approval for a vaccine could be as high as $1 billion. Without government funding, ""that product has got to have a market of a few billion dollars,"" she said.With the help of $43 million in initial funding from the U.S. government, France's Sanofi is developing a candidate using live attenuated virus. The company is not as far along as some other efforts, but it aims to start human trials next year and is confident it can catch up.""We've got technologies, infrastructure, experience dealing with regulators in this field. All of that gives us a jumpstart,"" said Nick Jackson, head of research for Sanofi's vaccine unit.Another French vaccine maker,  Valneva  SE (PA:VLS), generated an inactivated Zika vaccine candidate using the same process as its already approved Japanese encephalitis vaccine.GSK is working with NIAID on a new type of vaccine technology. Japan's Takeda also secured U.S. government funding to help develop a vaccine using killed Zika virus and plans to begin human testing in the second half of 2017.""If there is a huge need,"" said Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's global vaccine unit, ""there will be a business model that works.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

280,"Sep 30, 2016 02:20AM ET",Gut feeling: new CEO to steer Nestle down uncharted health path,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - Switzerland's Nestle, the world's largest food company, wants to tune up your guts. Last weekend, it hosted global experts in Playa del Carmen, Mexico for a three-day workshop on the intestinal microbiome to discuss how trillions of bacteria living in the digestive system can impact everything from obesity to depression.One attendee was Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, whose family ran a German confectionery business, giving him a unique perspective on Nestle's ambitions. ""Food companies have a real opportunity to continue to sell their products and at the same time be responsive to the emerging medical science in this area,"" he told Reuters, highlighting the role played by good bugs, especially in early life. Using them to cure disease and boost wellness is one of several bets KitKat maker Nestle is making in the field of health and nutritional science, as it seeks to offset slowing sales of traditional processed foods. Ulf Mark Schneider, a German medical industry veteran, is expected to speed the drive into health-oriented products when he becomes the first Nestle outsider chief executive in nearly a century in January. He will assume direct oversight of the health science business, which currently operates as a standalone unit. Schneider's hiring from healthcare firm Fresenius signals Nestle's commitment to pioneering the interface of food and medicine, in part by focusing on nascent areas like microbiome therapy, which has potential to boost human health and Nestle's margins. The concept has already given the world faecal transplants that can cure patients with life-threatening C. difficile infections by replenishing their gut flora with bacteria from a healthy person's stool, delivered via a nasal or rectal tube. Nestle -- famous for chocolate bars and ice cream -- is aiming for more appetizing products. But some long-term investors are queasy about its bets on early, unproven science that is taking the company down a road that has already seen crashes. The hazards were highlighted two months ago when U.S. biotech firm Seres Therapeutics, in which Nestle has invested $185 million, said its pill for C. difficile containing spores from good bacteria had failed in a clinical trial. Seres shares lost three-quarters of their value, dealing a blow to Nestle, its second-biggest shareholder.""It shows we still don't understand enough about how the microbial community really works,"" said Tim Spector, a professor of genetics at Kings College London. But he added that such trial failures were not unusual with experimental drugs and he remained optimistic about future research.Seres, which at the time described the results as ""unexpected"" and said it was continuing research efforts, declined to comment further to Reuters. WHERE'S THE RETURN Nestle sees its investments as future-proofing its business and carving out a competitive edge with food and drinks fortified by medical technology. It is not becoming a pharmaceuticals company, said its chief financial officer, who spent more than 20 years at the predecessor companies of French pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY).""There is no clear line between what is food and beverage on one side and pharma on the other,"" CFO Francois-Xavier Roger told Reuters. ""There are certain areas which are at the frontier of both."" Nestle has forecast its health science unit to reach annual sales of $10 billion, up from around $2 billion currently, though it has not said by when.Roger declined to estimate what Nestle has spent building up its health science unit, which employs now some 3,000 people. But he described the approach as involving modest bets made with a long-term horizon. ""Not all of them will succeed, but most of them will,"" he said, noting such risks were no different than what the food giant did with Nespresso, the first single-serve coffee, which took more than a decade to turn a profit.Still, there is investor concern that its recent spate of deals, while small, are not yet paying off. ""While we would expect acquisitions to be dilutive in the first two to three years, we expect a recovery thereafter,"" analysts at Bernstein said earlier this month, when downgrading Nestle shares to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"". ""There is currently no sign of this at Nestle,"" they said. Nestle's return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen to 10.9 percent in 2015 from 15.5 percent in 2010. ""That's not what you're supposed to be doing,"" said fund manager Ali Miremadi of GAM Holding, a Nestle shareholder. If that decline continues, he said Nestle risks losing its position as the keystone consumer goods investment in Europe to  Unilever  (LON:ULVR). Unilever, which has also been on an acquisition spree, had a ROIC of 18.9 percent last year. Regardless of the financial returns, academic investment in the microbiome is booming, with 8,800 scientific papers published in leading journals since 2006, half of them in the last two years, according to the Web of Science, a Thomson Reuters database. And the U.S. government endorsed the field in May by launching a National Microbiome Initiative with a combined federal agency investment of more than $121 million in 2016 and 2017. ""The microbiome is one of the hottest areas in medicine right now but we're only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding host-microbe interactions and how diet can be such a modifying influence,"" said John Cryan of Ireland's University College Cork. He and colleagues recently published a paper called ""Transferring the blues,"" showing that feeding gut bacteria from humans with depression reproduced depressive behavior in rats. CORPORATE COMPETITION Other corporations are looking on hungrily, too. French food firm Danone, the world's biggest yogurt maker, has long championed probiotics, live bacteria that can be added to food for their health benefits. One of its biggest products, Activia yogurt, boasts a particular bacterial culture it says has a beneficial effect on digestion. Several years ago it faced class action lawsuits related to the accuracy of health claims it had been making on Activia and DanActive. The case exposed a big challenge facing companies hoping to carve out a new business between food and medicine: regulation. So far, Nestle and its rivals have concentrated mainly on dietary supplements, which can get to market far more quickly than pharmaceuticals requiring lengthy clinical trials. But in future Nestle wants to invent products that are closer to scientifically proven medicines, while still potentially coming in the form of a tasty snack or drink. Regulators are wary, however, having been criticized in the past for allowing unjustified claims for some fortified and functional foods, sales of which reached $258 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor. Another Nestle-backed company, U.S. biotech firm Accera, was issued a warning in 2013 by U.S. health regulators over claims related to its Axona drink for Alzheimer's patients. Despite potential bumps in the road, long-time Nestle shareholder, Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo & Gardner, believes Nestle's move into health is a good one, as long as it doesn't stray too far from its core business. ""The benefit that comes from this is not just the revenues that come from Nestle Health Science, it's the work that's done through it to make the core products better for you,"" Russo said. ""It really surfaces throughout the entire offering."" ($1 = 0.9657 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

283,"Sep 22, 2016 11:20AM ET",Hard to swallow: emerging markets get tougher for drugmakers,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets have lost their luster for Big Pharma making drug firms ever more dependent on the United States for growth just as American anger over high medicine prices is building. A few years ago, the developing world was seen as a savior as patent after patent expired across the United States and Europe, but emerging market sales growth at the top drug firms slowed to less than two percent in the latest quarter.Forecasts from independent experts IMS Health now suggest the United States will account for 55 percent of sales growth between 2016 and 2020, with emerging markets only contributing 30 percent. The slowdown in China and other top emerging markets is being driven by a number of factors: government pressure on drug prices, slowing economies and in some cases significant currency devaluations.But the end result is that prescriptions for Americans will fund an even greater slice of the $1 trillion-a-year pharmaceuticals industry.Company executives insist markets from China to Colombia to Mexico to Myanmar are an important engine of long-term growth, given rising populations, increasing wealth, and the global march of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.""We have seen some flattening of growth, notably in Brazil and Russia, but in the long run we still expect that emerging markets will outgrow mature markets by 2 to 3 percentage points,"" Olivier Charmeil, who heads up emerging markets operations at French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY), told Reuters.GlaxoSmithKline's incoming chief executive Emma Walmsley, meanwhile, highlighted the potential of China, saying after being appointed to the top job this week that she was ""very excited about what we can do with GSK there"".NOT PRETTYBut the short-term picture is not pretty. Emerging market growth is the slowest since drug companies started breaking out such regional sales numbers about seven years ago, with GSK languishing at the bottom of the class.GSK's drug sales in China fell 14 percent in the three months to the end of June as the company continued to reshape its business following a damaging corruption scandal in 2013, leaving a question mark over whether it can return to growth this year as hoped.Others are doing better in China, which is now the world's second biggest drugs market behind the United States, but all are struggling with slowing sales growth, which slipped to its lowest rate since 2008 in July.""Across the board, we are seeing emerging markets register lower growth in local currency and in many cases there have also been big currency devaluations,"" said Murray Aitken, IMS Health senior vice president and executive director.The pharmaceutical industry tends to measure its sales performance in local currencies but in dollar terms devaluations wiped an estimated 77 percent off emerging market growth between 2013 and 2015, IMS calculates.""Some of our biggest emerging markets have seen huge currency devaluations,"" said Christophe Weber, CEO of Takeda Pharmaceutical, which ramped up its exposure to new markets in 2011 by buying Swiss group Nycomed.""But in the long term, when you have a world of more than seven billion people, I feel more comfortable if we are providing our medicines to a wide range of people.""RICH PICKINGSSucceeding in developing markets has never been plain sailing, with lower profit margins than developed markets due to competition from low-cost local suppliers and the need for investment.By comparison, the United States offers rich pickings at the moment thanks to hugely profitable new drugs for diseases such as cancer and hepatitis C.That disparity is an issue for investors trying to value growth outside the West, with some of the most highly rated drug stocks being those that have stepped back from emerging markets, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb.Its trades at 21 times this year's expected earnings whereas Sanofi is valued at just 12.5 times earnings.The French firm takes top spot in emerging markets among multinationals, with 29 percent of its second-quarter sales generated there, followed by AstraZeneca on 26 percent, according to Bernstein analysts.Many companies' sales in developing economies come from so-called branded generics, or off-patent medicines that command a premium to those made by local suppliers because the Western drugmaker's name is a proxy for quality.That business is now under threat as governments promote cheaper unbranded products as a route to universal healthcare. ""There is a lot of emphasis on providing essential medicines, which is providing growth for cheap local generics but not necessarily for multinational companies,"" said Aitken.One sign of the tougher times is the relative dearth of acquisitions in emerging markets by international players after a slew of multibillion-dollar deals between 2008 and 2011.Still, Sanofi's Charmeil is scouting: ""We are looking for opportunities and if we think it makes sense for our portfolio, we are ready to go for it.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

284,"Sep 22, 2016 08:30AM ET","UnitedHealth trims drug coverage, including Sanofi insulin",nan,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, will stop covering several brand-name drugs as of next year, reinforcing a trend of payers steering prescriptions to lower-priced options.In a bulletin seeking client feedback by Sept. 28, UnitedHealth said it is changing reimbursement terms for long-acting insulins and will no longer cover Lantus, the main insulin drug sold by Sanofi (PA:SASY).The insurer said Basaglar, a cheaper biosimilar insulin sold by Eli Lilly (N:LLY) would be covered as ""Tier 1,"" meaning the lowest out-of-pocket costs for members. Levemir, produced by  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), will move from Tier 1 to Tier 2.CVS Health (N:CVS) made a similar move last month to drop Lantus in favor of Lilly's new biosimilar.Analysts at Jefferies said the sales impact of the United exclusion should be less than that from the CVS move, because the United plan covers around 15 million people while CVS covers 19 million.Sanofi shares fell more than 1 percent on Thursday after the news but had recovered by 1200 GMT, while Novo was down 1.3 percent. Sanofi reaffirmed its sales expectations despite the latest exclusion. A spokeswoman said the company was still targeting a decline in diabetes drug sales of 4 to 8 percent a year until 2018.""We are disappointed with the decision. For Sanofi, it is a pity not to leave doctors a choice,"" she said. ""We had anticipated this kind of decision but we are holding discussions with other organisations in the United States to have them keep Lantus on their lists.""Biosimilars are cheaper copies of protein-based biotech drugs such as Lantus, which are no longer protected by patents. They cannot be precisely replicated like conventional chemical drugs but have been shown to be equivalent in terms of efficacy and side effects.United also said it will exclude from coverage Amgen's (O:AMGN) white blood cell-boosting drug Neupogen, in favor of Zarxio, a biosimilar sold by  Novartis  (S:NOVN).UnitedHealth last year bought Catamaran for $12.8 billion, making it the nation's No. 3 pharmacy benefit manager after Express Scripts Holding (O:ESRX) and Caremark, which is owned by CVS.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

287,"Sep 15, 2016 12:16PM ET","Teva, Intel to develop wearable technology for Huntington's disease",nan,"(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) said on Thursday it was collaborating with  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) to develop a wearable technology platform to track the progression of disease in patients with Huntington's, a fatal degenerative disorder.The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability.There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington's, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis.Teva (N:TEVA), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington's study, the Israeli company said on Thursday.Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement.The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity.The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware.Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare.The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions.Businesses such as Apple (O:AAPL), Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products.Earlier this month, Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care.In August, GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics.Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.Sanofi (PA:SASY) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (O:BIIB) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis.Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM's (N:IBM) Watson Health.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

288,"Sep 04, 2016 07:10AM ET",Exclusive: Saudi state fund plans stake in big industrial zone - source,nan,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh and Andrew TorchiaDUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund is negotiating to buy a stake in one of the kingdom's most ambitious real estate projects as Riyadh restructures the economy to cope with low oil prices, a source familiar with the plan said.The Public Investment Fund aims to invest in King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) on the Red Sea coast near Jeddah, the source said.That would inject capital into the business zone, now being developed by Emaar the Economic City (EEC) (SE:4220), a Saudi consortium affiliated with Dubai's Emaar Properties Group (DU:EMAR), developer of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Launched in 2005, KAEC had a population of only about 5,000 people and 120 industrial tenants at the end of last year, but says it plans to grow swiftly into a full-blown metropolis.The chief executive of the city, Fahd Al Rasheed, told Reuters in January its population was projected to hit 50,000 by 2020, with an ultimate target of 2 million around 2035.Tenants now include French pharmaceutical maker Sanofi (PA:SASY), a venture involving U.S. battery maker  Johnson Controls  (N:JCI) and producers of building materials.But with economic growth slowing sharply because of cheap oil, the government wants such zones to expand much faster and focus more on industries such as tourism, medical care and education to diversify the economy beyond oil and create jobs.Under economic reforms announced in April, the government said it would work with companies developing major business zones to ""revamp"" them; KAEC may be the first of those cases.""What they can do is inject cash. It’s no secret KAEC needs a lot of equity for this project,"" the source said of the PIF's plan. KAEC, EEC and the PIF declined to comment.The source, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is not yet public, said the PIF could either buy a stake directly in KAEC and serve as a partner to develop the project along with EEC, or take a stake in EEC itself.EEC obtained a 5 billion riyal ($1.33 billion) loan from the Saudi Ministry of Finance in 2011, which has been extended until 2026, and the source said the company had a similar amount of debt to commercial banks. An investment by the PIF in the economic city would be a step in the fund's development as one of the most important institutions in the Saudi economy, using its financial power to push projects which the government considers vital.Under the economic reforms, the government has said it will expand the PIF from 600 billion riyals to over 7 trillion riyals, by giving it assets such as ownership of state oil giant Saudi Aramco. That would make the PIF the world's biggest sovereign fund by far, on paper though not necessarily in terms of the cash it had available for investment.The PIF will invest abroad - in June, it bought a stake in U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber for $3.5 billion - but it will focus much of its money and management attention on domestic projects designed to reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil exports.For example, the PIF will take over Riyadh’s floundering King Abdullah Financial District and restructure the project, sources have told Reuters. It is also expected to get involved in developing a Saudi shipbuilding industry and in restructuring state firms such as utility Saudi Electricity Co (SE:5110).The PIF will ""help unlock strategic sectors requiring intensive capital inputs. This will contribute towards developing entirely new economic sectors and establishing durable national corporations,"" the national reform plan reads.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

289,"Aug 29, 2016 05:39PM ET",Mylan to launch generic EpiPen at half the price of original,nan,"By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell Pierson(Reuters) - Mylan NV (O:MYL) said it would launch the first generic version of its allergy auto-injector EpiPen for $300, half the price of the branded product, the drugmaker's second step in less than a week to counter the backlash over the product's steep price.The company reduced the out-of-pocket costs of EpiPen for some patients on Thursday, but kept the list price at about $600, a move that U.S. lawmakers and Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said was not enough. EpiPen cost about $100 in 2008.Mylan said on Monday it expected to launch the generic product ""in several weeks"", an unusual move considering the branded bestseller is still patent protected and major rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearances.""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Monday. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""Mylan's price move failed to squelch criticism of the company's huge price increase for EpiPen since it acquired the product in 2007. The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Mylan's CEO on Monday seeking documents on EpiPen pricing, including those relating to revenue from EpiPen sales since 2007, manufacturing costs, and the amount of money the company receives from federal government health care programs.And former Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted on Monday, ""At $300 generic EpiPens will still cost 3 times more than they did in 2007. This isn't a discount. It's a PR move.""Consumer watchdog group Public Citizen said Mylan's latest move was another ""convoluted mechanism to avoid plain talk."" It said activists on Tuesday will deliver petitions from more than 600,000 consumers and allergy sufferers to Mylan's headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, demanding further price cuts.""We would like the company to drop the price to $100 for two EpiPens,"" said Public Citizen spokeswoman Angela Bradbery, adding that was about the price charged in France. She said the petitions were gathered by it and various other consumer groups, including Consumers Union. EpiPen has a 94 percent market share for auto-injector devices, which jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings. The biggest danger is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated. Its only U.S. competitor is Adrenaclick, a device sold by Impax Laboratories (O:IPXL) that has not caught on with patients and doctors. The product, which is assembled by hand and is not considered by regulators to be an exact copy of EpiPen, has a list price of more than $400. Impax spokesman Mark Donohue declined to comment on whether the company would lower Adrenaclick's list price given the planned cheaper price of Mylan's genericDr. Howard Selinger, chairman of family medicine at Quinnipiac University, said he has only written two prescriptions for Adrenaclick because it is not much cheaper than EpiPen. Many other doctors do not even know the product's name because of EpiPen's long domination, he said.Industry analysts said the biggest potential threat to EpiPen is a similar device being developed by rival generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA).The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February declined to approve the product because of dosing problems. But some analysts believe Teva, after fixing the issue, could re-apply for approval and have its product on the market as soon as next year, and win considerable market share.Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) pulled its own device from the market last year, also on concerns of inaccurate dosage. It returned rights to the product to tiny privately held drugmaker Kaleo.Mylan has defended EpiPen's high price, saying it had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the product since acquiring it in 2007.It has said it recoups less than half the list price as pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers, are involved, along with insurers and others.Mylan shares closed up 0.4 percent at $43.22 on the Nasdaq, amid a moderate upturn for the broader stock market. The stock had fallen 12 percent last week amid a wave of criticism over prices of EpiPen, which generates annual sales of $1 billion.Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said though Mylan had ""infinite possibilities"" to handle the outcry over EpiPen prices, the generic launch was ""the big one"" and would help PBMs cap their costs.However, he expects Mylan to still come under fire for its prices and U.S. health regulators to face more pressure to approve competing treatments.Some lawmakers last week asked the Food and Drug Administration about its approval process for rival treatments.Leerink Partners said that the generic launch only removed a near-term pricing lever for Mylan as they expect the launch of Teva's version in 2018 to become a pricing headwind.Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage over drug price increases. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) International Inc (TO:VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84. The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA's (PA:SASY) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition. The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica.Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics. Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (N:AGN) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio.The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments.Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines. ""The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio.A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business. Pfizer's biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (N:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively.Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (T:4503) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period.Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists.""The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,"" Read predicted.Some analysts, including BMO's Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi's potential for earlier treatment in coming years.Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck,  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) and  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation. ""Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ... we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,"" RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement. Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a ""disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders."" Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter.Shares of other cancer drug companies, including  Incyte Corp  (O:INCY) and Seattle Genetics (O:SGEN), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about more dealmaking in the sector. Pfizer's financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation's financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

292,"Aug 22, 2016 03:57AM ET",Pfizer is reportedly close to spending $14 billion on cancer drugmaker Medivation,nan," Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) is reportedly close to scooping up cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion.The  Financial Times and  Bloomberg are reporting that the deal could close as soon as Monday, citing people close to the deal.A $14 billion deal would value Medivation at more than $80 a share, a notable premium to the $52.50-a-share offer the pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) had made earlier this year.Medivation shares ended trading at $67.16 on Friday.Sanofi went public with its $9.3 billion bid for the company in April. Medivation had rejected that bid but it wasn't long before it was fielding other offers and analysts were speculating about possible buyers, including reports that Pfizer — which in  April terminated its merger with Allergan (NYSE:AGN_pa) after the  US Treasury released new rules — was in the mix.Pfizer declined to comment. Medivation did not immediately respond to request for comment.The San Francisco-based biotech already has one drug on the market to treat prostate cancer. And its big appeal comes from an experimental breast-cancer treatment called talazoparib. It still hasn't been approved for use, but the drug also has potential as a treatment of cervical, lung, and ovarian cancers.In a July conference call,  Medivation talked up the value of talazoparib, saying that it has the potential to be ""best-in-class"" among so-called PARP inhibitors — a new type of medicine that blocks a particular enzyme that's used by our cells to repair DNA so that tumors can't survive.Here's what's in Medivation's pipeline that could make it worth a $14 billion sale:NEXT: This $10 billion drugmaker is the hottest thing in the industry — and it knows itRELATED: Intellia CEO: There won’t be a 'next CRISPR'"

296,"Aug 01, 2016 09:51AM ET",Pharma and tech converge in 'fantastic voyage' to fight disease,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware.GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) are the latest to share expertise, unveiling a new joint company on Monday that aims to market bioelectronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves.The plan to wrap a grain-sized electronic collar around nerves sounds like something from 'Fantastic Voyage', the 1966 sci-fi film in which a submarine is shrunk to fix an injured scientist's brain, yet GSK and Alphabet are not alone in pushing the boundaries in medical tech in this way.U.S. biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics (O:ETRM) have already shown the early benefits of bioelectronics both to tackle inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and suppress appetite in the obese.Others are miniaturizing technology in different ways. Medtronic  (N:MDT), for example, sells a well-established camera-in-a-pill as an alternative to colonoscopies, while Proteus Digital Technology is working with drugmakers on pills with embedded microchips that measure drug usage. Makers of lung treatments are racing to make smart inhalers.""It's an area that hotting up pretty fast because the technology is moving so fast,"" said Hilary Thomas, chief medical adviser at KPMG.Many of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies have turned to tech experts at Alphabet, including Swiss-based  Novartis  (S:NOVN), which is working with the U.S. group on a smart contact lens with an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.Sanofi (PA:SASY) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (O:BIIB) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis.Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has said that the combination of pharmaceuticals and technology will eventually be ""front and center"" in disease management.Certainly, many technology companies are pushing hard into the healthcare arena, especially when it comes to finding new ways for patients to monitor their own health and track chronic conditions using smart devices.Businesses such as Apple (O:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), along with Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products.Technology and pharmaceutical companies alike believe accurate monitoring using wearables will dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare.The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions.Real-time feedback on how patients are doing is one of the benefits of bioelectronics, according to Kris Famm, the GSK scientist who has been appointed president of the new jointly owned GSK-Alphabet company Galvani Bioelectronics.""It will really help us hone the intervention,"" he said. ""This is almost the epicenter of convergence because the technology is not only helping you to monitor a disease but it is also actually the therapy.""There are still plenty of hurdles ahead, including the need for multi-year clinical trials to prove that the new technologies are safe, effective and can deliver the kind of benefits to overall clinical outcomes that proponents hope.Regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also need to be convinced of the case for radically new ways of treating and monitoring patients.""The challenge will be to make sure that regulators are on board, although the FDA is much more innovative than it was 10 years ago about accepting different endpoints for treating disease,"" said KPMG's Thomas."

300,"Jul 05, 2016 03:30PM ET",Exclusive: Medivation discusses potential sale to Sanofi - sources,nan,"By Michael Flaherty and Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - U.S. cancer drug company  Medivation  Inc (O:MDVN) is discussing opening its books to Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) after the French pharmaceutical company sweetened its $9.3 billion acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The talks come after Medivation rejected Sanofi's $52.50 per share cash offer in April, prompting Sanofi to embark on a campaign to convince Medivation shareholders to oust Medivation's board of directors and replace them with its nominees in a so-called written consent process. Medivation is negotiating the terms of a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi that would allow the two companies to engage in deal negotiations, the people said. Medivation has already signed confidentiality agreements to discuss a potential sale with other companies, including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG), the people added.There is no certainty that Medivation will agree to a sale with any party, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Medivation and Sanofi declined to comment, while Pfizer and Celgene did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Medivation shares jumped as much as 4.2 percent on the news and were trading up 2.5 percent at $61.62 in afternoon trading in New York.Sanofi's new offer, whose terms could not be immediately learned, came following conversations with Medivation shareholders. Last month, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co recommended that Medivation's shareholders should not support Sanofi's efforts to replace the company's board members. Sanofi wants Medivation - which sells a successful prostate cancer drug called Xtandi - so Sanofi can expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it seeks new businesses to compensate for flagging diabetes revenues.Reuters had reported in May that Medivation had signed confidentiality agreements with some companies, including Pfizer.Medivation had previously argued that Sanofi's offer had failed to value fairly the prospects for Xtandi, as well as two other products currently in clinical trials - Talazoparib, for the treatment of breast cancer, and Pidilizumab, for the treatment of blood cancers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A further two cases came from remote forested areas not linked to the current outbreak. Five people in total have died, Kabange added.""I declare today a localized epidemic of yellow fever in the provinces of Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango,"" Kabange told a news conference. Kinshasa is the primary concern for global health officials since it has a densely-packed population of more than 12 million and poor healthcare infrastructure.Yellow fever is transmitted by the same mosquitoes that spread the Zika and dengue viruses, although it is a much more serious disease. The ""yellow"" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some infected patients.The global stockpile of vaccines has already been depleted twice this year to immunize people in Angola, Uganda and Congo. It stands at 6 million doses, but this may not be enough if there are simultaneous outbreaks in multiple highly-populated areas, experts warn.Almost 18 million doses have been distributed for emergency vaccination campaigns so far in the three African countries.The current method for making vaccines, using chicken eggs, takes a year.World Health Organisation (WHO) advisers have recommended using a fifth of the standard dose of vaccine in the event of a global shortage - enough to immunize temporarily but not to give lifelong immunity.""An epidemic in such a large city (as Kinshasa) is always difficult to handle,"" said WHO's Congo representative Yokouide Allarangar.A vaccination campaign has been staged in two of the city's health zones deemed as high risk because the virus is circulating but is not linked to imported cases, he said.""We need to quickly try to contain these zones where the virus circulates to prevent the disease from spreading to other zones,"" he said, adding that a million of the city's residents have been vaccinated so far.Manufacturers of the vaccine include the Institut Pasteur, government factories in Brazil and Russia as well as French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY).Congo's outbreak, since January, comes at a time when political tensions linked to an upcoming presidential election and an economic crisis stoked by a slump in global commodity prices is already putting a huge strain on the country's stability.President Joseph Kabila is facing opposition, which has sometimes turned violent, amid concerns that he will try to cling to power beyond the expiry of his mandate at year-end.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

305,"Jun 15, 2016 06:36PM ET",Visium's Valvani charged with insider trading on FDA leaks,nan,"By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan hedge fund manager was charged on Wednesday with trading on confidential tips about drug approvals, in one of the biggest insider trading cases since a 2014 court ruling made it harder for U.S. prosecutors to pursue them.U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan accused Sanjay Valvani of Visium Asset Management LP of fraudulently making $25 million by gaining advance word about U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals of generic drug applications.Prosecutors said the inside information was provided by Gordon Johnston, a consultant who got tips from a friend and former FDA colleague still working at the agency.Valvani passed some of these tips to Christopher Plaford, then a Visium portfolio manager, who made his own illegal trades, prosecutors said.""Sadly these are schemes we see time and time again, where lies and use of non-public information profits those conducting the crimes, and everyday investors lose out,"" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a statement.Prosecutors also accused Plaford and Stefan Lumiere, another former Visium portfolio manager, of fraudulently inflating the value and liquidity of a bond fund they oversaw by getting ""sham"" price quotations from brokers, in an effort to prevent investors from demanding their money back.""AN INNOCENT MAN""Bharara has won dozens of insider trading convictions over the last several years, including of hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam and Steven A. Cohen's firm SAC Capital Advisors.But such cases became tougher to prosecute in December 2014 when a federal appeals court in Manhattan voided his convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson.That court said prosecutors needed to show that traders knew the people who provided inside tips received something consequential in exchange.Barry Berke, a lawyer for Valvani, in a statement accused Bharara of ""stretching the facts and law to try to transform entirely innocent trading decisions into a crime.""Berke also called Valvani ""an innocent man whose investment decisions were always based on rigorous and entirely appropriate research and analysis.""Valvani, 44, of Brooklyn, New York, pleaded not guilty in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to five counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. He was freed on $5 million bond secured by his home.Lumiere, 45, of New York, was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy, and freed on $1 million bond after a brief court appearance. He did not enter a plea.Johnston, 64, of Olney, Maryland, and Plaford, 38, of Bedford, New York, pleaded guilty earlier this month to related charges and are cooperating with prosecutors.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against all four defendants. It said Valvani's illegal profit, including from other trades, was $32 million.Lumiere's lawyer Eric Creizman, Plaford's lawyer David Smith and Johnston's lawyer Christopher Mead declined to comment.A MOMENTA TIPFounded in 2005 by Jason Gottlieb, who has a medical degree, Visium oversees about $7 billion of assets. Last month, The Wall Street Journal said investors asked to redeem about $1.5 billion after news of the federal probes surfaced.The Visium Global multi-strategy fund gained 10.2 percent in 2015, and the Visium Balanced healthcare fund rose 5.6 percent.""I am deeply saddened by today's events,"" Gottlieb said in an email. Visium was not charged.Valvani's alleged scheme ran from 2005 to 2011, centered on ""political intelligence"" that Johnston got from his former colleague at the FDA,] where he was once deputy director of the Office of Generic Drugs.According to court papers, Visium paid Johnston hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years, but Valvani asked its chief financial officer in a Jan. 6, 2010 email to award a raise.Johnston ""is without question the most valuable consultant I've ever worked with and I'm pushing to reinforce the value of the relationship and encourage him to continue to go above and beyond for our team,"" Valvani allegedly wrote.Prosecutors said he did just that, sending tips about  Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc's (O:MNTA) effort to win FDA approval for the first generic equivalent to Sanofi SA's (PA:SASY) Lovenox, for treating deep vein thrombosis.After Momenta won approval in July 2010, causing its stock to rise 82 percent in one day, Valvani made $25 million from selling his Momenta stock, and closing bets that Sanofi stock would fall because of the new competition, prosecutors said.The SEC said Valvani reaped another $7 million by later selling Momenta short, based on tips that Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc might also win approval for a Lovenox generic.These trades helped Valvani receive bonuses topping $11.5 million in 2010 and $10.5 million in 2011, dwarfing his $2.5 million bonus in 2009, the SEC said.Prosecutors said Valvani called Johnston in January 2011 to end their relationship, ""in the wake of news reports of insider trading investigations.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

306,"Jun 13, 2016 05:50PM ET",Novo diabetes drug cuts heart risks by 13 percent in key trial,nan,"By Ben Hirschler(Reuters) - Novo Nordisk's (CO:NOVOb) top-selling diabetes drug Victoza cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death by 13 percent in a closely watched study that may help boost sales of the injectable medicine.Victoza is only the second diabetes drug to show such heart benefits, after Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and Boehringer Ingelheim's pill Jardiance. Victoza's effect was evident in all areas.""To me, the impressive thing about this trial is the consistency across clinical endpoints and its robustness,"" said John Buse, professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, who worked on the study.He believes doctors' approach to type 2 diabetes treatment will now start to shift to a greater focus on minimizing overall risks, rather than simply cutting blood sugar levels.Because about half of deaths in people with diabetes are caused by heart disease, reducing heart risk is considered essential to their care.Novo, the world's biggest diabetes company, had already said in March that Victoza cut heart risks ""significantly"" in the study but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed on Monday.Researchers told the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) annual meeting that 13.0 percent of patients on Victoza died from cardiovascular cases or suffered non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, against 14.9 percent of those on placebo.The clinical trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Victoza did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for Novo, especially as Sanofi's (PA:SASY) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test.Victoza, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is the biggest seller in a class of drugs known as GLP-1 analogues that stimulate insulin production.""I think physicians will look to GLP-1s with greater enthusiasm,"" Buse said in an interview.Once-daily Victoza is typically prescribed as a third or fourth option after patients have first tried various oral medicines.""The significance of this is that now we can start to change the conversation around diabetes management from one of 'let's manage your blood sugar' to one of 'let's manage your risk of complications',"" Buse said.The Leader trial was the most keenly anticipated at this year's ADA meeting and industry analysts had been hoping for a heart benefit of at least 10 percent, with some thinking it could exceed 15 percent. The Jardiance trial last year showed a similar 14 percent relative risk reduction.The findings, which involved following 9,340 patients for a median 3.8 years, were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.Gastrointestinal upset was the biggest side effect with Victoza. There were fewer cases of pancreatitis, which has been viewed as a potential problem, but more cases of pancreatic cancer, although the difference was not statistically significant.Since 2008, U.S. regulators have demanded studies for new diabetes medicines to show there is no increase in heart risk, opening a new battleground between different treatments. Lilly is conducting a similar large study to try and prove the heart benefits of its once-weekly GLP-1 drug Trulicity.The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

307,"Jun 02, 2016 07:40AM ET",Independence of compliance reviews is questioned in drug firm settlements,nan,"By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some major U.S. drug companies have hired their own auditors to perform compliance reviews mandated in government settlements over alleged civil violations, such as paying kickbacks or off-label drug promotion, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters.Third-party compliance reviews are playing an increasingly large role in helping the government ensure companies fulfill their obligations in federal settlements.But unlike the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general does not prohibit companies from hiring firms with whom they have existing business ties.Some lawmakers and legal experts say that practice creates conflicts of interest and could impair outside reviewers' independence.""If the goal of this whole thing is to have an energetic and independent reviewer ferreting out mistakes and potential fraud within the company, do not put them under the financial thumb of the people who have millions of dollars at stake in keeping the audit work,"" said Kevin Outterson, a professor of health and corporate law at Boston University.Several large drug makers - including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck (NYSE:MRK), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and  Allergan Inc  (NYSE:AGN_pa). - have relied on their existing or previous auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Ernst & Young (EY), to also serve as compliance reviewers, according to corporate filings and a list of reviewers.The health agency's inspector general provided the list of reviewers hired by drug companies in response to a Reuters Freedom of Information Act request.The inspector general typically settles civil claims through the use of a ""corporate integrity agreement"" mandating various reforms.These five-year deals often require the hiring of an independent compliance consultant known as an ""independent review organization,"" which is tasked with reviewing internal policies and data, such as payments to doctors.In exchange, the inspector general's office agrees not to exclude a company from participating in Medicaid and Medicare.Susan Gillin, an attorney in the inspector general's office, said she agreed that “theoretically, a potential conflict of interest exists.”But she said her agency has not observed any problems with weak oversight by auditors serving in dual roles. Such arrangements are allowed, she said, as long as the firm is not involved in corporate management or advising on policies it will also review.""We have very few repeat parties to corporate integrity agreements,” she said.While some companies have had multiple settlements over the years, they typically cover different alleged violations, or conduct committed by companies that, between settlements, became part of a different firm through an acquisition, Gillin said.Spokespeople for Novartis, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi all said they disclosed their business relationships to the inspector general, which reviewed them. A spokesman for Allergan Plc. said the arrangement predated the company's acquisition by  Actavis  (NYSE:AGN) in March 2015.Executives at PwC and Ernst & Young told Reuters they believe their dual work auditing and conducting compliance reviews are not in conflict and that they comply with all applicable regulations.The compliance reviewers “are independent in fact and in appearance,"" said EY Vice Chair Ron Hauben.Nancy Beacham, a partner at PwC, said the firm adheres to federal standards for all public company auditing engagements.""We abide by the rules of what we can and cannot do,"" she said.BIG CONTRACTS AT STAKESome legal experts who see a conflict in the dual role say it can be exacerbated by the fact that accounting firms are generally paid more for their audit work than for these sorts of compliance reviews.For example, prior to Allergan Inc's acquisition by Actavis in March 2015, the company disclosed that in fiscal year 2012, it paid Ernst & Young more than $5 million in audit fees, compared with more than $440,000 it paid the firm for compliance work performed under the corporate integrity agreement.""Work with a major company is an important contract, and an established contractor isn't going to be independent,"" said Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said such arrangements could weaken enforcement.""If the firms enforcing the agreements aren't independent,” he told Reuters in a statement, that “defeats the purpose of the agreements.""While some companies hire their auditors as reviewers, the majority of the more than two dozen public companies reviewed by Reuters that have or had corporate integrity agreements - such as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), CVS Caremark and Eli Lilly - do not hire their own auditors and instead opt for consulting or law firms.HISTORY OF VIOLATIONSPricewaterhouse's current dual clients for audits and compliance reviews include Novartis and Merck, according to the list provided by the health agency's inspector general.GlaxoSmithKline previously engaged its auditor, PwC, for a compliance review which ended in 2012.EY currently performs dual work for Sanofi and it previously did dual work for Allergan Inc. prior to its acquisition.GlaxoSmithKine, Novartis and Merck have all been involved in multiple settlements with the U.S. government since 1991 to resolve a range of criminal and civil claims, according to a recent report by the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen.GlaxoSmithKline has paid nearly $8 billion in federal fines between 1991 and 2015 - the most of any drugmaker, according to the Public Citizen report.A GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman said the company has greatly improved its compliance by taking steps such as eliminating payments to doctors who speak on the company's behalf and ending sales incentives based on prescription volumes.Novartis, in 2010, settled civil charges of paying kickbacks to doctors who spoke at corporate events, and signed a corporate integrity agreement.The company now faces another civil lawsuit filed by federal and state prosecutors, which alleges that kickbacks to doctors continued for nearly a year after it signed its 2010 corporate integrity agreement with the health agency's inspector general.Novartis has sought to dismiss the case, saying it makes ""sweeping"" allegations of a ""decade-long, nationwide fraudulent scheme based on just fifteen doctors."""

Sanofi, however, has recently done better there than some of its rivals.Guenter will move to a new position on June 1 as head of diabetes and cardiovascular, replacing Pascale Witz who is leaving the company.The group's 2015 revenues in emerging markets reached 10.6 billion euros ($11.83 billion), up 8 percent at constant currency exchange rates.""There are still a lot of unmet medical needs in China,"" Guenter said, with rapid urbanization leading to the spread of ""western diseases"" such as diabetes.""Patients still travel long distances to meet an established specialist in the big cities of the east coast because they fear they won't get the right treatment at home,"" Guenter said.Sanofi, which vies with China market leaders  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and AstraZeneca (L:AZN), as well as local manufacturers, has set up a research and development center in Shanghai both to reinforce its presence and boost its credibility with authorities.The company has been marketing Eloxatine -- usually prescribed for colorectal cancer -- for Chinese patients suffering with liver cancer for the past three years.""The prevalence of liver cancer is very high China and very low elsewhere - we don't know quite why,"" Guenter said.The company does not break out its sales figures by country but Guenter said the growth potential in China was particularly promising, especially with improved access to health insurance in rural areas of the country.""Of course, the reforms aimed at implementing better healthcare in China will put some pressure on pricing in the coming years but our hypothesis is that volumes will compensate.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The French drugmaker has said it is willing to raise its bid only after Medivation engages with it in negotiations.Medivation shares ended trading on Tuesday in New York at $61.91. Among Sanofi's eight nominees are Michael Campbell, the former chief executive of Arch Chemicals Inc, Ronald Rolfe, a retired partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, and Barbara Deptula, a former executive vice president and chief corporate development officer of biopharmaceutical company  Shire  Plc (L:SHP), one of the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the names of the nominees have not been disclosed. Medivation and Sanofi representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Medivation has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other pharmaceutical companies interested in an acquisition, including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), sources told Reuters earlier this month.However, no other company is close to tabling an offer for Medivation, according to the sources.Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection.Medivation has argued that Sanofi's offer fails to value fairly the prospects of its recently developed prostate cancer drug XTANDI, as well as two other products currently in clinical trials; Talazoparib, for the treatment of breast cancer, and Pidilizumab, for the treatment of blood cancers.Campbell served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Arch Chemicals, a maker of products that kill bacteria and fungi, between 1999 and 2011. Switzerland's Lonza AG (S:LONN) agreed in 2011 to buy the company for $1.2 billion.Rolfe retired from Cravath's litigation department in 2010, having worked on major antitrust and securities cases, as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and grand jury investigations. His clients included  IBM  Corp (N:IBM), PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP) and Sprint Corp (N:S).Deptula worked at Shire between 2004 and 2012, where she led efforts to expand its product portfolio. She has been a director on the board of AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:AMAG), a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on maternal health, anemia and cancer supportive care, since 2013.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

313,"May 23, 2016 12:20PM ET",Novartis executive exodus complicates drugmaker's rebuilding job,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - With seven departures in the space of five months, Novartis's (S:NOVN) top management is in upheaval just as CEO Joe Jimenez tries to tackle a list of challenges that have seen the drug firm's share price fall 25 percent since July.The most dramatic exit came last week, when head of pharmaceuticals David Epstein quit as his division was broken in two.By splitting oncology into a department of its own,  Novartis  aims to make the most of a high-margin business that it bought from GlaxoSmithKline for $16 billion last year, a reorganization that has business logic for analysts.“After years of empire building ... that’s what investors want"", said Cedric de Fonclare, a fund manager at London-based Jupiter Asset Management and a Novartis investor. ""Clearly, the future of that company will be about specialized drugs, high-value drugs, so they can face up to what is the challenge in this industry: price deflation and price pressure.""But the departures also reflect ongoing problems, as well as longer-term management instability.U.S. country head Christi Shaw left this month after overseeing, with Epstein, the lackluster launch of Entresto, Novartis's seemingly promising heart-failure medication, now expected to garner less than half the sales in 2016 than analysts had been forecasting.Novartis did get a break last week, when global guidelines on the treatment of heart failure strongly endorsed the drug.But the product pipeline is a pressing issue for the firm after the expiry of the U.S. patent for Gleevec, its best-selling blood cancer drug, which has put $2.5 billion of revenue at risk.ALCON TROUBLESAlcon head Jeff George departed in January after yet another quarter of falling sales in the division's core ophthalmic surgery equipment amid a lack of innovative products and customer disappointment with cutbacks in training for surgeons. ""Over the years, the company has been like a revolving door when it comes to senior managers departing -- below the CEO level, that is,"" wrote Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst. ""We have wondered if this has contributed to periodic shortfalls at the company, because of a lack of continuity.""Chief Ethics Officer Eric Cornut is leaving Novartis after 27 years, at a time when it is fighting U.S. allegations that its sales force bribed doctors to prescribe its medicines.Meanwhile Ameet Nathwani, global head of medical affairs, jumped ship to Novartis's rival Sanofi two months ago. (PA:SASY)Mark Fishman, director of the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, in Boston, is retiring, as is William Sellars, the head of oncology research.""Key positions are changing rapidly right now, in a situation where you probably prefer to have more stability,"" said Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider.Novartis did not immediately respond to questions about the wider effect of so many management changes.But with its shares down so sharply since July's peak, while the broader European pharmaceuticals sector (SXDP) is down only 17 percent and cross-town rival Roche (S:ROG) down 10 percent, it all adds up to a challenge for Jimenez as he prepares to explain to investors in Basel on Wednesday how he will revive Novartis's fortunes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

315,"May 17, 2016 01:20AM ET",Pfizer's Anacor deal showcases new wave of eczema therapies ,nan,"By Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) purchase of Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:ANAC) heralds an approaching wave of potentially safer and more effective treatments for millions who suffer from eczema, a common skin condition which causes infection-prone rashes that can feel like having poison ivy 24 hours a day. More than two dozen drugmakers are working on novel medicines to treat the condition affecting about 20 million Americans, also known as atopic dermatitis, and Pfizer's $5.2 billion deal positions it to become a market leader. Anacor's steroid-free topical ointment crisaborole is the first of the new treatments to be reviewed by U.S. regulators. An injectable therapy called dupilumab from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) is expected to be submitted for U.S. approval later this year. ""Until a few years ago, I don't think we had any message of hope for eczema patients who have tried everything,"" said Gil Yosipovitch, chairman of dermatology at Temple University School of Medicine who is a paid consultant for both companies. “Now we do.” The two medicines greatly reduced eczema symptoms in late-stage trials without side effects accompanying current treatments. They could eventually see combined annual global sales of over $9 billion and face no significant competition for years. Yosipovitch said Anacor’s crisaborole could be a valuable option for the 60 percent to 80 percent of patients with mild and moderate eczema on localized areas of the body. Dupilumab would be used for patients with more severe disease, he said.The global eczema drug market is currently worth about $4 billion in sales, mostly of topical steroids than can cause skin atrophy and increase risk of glaucoma and cataracts. Doctors may also prescribe oral drugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, but they are not approved for eczema and can cause infections, shingles and cancer. There are no approved systemic drugs for the condition. However, the cost of the new treatments may limit patient access. Regeneron's injectable dupilumab could cost $25,000 a year, similar to psoriasis drugs, at a time when U.S. health insurers are resisting rising drug prices. Analysts say it could eventually capture annual sales of $6 billion, with Anacor's drug costing more than $1,200 a year and having peak annual sales of up to $3 billion. ""Payers know this will be a big market and will put up a lot of barriers and restrictions,"" said Yatin Suneja, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.  Express Scripts Inc  (O:ESRX) last month said it would scrutinize new eczema treatments and their expected prices. LONG-TERM EFFECTS Crisaborole blocks an inflammation-causing protein called PDE-4. In large clinical trials that included children and adults, it cleared or almost cleared treated areas of skin in half of patients with mild to moderate disease, with mild side effects. ""We badly need a nonsteroidal topical that can get around serious steroid concerns and this drug showed no skin atrophy or other significant side effects,"" said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield of the University of California San Diego and lead author of American Academy of Dermatology eczema treatment guidelines. Regeneron and Sanofi (PA:SASY) aim to seek approval for dupilumab this year for adults with moderate to severe eczema. It blocks two proteins, IL-4 and IL-13, believed to cause eczema and allergic conditions like asthma. In big trials, dupilumab led to an average 70 percent improvement in rash area and severity. Fewer serious side effects, including infections, were reported for dupilumab than for placebos. In separate studies it reduced incidence of asthma. One concern over drugs like dupilumab, which regulate the immune system, is potential for serious side effects over time, including lymphoma. Such problems typically do not show up until a patient has used a medicine many years, said Dr. Cameron Rokhsar, a New York dermatologist with no financial ties to the drugmakers.Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) and AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) are developing injectable eczema treatments several years behind dupilumab. Data from mid-stage trials of the Roche drug, lebrikizumab, are expected in the second quarter. AstraZeneca plans this year to disclose data from a mid-stage trial of its tralokinumab in adults with moderate to severe eczema. Nemolizumab from Japan's Chugai (T:4519) is also being tested in a mid-stage trial. The injectable drug targets IL-31, a protein associated with itch, a hallmark of eczema.""The main concept of our drug is to break the vicious itch-scratch cycle because scratching damages the skin and causes more intense inflammation,"" Dr. Michiaki Tanaka, a senior Chugai research executive, said in an interview. Celgene Inc (O:CELG) recently tested its psoriasis drug apremilast in about 200 patients with moderate to severe eczema. It has not publicized the results, but researchers and analysts say it could become the first approved oral treatment for eczema. The pill has caused nausea and other gastrointestinal problems in psoriasis patients. ""I'm very excited about apremilast because we have no approved oral drug for eczema,"" said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. She helped conduct trials of apremilast and dupilumab.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

317,"May 10, 2016 05:08AM ET",Exclusive: Medivation succumbs to pressure to explore sale - sources,nan,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia(Reuters) -  Medivation  Inc (O:MDVN) will actively seek to sell itself after the US cancer drug maker rejected a $9.3 billion takeover offer from France's Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), according to people familiar with the situation.The San Francisco-based company has agreed to open its books to both  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), those people said.The move comes less than two weeks after Sanofi made its approach public by publishing a letter to Medivation's chief executive David Hung that contained details of the offer.However, there is still no certainty that Sanofi's rivals will press ahead with bids for Medivation, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Medivation, Sanofi, Pfizer and Amgen declined to comment. Medivation said last week that Sanofi's $52.50 per share cash offer ""substantially undervalues the company, its leading oncology franchise, and innovative late-stage pipeline."" Medivation shares traded on Monday around $10 above the offer price.Sanofi has said it is willing to raise its offer as long as Medivation engages in negotiations, and has threatened to go directly to shareholders to oust its board if it does not.Sanofi, which is being advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), has a track record of pushing through unsolicited deals, after buying Genzyme for $20 billion in 2011.A sale of Medivation would mark a bittersweet moment for Hung, who founded the company in 2003. In 13 years, he built Medivation from a penny stock peddling a 20-year-old Russian treatment for hay fever into a $10 billion market capitalization oncology company. In the process, he overcame numerous obstacles, including the failure of Alzheimer's treatment Dimebon, which used to be sold as an antihistamine in Russia. In 2009, Hung took a bet on a chemical compound called MDV3100, which was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles. In partnership with Japan's Astellas Pharma Inc (T:4503), Medivation turned MDV3100 into a nearly $2 billion dollar prostate cancer drug called Xtandi.Xtandi's successful progression from early stage experiments to full blown regulatory approval was one of the fastest in biopharmaceutical history, taking only seven years. At times, Hung resorted to unconventional methods to finance Medivation's research, including tapping the public markets through a 2004 reverse merger with a shell company, which he used to raise $12 million in public capital.Prior to joining Medivation, Hung was already an experienced life sciences executive, having previously led a medical device company, Pro-Duct Health, to a more than $167 million sale in 2001.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""If you are not prepared to engage with us, we have no choice but to go directly to your shareholders.""Sanofi said rules in the state of Delaware, where Medivation is registered, gave shareholders owning a majority of the company the power to oust the board.""If the Medivation board of directors continues to refuse to engage with us, then we intend to commence a process to remove and replace members of the board,"" Brandicourt said.In its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, Medivation's Chief Executive Officer David Hung said that Medivation's major shareholders had been ""very supportive"" of the board's choice to reject Sanofi's bid. He declined to comment on whether Medivation would run a sale process to explore offers from other potential bidders. Sanofi went public with the takeover proposal on April 28, but Medivation rejected the $52.50-a-share deal outright, saying it undervalued the company ""substantially"". The stock has since risen to over $59.""We believe we have offered a fair price, and a very attractive premium,"" Brandicourt wrote in the letter. ""We remain enthusiastic about a potential combination with Medivation.""Medivation's first-quarter earnings missed most analysts' forecasts. The San Francisco-based company reported non-GAAP net income of 11 cents per diluted share, up from 8 cents a year earlier, but much less than the average 23 cents expected by analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll. Sanofi is keen to boost its presence in cancer treatments and teamed up last year with U.S firm Regeneron in immuno-oncology. This differs from traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy as it uses or enhances the patient’s own immune system to stop the growth of cancer cells.Medivation, known for its Xtandi prostate cancer treatment, said on Thursday its board of directors ""believes the execution of Medivation's business plan will deliver value to its stockholders that is far superior to Sanofi's proposal"".The U.S. company will announce first-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday.U.S drug maker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has also approached Medivation to express interest in an acquisition, raising the possibility of a bid rivaling Sanofi's, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

321,"May 04, 2016 10:48AM ET",Biotech stock swoon sparks buyout interest: investor,nan,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - A brutal start to the year for biotech stocks could pave the way for more deal-making in the sector, with premiums of potentially 50 percent to 100 percent above depressed share prices, according to a top healthcare investor.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index (NBI) fell 23 percent in the first three months of 2016, its worst quarterly performance since 2002, and remains down one-third from its all-time high last July. Drug pricing practices in the United States and setbacks for a few promising experimental drugs have taken a toll on shares.Andy Acker, a portfolio manager at Janus Capital Group who helps oversee $7 billion in healthcare assets, says the sell-off led to a steep discount to the sector's value, especially at a time of major innovation in developing treatments for cancer, heart disease and other illnesses that affect millions.In the wake of the declines, large pharmaceutical and biotech companies appear ready to resume deal-making.""Buyers are starting to get interested,"" Acker said in an interview this week. Last week,  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) said it would spend $5.8 billion for privately-held Stemcentrx, which is developing a lung cancer treatment, while France's Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) went public with a $9.3 billion offer for cancer drug maker  Medivation  Inc (O:MDVN).Janus was the 10th-biggest investor in Medivation as of the end of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and Acker said multiple bidders could be interested in the company. Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late on Tuesday that  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) had approached Medivation to express interest in an acquisition.The U.S. government's derailment of Pfizer's $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc (N:AGN) last month has raised expectations that both drugmakers will now seek smaller transactions. Allergan will be flush with cash if its $40 billion sale of its generics unit to Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) wins U.S. antitrust approval.One potential target for Allergan, Acker said, is  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  Inc (O:IRWD), which is partnering with Allergan on an irritable bowel syndrome medicine. Another possibility is Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:ANAC), which is developing a nonsteroidal topical ointment for eczema, Acker said. As of the end of the year, Janus was Ironwood's third-biggest shareholder and Anacor's ninth-biggest. Janus is also a major investor in Allergan.Acker co-manages the Janus Global Life Sciences Fund, which has returned 19.35 percent a year on average over the past five years, beating 90 percent of peers, according to Morningstar. He said additional deals could take time because sellers may be reluctant to accept a buyout based on depressed prices. But takeovers eventually could be consummated at premiums of 50 percent to 100 percent above where target company shares bottomed recently.Biotech investors would welcome such deals, which could help boost valuations for rivals to a buyout target.Investor concerns about whether the winner of this year's U.S. presidential election will take steps to curb drug costs are likely to weigh, Acker said. ""There will be some uncertainty through the election,"" Acker said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

322,"May 03, 2016 06:20PM ET",Exclusive: Pfizer approaches Medivation about potential takeover - sources ,nan,"By Lauren Hirsch and Carl O'Donnell(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) has approached U.S. cancer drug maker  Medivation  Inc (O:MDVN) to express interest in an acquisition, raising the possibility of a bid rivaling a $9.3 billion offer by Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Pfizer's approach comes less than a week after Sanofi went public with its $52.50 per share cash offer, complaining that Medivation refused to engage. Medivation subsequently rejected the offer as too low. Its shares closed on Tuesday at $57.52.Medivation has not yet decided whether it should engage with Pfizer in negotiations and is in discussions with its financial and legal advisers, the people said. There is no certainty that Pfizer will press ahead with a bid, they added.Sanofi currently has no plans to raise its offer and is waiting for Medivation to launch an auction to sell itself before it makes any new bid, some of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Medivation, Sanofi and Pfizer declined to comment.Based in San Francisco, Medivation is best known for its oncology drug Xtandi, which treats prostate cancer. For Pfizer, a deal with Medivation would mark another attempt at building scale in patented drugs after it scrapped its $160 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Allergan Plc (N:AGN) last month. The breakdown came days after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules that weighed on Pfizer's ability to slash its tax bill by using the deal to redomicile in Ireland.Earlier on Tuesday, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview with Reuters that he would consider another merger of any size, as long as the deal makes sense. He did not comment on Medivation.Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection. Sanofi's unsolicited approach for Medivation has echoes of its bid for rare disease drug maker Genzyme in 2011. It took Sanofi nine months to overcome Genzyme's resistance. It also offered Genzyme shareholders so-called contingent value rights, which offered them additional payments if the acquired company was able to achieve certain performance milestones. Using contingent value rights in the case of Medivation may be more challenging for Sanofi, given its lackluster track record in cancer drugs. However, Sanofi has no plans to use contingent value rights in any new offer, according to the sources.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

324,"Apr 29, 2016 07:03AM ET",Sanofi confident it can win Medivation shareholders support,nan,"By Matthias BlamontPARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY), which reported higher quarterly profit on Friday boosted by its Genzyme division, is confident  Medivation  (O:MDVN) shareholders will back its proposed takeover of the U.S. cancer drug company.The French drugmaker went public on Thursday with a $9.3 billion offer to buy Medivation after it stonewalled its takeover approach, setting up what could be a lengthy battle.""We are confident that Medivation shareholders will ultimately share our strong belief that our offer ... would provide significant and immediate cash value,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said on a conference call.Chief Financial Officer Jerome Contamine declined to say whether Sanofi was ready to engage in a bidding war and raise its offer, as many investors expect it to do.Medivation, which markets prostate cancer drug Xtandi, said in a statement that its board would meet to discuss Sanofi's proposal and provide an update ""promptly"". The U.S. company said shareholders should take no action at this time.Shares in Sanofi fell more than 3 percent, with traders blaming the decline in part on worries about Sanofi getting sucked into a costly and lengthy takeover battle.Industry analysts and healthcare bankers expect Sanofi would need to sweeten its opening offer.""I imagine you’ll see a fair bit of movement,"" said one banker not directly involved in the situation. ""It’s fairly typical to see an average 10 percent premium to the original offer - I think this is going to get much higher.""CVRs, or contingent value rights, might also be deployed, the banker said, as happened when Sanofi bought Genzyme for $20 billion in 2011 after a similar unsolicited approach.CVRs, which pay out in specific circumstances, are sometimes used in biotech to compensate shareholders in a target company if, for example, a drug sells particularly well.There is also potential for other companies to get involved, including Japan's Astellas Pharma (T:4503), Medivation's partner on Xtandi, or Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which has a big focus on cancer.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot declined to comment on Medivation in a post-results call with reporters on Friday but said he had a high bar for acquisitions, since his company's drug pipeline was now full. Officials at Astellas have also declined comment.Sanofi said first-quarter business net profit grew 3.5 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.72 billion euros ($1.96 billion), equivalent to a 0.2 percent drop on a reported basis.Sales rose 0.7 percent at constant exchange rates to 8.54 billion euros, down 1.9 percent on a reported basis, Sanofi said, adding that it was confirming its full-year forecasts.Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected business net profit of 1.7 billion euros and net sales of 8.73 billion.Revenue at biotech arm Genzyme rose 20.5 percent, with a 134 percent rise in proceeds from multiple sclerosis treatment Lemtrada. Diabetes sales fell 4.5 percent, reflecting the trend of weaker revenue from blockbuster Lantus in the United States.Sanofi's ""main diabetes franchise remains in flux, with the company lowering estimates twice for this business over the last 18 months"", Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note.""(Sanofi's) research and development track record is not great, and it is guiding for no meaningful earnings per share growth in 2016/2017,"" said Anderson, who downgraded the stock to market-perform in November.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It also pushed back the expected data for reaching its 2% inflation target.The decision came a day after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged close to zero on Wednesday and offered little guidance on future rate hikes.Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) declined 0.80% and 1.39%, while Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Detusche Bank retreated 0.90% and 2.09%.Among peripheral lenders, Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) slid 0.48%, while Spanish banks BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) tumbled 1.05% and 1.15% respectively.In earnings news, Sanofi (PA:SASY) reported a rise in first quarter sales and maintained its full-year guidance, but shares still plummeted 1.92%.Spanish telecoms group  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) lost 0.84% after saying core profit declined by 6.7% in the first quarter.Puma SE (DE:PUMG) reported a 3.7% increase in first quarter sales, but shares in the German sports goods maker still slipped 0.24%.In London, FTSE 100 tumbled 1%, weighed by Rolls Royce (LON:RR) Holdings, whose shares plunged 2.09% after after the company's CEO challenged senior management to identify broader cost cuts earlier in the week.Financial stocks added to losses, as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) slid 0.77% and Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) dropped 0.91%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) tumbled 1.23% and 1.96% respectively.Earlier Friday, RBS said its losses widened to £968 million in the first quarter from £459 million in the same period last year.In the mining sector, stocks were mixed.

326,"Apr 28, 2016 03:14PM ET","AbbVie forges deeper into cancer, as clock ticks for Humira",nan,"By Ransdell Pierson(Reuters) -  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) placed another big bet on new cancer drugs on Thursday with a $5.8 billion acquisition that could lessen its dependence on arthritis treatment Humira, the world's top selling drug.Shares of AbbVie rose 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. The suburban Chicago drugmaker said it would buy privately held Stemcentrx and its experimental treatment for small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 10 percent to 15 percent of all lung cancers and is notoriously difficult to treat. It brings AbbVie into the broad and lucrative arena of solid tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer. AbbVie's current drugs, including leukemia treatment Imbruvica, focus on blood cancers, a smaller group of patients.Companies with innovative cancer drugs, especially ones that spur the immune system to attack tumors, are attractive takeover targets. These life-extending new treatments can command extremely high prices that health insurers seem willing to pay for, unlike some other therapeutic categories where they are putting pressure on price.""The mantra to reimbursement is innovation, and AbbVie is heading down the right path"" by its widening focus on oncology, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.AbbVie last year bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of Imbruvica for $21 billion. It sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Squibb has been particularly successful with its oncology focus. It predicted on Thursday its earnings will jump as much as 29 percent this year, fueled by its new Opdivo treatment for melanoma and lung cancer. A similar new drug from Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co also has a list price of $150,000.Also on Thursday, French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) announced its $9.3 billion offer to buy Medivation, which makes prostate cancer treatment Xtandi.Stemcentrx's drug, called Rova-T, is a toxic chemical that has been loaded onto an antibody. It targets a protein called DLL3 found in more than 80 percent of patients with the cancer. A biomarker is used to help select patients whose cancers express the protein. Late-stage trials involving patients who have already failed to benefit from chemotherapy and radiation are under way and AbbVie expects the drug to be approved by 2018.""Oncology is an important growth driver and an area we plan to build a leading portfolio,"" Michael Severino, AbbVie's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.But he said AbbVie will remain heavily involved in arthritis, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases that are treated by Humira, which generates $14 billion in annual sales.AbbVie's quarterly earnings results on Thursday demonstrated its reliance on Humira, for which sales jumped 15 percent to $3.58 billion, accounting for 60 percent of company revenue. As sales of Humira rise by double-digit percentages each year, investors are growing ever more fretful because its main U.S. patent lapses in December. AbbVie says other patents will stave off introduction of cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022. AbbVie said it would pay about $2 billion in cash for Stemcentrx and fund the remainder with stock. Stemcentrx shareholders may also receive up to $4 billion in cash if certain performance milestones are achieved.AbbVie, which expects the deal to close in the second quarter, lowered its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $4.62-$4.82 per share, from its earlier view of $4.90-$5.10.It said the deal would be dilutive this year and for several years to come.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

327,"Apr 28, 2016 10:33AM ET",Sanofi launches $9.3 billion fight for U.S. cancer firm Medivation,nan,"By Ben Hirschler and Leigh ThomasLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) went public with a $9.3 billion offer to buy Medivation on Thursday, setting up what could be a lengthy takeover battle after the U.S. cancer firm rebuffed its approaches.The decision to target Medivation marks a return to the biotech takeover trail for Sanofi, which is looking to new cancer treatments to bolster its portfolio and help offset declining sales of mainstay diabetes drug Lantus.Sanofi's non-binding proposal is to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in cash, representing a 50 percent premium over the San Francisco-based firm's two-month volume-weighted average share price prior to takeover rumors.It is, however, only modestly above Medivation's Wednesday closing price of $52.05 and investors signaled they expected Sanofi to dig deeper, with the shares trading above $56 on Thursday.Reuters reported last month that Medivation had been working with investment bank J.P. Morgan to handle interest from companies regarding a potential acquisition, but it had no plans to sell itself.Bryan Garnier analyst Eric Le Berrigaud said Sanofi could now face a prolonged takeover fight with other players potentially getting involved, including Japan's Astellas Pharma, Medivation's partner on its prostate cancer drug Xtandi.Britain's AstraZeneca has also been reported to have looked at Medivation.Officials at Astellas and AstraZeneca declined to comment, although one person close to the British company said it was unlikely to enter a bidding war.Medivation, which has limited takeover defenses, said it would respond to Sanofi's offer following a board meeting on Thursday, with input from financial advisers Evercore and J.P. Morgan.Sanofi, which is being advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), has a track record of pushing through unsolicited deals, after buying Genzyme for $20 billion in 2011.Sanofi's move comes on the same day that  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) agreed to buy medical device maker St. Jude Medical for $25 billion and AbbVie announced a $5.8 billion deal for cancer firm Stemcentrx, highlighting a pattern of healthcare companies snapping up smaller rivals.LOOKING FOR DEALSThe French company, whose shares slipped 1 percent, said there was no certainty the deal would get done, but that if it did, it would boost earnings immediately. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said Sanofi likely had ""significant flexibility"" to raise its offer, given the current low cost of debt, while Bernstein calculated the deal would still lift earnings from 2017 even at $62.40 a share, or 20 percent above Wednesday's close.The premium to the unaffected price offered by Sanofi is below some other recent large biotech deals, with Roche paying a 63 percent premium for Intermune in 2014 and Alexion 140 percent for Synageva last year.Stepping up acquisitions fits with the strategy of Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt, who took over a year ago. He told Reuters in January that he was looking for deals to broaden its reach in areas such as oncology and could consider deals of up to $20 billion.France's biggest drugmaker is going through a tough patch, due to falling sales of Lantus, prompting it to warn of no meaningful profit growth over the next two years.Oncology is currently the hottest area of pharmaceutical research, thanks to advances in understanding the biological drivers of the disease. Sanofi has a long history in selling chemotherapy drugs but has been less successful at developing modern cancer medicines. 'COMPELLING' PROPOSALBrandicourt first contacted Medivation about a deal on March 25 but he said Chief Executive Officer David Hung had declined to meet him and had told him the U.S. company's board was not interested in discussing a transaction.Sanofi then set out its $52.50-a-share offer in an April 15 letter to Hung, to which Medivation only acknowledged receipt without commenting on its contents.""We do not understand the delay in responding to our letter. The price we put forth represents a very substantial premium, and it would be all cash without any financing condition. In these circumstances we believe it is appropriate to make this letter public, which we are doing today,"" Brandicourt wrote in a follow-up letter to Hung on April 28. ""We also strongly believe that Medivation shareholders would find our proposal to be compelling.""Xtandi, which had worldwide sales of nearly $2 billion in 2015, is Medivation's only marketed drug. The high price of Xtandi has been criticized by some U.S. lawmakers, including Democratic Party presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.Medivation is also conducting clinical trials on two experimental drugs, talazoparib for breast cancer and pidilizumab for blood cancers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The program encourages manufacturers to study treatments for diseases that might not be profitable by expediting the regulatory review of a more lucrative drug in their research pipeline.The House of Representatives passed the bill on a voice vote, without a roll call, weeks after the same measure was approved by the Senate.White House spokeswoman Katie Hill said Obama was expected to sign the bill, which she called a ""small step"" that could encourage the private sector to tackle Zika.""But it contains no funding and is ultimately insufficient on its own, since it doesn't provide the $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts have said is needed right now to prepare Americans for the imminent local transmission of Zika in this country,"" she said in a statement.Democrats and administration officials are urging the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat the spread of Zika. In a temporary fix, the White House said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for the mosquito that carries the disease to emerge in the continental United States.According to the World Health Organization, there is a strong scientific consensus that the Zika virus can cause the rare birth defect microcephaly in newborns. But the link between the virus and the birth defects has not been scientifically established.On Tuesday, Brazil confirmed 1,113 cases of microcephaly and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mother.Drugmakers who are working on Zika-related drugs, or considering such research, include Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. Zika was first detected in Brazil last year and is spreading through the Americas. The World Health Organization had declared a global health emergency due to the virus’s possible link to microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, in adults.On Monday, top health officials said the mosquito that spreads the virus is now present in about 30 U.S. states, making local outbreaks a possibility. They have also predicted hundreds of thousands of people would be infected in Puerto Rico when the mosquito season kicks in this summer.A pharmaceutical company may be given a priority review voucher to develop a drug for an infectious disease, in this case Zika, which may not generate much profit for the manufacturer. The voucher gives the company the right to an accelerated review by the FDA of any other, more lucrative, drug in its pipeline.Developing a new drug can take years and cost millions of dollars. A standard FDA review takes at least 10 months to complete - longer if the agency requires additional information. Being able to shave time off that process and get a profitable drug onto the market faster can be worth millions of dollars to a manufacturer.Under the agency's priority review program, companies who submit a drug for review that is intended to treat serious conditions or whose drug shows a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing treatments is eligible to be reviewed in six months, at least four months faster than usual.A priority review voucher gives a company the right to a six-month review on any product, regardless of whether it meets the conditions normally required to receive an accelerated review. It also gives the company the right to sell the voucher to another company.The law currently makes any company eligible for a priority review voucher that is developing a drug for one of more than 20 tropical diseases listed under the voucher program. These include malaria, cholera, leprosy, dengue, tuberculosis, and Ebola. The FDA has the authority to add other infectious diseases to the list which primarily affects poor countries.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

334,"Mar 29, 2016 12:10PM ET",Sanofi poaches AstraZeneca scientist as new research head,nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has poached one of AstraZeneca's top scientists to be its new research head in another high-profile departure for the British drugmaker.Sanofi said on Tuesday that Yong-Jun Liu had been appointed as head of research with effect from April 1, reporting to Elias Zerhouni, the group's president of global research and development.Liu, a specialist in immunology with more than 250 published articles in leading academic journals, currently heads up research at AstraZeneca's MedImmune biotechnology division, a position he has held since 2014. Zerhouni said his appointment would help the transformation of Sanofi from a pharmaceutical into a biopharmaceutical company, with a strong research presence in cutting-edge biotechnology.Prior to that he led program at Baylor Research Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he was founding director of the Cancer Immunology Research Institute.His decision to leave AstraZeneca follows the exit last June of Briggs Morrison, the company's former chief medical officer and head of late-stage drug development, and respiratory and inflammatory medicines head James Ward-Lilley.An AstraZeneca spokesman declined to comment on his move.AstraZeneca is going through a transition as older drugs lose patent protection and it invests heavily in new medicines, especially in the field of cancer immunotherapy.It has a promising pipeline of experimental drugs but has also suffered some recent setbacks, including last week's failure of its marketed heart drug Brilinta as a treatment for stroke patients and earlier disappointing results with a drug to treat lung and abdominal cancer mesothelioma. Sanofi, meanwhile, is seeking to rejuvenate its early-stage pipeline and Zerhouni said Liu's experience in immunology, oncology and translational medicine would be ""vital assets"" for this task.""He fits perfectly for us at this time,"" Zerhouni said in a telephone interview. ""We have the luxury of a full late-stage pipeline and therefore we can step back and invest for the long term.""Oncology is a particular priority. Sanofi may have missed the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that help fight tumors by removing brakes on the immune system, but Zerhouni hopes to ""leapfrog"" forward by focusing on new approaches and testing multiple cancer drug combinations.""Immuno-oncology is just at the beginning of its development,"" he said. ""Frankly, I think it won't be enough to just remove a checkpoint inhibitor because it is also important to activate the immune system.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

338,"Mar 07, 2016 01:05AM ET",Insight: Venezuela uses distressed bonds to settle debts with drugmakers,nan,"By Brian Ellsworth, Ben Hirschler and Tim McLaughlinCARACAS/LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela has settled debts with at least three global drug companies by giving them bonds that trade at a heavy discount, a further sign of the OPEC nation's worsening financial crisis. Novartis  AG (VX:NOVN),  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) acquired dollar-denominated bonds from state-owned oil company PDVSA that they resold for as little as a third of their face value, according to a Reuters analysis of regulatory filings and sources with knowledge of the situation. This contributed to some $500 million in foreign exchange losses that the three companies suffered in Venezuela in 2015, The extent of the bond transactions has not been previously reported.For a graphic showing how the bond deals can be a bitter pill for drugs companies, see http://tmsnrt.rs/1L3jONRThe payment method provided a shortcut around the country's troubled 13-year-old currency control mechanism. The system is widely regarded as a primary cause of runaway inflation, a deep recession and chronic product shortages that have afflicted Venezuela's economy under socialist President Nicolas Maduro.Companies are required to sell products in bolivars but then struggle to convert them into hard currency through the government's currency board. Venezuela tries to use an official exchange rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar for priority goods such as food and medicine. The rate is the result of a devaluation last month from the previous rate of 6.3 bolivars.However, Venezuela, which gets nearly all of its foreign exchange from oil exports, has had fewer dollars to disburse as a result of the crash in oil prices in the past two years. That has left it without enough dollars to pay down debts to pharmaceuticals companies at the preferential exchange rate.Few of the alternatives are palatable. They include holding a rapidly deteriorating currency or using a much weaker official exchange rate of 206 bolivars to the dollar. The black market rate is close to an extraordinary 1,100 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, valuing the Venezuelan currency at less than 1 percent of the official rate. Novartis said it agreed to acquire PDVSA bonds with a face value equivalent to the amount it was owed, and later sold them at a roughly two-thirds discount. Novartis reported a loss of $127 million on its sale of PDVSA 2024 bonds , leaving it with proceeds of just $73 million from the operation. The bonds currently trade at about 31 cents on the dollar, with a yield of 27 percent.Neither Bayer nor Sanofi provided details on their bond transactions, but sources familiar with the situation said they accepted similar steep discounts. They declined to comment on whether they had any other option for repatriating their funds. A fixed-income trader who follows the Venezuelan market said he noticed heavy selling of the PDVSA 2024 bonds starting in January, and estimated that more than $500 million of the bonds flooded the market.This coincided with a sharp drop in the price of the bond, which fell to 25 cents in the dollar from 37 cents. The trader added he did not think financial institutions would have sold the bonds at such low prices. It is unclear whether this was directly related to selling by the drug companies.Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles media requests on behalf of the Finance Ministry, did not respond to a request for comment. The Central Bank did not respond to an email seeking comment.Investors who track Venezuela say the deals makes sense for the companies despite the losses. The bond purchases represented a chance to get dollar denominated assets, even ones that had to be sold at a heavily discounted price.At the black market rate, Novartis would have been left with only a tiny sliver of what it was owed. FOOD AND OILSanofi in 2015 recorded a currency loss of 240 million euros ($264 million) associated with its Venezuela operations. A spokesman said this was the result of ""a variety of payment means including dollar-denominated bonds.""In early 2015, several big drug companies were still holding out to convert their bolivars into dollars at the most favorable exchange rate permitted by law, U.S. regulatory filings show. In a typical disclosure,  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), for example, said last May that it continued to believe that the nature of its business, shipping medicine to Venezuela, would qualify for the most preferential rates.Last month, Pfizer said it expects an $800 million ""negative impact"" related to Venezuela in 2016, but did not immediately respond to questions about whether it was involved in any Venezuela bond transactions.Buying bonds to obtain hard currency assets has so far mostly been a path used by foreign multinationals. A proposal by Venezuela's principal industry association for a similar mechanism for local companies to settle debts with foreign providers has so far gained no traction. Two sources in the Venezuelan food industry, which has struggled to maintain operations due to a lack of imported raw materials, told Reuters that they would not accept an arrangement in which their providers were required to assume such heavy discounts. They insisted that the government should fully pay off those debts.Venezuela in March 2013 used a similar scheme to settle debts with oil services companies, including Weatherford International Ltd. (N:WFT), which said it received bonds from PDVSA that year in exchange for unpaid bills. It said it sold them for around half their face value.Maduro has vowed to maintain social programs created by his mentor and predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, including expanded access to low-cost medicine. But with fewer dollars available for health sector imports, Venezuelans struggle to obtain products ranging from simple ointments to life-saving cancer drugs. Long pharmacy lines and social media pleas for help obtaining pharmaceuticals are routine.Venezuela's bond-payment offers mirror a similar scheme in 2010 by Greece in which Athens settled billions of dollars in debts to pharmaceuticals companies with zero-coupon bonds issued specifically for that purpose. With Greece at the height of its debt crisis, the bonds quickly fell to around half of their face value and the drugmakers sold them at a substantial discount.Greece's situation was simpler, however, given that it did not have exchange controls and the debts were denominated in the widely-used euro currency.BETTER THAN NOTHINGAt a least a dozen major U.S. companies, including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), Pepsico Inc (N:PEP), Colgate Palmolive Co (N:CL), Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), have deconsolidated their operations in Venezuela, resulting in several billion dollars in write downs over the past year. The accounting maneuver largely insulates their consolidated financial results from Venezuela's economic turmoil. Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline plc (L:GSK) in 2015 reported a $130 million Venezuela foreign exchange loss after switching to a 200 bolivar per dollar exchange rate, 97 percent weaker than the official rate it had previously used.Merck & Co (N:MRK) in 2015 reported an $876 million foreign exchange loss related to Venezuela. The firm declined to comment when asked if this was related to bond operations.Venezuelan bonds are the riskiest of any issued by an emerging market nation, according to the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Global Diversified Emerging Markets Bond Index . They pay on average some 31 percentage points more than similar U.S. Treasury bills, nearly triple that of war-torn Iraq. Investors worry PDVSA will be unable to meet heavy debt service of around $7.5 billion between March and December unless there is a major rebound in crude oil prices.Maduro dismisses default talk as a right-wing smear campaign. Government officials note that the neither the country nor state oil company PDVSA have missed a bond payment under the ruling Socialist Party.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

339,"Feb 17, 2016 08:47AM ET","Zika vaccine shows promise in mice, lifting maker Inovio",nan,"(Reuters) - Hopes of developing a vaccine against Zika took a small step forward on Wednesday as  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  (O:INO) said its experimental shot had induced a robust and durable response in mice.Shares in the U.S. biotech firm, which expects to test its product in humans before the end of the year, jumped 7 percent in premarket trading on the prospect of it developing a vaccine against the mosquito-borne disease.At least 15 companies and academic groups are currently racing to develop Zika vaccines, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), spurred on by growing public concern over the virus sweeping across the Americas.Zika, whose symptoms include mild fever and rash, has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil, although the connection is not yet proven. There is no proven treatment or vaccine for the disease, a close cousin of the viruses that cause dengue, chikungunya and West Nile fever. Inovio said in a statement that mice given its vaccine showed the development of antibodies and generated a response from T-cells, which play an important role in immunizing the body. ""We will next test the vaccine in non-human primates and initiate clinical product manufacturing. We plan to initiate Phase I human testing of our Zika vaccine before the end of 2016,"" Inovio Chief Executive Joseph Kim said.Phase I is the first stage in a three-step process of testing new medicines and involves giving an experimental product to healthy volunteers.Inovio's DNA-based vaccine is being developed with South Korea's GeneOne Life Sciences Inc (KS:011000) and academic collaborators. One Canadian collaborator told Reuters last month that vaccine testing on humans could begin as early as August. Other organizations with relatively advanced Zika vaccine projects include India's Bharat Biotech, which said earlier this month that its experimental vaccine would start pre-clinical trials in animals imminently. The U.S. National Institutes for Health is also working on another DNA vaccine, while France's Sanofi (PA:SASY), which makes the world's first vaccine for dengue, said on Feb. 2 it was launching a Zika project.Despite the accelerated work program, however, the WHO estimates it will still be at least 18 months before any Zika vaccines are ready to be tested in large-scale clinical trials.Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by an abnormally small head size in newborns, although the WHO believes the suspected link could be confirmed within weeks.Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,300 suspected microcephaly cases.An estimated 80 percent of people with Zika have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected. Experts say the developing of a useable preventative shot against the disease will not be simple, particularly due to concerns surrounding the safety of vaccinating pregnant women.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

342,"Jan 26, 2016 08:20AM ET",Big Pharma's bet on Big Data creates opportunities and risks,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis wants every puff of its emphysema drug Onbrez to go into the cloud. The Swiss drugmaker has teamed up with U.S. technology firm Qualcomm (O:QCOM) to develop an internet-connected inhaler that can send information about how often it is used to remote computer servers known as the cloud. This kind of new medical technology is designed to allow patients to keep track of their drug usage on their smartphones or tablets and for their doctors to instantly access the data over the web to monitor their condition.It also creates a host of ""Big Data"" opportunities for the companies involved - with huge amounts of information about a medical condition and the efficacy of a drug or device being wirelessly transmitted to a database from potentially thousands, even millions, of patients.The potential scale of the so-called ""Medical Internet of Things"" has not been lost on pharmaceutical and tech firms around the world, both big companies hunting growth and smaller ones looking to provide bespoke products and services. It has created unlikely alliances. Novartis' domestic rival Roche has also teamed up with Qualcomm and Danish diabetes drugmaker  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) has partnered with  IBM  (N:IBM) on cloud-linked device projects, for example, while healthcare device maker  Medtronic  (N:MDT) is working with a U.S. data-analytics firm Glooko.GlaxoSmithKline, meanwhile, is in talks with Qualcomm about a medical technology joint venture potentially worth up to $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. However, with the opportunity comes risk.Security experts warn that hacked medical information can be worth more than credit card details on the black market as fraudsters can use it to fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or file bogus insurance claims. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 35 million U.S. hospital discharges a year, a billion doctor and hospital visits and even more prescriptions, much of which is stored in cloud databases. CLOUD CONCERNNow the ""Medical Internet of Things"" is introducing more and more web-connected devices into the equation and pushing even more confidential patient data on to the cloud. This is creating potential new opportunities for thieves seeking to penetrate medical companies' security where they may target names, birth dates, policy numbers, billing data and the diagnosis codes needed to obtain drugs, say experts.""The weakest link tends to be the medical device itself,"" said Rick Valencia, senior vice president of Qualcomm Life, Qualcomm's four-year-old healthcare unit. ""They weren't designed with the idea in mind that they would be going over the network and the information would be residing in cloud infrastructure.""Medtronic, the world's largest standalone medical device maker, said in 2014 it lost patient records in separate cyberattacks at its diabetes business. ""The more information, the easier identity theft is and the more valuable the profiles that the hacker can sell to third parties,"" said Erik Vollebregt, a lawyer in Amsterdam who specializes in medical device cybersecurity and privacy.He said it could also be possible for criminals to hack into web-connected medical devices, and threaten the lives of patients, to blackmail the manufacturer. Despite no documented patient-endangering hacks, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last year an infusion pump could be vulnerable to attack and asked healthcare providers to stop using it. SMART LENSNovartis aims to have its inhaler for chronic lung disease, to be on the market by 2019. Other pharma-tech alliances include Aerocrine and Microsoft (O:MSFT), which are working together on a cloud project to analyze data from allergy and asthma patients.Google (O:GOOGL) is, meanwhile, working with French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) to collect and analyze information from diabetes sufferers. The U.S. tech giant also has a partnership with Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that can monitor diabetics' glucose levels. All the companies involved in such projects say they are going to extreme lengths to protect patients' data from hackers. Philips has turned to San Francisco-based identity-management software maker ForgeRock to keep data from the Dutch company's medical devices from falling into the wrong hands. Software security expert Marie Moe, of Norway's SINTEF scientific research foundation, said the wireless ports in the pacemaker that keeps her heart beating left it vulnerable to intrusion - but that she could not survive without the device.""Wireless interfaces are a great benefit to certain patient groups,"" she told Reuters. ""But as a security researcher, I know connectivity also means vulnerability.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

343,"Jan 25, 2016 01:06PM ET","Zika virus set to spread across Americas, spurring vaccine hunt",nan,"By Tom Miles and Ben HirschlerGENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil, is likely to spread to all countries in the Americas except for Canada and Chile, the World Health Organization said on Monday.Zika transmission has not yet been reported in the continental United States, although a woman who fell ill with the virus in Brazil later gave birth to a brain-damaged baby in Hawaii.Brazil's Health Ministry said in November that Zika was linked to a fetal deformation known as microcephaly, in which infants are born with smaller-than-usual brains.Brazil has reported 3,893 suspected cases of microcephaly, the WHO said last Friday, over 30 times more than in any year since 2010 and equivalent to 1-2 percent of all newborns in the state of Pernambuco, one of the worst-hit areas.The Zika outbreak comes hard on the heels of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, demonstrating once again how little-understood diseases can rapidly emerge as global threats.""We've got no drugs and we've got no vaccines. It's a case of deja vu because that's exactly what we were saying with Ebola,"" said Trudie Lang, a professor of global health at the University of Oxford. ""It's really important to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible.""Large drugmakers' investment in tropical disease vaccines with uncertain commercial prospects has so far been patchy, prompting health experts to call for a new system of incentives following the Ebola experience.""We need to have some kind of a plan that makes (companies) feel there is a sustainable solution and not just a one-shot deal over and over again,"" Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said last week.The Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute is currently leading the research charge on Zika and said last week it planned to develop a vaccine ""in record time"", although its director warned this was still likely to take three to five years.British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said on Monday it was studying the feasibility of using its vaccine technology on Zika, while France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) said it was reviewing possibilities. RIO CONCERNSThe virus was first found in a monkey in the Zika forest near Lake Victoria, Uganda, in 1947, and has historically occurred in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. But there is little scientific data on it and it is unclear why it might be causing microcephaly in Brazil.Laura Rodrigues of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was possible the disease could be evolving.If the epidemic was still going on in August, when Brazil is due to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, then pregnant women should either stay away or be obsessive about covering up against mosquito bites, she said.The WHO advised pregnant women planning to travel to areas where Zika is circulating to consult a healthcare provider before traveling and on return.The clinical symptoms of Zika are usually mild and often similar to dengue, a fever which is transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito, leading to fears that Zika will spread into all parts of the world where dengue is commonplace.More than one-third of the world's population lives in areas at risk of dengue infection, in a band stretching through Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Zika's rapid spread, to 21 countries and territories in the Americas since May 2015, is due to the prevalence of Aedes aegypti and a lack of immunity among the population, the WHO said in a statement.RISK TO GIRLSLike rubella, which also causes mild symptoms but can lead to birth defects, health experts believe a vaccine is needed to protect girls before they reach child-bearing age.Evidence about other transmission routes, apart from mosquito bites, is limited. ""Zika has been isolated in human semen, and one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission has been described. However, more evidence is needed to confirm whether sexual contact is a means of Zika transmission,"" the WHO said.While a causal link between Zika and microcephaly has not yet been definitively proven, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said the circumstantial evidence was ""suggestive and extremely worrisome"".In addition to finding a vaccine and potential drugs to fight Zika, some scientists are also planning to take the fight to the mosquitoes that carry the disease.Oxitec, the UK subsidiary of U.S. synthetic biology company Intrexon, hopes to deploy a self-limiting genetically modified strain of insects to compete with normal Aedes aegypti.Oxitec says its proprietary OX513A mosquito succeeded in reducing wild larvae of the Aedes mosquito by 82 percent in an area of Brazil where 25 million of the transgenic insects were released between April and November. Authorities reported a big drop in dengue cases in the area.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

If successful, the deal will play a pivotal role in getting France's most valuable company back on track and delivering on its five-year strategic plan, after the business was hit by lagging diabetes sales and boardroom rows.Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Lazard declined to comment. Lazard has a close relationship with Sanofi Chairman Serge Weinberg who has often recommended the investment bank on deals carried out by his private equity firm Weinberg Capital Partners, another source said. Sanofi's new boss Olivier Brandicourt, 59, took the helm of the drugmaker in April and on Nov. 6 unveiled plans to cut costs by 1.5 billion euros by 2018 while seeking bolt-on acquisitions to continue growing its product offering. But he also hinted at possible disposals, namely Merial and the company's European generic drugs business. The company said on Nov. 6 these two units provide ""limited synergies"" and all options would be considered including retention.Led by Carsten Hellmann, Merial provides veterinary products such as antiparasitics and vaccines and is present in more than 150 countries. The unit, which employs around 6,500 people, expects to exceed 2.4 billion euros in sales this year.Sanofi could favor an initial public offering (IPO) for Merial as any takeover attempts by industry rivals would face antitrust challenges, a banker familiar with the matter said.Merial competes head to head with Pfizer's former animal health business Zoetis (N:ZTS), which Brandicourt helped to list on the New York Stock Exchange in a previous job at  Pfizer  (N:PFE) in 2013.Zoetis, with a market capitalization of $23.4 billion, trades at a multiple of enterprise value to forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 16.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.Sanofi could also pursue an outright sale of its European generics business, worth up to 3 billion euros. But any process would only start in the second half of 2016 due to the lengthy legal work needed to disentangle the European business from its global operations, the sources said.Sanofi's global generics unit had overall sales of 1.8 billion euros in 2014.

347,"Nov 16, 2015 12:34PM ET",How Pfizer has shifted U.S. profits overseas for years,nan,"By Tom Bergin and Kevin DrawbaughRINGASKIDDY, Ireland (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer's (N:PFE) plans to take over Allergan (N:AGN) have faced a political backlash in the United States over fears a deal would lead to the company shifting its headquarters and taxable profits to Ireland.However a Reuters examination of corporate filings in Europe, patent databases and other information shows the company has for over a decade been shifting profits generated by American scientists and patients overseas - to a subsidiary based in the rolling hills of County Cork.  Pfizer  and Allergan are in talks to create the world's biggest drug company by market value and analysts expect a deal would likely involve Pfizer ""inverting"", or reversing into the smaller, Irish-registered Allergan.Ireland's tax rate is 12.5 percent, a fraction of the 35 to 40 percent levied in the United States. President Barack Obama has described inversions as unpatriotic and last year changed some tax rules to make inverting less attractive. Allergan investors fear the U.S. treasury department may scupper a deal with additional measures. Yet any such actions would already be too late to stop New York-based Pfizer from reporting in Ireland profits tied to its U.S. activities.Pfizer has used transactions between companies within its group to allow an Irish subsidiary based in Ringaskiddy - Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals - to buy the rights to patents developed in the United States and then use them to make drugs which are sold back to U.S. affiliates. Even though the Irish and other overseas units pay $3.2 billion a year in royalties to use such patent rights, the higher prices at which Pfizer in the United States imports manufactured drugs from affiliates means almost all the profits from these drugs are reported overseas.Drugs which were discovered in the United States, manufactured in Ringaskiddy and sold back to the United States include anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor - the best-selling prescription drug of all time - and epilepsy drug Lyrica, which generated revenue of over $5 billion last year for Pfizer.Pfizer's actions are entirely lawful and all companies seek to manage their tax bills down.The drugmaker said the prices it used for its inter-subsidiary transactions were fair and that its business structure was motivated primarily by a desire for operational efficiency rather than tax minimization. ""Pfizer fully complies with all applicable accounting and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and pays all taxes due,"" spokeswoman Joan Campion said. Jerry Buttimer, a member of the Irish parliament in whose constituency Ringaskiddy lies, said there was nothing wrong or unusual in companies seeking to reduce their tax bills. ""All companies will do what is in the best interest of its operations and shareholders,"" he said. But Ed Kleinbard, Professor of law at the University of Southern California said the company's arrangements reflected ""aggressive tax planning"" and it seemed, from the outside, to be almost as capable in tax planning as pharmacology. ""This is a company that is investing heavily in tax research, as well as pharmaceutical research,"" he joked. IRISH PROFITS Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals is at the center of the drug company's tax-minimizing structure. It is registered at a two-story 1970s era office block on the road into Ringaskiddy, a hamlet with two pubs and several factories operated by major drug manufacturers, a reflection of Irish government policy over the decades to create jobs in the area. Pfizer licenses the rights to drugs developed in the United States and in other countries like Britain, to Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, according to accounts filed by the Dutch and Belgian parents of Pfizer's Irish units. A manufacturing facility on the 200-acre Ringaskiddy site, which is bordered by green fields on one side and Cork Harbour on the other, produces active ingredients for drugs, based on formulas discovered by overseas affiliates. It currently makes the active ingredients for Lipitor, anti-impotence drug Viagra, anti-lung cancer drug Xalkori and Ibrance, which fights breast cancer.Pfizer also operates other factories across Ireland, and smaller operations in Singapore and Puerto Rico. The compounds pass through a series of Irish companies which, like Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, have unlimited status meaning they do not have to publish accounts, a requirement of similar-sized limited companies in Ireland. Reuters pieced together the Irish subsidiary's activities over the past 11 years from notes in the accounts of affiliates such as UK-registered Pfizer Ltd, Belgian registered Pfizer Research and Development Company NV and CP Pharmaceuticals International CV, the tax-exempt Dutch partnership through which Pfizer owns its overseas activities, including the Irish operations. It also examined patent and public-health databases and spoke to three company executives.Pfizer does have manufacturing plants in the United States but filings for its overseas units show non-U.S. companies supply over 80 percent of U.S. sales. Those sales generate margins of around 40 percent for Pfizer's overseas arm - earning it over $17 billion in 2013. However, Pfizer has reported losses on its U.S. business in each of the past five years. Pfizer said it follows the ""arm's length"" tax principle when conducting inter-company sales and purchases. This says companies should transact with affiliates at the same prices unconnected companies would. However, academics say it is very hard to judge whether inter-company sales of unique products like patented chemicals, for which there is no independent open market, are conducted at prices that independent companies would agree to use. ""The current arm's length rules are always difficult to enforce because of the lack of a comparable price (in the drugs industry),"" said Edmund Outslay, tax accounting professor, Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. U.S. COSTS Many of Pfizer's group costs like research, debt and top management are mostly borne in the United States, despite non U.S. operations accounting for over 60 percent of global sales and 50 percent of hard assets like plants and property. For example, Pfizer has $30-40 billion in long-term debt but only $12 million of it is borne by the overseas arm, filings for CP Pharmaceuticals International show. The company said the practice of borrowing in the United States reflected lender preferences rather than any attempt to shift profits.It added that it was natural for a U.S. company to bear a big share of its overhead costs in the United States. But academics and campaigners are skeptical. ""Pfizer maximizes the deductions it takes in the U.S. and maximizes the income it shifts to low-tax jurisdictions,"" Outslay said. Pfizer denies its allocation of costs is an intentional ploy to cut taxes. While it manages to report most of the profits generated by U.S. activity overseas, if it wants to take the overseas profits home, to pay dividends or fund buybacks, it has to pay the difference between the tax paid on the money – around 12.5 percent – and the U.S. tax rate. Of $16 billion of U.S. income taxes Pfizer has paid since 2009, almost all reflects payments in relation to such remitting of profits from overseas subsidiaries, a Reuters analysis of group filings shows.Even including this tax on remitted earnings, the amount of cash Pfizer pays in overall income taxes as a share of its profits is lower than rivals like Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), Denmark's  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Paris-based Sanofi (PA:SASY). To avoid having to pay the tax due when cash is repatriated, Pfizer keeps most of its foreign earnings overseas and, indeed, much of it stays in Ireland. In the capital, an office building near the mouth of the Liffey in Ringsend houses Pfizer's Dublin Treasury Centre, which the company says is responsible for treasury operations outside the United States and for helping manage Pfizer's offshore pile of cash on which no U.S. tax has been paid.According to a presentation given by one of its staff last year, this unit overseas a cash mountain approaching $50 billion. But if Pfizer does complete an inversion, the practice of stockpiling foreign profits in Dublin may no longer be necessary. That's because as an Irish-headquartered group it would be free to use its cash for dividends without incurring additional U.S. tax.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

348,"Nov 12, 2015 05:50AM ET","Germany, U.S. in hot pursuit of 'messenger' drug molecules",nan,"By Ludwig Burger and Ben HirschlerFRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - A molecule that carries the recipe for making drugs inside body cells is exciting scientists and investors alike, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in a scramble for the next promising area of biotechnology.German and U.S. firms are leading the way in synthetic messenger RNA, or mRNA technology, a new approach to tackling a range of hard-to-treat diseases.In theory, the promise of mRNA is enormous, ranging from cancer to infectious diseases to heart and kidney disorders, since it could be used to tackle the 80 percent of proteins that are difficult to affect with existing medicines.Despite a recent sell-off in biotech stocks, sparked by U.S. Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's threat to crack down on drug pricing, enthusiasm for mRNA, is rising.Four-year-old Moderna Therapeutics, based in Massachusetts, which raised a record-breaking $450 million in a private funding round in January, valuing it at $3 billion, has so far hogged the limelight but German companies are flexing their muscles.Privately-held CureVac in the university town of Tuebingen, which already has backing from Microsoft (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates thanks to its vaccine work, last week raised $110 million from new investors, valuing it at $1.6 billion.And Mainz-based BioNTech clinched a deal possibly worth up to $1.5 billion with Sanofi (PA:SASY) to use mRNA to fight cancer. BioNTech is owned by the Struengmann family who sold generic drugmaker Hexal to Novartis in 2005. Driving the point home, the third International mRNA Health Conference is being held in Berlin this week. Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are all sponsoring the event.Today's biotech medicines use complex proteins or antibodies to treat disease, while traditional tablets such as aspirin or Viagra are simple chemicals. Harnessing synthetic mRNA is a different model altogether.In effect, mRNA serves as software that can be injected into the body to instruct ribosomes, the ""3D-printers"" found inside cells, to churn out desired proteins.""This is a radically different approach from conventional approaches, where therapeutic proteins are produced outside the human body and active ingredients need to be isolated, purified and cooled and then be inserted back into the human body at great complexity and cost,"" said CureVac co-founder and CEO Ingmar Hoerr.LONG-TERM BETSingle-stranded RNA, which helps to relay information encoded in double-helix DNA molecules, for a long time attracted only academic interest because it was seen as too unstable to handle. But advances in chemistry have increased both stability and potency, paving the way to the creation of potential drugs, although big challenges remain to prove their clinical value.""It's still a long-term bet,"" said Andy Smith, chief investment officer at fund manager Mann Bioinvest. ""I don't think it is ready for prime time just yet."" Still, ever more big pharmaceutical companies are lining up to do deals with mRNA firms.Some of the most advanced work to date has been in vaccines, where CureVac is a leader with clinical trials in prostate cancer and rabies. Overall, the company has tested its products on more than 300 clinical trial participants and its relatively maturity means it could be the first mRNA player to go public.The company says it is getting ready for a possible initial public offering, but declines to say when.Moderna has yet to start clinical trials, although it has ambitious plans for parallel studies with multiple drug candidates, alongside partners including AstraZeneca, Merck (N:MRK) & Co and Alexion.Marcus Schindler, vice president for cardiovascular and metabolic drug discovery at AstraZeneca, is particularly excited about the promise of mRNA in producing a radical new treatment for heart failure, by regenerating cardiac tissue.AstraZeneca plans to start testing mRNA as an agent to improve coronary blood flow in human trials in 2016. This follows promising data in animals that suggests synthetic mRNA can be delivered accurately and produce the right amount of protein.""The field is moving very rapidly,"" Schindler said. ""I predict it will have a significant impact."" As a chemically synthesized product, Schindler believes mRNA should be cheaper to make than current costly antibody drugs.But potential obstacles remain in the form of optimizing drug delivery and possible side effects, while the history of biotech advances suggests some unforeseen setbacks are likely as the technology moves into large clinical trials. Other companies working in the mRNA area include Argos Therapeutics, eTheRNA, Ethris and Factor Bioscience.(editing by David Stamp) OLUSSCIENCE Reuters US Online Report Science News 20151112T104020+0000"

353,"Oct 05, 2015 10:23AM ET",Beating parasites wins three scientists Nobel prize for medicine,nan,"By Simon Johnson and Ben HirschlerSTOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - Three scientists from Japan, China and Ireland whose discoveries led to the development of potent new drugs against parasitic diseases including malaria and elephantiasis won the Nobel Prize for Medicine on Monday.Irish-born William Campbell and Japan's Satoshi Omura won half of the prize for discovering avermectin, a derivative of which has been used to treat hundreds of millions of people with river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, or elephantiasis.China's Tu Youyou was awarded the other half of the prize for discovering artemisinin, a drug that has slashed malaria deaths and has become the mainstay of fighting the mosquito-borne disease. She is China's first Nobel laureate in medicine.Some 3.4 billion people, most of them living in poor countries, are at risk of contracting the three parasitic diseases. ""These two discoveries have provided humankind with powerful new means to combat these debilitating diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people annually,"" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said.""The consequences in terms of improved human health and reduced suffering are immeasurable.""Today, the medicine ivermectin, a derivative of avermectin made by Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co, is used worldwide to fight roundworm parasites, while artemisinin-based drugs from firms including Novartis and Sanofi (PARIS:SASY) are the main weapons against malaria.Omura and Campbell made their breakthrough in fighting parasitic worms, or helminths, after studying compounds from soil bacteria. That led to the discovery of avermectin, which was then further modified into ivermectin.The treatment is so successful that river blindness and lymphatic filariasis are now on the verge of being eradicated.Omura, 80, said the real credit for the achievement should go to the ingenuity of the Streptomyces bacteria, whose naturally occurring chemicals were so effective at killing off parasites.""I really wonder if I deserve this,"" he said after learning he had won the prize. ""I have done all my work depending on microbes and learning from them, so I think the microbes might almost deserve it more than I do.""Omura is professor emeritus at Kitasato University in Japan, while Campbell is research fellow emeritus at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey.""This was the work of a team of researchers so it is by no means my work, it's our work,"" said Campbell, 85, who learned of his prize in a pre-dawn phone call from Reuters that woke him at his home in North Andover, Massachusetts. ""In the first decade, there were 70 authors that I co-authored papers with. That gives you some idea of the number of people involved,"" he said.TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINETu, meanwhile, turned to a traditional Chinese herbal medicine in her hunt for a better malaria treatment, following the declining success of the older drugs chloroquine and quinine.She found that an extract from the plant Artemisia annua was sometimes effective but the results were inconsistent, so she went back to ancient literature, including a recipe from AD 350, in the search for clues.This eventually led to the isolation of artemisinin, a new class of anti-malaria drug, which was available in China before it reached the West. Tu, 84, has worked at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine since 1965.World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl said the award of a Nobel prize for the discovery was a great tribute to the contribution of Chinese science in fighting malaria.""We now have drugs that kill these parasites very early in their life-cycle,"" said Juleen Zierath, chair of the Nobel Committee. ""They not only kill these parasites but they stop these infections from spreading."" Death rates from malaria have plunged 60 percent in the past 15 years, although the disease still kills around half a million people a year, the vast majority of them babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa.The 8 million Swedish crowns ($960,000) medicine prize is the first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year. Prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.Last year, the medicine prize went to three scientists who discovered the brain's inner navigation system.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sanofi bought Genzyme in 2011.Seprafilm is a clear film used to reduce abnormal internal scarring that can cause organs and tissues to stick together following pelvic and abdominal surgeries known as laparotomies.But the Justice Department said some sales representatives taught surgeons how to turn Seprafilm into a ""slurry"" for use in increasingly popular laparoscopic surgery, even though U.S. regulators had never approved the film for that use.According to papers filed with the federal court in Tampa, Florida, Genzyme admitted and accepted responsibility for the facts underlying the two criminal counts.The two-year deferred prosecution agreement calls for improved oversight, and steps to halt Seprafilm sales for off-label uses. If Genzyme complies, the government will dismiss the charges.Genzyme, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in a statement it is ""confident"" in the compliance measures it has taken.In December 2013, Genzyme reached a $22.28 million civil agreement to resolve claims related to Seprafilm under the federal False Claims Act.The Justice Department said Thursday's settlement reflects Genzyme's ""significant"" cooperation during the probe.The case is U.S. v. Genzyme Corp, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, No. 15-cr-00352.(This version of the story corrects name of court in case citation)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

359,"Aug 10, 2015 12:00PM ET",Sanofi Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal,nan,"By Amy Nordrum -Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi (PARIS:SASY) is partnering with two biotech companies -- Evotec AG in Hamburg, Germany and Apeiron Biologics AG in Vienna, Austria – in its latest effort to develop a drug that will harness the body’s own immune system in the fight against cancer. The focus of the new collaboration will be on a first-in-class treatment that takes aim at tumors and cancers of the blood by boosting the function of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.This strategy, known as immuno-oncology, turns the body’s own immune system against cancer cells and represents an emerging area of drug development. Already, major pharmaceutical companies including Merck (NYSE:MRK), Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb have devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to the idea and launched several treatments known as PD-1 inhibitors that work in this manner. Others, such as Sanofi, are eager to get in the game.“Immuno-oncology has emerged as a particularly promising field to create potentially curative treatment options for many cancer patients,” Victoria Richon, a vice president and head of cancer research for Sanofi, said in a statement. ”Our partnership with experts at Evotec and Apeiron Biologics will help us take the next step toward realizing the full value of these innovative treatments.”As part of the new agreement, Sanofi will pay the two biotech companies up to 200 million euros, or $219 million, each over two years to research, develop and commercialize treatments, plus additional royalties once these drugs hit the market.The announcement comes on the heels of Sanofi’s $2 billion deal with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN). that pays Regeneron to develop an immuno-oncology treatment that is already in its pipeline. In that deal, the companies will split the profits of any drugs that debut from the collaboration."

Amgen now sees adjusted earnings of $9.55 to $9.80 per share, up from its prior view of $9.35 to $9.65. It sees revenue coming in between $21.1 billion and $21.4 billion, up from $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion.""The magnitude of the guidance raise was substantial,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. ""The numbers are all very good."" Amgen's shares rose 1.8 percent in extended trading.The company is expecting U.S. approval of what could be its next big product, a potent new type of cholesterol fighter called Repatha, by late August.

362,"Jul 22, 2015 08:56AM ET",Plant 'milkers' seek molecules for medicines and make-up,nan,"By Gilbert ReilhacLARONXE, France (Reuters) - A quiet village in eastern France is home to an unusual greenhouse.Farmers at the site in Laronxe, about 100 km (60 miles) from Strasbourg, are growing plants in an unconventional way so they can ""milk"" them for rare molecules that could be used in medicines, cosmetics and agrochemicals.Several major companies, including German chemicals group BASF and French cosmetics maker Chanel, have teamed up with Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT) in the hope of securing privileged access to the so-called biomolecules it extracts through the use of a patented technique.""Our job is to develop vegetal platforms that will produce very rare biomolecules on an industrial scale,"" Jean-Paul Fevre, co-founder of PAT, and a former head of research with French drugmaker Sanofi (PARIS:SASY), told Reuters.The 10-year-old French firm tests around 100 plant species every year. They are grown using aeroponics, a soil-free culture system that allow roots to interact with a mist containing various nutrients to allow the plants to grow. The biomolecules PAT hunts are those produced when plants' defenses are triggered, which it has found to be most useful for commercial applications. In a process similar to vaccination, farmers spray on liquids containing traces of a bacteria, insect or fungus that attack the plant - to activate its defenses - before submerging the roots in a solvent to extract the desired molecules. The operation is repeated several times a year.""Plants generate defense molecules naturally,"" said Frederic Bourgaud, a PAT vice president. ""We ensure they produce as many of them as possible,"" he said. PAT is not alone in seeking to extract commercially promising ingredients from plants - the field includes firms such as Italy's Indena and France's Pierre Fabre and Naturex. But it is the only company to use the ""milking"" technique to harvest molecules.PESTICIDES, DRUGSBASF, the world's largest chemicals company by sales, sealed a deal with PAT in May under which it gains exclusive access to tests involving molecules that could be used in agriculture, such as biological pesticides. In return, the German group provides PAT with research teams and industrial know-how.""What makes PAT stand out is their ability to target the right plants. On a blind search, you may end up testing some 150,000 molecules before identifying the right one but I would say they have a 30 percent rate,"" said Jean-Marc Petat, BASF France's head of sustainable development, referring to their rate of success for finding potentially useful molecules.The global biopesticide and synthetic pesticide market will grow from $54.8 billion in 2013 to $83.7 billion by 2019, according to research firm BCC. Biopesticides on their own accounted for around $3.6 billion of the market last year and that figure could reach $6.9 billion by 2019, it said.Chanel was the first company to sign a production agreement with PAT, in 2012, teaming up to manufacture a new anti-aging cream made out of an edulis, a plant native to South Africa, that is now on the market.PAT says it has 28 promising molecules in its pipeline and that some of its products could be used to design medicines to fight diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.The company, listed on the European small and midcap Alternext index and owned by its three co-founders, aims to become profitable by the end of 2016.The firm also aims to become one of the first groups to extract proteins from genetically modified carnivorous plants. The proteins could be used by the health sector to manufacture cheaper and safer insulin or growth hormones, it says.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Amgen's high-dose monthly injection could be seen as more convenient and might appeal to doctors because of its higher potency. Regeneron and Sanofi could enjoy a significant pricing advantage with their low-dose option. Both drugs belong to a new class of antibodies that target PCSK9, a protein that maintains ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood, and are aimed at the millions of people who don't benefit from statins.

371,"May 13, 2015 07:42AM ET",How DNA sequencing is transforming the hunt for new drugs,nan,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - Drug manufacturers have begun amassing enormous troves of human DNA in hopes of significantly shortening the time it takes to identify new drug candidates, a move some say is transforming the development of medicines.The efforts will help researchers identify rare genetic mutations by scanning large databases of volunteers who agree to have their DNA sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records. It is made possible by the dramatically lower cost of genetic sequencing - it took government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. As of last year, the cost was closer to $1,500 per genome, down from $20,000 five years ago.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which signed a deal with Pennsylvania's Geisinger Health System in January 2014 to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, is already claiming discoveries based on the new approach. Company executives told Reuters they have used data from the first 35,000 volunteers to confirm the promise of 250 genes on a list of targets for drugs aimed at common medical conditions, including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.Regeneron says it has also identified ""several dozen"" new gene targets, including a novel gene that plays a role in obesity. Pfizer Inc, Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc are working on similar projects that use DNA and patient health data to find new drug targets or predict the effects of drugs. Their investments have been inspired by early successes in cancer with drugs such as Pfizer's lung cancer treatment Xalkori, which was approved in 2011 and targets mutations in tumors driving the disease. More recently, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has changed the treatment of cystic fibrosis with Kalydeco, which targets the disease's underlying genetic cause.""All of a sudden, it all opened up,"" as companies recognize the potential for drugs targeting genetic glitches, Dr. Eric Topol, a genomics expert at the Scripps Translational Science Institute. ""It's starting to really become a new preferred model for drug development.""In the past, discovering such genes was a painstaking process, often involving years of research into isolated populations. In 1991, for example, researchers discovered a rare mutation in a gene called Angptl3 that caused very low levels of artery-clogging cholesterol and triglycerides among families in the remote Italian village of Campodimele.It took nearly two more decades and several groups of scientists to fully understand the potential cardiovascular benefits linked to mutations in that gene. Since last autumn, the Regeneron Genetics Center has sequenced the DNA of more than 35,000 Geisinger patients and is on track to sequence 100,000 by year end. Already, the company has identified 100 people carrying similar cholesterol-affecting mutations to those first observed in Campodimele and elsewhere.""You no longer have to find that one rare family in Italy, because it's just in the database,"" said Dr. George Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron.    PRECISION MEDICINE   Identifying target genes is just a first step, though, and does not guarantee that a drug can be developed on a genetic lead, or that it will ultimately be safe and effective enough to be used.Experts also differ on approach. Regeneron is sequencing exomes, the protein-making genes that comprise 1 to 2 percent of the genome, a search that costs roughly $700 per person. Others favor looking at the whole genome, which costs the $1,500 per person.Craig Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, believes the whole genome approach will be more meaningful over time.""I'd rather have a gold mine with a deep vein of gold and modern industrial equipment to mine it rather than sitting there with a pan in a stream looking for gold,"" he said. ""Both will find gold. It's a question of how much you find.""Even so, the early returns from new ""genomic"" medicines have attracted attention from the White House. In January, President Barack Obama said he would seek $130 million from Congress to gather genetic data from 1 million volunteers as part of a ""precision medicine"" initiative.Regeneron is lobbying for the Geisinger database to become a cornerstone of that effort, and proposes creating a consortium of drugmakers to fund it. In return, Yancopoulos said, the company hopes to recoup some of its investment.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is in charge of the precision medicine project, identified Regeneron among a short list of potential contributors to the 1 million-strong DNA study. Others on the list include Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin. A decision is expected by early fall.For drug companies, the lure of a big payoff is strong. Regeneron and its partner Sanofi (PARIS:SASY) are expected to soon win regulatory approval for a cholesterol-lowering drug that works by blocking the PCSK9 gene. Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Pfizer have developed similar treatments.Individuals born with non-functioning versions of PCSK9 have very low cholesterol. The new drugs mimic that effect and are considered a poster child for treatments that take advantage of glitches in the genome that prove beneficial to the rare individuals who carry them. Wall Street analysts project Regeneron/Sanofi's PCSK9 drug will generate revenues of $4.4 billion by 2019.    MINING THE DATA Amgen bolstered its search for gene targets by buying Decode Genetics in late 2012 for $415 million, giving it a database of complete genetic sequences of 2,636 Icelanders. The community shares a relatively homogenous genetic profile due to its geographic isolation, allowing researchers to identify gene variations more easily.In March, Amgen reported the discovery of a new mutation that increases the risk of Alzheimer's and confirmed the role of two mutations involved in diabetes and atrial fibrillation.This past January, Roche's Genentech unit tapped Venter's Human Longevity Inc for a large sequencing project. Genetic testing company 23andMe announced deals this year with Genentech and Pfizer. Genentech will have access to 3,000 individuals in 23andMe's community of Parkinson's patients, and Pfizer will expand an existing collaboration with the company to study the genetics of lupus.That same month, Biogen formed a $30 million research alliance to support the formation of a sequencing center at Columbia University.""All of the companies are feeling like, 'Oh my gosh. We have to do something substantial in genomics – yesterday,'"" said Dr. David Goldstein, director of Columbia's Institute for Genomic Medicine.At the heart of Regeneron's model is finding rare mutations that disable normal gene function. So far, it has identified people with at least one such ""loss-of-function"" gene that correlates with nearly all 250 genes on the company's list of drug targets. That includes essentially every gene previously linked to triglyceride regulation and several novel candidates, Yancopoulos said. They have done the same for cholesterol and coronary artery disease.Regeneron has also partnered with academic centers studying families with extreme genetic disorders, collaborations that already have led to the discovery of a couple of dozen new candidate genes, said Dr. Aris Baras, who runs Regeneron's genetics center.In one case, they are using the Geisinger database to study a rare gene they believe causes severe obesity in young children. The team has found milder mutations in the overall population that may cause an average 10-pound weight gain in adults. That would validate the role that such genes play in regulating body weight and suggests that, ""if you had a drug it could have a profound effect,"" Yancopoulos said.""This is why everybody is excited about it,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Stocks on the NASDAQ Composite index and S&P 500 Composite index also increased more than 1% on the day. Led by gains in the health care and utilities sectors, the S&P 500 gained 1.35% or 27.79 to close at 2,081.19. Nine of the 10 sectors on the S&P 500 closed higher with only materials lagging. The NASDAQ, meanwhile, rose 1.19% or 57.75 to 4,929.51. The top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which gained 2.84% or 3.27 to 118.52. The worst performer on the Dow, meanwhile, was EI du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) which lost 4.26% or 3.43 to close at 77.07, after the chemical conglomerate was given a downgrade by Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

378,"Jan 30, 2015 05:00AM ET","Three months on, fruitless CEO search overshadows Sanofi ",nan,"By Andrew Callus and Noëlle MennellaPARIS (Reuters) - Barring a last-minute breakthrough, drugs firm Sanofi's Chairman Serge Weinberg may have to acknowledge in his results presentation next week that the hunt for a new chief executive is not going well.At least three potential candidates in a narrow field have turned their back on the job heading France's largest company.The manner of Chris Viehbacher's shock dismissal three months ago, and the surprisingly small pay-off he won last week, have cast a long shadow over the process.""I think it is going to take time,"" said a source close to the company. ""What we risk missing in the meantime is a strategic vision that you cannot have without a deep knowledge of the pharmaceuticals sector.""Last week Christophe Weber, the French chief operating officer of Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, told Reuters he had rejected an approach.Paris-schooled Olivier Bohuon, chief executive of British medical devices maker Smith & Nephew, told staff in November he had no plans to leave, and in the same month, former Wyeth boss Bernard Poussot joined the board of Sanofi's rival Roche.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, another prominent French pharma executive, has played down any interest by saying he sees himself as more Australian than French.Weinberg, who will be 64 on Feb. 10 and does not have a pharmaceuticals background besides his five years on the board, is running Sanofi himself while board member Jean-Rene Fourtou conducts a search -- one which began well before Viehbacher was fired.Weinberg has said an understanding of Sanofi's French culture is important to the search for ""mainly outside candidates"".But he has rebuffed suggestions that non-French candidates are unwelcome, despite his experience with the German-Canadian Viehbacher, who ruffled establishment feathers by keeping secret plans to cut French jobs, and by moving his domicile to the United States. Nevertheless, insiders say a command of the French language would be important.Viehbacher was fired abruptly on Oct. 29 last year, hours after he had presented a poor set of third-quarter results, and days after a leaked letter he sent to the board showed he had found out months earlier of Weinberg's plan to get rid of him.The news came as a shock to investors, who had hitherto seen the outspoken and affable former GlaxoSmithKline executive as a strong manager. Weinberg put the sacking down to poor execution and lack of communication with the board -- citing partly a poor outlook for the diabetes division, which accounts for more than 30 percent of profits.SEVERANCE QUESTIONSIt has not been all bad news for post-Viehbacher Sanofi. Last week, U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race to market with Amgen. And Sanofi's shares, down about 1.7 percent at 82 euros since the sacking and the poor third-quarter figures, have recovered most of the losses suffered after the initial shock.But some believe the discount they carry to their peer group should be bigger. Citi analysts earlier in January downgraded Sanofi to 'Sell' from 'Neutral', targeting a 70 euro price that implies a 2016 price-to-earnings ratio of 13 times compared with a sector average of 15.Meanwhile, last week's announcement of Viehbacher's severance settlement has raised new questions about whether there is more behind his dismissal. Viehbacher received 4.44 million euros ($5 million) in severance, even though the amount stipulated under the terms of his employment was 5.92 million euros.""The trouble with finding a successor hinges on the fact that we don't know the real reason he was fired, and because a lot of people are asking themselves questions about the subject,"" said an industry insider who has spoken to some potential candidates.""The very low pay-off he received only reinforces the idea that the reasons he was fired are not the ones that have been talked about.""A Sanofi spokeswoman confirmed that the negotiated pay-off was lower than specified in Sanofi's annual report filing but she said these terms did not apply because his dismissal was not related to a change in control or strategy.She declined to comment further on why his severance package was so low.Viehbacher did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Fourth-quarter results are due on Feb. 5.($1 = 0.8840 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

381,"Dec 23, 2014 07:31AM ET",Exclusive: Express Scripts presses for more drug savings with coverage list ,nan,"By Deena Beasley LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts (O:ESRX), the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year. On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's (O:GILD)  rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc (O:AMGN) and Biogen Inc (O:BIIB), will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc (L:SHP), Novo Nordisk (VX:NOVN) and Theravance Inc (O:THRX), may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment. Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won't cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market. Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015. The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts' biggest ""formulary"" list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said. Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said. Employers ""are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,"" Miller said. ""We are going to be opportunistic"" in looking for savings in the future. Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90. Shares in Amgen, Biogen and Celgene CELG.O fell more than 2 percent. CVS HEALTH The second largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, CVS Health Corp (N:CVS), has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year, up from 72 in 2014. It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2015. The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive, ""me-too"" products, in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients. Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) are developing slightly longer-lasting insulins. Amgen, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), respectively sell Enbrel, Humira and Remicade - all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (N:TEVA) and Actavis (N:ACT) want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's drugs, respectively, before the arrival of cheap generic competitors. The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and Sanofi. Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U.S. price discounts on some of their biggest brand-name medicines will hurt 2015 sales. Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories, including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments, where there are multiple options for doctors and patients, observers said. ""The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma, (high cholesterol), Alzheimer's and cancer,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. ""If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.""   DIMINISHING RETURNS In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc's (N:PFE) Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co's (N:MRK) asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably. In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse. The influx of generics ""allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,"" said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity's Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio. ""At the same time, others are launching innovative new drugs ... Based on those dynamics I get more concerned. Where is the give in the system? It's on the legacy products."" Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments. Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis, AbbVie, Novartis AG (VX:NOVN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY). ""When you look at the industry as a whole, we will probably see less profitability,"" said Nils Behnke, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. ""Mid-sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products, 'me-too' products - they will have a hard time."" Murray Aitken, vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health (N:IMS), estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand-name drugs will total about $20 billion compared with about $3 billion in 2012. Industry executives say newer health plans, whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer, will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs. Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient. Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a leading drug industry trade group, said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions. But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor's orders. ""Plan sponsors, because of the rapid rise in cost, are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more"" for their medicines, said Express Scripts' Miller. ""If you can't afford your healthcare, you don't take it.""  (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering) "
382,"Dec 08, 2014 09:10PM ET",Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy,nan,"By Vidya L Nathan and Ben Hirschler (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) said it would buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:CBST) for $8.4 billion plus assumption of debt, giving the major drugmaker an entry into the market for drugs that combat so-called superbugs. The deal is the latest sign that large pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention back to antibiotics after decades of low investment. The spread of superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics threatens modern medicine, the World Health Organization said in April, warning of ""a post-antibiotic era"" in which common infections were killers once again. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated last year that more than 2 million people in the United States are sickened every year by superbug infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. (http://1.usa.gov/1w5Hhml) Merck said on Monday that the deal, which will give it access to Cubist's antibiotic Cubicin, is expected to add more than $1 billion to revenue in 2015 after closing in the first quarter, but will be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share until 2016. Cubist's third-quarter sales rose 16 percent, driven by strong sales of Cubicin. Cubist may lose patent protection for Cubicin earlier than expected, after a Friday federal court ruling that invalidated four of its patents. If the ruling stands, it will allow Hospira Inc to launch a generic version of the drug in 2016. Merck could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling. Cubist's lead drug in development, Ceftolozane/Tazobactam, is widely expected to win marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this month as a treatment for complicated urinary tract infections. Merck will pay $102 per share for Cubist, a premium of 37 percent to the Lexington, Massachussetts-based company's closing share price of $74.36 on Friday. The deal includes assumption of $1.1 billion in debt. ""Cubist is a global leader in antibiotics and has built a strong portfolio of both marketed and late-stage pipeline medicines,"" Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. ""Combining this expertise with Merck's strong capabilities and global reach will enable us to create a stronger position in hospital acute care while addressing critical areas of unmet medical need, such as antibiotic resistance."" Merck has said it is focusing on acute care within hospitals - considered a hotbed for superbug infections such as bacterial pneumonia - as a top priority. Many drugmakers have cut investment in the past because antibiotics are typically low-priced and used for only short periods, generating poor returns. That has fueled demands for a rethink of the antibiotic market model. It has also left Cubist as a leading investor in the field, with an annual research budget for antibiotics of $400 million. More recently, however, there have been signs of a revival, with Roche Holding AG (VX:ROG), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) all investing in new approaches to fight superbugs. Cubist shares were trading at $101.04 premarket. Merck shares were unchanged from Friday's close at $61.50. The New York Times, citing people briefed on the matter, first reported the deal on Friday. The Cubist deal is Merck's second big acquisition this year. The company bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals for $3.85 billion in June to boost its hepatitis C drug portfolio.

A total of 900 posts will be eliminated at GSK's Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina as drug research is consolidated in Philadelphia and in Stevenage, near London, according to a filing with the North Carolina Department of Commerce. (http://www.nccommerce.com/Portals/11/Documents/Reports/WARN/Warn.pdf) GSK, however, said some staff would be offered the chance to relocate to other sites. ""This is a significant program and will result in the loss of several hundred employees in the U.S. commercial business and a similar number in R&D activities based in the U.S.,"" a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. Sources familiar with the matter said at the weekend the drugmaker would inform U.S. staff about the job cuts as it starts implementing a big cost-saving program, following a sharp decline in sales of its top-selling lung drug Advair. Britain's biggest drugmaker announced in October that the new restructuring scheme would save 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) in annual costs over three years, although it did not go into details at the time. Staff in the United States, where GSK employs 17,000 people in commercial and research operations, were briefed on the changes on Wednesday. ""Cuts are not being made across the board but are strategic, focused changes to allow GSK to operate more efficiently,"" the spokesman said. ""This is a rescaling of work to reflect market forces that were anticipated but that have accelerated and are affecting the entire industry."" Respiratory medicine has traditionally been GSK's strongest business and Advair, an inhaled therapy for asthma and chronic lung disease, is its biggest seller. But Advair sales are now tumbling in the United States, while new lung drugs Breo and Anoro are proving slow to take off. Advair has been hit by competition from rivals and an increasing trend by U.S. health insurers to use hardball tactics to get drugmakers to cut prices for older products. French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has reported similar pressures from U.S. insurers in the diabetes market. U.S. insurers, who themselves are under pressure to keep premiums in check, are pushing back particularly hard on prices for medicines in areas like diabetes and respiratory diseases where there are multiple options for doctors and patients.

Britain's top drugmaker announced at third-quarter results on Oct. 22 that the new restructuring scheme would save 1 billion pounds ($1.56 billion) in annual costs over three years, but it has yet to tell employees where the axe will fall. Staff in the United States, where GSK has been struggling with falling sales of respiratory drugs, will be briefed on the changes on Wednesday by the company's head of North American pharmaceuticals Deirdre Connelly, the sources said. A GSK spokesman declined to go into details but said the aim of the restructuring program was to improve performance by reducing complexity and establishing a smaller, more focused and lower-cost organization. ""Each business unit is currently deciding how to respond to this challenge. When we do have proposals, we will first share those with our employees,"" he said in an e-mailed statement. Respiratory medicine has traditionally been GSK's strongest business and Advair - an inhaled therapy for asthma and chronic lung disease - is its biggest seller. But Advair sales are now tumbling the United States, while new lung drugs Breo and Anoro are proving slow to take off. Advair has been hit by competition from rivals and an increasing trend by U.S. health insurers to use hardball tactics to get drugmakers to cut prices for older products. French drugmaker Sanofi has reported similar pressures from U.S. insurers in the diabetes market.  U.S. insurers, who themselves are under pressure to keep premiums in check, are pushing back particularly hard on prices for medicines in areas like diabetes and respiratory diseases where there are multiple options for doctors and patients. The revamped GSK operation in the United States is designed to defend the company's margins in this tough environment. The changes will also take into account the movement of some pharmaceuticals staff as a result of a complex asset swap deal with Switzerland's Novartis, which is taking over GSK's oncology business.

385,"Nov 26, 2014 01:00PM ET",Exclusive: First gene therapy drug sets million-euro price record,nan,"By Ludwig Burger and Ben Hirschler FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - The Western world's first gene therapy drug is set to go on sale in Germany with a 1.1 million euro ($1.4 million) price tag, a new record for a medicine to treat a rare disease.The sky-high cost of Glybera, from Dutch biotech firm UniQure (O:QURE) and its unlisted Italian marketing partner Chiesi, shows how single curative therapies to fix faulty genes may upend the conventional pharmaceutical business model.After a quarter century of experiments and several setbacks, gene therapy is finally throwing a life-line to patients by inserting corrective genes into malfunctioning cells - but paying for it poses a challenge.The new drug fights an ultra-rare genetic disease called lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) that clogs the blood with fat. The medicine was approved in Europe two years ago but its launch was delayed to allow for the collection of six-year follow-up data on its benefits.Now Chiesi has filed a pricing dossier with Germany's Federal Joint Committee, or G-BA, which will issue an assessment of the drug's benefits by the end of April 2015. The company is seeking a retail price of 53,000 euros per vial, or 43,870 euros ex-factory.That equates to 1.11 million euros for an typical LPLD patient, averaging 62.5 kg in clinical trials, who will need 42 injections from 21 vials. This price will be subject to a standard 7 percent discount under Germany's drug pricing system.Under German rules, the launch price for a new drug is valid for the first 12 months.A Chiesi spokeswoman confirmed the launch price, in response to inquiries from Reuters, prompted by information from health insurance sources. She added that a final figure would be set after the G-BA gives its verdict and negotiations are held with statutory health insurance funds.""First commercial treatments are expected in the first half 2015,"" she said.UniQure, which will get a net royalty of between 23 and 30 percent on sales, said EU pricing was a matter for its Italian partner, although the Dutch firm does plan to discuss Glybera pricing during an investor meeting in New York on Dec. 1.BENCHMARK PRODUCTWith only 150 to 200 patients likely to be eligible for Glybera across Europe, the impact on healthcare budgets will be small, even at a very high price - but this case will be watched closely as a benchmark for future gene therapies.UniQure also has plans to seek approval for Glybera in the United States, which it hopes to get in 2018.Although there is already a gene therapy for cancer on the market in China that drug has not been rolled out to other countries, making Glybera a first for the Western world.Proponents of the gene-fixing technology insist it stacks up as a cost-effective treatment, despite the high cost, since it could permanently cure many patients.In the case of Glybera, Chiesi said the annualized cost was no more than that charged for some expensive enzyme replacement therapies used in other rare diseases, taking into account the drug's proven benefits of at least six years.The drug consists of a harmless modified virus that carries a corrective gene into the body's cells.UniQure is also working on gene treatments for hemophilia and has an early-stage project in heart failure, which would take gene therapy beyond the rare disease space.Assuming trials are successful, analysts expect gene medicines treating more common conditions to cost less, since manufacturers should be able to recoup their research and development investment from a larger patient group.Rivals in the gene therapy market include privately owned Spark Therapeutics, which has an eye drug in late-stage clinical tests, and Bluebird Bio (O:BLUE), which is working on drugs for neurological and blood disorders.Bluebird Bio and UniQure both staged successful floats on the Nasdaq market in the past 18 months, reflecting growing investor interest in the field.Among major pharmaceutical companies, Bayer (DE:BAYGn) struck a gene therapy deal with Dimension Therapeutics in June, while Novartis (VX:NOVN) recently established a new cell and gene therapies unit, and Sanofi (PA:SASY) has a long-standing tie-up with Oxford BioMedica (L:OXB).(Writing by Ben Hirschler; editing by Philippa Fletcher)"

Then it leaked into the press in the summer.This might have been the tipping point for Weinberg, who cited the issue as an example of Viehbacher's poor communication with the board, and said he had begun discussions about replacing him around that same time.Viehbacher told Reuters just before he was fired that the review had never become an actual project, and so there had been no need to share it. One investor said that might have been unwise.""As CEO, do not try to sell an $8 billion drug portfolio without informing your board, if you want to keep your job!"" said Geir Lode, head of Hermes Global Equities.LANTUS WOESWeinberg also laid the blame for the Lantus problems at Viehbacher's feet. ""It was clear in the beginning of the year that we had an issue that needed to be fixed"", he said.""It appears that our sales force management on Lantus in the U.S. could have been better. I don't want to elaborate more on this but, clearly, we have not been as good as we should have in managing our sales force on this market.""Another issue that surfaced around the same time as the mature products review was Viehbacher's move from Paris to Boston, headquarters of Genzyme, and the heart of the biotech industry. At the time, a spokesman cited family reasons.Sanofi alternates with oil group Total (PA:TOTF) as France's biggest company by market value, and so the domicile abroad of its CEO made headlines, but only for a few days.On the phone to analysts last week, Weinberg appeared to have difficulty saying whether it was a problem or not:""So, of course, the (Boston move) decision was not an issue. We were informed. We didn't have a discussion on this, we understood the subject, but clearly, from a functional point of view, it has probably made things a little bit more difficult, although it is not a matter that has been counting in the decision that we took.""But Viehbacher's relationship with Weinberg was by now bad. ""There was a lot of growling,"" said a source close to the board.There remain plenty of unanswered questions, including why Weinberg thought he could hunt for a replacement for Viehbacher without fear he would find out, how the CEO's bombshell letter stayed secret for almost two months, to what extent performance or personality were the problem, and whether there are other as yet unrevealed issues in the background.For the moment, it looks like mismanagement all round.""They all knew there was disagreement, and yet the whole affair was allowed to reach the market with no plan B in place,"" said Philippe Soullier, head of management transition consultants Valtus.And the real test for Sanofi, shorn of its CEO of six years, now lies ahead.First of all, Weinberg needs to reassure the all-important executive committee - the team of top bosses that reported directly to Viehbacher. Nine out of 11 of them were appointed under Viehbacher. ""The team he put in place may well decide to leave,"" said Alain Gilbert, co-chairman of medical business strategy consultants Bionest.And Weinberg must also take the stand in Viehbacher's place on Nov. 20 to present the company's R&D day - ironically, being held at the Genzyme headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Viehbacher's new U.S. home.""The strategic direction of the company is now much more uncertain,"" said Hermes' Lode. ""Given the growth challenges faced by the company, especially in the diabetes area, it is now a much harder investment case.""(Additional reporting in Paris by Natalie Huet and Gwenaelle Barzic, and in London by Ben Hirschler and Simon Jessop; Writing by Andrew Callus; editing by Janet McBride)"

The Fed started buying bonds as far back as late 2008.Still, Fed officials have also stressed they are in no hurry to take policy tightening a step further by raising rates from near zero levels due to subdued inflation and the poor quality of a recovery in labor markets.Upbeat U.S. earnings so far have also eased worries that corporate profits might be squeezed by sluggish global growth. With 245 companies in the S&P 500 (SPX) having reported earnings so far for the third quarter, 73.5 percent have beat analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. Over the past four quarters, 67 percent of companies have beat estimates.The picture in Europe isn't quite so rosy. About a third of companies listed on the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX) benchmark index have reported results so far this earnings season, with 67 percent of them meeting or beating profit forecasts, and 59 percent meeting or beating revenue forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data.On Wednesday, Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) announced a third-quarter net loss, and French oil major Total (PA:TOTF) said net adjusted profit fell 2 percent.In other European corporate news, shares in French pharma group Sanofi (PA:SASY) slumped 5 percent after the company's board said it had decided to oust chief executive Chris Viehbacher.In currency trading, the dollar was down 0.2 percent against the Japanese yen at 107.90 yen <USD/JPY> and the euro was little changed at $1.2730 <EUR/USD>, close to Tuesday's one-week high of $1.2765.The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds was down a basis point at 2.275 percent (US10YT=RR), as was the German Bund yield at 0.87 percent <EU10YT=RR>.Italian government borrowing costs fell more steeply, prompting a similar move across peripheral euro zone bond markets, after the European Commission gave a tentative thumbs-up to Rome's 2015 budget.Italy, like France, has been campaigning for Brussels to afford it greater fiscal flexibility in order to nurture fragile economic growth, although their original budget proposals had to be tweaked.Ten-year Italian yields <Italy 10-Year Bond Yield> dropped 4 basis points to 2.51 percent. Spanish equivalents, which tend to trade in lock step with their southern neighbor, also dropped 4 basis points to 2.11 pct <ES10YT=TWEB>.(Additional reporting by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Susan Fenton; To read Reuters Global Investing Blog click on http://blogs.reuters.com/globalinvesting; for the MacroScope Blog click on http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope; for Hedge Fund Blog Hub click on http://blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub)"
389,"Oct 29, 2014 08:10AM ET",French drugmaker Sanofi sacks CEO Viehbacher,nan,"By Natalie Huet and Noëlle Mennella PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi's (PA:SASY) board ousted its chief executive of six years at a special meeting on Wednesday, two days after it emerged he had fallen out with the French drugmaker's chairman, wiping more billions off its market value.The management turmoil comes at a particularly awkward time for France's second-biggest listed company, after it warned on Tuesday that growth in its key diabetes business would likely stall next year.The board said on Wednesday Sanofi would continue the strategy of international expansion pursued under Chris Viehbacher, blaming his dismissal on his management style and poor relations with the board.But some analysts fear the company may become more insular.""Viehbacher tried hard to change the DNA of the company but the board won in the end. Sanofi will become more parochial now,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities in London.Shares in Sanofi were down more than 4 percent in morning trade. That takes their decline over the past three days to more than 15 percent, wiping almost 17 billion euros ($22 billion) from the company's market value -- or more than the entire market capitalization of French carmaker Renault (PA:RENA).Sanofi said Chairman Serge Weinberg would take on the CEO role until a replacement for the ousted German-Canadian Viehbacher was found. Weinberg said on a conference call there had already been contacts with potential candidates in the pharmaceutical industry and nationality would not be a factor.""We want to choose the best possible boss for Sanofi, so we'll take the time that's needed,"" Weinberg said, adding the board would strive to go ""as fast as possible"".UNANIMOUS DECISIONSanofi's first non-French boss, Viehbacher transformed a national champion into a global business, largely due to the $20 billion acquisition of U.S. biotech and rare diseases company Genzyme in 2011, which tipped the enlarged group's center of gravity away from Paris and towards Boston.But his straight-talking and sometimes brusque management style raised the hackles of trade unions, and a source close to the board told Reuters this week that it was unhappy at the lack of communication from an ""authoritarian, solitary, secret"" CEO.Viehbacher did not inform the board when he recently oversaw a review of what to do with an $8 billion portfolio of off-patent drugs in Europe, most of which are produced in France. The options studied leaked to the press and fired up tensions.Weinberg said the unanimous decision from the board's 15 members to remove Viehbacher stemmed mainly from his management style and poor cooperation. He also cited problems with Viehbacher's execution of group strategy, pointing to inventory problems in Brazil last year, a slowdown in sales in China and Tuesday's warning on its diabetes business.The fact Viehbacher moved to Boston in June did not help relations improve, but his change of residence was not the root of the dispute, one source close to the board said.Uncertainty over Viehbacher's role first surfaced on Monday with the publication of a Sept. 4 letter he sent to the board asking for clarity about his position.A source close to the matter said Wednesday's board meeting lasted only 30 minutes and was relaxed. ""Chris Viehbacher thanked everybody and said he respected the board's decision. He seemed prepared,"" the source said.French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is Sanofi's largest shareholder, with a stake of 9 percent. Officials at the company were not immediately available to comment.M&A?Some investors were disappointed Sanofi did not set out a plan on Tuesday to offset problems at its diabetes unit with cost cuts. However, Citi analyst Peter Verdult said scope for significant cuts were limited by the need to invest in the new drug pipeline. It is also difficult for Sanofi to cut its domestic cost base in France, due to strict French labor laws.One lever Sanofi could pull would be to make further acquisitions, according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.""Generally speaking, in the pharmaceutical sector, larger M&A deals tend to happen when companies are in difficult straits and this is where Sanofi seems to be at the moment,"" he said.Sanofi has stayed somewhat on the sidelines of a global tide of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over the past year.Weinberg ruled out mega-deals, saying these rarely created value, but said the group would keep looking at targeted acquisitions to strengthen its existing businesses.""It's not because we haven't acted lately on this front that we won't do so tomorrow, but we are not interested in big operations, in what we call mega-mergers,"" he said.(1 US dollar = 0.7853 euro)(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris; Editing by James Regan, Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)"

391,"Sep 01, 2014 10:00PM ET",Pricing is key for new heart drugs challenging cheap generics,nan,"By Ben Hirschler BARCELONA (Reuters) - Doctors looking at highly encouraging clinical trial results for new heart drugs at the world's largest cardiology meeting this week are missing one piece of data that will be critical to their success - the price.While new treatments on show in Barcelona are certainly moving cardiovascular medicine forward after a series of setbacks in recent years, cardiologists say that cost will be key in determining how widely they are used.""We are entering a new era of treatment and, of course, it will cost a lot of money, which is a problem,"" said Michel Bertrand, emeritus professor at the University of Lille and a past president of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).Hopes have spiked for a heart failure drug from Novartis and an innovative class of injectable anti-cholesterol agents known as PCSK9 inhibitors after the release of data at the ESC's annual meeting indicated that they can save more lives than standard therapies.The pharmaceuticals industry, however, faces a challenge because the new drugs are designed to replace or supplement a range of older medicines that have lost patent protection and are now widely available as bargain-basement generics.Novartis's new heart failure drug LCZ696, for example, was tested in a pivotal trial against enalapril, a generic drug in the so-called ACE inhibitor class, a month's supply of which can be bought at Wal-Mart stores for only $4.The Swiss company has yet to say what it will charge for LCZ696, but based on the cost of recently launched drugs such as Bayer and Johnson & Johnson's anticoagulant Xarelto, analysts expect between $7 and $8 a day - or about $225 a month - with a lower price in Europe.LARGE MARKETIt would be a big price for a big population - heart failure affects about 26 million people across the United States and Europe - and analysts have forecast peak annual sales of $5 billion-plus.Doctors, too, are keen that insurers and governments should see beyond the upfront cost to the long-term benefits.""Unfortunately, many insurance companies focus strictly on the cost of the pill,"" Elliott Antman, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and president of the American Heart Association, told Reuters.""But if we only look at the per-pill cost we have blinders on. We have to think about the impact on the health-delivery system overall - and if a more expensive new drug reduces symptoms to the extent that patients aren't hospitalized as much, then that has enormous economic impact.""That chimes with the message from Novartis pharmaceuticals head David Epstein, who argues that the cost of a generic ""is not the way to think about this product"".Still, with LCZ696 now in a position to replace an array of cheap medicines that have been the mainstay of heart failure treatment for more than 20 years, many cardiologists expect inevitable delays as healthcare providers haggle over access.""A lot of payers will probably initially deny this because of costs,"" said Alfred Bove, emeritus professor at Temple University. ""Normally it takes about two years for something like this to get ingrained into routine care.""COST-EFFECTIVENESS CHALLENGEWhile LCZ696 may involve wholesale switching of treatment, the emerging class of PCSK9 agents present a different cost-effectiveness challenge.They are designed to complement existing drugs, such as statins, and are likely to cost about twice as much as LCZ696 because they are complex biotech products that have to be injected, according to industry analysts.Sanofi, working with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is racing Amgen to bring the first PCSK9 drug to market in 2015, with Pfizer lagging slightly behind.Once again the data is looking good, but in this case cardiologists expect uptake to be much more targeted, initially focused on people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as high-risk and statin-intolerant patients.""I think doctors will be quite cautious and I would expect a very stratified approach,"" said the University of Edinburgh's Keith Fox, who chairs the ESC's congress program committee. ""I don't see these drugs going out in the same broad way as statins.""However, this high-risk group alone totals about 21 million in the United States and Europe, Sanofi estimates, pointing to a multibillion-dollar sales opportunity.For cardiologists, the expected launch next year of two important types of treatment is a breath of fresh air. Heart medicine has recently been eclipsed by advances in oncology, with U.S. regulators approving five new cancer drugs this year against only one for cardiovascular conditions.What is more, some heart drugs launched in recent years have not been used as widely as initially hoped, including AstraZeneca's Brilinta and Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Eliquis, a rival to Xarelto.These drugs, however, did not offer the innovative mechanisms used with LCZ696 or PCSK9, which Freek Verheugt, of the Rotterdam Thorax Center, says should make a difference when the success stories from Barcelona finally reach patients.""A brand new thing that saves lives should be adopted quickly,"" he said.(Editing by David Goodman)"

394,"Jul 16, 2014 07:50AM ET",Ex-GSK China staff seek compensation for illegal dismissal,nan,"By Li Hui and Adam Jourdan BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Three former Chinese employees of GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which is embroiled in a long-running corruption probe in China, are seeking compensation for illegal dismissal from their jobs, a lawyer representing them told Reuters. The plaintiffs are seeking two months' pay for each year of their employment from Britain's biggest drugmaker for dismissing them between April and May for expenses that were ""not compliant with company regulation,"" Shanghai-based Liu Feng said. They are also seeking reimbursement for unpaid expenses which they said were part of the bribe money they paid to doctors and hospital staff with approval from their managers, the lawyer added. Some sales staff were laid off with unpaid expenses worth more than 200,000 yuan ($32,200), according to Liu. The labor dispute arbitration committee in Shanghai's Huangpu district will hear the case on Thursday. A similar labor arbitration case filed by a former GSK salesperson was heard in the central province of Henan in May. That plaintiff, who did not want to be named, said by telephone that the decision would be issued soon. While any compensation GSK could end up paying will be relatively minor, it is another headache for the drugmaker and could further tarnish its reputation in the Chinese market. EXECUTIVES ARRESTED Chinese police in May charged Briton Mark Reilly, the former head of GSK in China, and two Chinese executives for allegedly orchestrating a widespread network of bribery to promote sales in the biggest corruption scandal to hit a foreign firm in China since 2009. Prosecutors are reviewing the case.  ""The workers think the company is very dishonest and its attitude abominable. They are very dissatisfied with the company's actions,"" Liu said in a telephone interview. In an email to Reuters, a GSK spokesman in China declined to comment on individual cases. But he said that a ""single digit"" number of Chinese ex-employees, who had been dismissed because of issues related to expenses, had brought cases against the firm through labor arbitration channels. ""We have zero tolerance to expense fraud, and where we have found potential issues, we have thoroughly reviewed them and taken disciplinary action including dismissal where appropriate,"" he said. He declined to comment further on the allegations from the ex-employees about GSK's conduct. Liu said about two dozen other former GSK staff had contacted him about filing similar cases, but they were waiting to see the outcome of the Shanghai case. ""My expenses were approved by my manager ... but they are saying it was a personal action not a company one,"" said one of the plaintiffs, speaking on condition of anonymity. The same plaintiff added that, during recent dismissals, GSK urged some China employees to resign and told them that if they did not, their contract would be terminated and the company would give them a bad reference reflecting problematic expenses. SMALL PROPORTION GSK has declined to specify the number of staff that were dismissed as result of a crackdown on illegal expenses, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that it was a very small proportion of the company's total workforce in China of around 7,000. GSK is facing the biggest corruption scandal to hit a foreign company in China since the Rio Tinto affair in 2009, which resulted in four executives, including an Australian, being jailed for between seven and 14 years. The allegations against GSK have damaged its reputation, thrown its China management team into turmoil and forced it to change its China business model, although the firm says head office had no knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing.  China is a key growth market for large drugmakers, which are counting on its swelling middle class to offset declining sales in Western countries. China is set to be the second biggest pharmaceuticals market behind the United States within three years, according to consultants IMS Health. But bribery between sales staff and doctors is believed to be rife in the world's second biggest economy, and it remains to be seen whether the GSK case will be a one-off or the first of a broader campaign to clean up the Chinese health sector. Other large international drugs manufacturers including Novo Nordisk A/S, AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG were also visited by Chinese officials in 2013 as part of a broad investigation into the business.

 (Adds further CEO comment, updates with closing shares) By Caroline Jacobs PARIS, April 28 (Reuters) - Growing generic competition
knocked first quarter earnings at Sanofi-Aventis, underscoring
the French drugmaker's need to swiftly integrate  U.S. biotech
Genzyme to help counter the threat. Like AstraZeneca, Sanofi's earnings on Thursday showed a hit
by generics to several of its top drugs, as well as a drop in
sales from swine flu vaccines. Sanofi expects its takeover of Genzyme, completed earlier
this month, to lessen its exposure to cheaper copycat drugs as
it adds treatment of rare diseases as a new growth area. Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said the integration of its
$20.1 billion purchase was going well and he was ""hopeful we can
maintain the people that made Genzyme so strong"". Decisions on Genzyme's integration, such as scrutiny of its
drug pipeline, would be announced before the summer, said
Viehbacher who spends one or two days a week at Genzyme's
headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Genzyme has 10 drugs in clinical trials, three of which are
in promising late stage trials. Genzyme's drugs would add to
Sanofi's pipeline of 64 products, including vaccines. Due to the integration of Genzyme, which has about 10,000
staff compared with 100,000 at Sanofi, Sanofi refrained from
giving an earnings outlook, saying it would update its forecast
at its first-half earnings in July. Throughout the year, however, Genzyme should add to Sanofi's
performance and finance director Jerome Contamine estimated it
to contribute 3 to 4 percent to Sanofi's business earnings per
share, which excludes items like amortisation and legal costs. Manufacturing issues involving two of Genzyme's main drugs
Cerezyme and Fabrazyme were improving daily, Viehbacher said, as
Genzyme solved shortages caused by a plant contamination. ""I have a lot of confidence that we will be able to get
manufacturing issues back on track pretty quick,"" he said. Deutsche Bank analysts called those comments ""reassuring"" in
a research note and rated Sanofi shares ""buy"".
  NEW GROWTH AREAS Sanofi shares closed little changed at 53.30 euros after
hitting a year high on Tuesday. Earnings just beat the average of a Reuters analyst poll and
showed that Sanofi's new growth areas, which represented 60
percent of its business in the quarter, could partly offset the
dent from generics and the absence of H1N1 flu vaccine sales. Business EPS, fell 10.8 percent to 1.66 euros in the first
quarter against the Reuters poll's average of 1.63 euros. Sales lost 1.5 percent to 7.779 billion euros ($11.4
billion) compared with consensus for 7.659 billion, as a
stronger-than-expected currency effect helped cushion the fall,
on business net income down 10.6 percent at 2.170 billion euros. Analysts are keenly awaiting Sanofi's seminar in September,
when the group will clarify its outlook for 2013 and beyond. ""We can (then) start to evaluate the impact of the deals
they have done. It will be interesting to see what Viehbacher's
revised vision is,"" said Michael Leacock, analyst at Royal Bank
of Scotland. Viehbacher set out to change Sanofi when he became CEO end 
2008 and steer it through the so-called patent-cliff years. Under his tenure Sanofi has struck plenty of partnerships to
replenish its pipeline with biotechnology-based drugs that are
much harder to copy, while Genzyme has been only one of many,
albeit much smaller, acquisitions.  Generics weighed on Sanofi's high-margin branded drugs such
as anti blood clotter Lovenox and cancer drug Taxotere. And as
with vaccine makers GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, H1N1 flu
vaccines no longer featured, pulling Sanofi's total vaccine
sales down 38.3 percent. Sanofi's so-called growth platforms, meant to diversify the
group's business and limit its exposure to generics, increased
sales at constant exchange rates by 4.3 percent with consumer
health products up 40 percent and animal health up 11.5 percent. Sanofi for the first time consolidated its Merial animal
health unit after its joint venture with Merck failed. Viehbacher said Merial's expansion would mainly be in
livestock and in emerging markets where growing middle classes
are buying pets. In addition, he saw possibilities for synergies
between animal health and Sanofi's pharmaceutical business, with
some diseases such as cancer and diabetes overlapping. As part of its business review, Sanofi wants to sell its
small dermatology line and Viehbacher said interest was strong. Separately, Genzyme's first-quarter sales rose 7 percent to
$1.009 billion, not consolidated in Sanofi's accounts.

407,"Apr 14, 2011 06:12PM ET","Deal in reach on flu virus-sharing, vaccine access",nan,"* Indonesia part of wide consensus but U.S. nod awaited
 * Drug industry said on board to share costs of helping poor  By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, April 14 (Reuters) - A global deal is tantalisingly
close under which countries would share flu virus samples in
exchange for access to affordable vaccines derived from them,
thus saving lives in a pandemic, senior diplomats said. Consensus has been reached across all regions, including
Indonesia which three years ago stopped sharing influenza
samples with the World Health Organisation (WHO), but the United
States has yet to give formal approval, they said on Thursday. The hope was to reach agreement by Friday on a political
deal to be presented for approval by health ministers at the
annual meeting of the U.N. agency scheduled for May 16-24. ""There is a package. Everybody is on board, including
Indonesia. The U.S. delegation is checking with Washington
overnight but the U.S. ambassador has recommended going along,""
one ambassador told Reuters late on Thursday. An envoy from a
major country in Asia called it a ""model"" agreement. A U.S. spokesman in Geneva said: ""Negotiations are still
ongoing."" He had no other details on the closed-door talks. Negotiations began four years ago between WHO's 193 members
after the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus emerged in southeast Asia.
A year later, Indonesia stopped sharing flu virus samples with
WHO's network of laboratories, demanding its share of vaccines. Ambassadors Juan Jose Gomez Camacho of Mexico and Bente
Angell-Hansen of Norway, who co-chair the talks, told reporters
on Tuesday that a deal was near but challenges remained,
including how to define the drug industry's role and to overcome
intellectual property issues.  They met top officials from 30 drug companies last week,
including GlaxoSmithkline, Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis to win
their support for providing affordable vaccines to developing
countries lacking local vaccine makers. The drug industry has now agreed to provide about one-half
of an estimated $58 million needed a year to help poor countries
through donations of vaccines and anti-virals as well as
financing to improve their laboratory capacity, according to
senior diplomats on Thursday evening. Industry executives have reported that current annual
production capacity for pandemic flu vaccine is 1.1 billion
doses, forecast to rise to 1.8 billion in four to five years.
This was up from 500 million doses during the H1N1 swine flu
pandemic of 2009-10, the first influenza pandemic in more than
40 years. During the pandemic, the WHO coordinated the distribution of
78 million doses of vaccines to 77 countries from Cuba to
Zimbabwe, but distribution was slow due to regulatory and other
hurdles. The doses were donated by rich nations and drug makers. The working group's draft document calls for having deals in
place ahead of the next pandemic, including pre-purchase
agreements with industry and governments to reserve a certain
percentage of production capacity, for example 10 percent,
earmarked for countries without access to vaccines. (Editing by Mark Heinrich)

408,"Apr 12, 2011 12:16AM ET",ANALYSIS-Indian pharma in tough battle for generic riches,nan," * $100 bln worth of drugs coming off patent in next 2 yrs * Indian companies face competition, lawsuits, stricter
regulator * Mylan lawsuit over Lipitor a sign of more to come * Indian firms' violations of manufacturing rules could
crimp FDA approvals * Indian pharma index down 9 pct this year
 By Bharghavi Nagaraju	 BANGALORE, April 12 (Reuters) - Indian makers of generic
drugs have a fight on their hands as they scramble for access to
the $100 billion worth of drugs coming off patent over the next
two years.	 Fierce competition and lawsuits from rival generic firms, a
stricter U.S. health regulator and compliance issues are some
hurdles Indian pharmaceutical firms face in their race to grab
the opportunity.	 In a sign of what lies ahead, U.S. generic drug firm Mylan
 last month sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
an effort  to block Ranbaxy Laboratories from
getting a six-month head start on marketing a generic version of
the world's largest-selling drug, Pfizer's Lipitor.
[ID:nN21120116]	 ""Though this litigation will turn on its own merits, a
number of others can be anticipated to follow given the sheer
size of the market that will be vacated by the erstwhile
patent-protected products as the patents expire,"" said Hitesh
Gajaria, executive director with KPMG.	 Some manufacturers from India and elsewhere have also run
afoul of U.S. regulators over manufacturing standards and
processes, potentially crimping their ability to win approvals.	 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries , for example, has
three sites under FDA investigation and has said it is working
on remedial measures for compliance.	 Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi said in February that
compliance issues meant Sun was likely to file for 20 to 22 drug
approvals in the year ended in March, down from its earlier
target of 30.	  ""The companies will have to tighten the norms and make sure
they are in compliance with all the norms all the time,"" said
analyst Ranjit Kapadia at HDFC Securities.	 ""It is a part of business but a major concern.""	 Another worry is the longer time taken for generic drug
approvals as the FDA deals with a backlog fuelled by competition
and becomes more stringent on quality,  analysts said.	 It now takes the FDA more than 30 months to approve a
generic drug -- where as a year ago it took 25 to 30 months --
which is likely to hurt the margins of drug makers, PINC
Research's Sushant Dalmia said.	
	 BIG OPPORTUNITY	 Indian drug firms, which account for about a third of U.S.
applications for approval to sell generics, could add $2 billion
to $2.5 billion in U.S. sales in the next five years, doubling
their revenue from the country, according to Morgan Stanley.	 But that opportunity will not be easily won and investor
sentiment is reflected in the decline in share prices.	 The Indian pharmaceutical index is down more than 9
percent this year, versus a near 6 percent fall in the broader
market .	 ""The broad pharma sector has not come up from a market
perspective because of the underlying fear of possible
litigations,"" said Rakesh Rawal, CEO of private wealth
management at Anand Rathi Financial Services.	  BLOCKBUSTERS UP FOR GRABS	 Drugs worth more than $140 billion are likely to go off
patent in the next five years, analysts said, and the right to
sell blockbusters such as Lipitor will be especially
contentious.	 In the next few years, Ranbaxy, Sun and Dr Reddy's 
will compete for a host of big-ticket drugs losing patent
protection, including Forest's Alzheimer's drug Namenda
and anti-depressant Lexapro, and blood clot drug Plavix, sold
jointly by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Sanofi-Aventis
 .	 Generics are poised to increase their market dominance in
the next few years in the United States, driven by the wave of
patent expirations, rising from 77 percent of prescriptions in
the first half of 2010 to as much as 85 percent by 2014,
according to a forecast by IMS Health Inc.	 Health insurers, pharmaceutical benefit managers and other
healthcare payers also push consumers to use generics to help
control spending after the U.S. government enacted a broad
healthcare reform law last year.	  ""The next two to three years is going to be good.
Lots of Indian companies are well-geared for exploiting this
market. Turnover will zoom, profits will zoom,"" said Ramesh
Swaminathan, Lupin's president for finance and
planning.	 ""However, there will be lots of lawsuits. It is going to be
extremely competitive,"" Ramesh said. ""The FDA will be a lot more
diligent.""	 At the end of December, Lupin had 137 applications filed
with the FDA, with 47 approvals won to date.	  LAWSUIT TROUBLE	 With so much at stake, rival generic drug makers such as 
Israel's Teva  and Mylan, as well as the
patent holding companies, are expected to leave no stone
unturned.	 In its lawsuit, Mylan contends that Ranbaxy, controlled by
Japan's Daiichi Sankyo , should be forced to forfeit its
exclusivity period to sell Lipitor because it violated the FDA's
application integrity policy. A victory for Mylan could cost
Ranbaxy $500 million to $600 million in revenue.	 In 2009, the FDA accused Ranbaxy of falsifying test results
and data in drug applications and halted reviews of products
from the firm's Paonta Sahib plant in northern India.	 The FDA has asked for a dismissal of Mylan's lawsuit,
according to media reports.	 Analysts expect Ranbaxy, whose shares have lost 23 percent
so far this year, to launch generic Lipitor in November, given
U.S. approval of its generic version of Pfizer's Alzheimer's
drug Aricept and its plans to move the manufacturing of generic
Lipitor to New Jersey from Paonta Sahib.	 While that may placate regulators, moving manufacturing to
the United States also undermines the cost advantage of
producing in India.	 ""There is plenty of opportunity for
generics,"" said Sujay Shetty, leader, India pharmaceutical and
life sciences at PricewaterhouseCoopers.	 ""But unfortunately competition is very fierce both from big
pharma and incumbent generics.""

409,"Apr 04, 2011 07:00AM ET","UPDATE 3-Sanofi wins control of Genzyme, CVRs fetch $2.35",nan," * Sanofi says 84.6 percent of Genzyme shares tendered * CVRs trading at $2.35 in early Nasdaq dealings * Sanofi to drop Aventis from name - CEO * French drugmaker's shares up 0.2 percent 
 (Updates with start of trading in CVRs, analyst comment) By James Regan and Ben Hirschler PARIS/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Certificates used by
Sanofi-Aventis SA to win Genzyme Corp started trading at a steep
discount to their best-case value on Monday after the French
drugmaker gained control of the biotech group. Taking over U.S.-based Genzyme gives Sanofi a new business
in treating rare diseases that is expected to boost earnings
from the first year after completion, offsetting lost revenue
from drugs facing generic competition. Investors holding 84.6 percent of Genzyme accepted Sanofi's
bid of $20.1 billion offer, or $74 a share, the French company
said in a statement. Shareholders are also receiving one so-called contingent
value right (CVR) per share entitling them to future payments if
specified milestones relating to several Genzyme drugs are met. The CVRs trade on the U.S. Nasdaq market under the ticker
 and, as expected, are selling for less than their potential
value. The CVRs started trading on Monday at $2.30 each and moved
up to $2.35 by 1355 GMT, against a maximum possible payout of
$14. A ""grey"" market had valued them at $2.23 on Friday. Mark Schoenebaum, an industry analyst at ISI Group, said he
believed the CVRs should be valued at around $2.30 to $2.60. Holders will only receive the full $14 per CVR -- worth some
$3.8 billion -- if Genzyme's experimental multiple sclerosis (MS)
drug Lemtrada is approved by regulators and meets its most
ambitious sales targets by 2020. The deep discount in the traded CVR price reflects the long
time-frame and the risks associated with Lemtrada, which is
already sold under the brand name Campath for cancer but has yet
to be approved in MS. Expected sales of Lemtrada was a key bone of contention
between the two companies during the takeover battle.  BRAKES ON OTHER DEALS Sanofi is to give remaining Genzyme shareholders a further
four days until Thursday to tender their shares. Sanofi Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher suggested the deal
would put the brakes on further big transactions for now. ""When you spend 20 billion, you lock in that strategy ... if
we do it, that means we don't do other things,"" he told BFM
Radio. ""Up until now, transactions of 1, 2 billion, well, that
doesn't prevent the group from being flexible, but 20 billion,
that stops us in fact from doing other transactions."" The CEO also said the purchase of Genzyme, which Sanofi will
make its rare diseases arm, marked a new phase for the company
and that it was time to simplify its name. ""Sanofi-Aventis is a very complicated name to say in several
languages, in China, as in the United States, and with the
acquisition of Genzyme, in the end we said, well, we have a
bigger family and now in the future we are the Sanofi family,""
he said. The integration process for the two companies was
""progressing well and remains on track"", Viehbacher added in the
statement.   Sanofi clinched its long-sought deal to buy Genzyme in
February when it sweetened its offer to include CVRs and more
cash. Genzyme's board unanimously recommended it. Genzyme investors can be paid $1 per CVR if Genzyme meets
specified production levels of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme this year
after the two key rare disease drugs were in short supply due to
contamination problems at a manufacturing plant. Another dollar will be paid if the U.S. health regulator,
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), clears Genzyme's
Lemtrada multiple sclerosis drug for marketing, which could come
in 2012 or 2013. Sanofi shares were down 0.1 percent at 50.22 euros.

410,"Mar 31, 2011 07:52AM ET",Sanofi loses bid to ditch U.S. suit on failed drug,nan," * Sanofi calls decision over Acomplia suit ""disappointing"" * Company and two ex executives still face legal action * Five former executives win dismissal of suit   By Caroline Jacobs  PARIS, March 31 (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis lost a bid to
dismiss a U.S. lawsuit launched by an investor for allegedly
withholding information on its flopped anti-obesity pill
Acomplia, which was once seen as a potential blockbuster. The French drugmaker said in a statement on Thursday it
would ""continue to defend its interests"" after a U.S. court
denied its motion to dismiss the suit against Sanofi itself as
well as former Chief Executive Gerard Le Fur and its head of
pharmaceutical operations Hanspeter Spek. U.S. District Judge George Daniels, in a decision handed
down on Wednesday, did agree to dismiss the complaint against
five other former Sanofi executives. Rimonabant, which was branded in Europe as Acomplia and in
the United States as Zimulti, never made it to the world's
biggest drug market and was withdrawn in Europe. Its failure led to the departure of Le Fur, who in his
previous role as research and development head had overseen the
drug's development. The investor, Carrie Smith, originally filed the lawsuit
seeking class action status in the U.S. District Court in
Manhattan in 2008.  FAILURE TO DISCLOSE  Smith alleged that she and other investors suffered damages
from Sanofi's failure to disclose key data that questioned the
drug's safety. While the case was dimissed in 2009, the court a year later
granted a motion by the plaintiffs to reconsider, reopening the
case. The suit's other defendants included former executives
Chairman Jean-Francois Dehecq, R&D head Marc Cluzel and Finance
Director Jean-Claude Leroy, U.S. Chief Medical Officer Douglas
Greene and Sanofi's current Chief Medical Officer Jean-Pierre
Lehner. Sanofi said it was pleased with Daniels' decision to dismiss
the suit against the five ex-executives but disappointed the
judge had kept it alive against the drugmaker and its former CEO
and head of pharmaceutical operations. ""Sanofi-Aventis believes its actions were appropriate and
will continue to defend its interests,"" it said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) questioned the
drug's safety in 2006 and had sought more information on its
efficacy and safety in tackling obesity after turning the drug
down as an anti-smoking treatment.  Concerns over possible risks of suicidal thoughts tied to
the drug led an independent panel of health experts in 2007 to
unanimously advise the health regulator to reject the drug for
marketing approval, prompting a steep drop in Sanofi shares. Sanofi then decided to withdraw its U.S. new drug
application for rimonabant. Under current Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi has
branched out to make it less dependent on pure pharmaceutical
business and include growth areas like consumer health, 
emerging markets and, most recently, rare disease through its
takeover of U.S. biotech group Genzyme.

 (Adds swine flu context, stock action) By Caroline Jacobs PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Leading vaccine supplier
Sanofi-Aventis raised its outlook for 2009 thanks to surging
sales of swine flu innoculations, the latest drugmaker to see a
boost to results from the pandemic. The French company posted third-quarter earnings per share
that beat forecasts as competition from generics was offset by
revenue growth for other drugs. Sanofi expected H1N1 vaccines to add about $500 million to
its sales in the fourth quarter, up from $78 million in the
recently ended quarter, as it begins to see results from its
first shipments into the U.S. market. It indicated sales would continue ""at a similar rate"" until
into the first quarter, the two periods when most vaccine
shipments are expected to take place. But while the French drugmaker has upward of a 40 percent
share in the market for seasonal flu vaccines, Sanofi ranks
behind some competitors in the market for swine flu preventions
and treatments. GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have both said they were in
line for a boos from H1N1 vaccine sales earlier this week. Sanofi on Friday predicted adjusted earnings per share
excluding items for the final quarter of this year would grow by
around 11 percent at constant exchange rates instead of around
10 percent beforeare.""We will see quite a big bonus of sales (in the fourth
quarter) of H1N1 and seasonal flu,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Chris
Viehbacher said at a conference call. Sales of seasonal flu
vaccines will take off in the fourth quarter this year. Shares of Sanofi were little changed in afternoon trading in
Paris, down 35 cents to 50.54 euros. EPS in the third quarter beat expectations, increasing 16.3
percent to 1.71 euros, in part thanks to continued cost cutting.
The average outcome of a Reuters poll among 15 analysts was for
EPS of 1.61 euros. Sales just missed consensus, up 8 percent at
7.4 billion rather than 7.44 billion. For now, it is unclear how the worldwide spread of H1N1 will
continue and last, but Viehbacher said that strain of flu could
be a factor until April. ""I would see us continue to sell more or less at the same
rate into 2010, at least up until late spring,"" he said. ""Beyond
that it is difficult to see if the pandemic will continue."" Sanofi is awaiting European Union regulatory approval for
two versions of its H1N1 flu vaccine, expecting clearance for
the Panenza vaccine in the next couple weeks and for the Humenza
adjuvented, or booster-type, vaccine by mid-December. Extra revenues from swine flu vaccines will only temporarily
help Sanofi's battle to overcome a loss of about a fifth of its
revenues in the next years due to patent expiries on blockbuster
drugs, making way for cheaper copies from generic drugmakers. Third-quarter sales growth, pulled by anti-thrombosis drug
Lovenox, insulin Lantus, as well as vaccines, was partly held
back by competition from generics to Sanofi's cancer drug
Eloxatin in the United States in August and blood thinner Plavix
in Europe. Eloxatin sales fell 44 percent. Sales of irregular heart beat drug Multaq, touted by Sanofi
and analysts as a blockbuster, were 13 million euros. The drug
has been available for eight weeks in the United States and is
awaiting EU marketing approval. So far prescriptions and
reactions to Multaq were ""very encouraging"", Sanofi said. ""Most (analyst) forecasts I've seen strike me as being
reasonable forecasts,"" Viehbacher said. ""I think you can
certainly say this will be a major product for the company."" Consensus estimates from analysts for Multaq peak sales
range from 1 billion to 1.5 billion euros. Analysts welcomed Sanofi's earnings performance, while the
EPS upgrade for the year had been expected. ""Solid growth that was driven by surprisingly strong sales
of Sanofi's key products Lantus and Lovenox, cost savings and
positive currency effects,"" DZ Bank analyst Thomas Maul said in
a research note, rating the shares ""buy"". ""In our view Sanofi-Aventis is reacting in an ideal manner
to the forthcoming ""years of patent expiries"" with the
efficiency-enhancing measures it has launched, the recent
acquisitions and its efforts to develop into a broadly-based
healthcare group."" As part of Sanofi's aim to diversify its business, it said
on Thursday it was expanding its over-the-counter-drugs, buying
French nutritional beauty supplements maker Oenobiol. Oenobiol
sales reached 57 million euros so far this year. No financial
details were disclosed. Net debt increased to more than 5 billion euros at the end
of September from 1.8 billion at the end of 2008 following a
string of acquisitions, such as generic drugmakers in Latin
America, biotech company Shantha and the buy-out of animal
healthcare company Merial.(Reporting by Caroline Jacobs; Editing by Lincoln Feast, John

2015 By Nopporn Wong-Anan SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Singapore's government plans
to attract pharmaceuticals makers and raise the number of drug
factories on the island by two thirds in the hope that a
broader product range will reduce the wild swings in industrial
output. The Economic Development Board, an investment promotion
body, plans to increase the number of jobs in the
pharmaceuticals industry by a quarter to 15,000 by 2015. Drugs
production unexpectedly drove a strong rebound in the country's
economy this year. ""We have 30 (plants) now and we are looking at 50,"" Beh
Kian Teik, director of biomedical sciences at the EDB told
Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Biomedical production and exports, which contributed 4
percent to Singapore's $179 billion gross domestic product in
2008, surged in the second and third quarters of this year. The industry's production cycles are subject to wild
swings, which economists say could distort the picture of the
economy. Factory output slipped last month as the biomedical
output boom faded. Beh said the volatility was caused by a small number of
manufacturers, which are at different stages of production from
clinical to full-scale commercial output, and often shut plants
for cleaning when changing between products. The government had identified the drugs industry in the
1990s as a way to diversify its economy away from electronics
manufacturing. Analysts said the EDB should give a timeframe for its plan.
""It will be good to know the timeframe as it will provide a
clearer picture on the speed of expansion of this industry.
This is important given its significant contribution to the
economy,"" said DBS economist Irvin Seah. Biomedical output has more than made up for Singapore's
weak electronic manufacturing this year to help push the
trade-dependent city out of its deepest-ever recession. Singapore has turned into one of Asia's fastest-growing
biomedical centres, with partnerships between research
institutes, corporate laboratories and public hospitals to
develop new medicines for Asian and global markets. More than 10 leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies have their Asian headquarters in Singapore, including
Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis and
Merck.

factors diluted the strong results, and investors fretted over
prospects for new blood thinner Brilinta, pushing shares in the
Anglo-Swedish drugmaker lower. AstraZeneca has been helped this year by the resilience of
the pharmaceutical sales and delays in cheap generic versions of
heart drug Toprol XL and cancer treatment Casodex -- though both
have now been launched in the United States. The sale of H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the U.S. government by
the group's MedImmune unit has been an added bonus, contributing
$152 million to sales in the third quarter -- a lot more than
the nominal $25 million or so many analysts had forecast. ""Overall, the business has performed more strongly on the
top line than we had anticipated and we haven't experienced
quite the extent of the headwind that we had anticipated at the
beginning of the year,"" said finance chief Simon Lowth. Long-term concerns remain, however, given the threat of
generic competition to AstraZeneca's top-selling medicines such
as heartburn drug Nexium, Seroquel for schizophrenia and,
further off, cholesterol drug Crestor. Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Baum said the outlook for the
company ""gets much tougher from here"". Lowth acknowledged one-offs had helped in the quarter but
said key drivers, including Crestor, were doing well. ""Even if we strip out a couple of the unanticipated upsides
... such as Toprol and H1N1 ... we've still maintained strong
growth of the business of 5 percent or so,"" he told reporters. AstraZeneca's core pretax profit rose 28 percent to $3.4
billion in the third quarter, equivalent to core earnings per
share (EPS) of $1.68, on sales up 5 percent at $8.2 billion. The mean consensus forecast had been for core earnings,
which exclude certain restructuring costs and charges, of $1.38
and sales of $7.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AstraZeneca now predicts full-year EPS of $6.20-6.40 versus
$5.70-6.00 previously forecast.  NOT SO BRILLIANT? AstraZeneca has seen an improvement in its pipeline
prospects this year -- but things are not going all its way. On Wednesday, it pulled regulatory submissions for its
experimental lung cancer drug Zactima and on Thursday investors
were unnerved by suggestions its key experimental heart drug
Brilinta did not work so well when patients also got a high dose
of aspirin. The firm also said it had reached an agreement in principle
with U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia to resolve an
investigation related to its schizophrenia drug Seroquel sales
and marketing practices. The settlement accounts for $520 million of the $538 million
provisions taken in the first nine months of the year, it said. Other major drugmakers in Europe and the United States have
also reported solid results this quarter, helped by an
industry-wide cost-cutting drive that has softened the impact of
generic competition to many products. Those companies with vaccine capacity also stand to book
exceptional profits from the sale of H1N1 swine flu vaccine in
the fourth quarter, as highlighted by GlaxoSmithKline on
Wednesday. Swine flu will also be a focus when Sanofi-Aventis, the
world's biggest flu vaccine manufacturer, wraps up the Big
Pharma reporting season on Friday. AstraZeneca is a relatively small player in the flu market
but it has a $453 million contract with the U.S. government to
supply around 40 million doses of a nasal spray form of H1N1
vaccine. Shares in AstraZeneca, which were off 1.4 percent by 1515
GMT, underperforming a 0.6 percent decline in the European drugs
sector, trade at around 7.7 times forecast 2010 earnings, a
discount to British-based rival Glaxo, reflecting concerns about
upcoming generic competition.

428,"Oct 29, 2009 02:45AM ET",UPDATE 3-Vaccine firms say on track to meet US H1N1 orders,nan," * U.S. has said not getting as much H1N1 vaccine as expected * Novartis sees 25-30 million doses available by end-Nov * AstraZeneca to ship 40 million doses to U.S. by early 2010 
 (Adds Astra, industry detail and shares) By Sam Cage and Ben Hirschler ZURICH/LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Drugmakers say they are on
track to deliver as much H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the United
States as they promised, despite concerns over production. The U.S. has contracted with its five suppliers of seasonal
influenza vaccine to also deliver H1N1 vaccine, but officials
have sharply cut initial estimates of how much will be delivered
this month and next. Many U.S. states and cities say they have received about a
tenth as much vaccine as they had expected by this time, but
Novartis AG and AstraZeneca Plc said they were on track to meet
their commitments. Most major vaccine producers have been struggling with low
H1N1 yields, leading to lower-than-expected shipments and a
scramble for supplies in some markets. In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses
would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20
million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250
million doses by the end of flu season in March or April. ""Not only did we complete our commitment to provide seasonal
vaccine ahead of schedule, we are making every effort to make as
much H1N1 vaccine available as quickly as possible,"" Novartis
vaccines chief Andrin Oswald said in a statement. GlaxoSmithKline Plc Chief Executive Andrew Witty said on
Wednesday his company had initially experienced problems, but
yields were now improving and he predicted the final yield would
be ""pretty good"" compared with historic flu strains. Glaxo is one of the world's largest manufacturers of flu
vaccines, along with Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis. It is not,
however, a big source of vaccine for the U.S., since it is still
awaiting approval for its unadjuvanted vaccine from U.S.
regulators. Sanofi has said it is on track to deliver more than 75
million doses to the United States.  LOW YIELDS Novartis said production was progressing despite low yields
of the initial seed virus. It will produce 90 million units of
bulk antigen, which is expected to result in 60 million finished
vaccine doses, due in part to overfills in the filling process.
 It has already shipped more than 7.5 million doses and
expects to reach 25 to 30 million by the end of November, in
line with commitments it made to U.S. authorities. To date, 42
million bulk units of vaccine have been produced and the full
run of 90 million is expected to be completed by December. As requested, Novartis is supplying the U.S. with
unadjuvanted vaccine, which does not contain an additive. But it
is has also started delivering its own adjuvant, which could be
used with the vaccine to double the number of doses produced. AstraZeneca's Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth said it
had already delivered 10 million doses of H1N1 vaccine to the
U.S. and was on track for a total of 40 million by early 2010. Unlike other vaccine firms, AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit
supplies flu vaccine as a nasal spray rather than injection and
uses a different system to make the vaccine. It has not had problems with vaccine yields but is
constrained by the number of spraying devices that can be
manufactured.  MedImmune, which could produce about 200 million doses of
its needle-free vaccine in bulk, is now talking to regulators
about perfecting a dropper device to drip vaccines into the nose
-- technology that has been used with other vaccines. In early afternoon trade Novartis shares were down 0.37
percent, Sanofi-Aventis down 1.73 percent, Glaxo down 0.72
percent, and Astrazeneca down 1.76 percent.

429,"Oct 28, 2009 12:42PM ET",ANALYSIS-US government faces no-win fight with flu,nan," * US struggles to balance demand for vaccine * Inexact vaccine science clashes with need to plan * Cynical public questions every move By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - First came the jibes about
the U.S. government rushing out an untested swine flu vaccine.
Now, critics say it is not fast enough. ""The premise that 'you can't win' is part of the equation,""
said Dr. D.A. Henderson, who advised the administration of
former president George W. Bush on pandemic preparedness. It is a lesson playing out in real time by U.S. government
health officials as the H1N1 pandemic turns from a scientific
and logistical battle to a political one. Plans have been in the works for handling a flu pandemic
since 2003, when H5N1 avian influenza re-emerged in Asia.
Health officials held roundtables and ran tabletop exercises,
with journalists, bloggers and activists. They knew it would take time to make a vaccine against a
new flu strain and handle the delicate balance between
communicating the need for the vaccine without sparking anxiety
if manufacturers were unable to deliver it on time. Now that the H1N1 flu pandemic has arrived, health
officials are facing the inevitable, Henderson, who helped lead
the vaccination effort that eliminated smallpox in 1979, said
in an e-mail. ""If one anticipates a potential disaster and is successful
in having enough done to head it off, there is criticism of the
energy and money expended for something that didn't happen. The
converse is obvious."" QUESTIONING NEED AND SAFETY For the most part, public health experts have praised the
administration of President Barack Obama for how it has dealt
with H1N1. Companies formulated a vaccine in a record five
months. Antivirals and other supplies from the Strategic
National Stockpile were pushed out. The National Institutes of Health is conducting research on
new antivirals and how best to slow the spread of flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has briefed
the media frequently, and the agency is using new media such as
pages on Facebook, updates on Twitter and videos on YouTube. But now Health and Human Services is under fire for having
miscalculated how much vaccine would become available and when.
Officials said 40 million doses of vaccine would be available
by the end of October, with 20 million a week rolling out after
that. As of Tuesday, 22.4 million were ready. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius began making appearances in
which she promised that every American who wanted a vaccine
would get one and said 250 million doses were on order. ""The one thing they have to stop saying is there is a dose
for everybody,"" said Mike Osterholm, a former Minnesota public
health official and expert on pandemic preparedness at the
University of Minnesota.""The virus has been in a race with the vaccine and the virus
is winning. It doesn't matter if there is a dose for everybody
if it doesn't get to them before they become ill."" MILLIONS INFECTED CDC has stopped trying to count how many people have caught
swine flu, saying only that it is millions. Officially, 1,000
U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April. Members of Congress have begun to question the vaccine
numbers. Republican Senator Susan Collins took Sebelius to task
on Monday for having released estimates too soon, then herself
demanded a new timetable of estimates. Dr. Bruce Gellin, head of HHS's National Vaccine Program
Office, defended the decision to give numbers as they became
available and change them as necessary. ""I think that all along was the pledge to be as transparent
as we could at the time,"" Gellin said in a telephone
interview. States would have been overwhelmed if they had been told
they would only get a few vaccines and then millions were
dumped on them, he said. The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of
H1N1 swine flu vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit
of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Australia's CSL,
GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. Except for MedImmune, all had problems making vaccine at
first and are still struggling to make the virus grow in eggs,
the first step to manufacturing influenza vaccine. MedImmune has prolific production -- officials say the
company can make 200 million doses of its nasal spray vaccine
-- but only had 40 million sprayers to deliver it. The company
is working with the federal government to perfect a device to
drip the vaccine into the nose. ""How did we do with this one? From my vantage point, we
could have done far better had due attention been paid to
history,"" said Henderson, a veteran of the last two flu
pandemics in 1957 and 1968.

* Shares down 1 percent in London market down 1.8 percent 
 (Adds CEO comments, analyst reaction, latest shares, details) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Sharply higher sales of flu drug
Relenza buoyed GlaxoSmithKline's quarterly sales, and the
British group said it was in line for a booster from its swine
flu vaccine in the last three months of the year. Third-quarter earnings per share growth of 13 percent,
flattered by a weak pound, was just shy of expectations, while
group revenue rose 15 percent, helped by recent diversification,
the world's second-biggest drugmaker said on Wednesday.  Glaxo has lost plenty of business this year to cheap
generics, as patents on its older medicines expire, resulting in
a 12 percent fall in U.S. sales in the period. But windfall sales of drugs and vaccines due to H1N1 are
softening the blow. As with many of its rivals, 2009 is turning out better than
initially feared, and Chief Executive Andrew Witty said he
expected further growth in the fourth quarter of the year,
""including significant sales of influenza products"". Glaxo said previously it had taken orders for 440 million
doses of its H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix, and analysts say it could
book around 1 billion pounds ($1.64 billion) of this business in
the fourth quarter as immunisation campaigns get underway. Witty told reporters that market expectations for sales of
the vaccine were ""pretty close to being right"", adding Glaxo had
booked further orders and still had capacity for more. European drugmakers Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis and
AstraZeneca are set to win the bulk of the business for mass
swine flu vaccination programmes launched by governments around
the world. Glaxo also gains from having the inhaled flu drug Relenza,
which registered sales of 182 million pounds in the third
quarter, against just 12 million pounds a year earlier. Roche has seen a similar sharp jump in sales of its rival
flu drug Tamiflu. Glaxo's pretax profit totalled 2.07 billion pounds in the
third quarter, equivalent to earnings per share before major
restructuring of 28.5 pence, on sales of 6.76 billion. The mean consensus forecast had been for earnings of 28.7p
and sales of 6.81 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said the results were
broadly in line, helped substantially by currencies. ""GSK has a decent revenue and EPS profile through 2015, but
its valuation seems to reflect this already,"" he added, as
shares in the group traded 1 percent lower in a London market
down 1.8 percent at 1400 GMT.  MOVING ON FROM ""WHITE PILLS"" While H1N1 may be a one-off, Witty said his strategy of
diversifying away from reliance on ""white pills in Western
markets"" would mean more predictable long-term growth, as
emerging market and consumer products sales increase. Less than 30 percent of third-quarter sales were generated
from traditional pharmaceuticals and markets, compared with 38
percent last year. ""What we've begun to show very clearly in these results is
the change in dynamics in our business and particularly the good
progress we are making towards diversifying our portfolio,"" he
said. Witty added he would continue to look actively for bolt-on
acquisitions, but only if the price was right. He has eschewed
large-scale acquisitions of the kind pursued this year by Pfizer
 and Merck & Co. Progress on the research front included encouraging results
with experimental heart drug darapladib, which Witty said was
now six months ahead of schedule in late-stage clinical trials. Glaxo trades at about 10.4 times forecast 2010 earnings, a
premium to AstraZeneca and Sanofi, which report on Thursday and
Friday respectively, but a discount to Swiss rivals Roche and
Novartis.

2015 By Nopporn Wong-Anan SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Singapore's government plans
to attract pharmaceuticals makers and raise the number of drug
factories on the island by two thirds in the hope that a
broader product range will reduce the wild swings in industrial
output. The Economic Development Board, the trade promotion body,
plans to increase the number of jobs in the pharmaceuticals
industry by a quarter to 15,000 by 2015. Drugs production
unexpectedly drove a strong rebound in the country's economy
this year. ""We have 30 (plants) now and we are looking at 50,"" Beh
Kian Teik, director of biomedical sciences at the EDB told
Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Biomedical production and exports, which contributed 4
percent to Singapore's $179 billion gross domestic product in
2008, surged in the second and third quarters of this year. The industry's production cycles are subject to wild
swings, which economists say could distort the picture of the
economy. Factory output slipped last month as the biomedical
output boom faded. Beh said the volatility was caused by a small number of
manufacturers, which are at different stages of production from
clinical to full-scale commercial output, and often shut plants
for cleaning when changing between products. The government had identified the drugs industry in the
1990s as a way to diversify its economy away from electronics
manufacturing. Analysts said the EDB should give a timeframe for its plan.
""It will be good to know the timeframe as it will provide a
clearer picture on the speed of expansion of this industry.
This is important given its significant contribution to the
economy,"" said DBS economist Irvin Seah. Biomedical output has more than made up for Singapore's
weak electronic manufacturing this year to help push the
trade-dependent city out of its deepest-ever recession. Singapore has turned into one of Asia's fastest-growing
biomedical centres, with partnerships between research
institutes, corporate laboratories and public hospitals to
develop new medicines for Asian and global markets. More than 10 leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies have their Asian headquarters in Singapore, including
Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis and
Merck.

 (Adds analyst comment, shares, H1N1 detail) By Sam Cage ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis said
sales would grow faster than expected this year, even without a
shot in the arm of up to $700 million from its H1N1 swine flu
pandemic vaccine. Third-quarter net profit at Novartis, which joined other
major drugmakers in reporting strong trading conditions, nudged
up 1 percent to $2.1 billion, in line with forecasts, the firm
said on Thursday. ""A surprisingly strong set of operating figures,"" said DZ
Bank analyst Thomas Maul. ""Management guidance, especially the
outlook for the pharmaceuticals division, is amazingly bullish."" Novartis shares rose 0.5 percent to 52.75 Swiss francs by
0736 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European
healthcare sector. This year is turning out to be better than initially feared
for Novartis and other major pharmaceutical companies, thanks to
hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1
outbreak, though long-term problems like increasing competition
from makers of generic drugs have not gone away. Both Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, and Eli Lilly
topped earnings forecasts this week and investors will look to
U.S. rivals Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both due to
report later on Thursday, for more clues on the health of the
sector. Novartis, which faces loss of exclusivity on its top-selling
blood pressure drug Diovan in 2012, was hit by one-off charges
of $189 million from rival Roche's acquisition of Genentech and
discontinuing of a drug by Alcon. It has a 33 percent stake in Roche and holds 25 percent of
eye care company Alcon. It made no comment on an agreement with
Nestle to acquire a majority of Alcon. The world's biggest food group, which on Thursday reported
nine-month sales that met forecasts and kept its 2009 outlook
unchanged, also gave no comment on Alcon in its trading
statement.  SWINE FLU BOOSTER Swine flu is set to provide a significant boost to European
drugmakers this year and in the early part of 2010, though the
one-off nature of these sales means investors may not set too
much store on the resulting profit boost. Roche reported a sharp jump in sales of its Tamiflu drug for
flu last week and analysts expect GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza will
also see strong sales in the third quarter. On the vaccine front, Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis and AstraZeneca
 are all expected to highlight an expected jump in
fourth-quarter sales due to swine flu when they unveil results
next week. Novartis now expects group sales to grow at a high
single-digit rate, even excluding H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine
sales, and sees drugs sales growth at a double-digit rate.  It had previously expected group sales to grow at a
mid-single-digit rate in 2009 and drug sales to rise at a
minimum high-single-digit rate, both in local currencies. It added currency-related losses could significantly reduce
growth this year. The H1N1 flu vaccine is expected to contribute about
$400-700 million of sales in the fourth quarter. Novartis trades at about 13 times forecast 2010 earnings, a
premium to some of Europe's other big drugmakers like
AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Sanofi but a discount to Swiss rival
Roche, which has less exposure to generic competition. It had been expected to post third-quarter net profit of
$2.1 billion, according to a Reuters poll.(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London; editing by

Monday, as Dutch giant Philips  helped reinforce
investor confidence in the third-quarter earnings season, still
in its early stages. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
rose 0.7 percent to 1,005.37 points, the highest close since
Sept. 23. The European benchmark index is up 56 percent from its
lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more confident
on the prospects of economic recovery.   Philips surged 7.7 percent after posting better than
expected third-quarter results, as the world's biggest lighting

benefited from cost-cutting measures. [ID:nLC210070] ""The results of companies like Phillips are important, and

with Siemens  and Nokia  up 2.6 percent and

reported it was planning to spin off a 4-billion-pound portfolio
of complex credit assets in a bid to further clean up its
balance sheet. Oil companies gained ground as crude oil futures  rose
2.5 percent to more than $73 a barrel. Total , BP  and Royal Dutch Shell 
rose 1.3-1.8 percent. Among other individual shares, Vodafone  rose 1.6
percent, rebounding after falls last week helped by reassuring
comments from Deutsche Bank which repeated its 'buy' rating on
the mobile telecoms heavyweight. Dutch brewer Heineken  fell 3.3  percent after UBS
downgraded it to 'neutral' from 'buy'.

trade on Tuesday, adding to gains in the previous session as
further evidence of global economic recovery boosted demand for
riskier assets like equities. U.S. data on Monday showed its services sector expanded for
the first time since 2008, while an interest rate rise by
Australia's central bank signalled some policymakers were
confident the recovery was gathering pace. By 0806 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.8 percent at
979.06 points, after closing 0.8 percent higher on Monday. The index, which posted its best quarterly performance in
nearly 10 years in the three months to the end of September, had
started the fourth quarter on shaky ground after soft data shook
confidence. But the U.S. services data once again led investors to
believe a significant recovery was coming through. Banks, typically strong beneficiaries of recovering risk
appetite, were among the strongest performers. Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas and Deutsche
Bank added 1 percent to 2.4 percent.  But Societe Generale fell 0.7 percent after unveiling a 4.8
billion euro ($7.0 billion) capital hike to repay state support
and pursue acquisitions, following domestic peer BNP Paribas in
paying off aid received during crisis. ""U.S. equities gained about half a percent more after Europe
closed (on Monday) ... and shares came off so much on Thursday

hunting,"" said Josh Raymond, market strategist at City Index. Insurers were also supported by increasing optimism on the
outlook for the global economy. Aegon, ING Groep, Legal &
General and Prudential rose up to 3 percent.  MINERS, ENERGY GAIN Miners were firmer as a weaker dollar helped to boost metal
prices. The U.S. unit was pressured by a British newspaper
report that Gulf Arab states were in secret talks to end the use
of dollars in oil trading. A Saudi offical said the report was ""absolutely incorrect"",
while Russia's deputy finance minister, Dmitry Pankin, said the
dollar had not been discussed. Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Lonmin, Anglo American, Kazakhmys and
Fresnillo gained 2.2-4.7 percent. Energy stocks were lifted as crude rose towards $71 per

and ENI added 0.1-1.6 percent. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC were up 0.4-0.6 percent. Tesco, the world's third largest retailer, fell 1
percent after posting slightly weaker than expected
second-quarter sales, offsetting first-half profit towards the
top end of forecasts. Defensive pharmaceutical stocks were among the main drags on
the index, as investors repositioned towards more cyclical
stocks. AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis
fell 0.3-1.2 percent. Shire was among the top fallers, shedding 2.3 percent after
UBS cut its rating for the drugmaker to 'neutral' from 'buy',
citing valuation grounds. Other stocks seen as relatively defensive plays like

by merger activity between Telenor and Alfa Group. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed up
0.8 percent at 971.21 points, after falling for three sessions
in a row.  The index, which slumped 45 percent last year, is up 17

after non-farm payrolls data contributed to a 1.9 percent fall
on Friday. The U.S. service sector expanded in September at a faster
pace than expected, with the Institute for Supply Management's
services index coming in at 50.9, compared to a forecast of 50. Markit's Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index of
around 2,000 companies showed the euro zone's services economy
returned to growth for the first time in 16 months in September
at a slightly better rate than first expected, but job losses
grew. Banks, which are sensitive to changes in risk appetite,
gained. Barclays, HSBC, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank added

fragile and third-quarter results from the U.S. companies, which

prices and said sovereign wealth funds might take an interest in
the sector. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,

key partner in Russia, the Alfa Group, agreed to merge their
Russian and Ukrainian holdings into a New York-listed mobile
operator worth over $23 billion. The news helped the telecom sector, with TeliaSonera,
Mobistar, Vodafone, Telefonica adding 0.9-3.5 percent. Drugmakers shrugged off early weakness, with AstraZeneca up
0.8 percent, boosted as a new diabetes drug has been approved
for sale in Europe. Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and Shire added 0.2-2 percent. ArcelorMittal rose 1.1 percent after its chairman and main
owner, Lakshmi Mittal, told The Financial Times newspaper it was
close to pulling out of a $20 billion plan to build two steel
plants in India due to difficulties buying land. Energy stocks were among a limited number of stocks in
negative territory, pressures as crude fell below $69 per

buying equities following Friday's worse-than-expected U.S. jobs
report and ahead of the new U.S. corporate earnings season,
which begins this week with aluminium giant Alcoa. With second-quarter earnings primarily boosted by
cost-cutting, investors want to see if the latest quarterly

companies and said that as the recovery process got underway,
mining assets could fall under the radar of China as the country

 (Adds closing share price) By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Dendreon Corp  plans
in November to seek U.S. approval for its high-profile Provenge
prostate cancer vaccine and expects U.S. regulators to act on
the application by mid-2010, the company said on Thursday. Dendreon will be able to make enough Provenge to generate
potential sales of $60 million to $125 million in the second
half of next year, according to manufacturing details provided
by the drugmaker at a two-hour meeting with industry analysts. The company said it will steadily ramp up production until
full capacity is achieved by late 2011 at plants in New Jersey,
Atlanta and Los Angeles, together able to support potential
annual sales of $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion. ""The launch could be slow at first due to supply
constraints, with demand outweighing supply in the first six
months,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas. But peak
annual U.S. sales of the drug may eventually top $1.8 billion,
she added. Shares of Dendreon, which have soared 10-fold since March,
closed down 4.85 percent, amid an almost 1 percent decline for
the Nasdaq Biotech Index . Some investors may have been disappointed with the 2010
sales prospects and that Dendreon did not announce an overseas
marketing partner at the meeting, Karnauskas said. The company
plans to sell Provenge by itself in the United States. Provenge would be the first approved ""therapeutic"" cancer
vaccine. While conventional vaccines prevent diseases, Provenge
treats the condition, which is diagnosed in one of every six
American men and is the second-leading cause of death among
men. ""We'll roll this product out in step-wise fashion,""
Dendreon Chief Executive Mitchell Gold said in an interview. He
declined to provide sales estimates for any period, but cited
high hopes for Provenge. ""A whole new era of medicine is about to emerge,"" he said,
with a drug that harnesses the patient's immune system to find
cancer cells and destroy them. The Seattle biotechnology company previously said it would
submit an application for Provenge in the fourth quarter. While many drugmakers are dramatically cutting jobs,
Dendreon said it would more than double its current workforce
of 290 by the time of its anticipated Provenge launch. Excitement has been high over Provenge since the release of
data in April that showed it prolonged lives of patients about
four months. That compares to a two-to-three month survival
benefit in separate studies for Sanofi-Aventis' 
Taxotere, the current standard of care. Dendreon noted on Thursday that Taxotere, a chemotherapy,
can cause harsh side effects that were not seen with Provenge
-- potentially a big selling point as well as an advantage to
patients. Dendreon said its New Jersey manufacturing plant would be
at 25 percent capacity next year and up to full capacity in the
first half of 2011 with a capability of producing enough
Provenge to generate $500 million to $1 billion in annual
sales. That would be supplemented by manufacturing at sites in
Atlanta and Los Angeles, each capable of producing $375 million
to $750 million of Provenge annually. Dendreon said it plans next year to test a therapeutic
vaccine called Neuvenge against bladder cancer. It aims to put
one new drug into human clinical trials per year. Shares of Dendreon fell $1.37 at $26.90 on Nasdaq.

its H1N1 vaccine that targets the swine flu virus to boost to
its revenues this year and next, the head of the French
drugmaker told Reuters in an interview. ""There's going to be a significant revenue opportunity, both
this year and next year,"" Chris Viehbacher said on Thursday.
""It's a nice short-term boost for sales and cash flow."" Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine division of Sanofi-Aventis,
earlier this month won an additional order from the U.S. health
department for its H1N1 vaccines, taking the total to 75.3
million doses. Sanofi-Aventis expects to submit its H1N1 vaccine with the
European Medicines Agency (EMEA) by the end of October and
Viehbacher expected approval to take up to six weeks. Viehbacher, who took the helm in December 2008, said the
company had no plans to alter it strategy of making acquisitions
of up to 15 billion euros ($22.09 billion) in market value while
preferring to avoid big takeveovers. ""I'm not going to change a strategy that has been
successful,"" he said. ""I still remain skeptical about big mergers,"" he added. Sanofi has several blockbuster drugs such as blood-thinner
Plavix and cancer treatment Taxotere. Sanofi has a market capitalisation of some $100 billion,
which makes it sixth in the world after Johnson & Johnson
, Roche , Novartis , Pfizer  and
GlaxoSmithKline  -- the former employer of Viehbacher.  AIDS VACCINE Viehbacher was speaking ahead of an expert presentation on a
the clinical results of an experimental AIDS vaccine, made from
two older versions, which showed made major progress in finding
an effective way to combat the illness. [ID:nLO53122] Sanofi's pipeline of drugs in development has become leaner
following a rejig that left it with only the most promising
candidates after Viehbacher put a halt to others. Partnerships should help expand the pipeline again with a
focus on the United States, the world's biggest drugmarket. ""I think we are underrepresented in research in the U.S.""
Viehbacher said. ""Today you want to be able to capture the best
science everywhere. I'd certainly like to strengthen our
presence there,"" he said, adding ""nothing major is cooking"". Sanofi earlier this year bought U.S. biotech company BiPar
whose candidate drug BSI-201 which seeks to treat cancers
including breast and ovarian, is seen as a potential
blockbuster. Rather than cost savings, Sanofi's takeover strategy focuses
on boosting its revenues as the company is facing a number of
patent expiries on several of its top-selling drugs, making it
vulnerable to cheaper copies made by generic drugmakers.  NO MEGA MERGER Instead of mega-mergers and a focus solely on finding the
next multi-billion euro blockbuster drug, Sanofi seeks to grow
its business by expanding its existing platforms, like vaccines,
generics and over-the-counter drugs, which can be bought without
a prescription. It is aiming to turn its OTC business, which includes
Sanofi's best-selling drug in France Doliprane paracetamol, into
a division with a head of its own who should be able to double
sales in next five years from 1.3 billion euros in 2008. ""We are in the process of trying to nominate someone,""
Viehbacher said. In a first move to expand its widespread OTC business,
Sanofi last year bought Australia's Symbion, which also makes
vitamin supplements. Sanofi shares were down 1.47 percent at 50.11 euros at 1430
GMT, after a 12 percent rise sofar this year.  For fundamental data about this company, please double click

dominate the U.S. cervical cancer vaccine market despite the
expected launch of a competitor from GlaxoSmithKline, Merck &
Co's chief executive said on Thursday. ""With the profile of the vaccine and the head start we have,
it should be an advantage for us,"" Richard Clark told Reuters
during a visit to London. ""We are very comfortable with Gardasil's profile. In the
parts of the world where physicians have the choice between two
HPV vaccines, in a substantial majority of cases Gardasil is
chosen. The market share in Europe for Gardasil is around 78
percent."" Clark said he hoped Merck's head start in the United States
would keep it even further ahead there when Glaxo's Cervarix
reaches the market. Glaxo won a U.S. panel's support for its vaccine on Sept. 9,
following a series of delays. The Food and Drug Administration
usually follows panel recommendations and Glaxo said a final
decision on Cervarix may come as early as this month. Both Gardasil, which won FDA approval in 2006, and Cervarix
protect against infection with the sexually transmitted human
papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer and genital
warts. Global sales of Gardasil were $1.4 billion in 2008, with an
additional $865 million received through the Sanofi-Pasteur MSD
joint venture partnership with Sanofi-Aventis. But growth has
slowed recently in markets where the initial group of eligible
teenage girls has now been immunised. Clark, however, said he saw room for additional sales if, as
hoped, the vaccine is approved for older women and males. ""There is still a tremendous opportunity for HPV, for
Gardasil, not only in the United States but on a global basis,""
he said.

446,"Sep 16, 2009 08:03AM ET",Banks aim for sale of Ratiopharm as whole -sources,nan," FRANKFURT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Banks controlling the sale of
Ratiopharm plan to put the German generic drugmaker on offer as
a whole, two people familiar with the sale process told Reuters
on Wednesday, rejecting a report that a break-up was imminent. The lenders, keen to use proceeds from the sale to recoup
some of the debt owed by Ratiopharm's founding Merckle family,
expect to fetch more for the entire group than if parts are sold
separately, one source familiar with their thinking said. A sale in separate parts cannot be ruled out entirely but
the option is seen as intricate because the target would have to
be divided up without overlap or leftovers, the sources said. An initial public offering (IPO) could also be an option,
but it is unlikely because the procedure is much more costly
than a sale, one source said. Ratiopharm declined to comment. The world's fourth-largest generics supplier is part of the
heavily indebted empire built up by German billionaire Adolf
Merckle, who killed himself in January after being forced to
cede control of his conglomerate to lenders after huge trading
losses. His oldest son, Ludwig Merckle, inherited the main holdings,
which include a majority stake in cement maker HeidelbergCement
 and drug wholesaler Phoenix. HeidelbergCement this week unveiled plans to raise its
capital by half, also saying that Merckle would sell most of his
shares in the building materials company. On Wednesday, German business daily Handelsblatt cited
industry sources as saying a sale of Ratiopharm in separate
slices was now the most likely option. The group's Canadian business could be split off and
Novartis' generics subsidiary Sandoz was seen as a likely bidder
for that asset, the newspaper said, citing sources. Teva, Sanofi-Aventis and Mylan are tipped as potential
suitors for Ratiopharm. Up to 15 suitors will receive the first documents on the
sale in the next few weeks, sources told Reuters. The procedure is managed by Commerzbank and Royal Bank of
Scotland.(Reporting by Frank Siebelt and Philipp Halstrick, writing by

trade on Wednesday, with the main FTSEurofirst 300 index hitting
the 1,000 mark for the first time since October 2008, boosted by
stronger banking and commodity stocks on global recovery hopes. By 0845 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.9 percent at 1,001.43 points, rising for the
eighth sesssion out of nine. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares, which is
up 20 percent so far in 2009, is still down 14 percent from its
level in mid-September 2008 before the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers. ""Another day in this brilliant bull market. The news around
the world has been pretty good again in the last 24 hours ...
with comments from (Bank of Englang Governor Mervyn) King and
(U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben) Bernanke that the recession
had finished,"" said Jim Wood Smith, head of research at Williams
de Broe. ""Although the EU story that Lloyds maybe be forced to sell
Halifax is probably bad for Lloyds as it would limit integration
and cost cutting scope, the market has probably been expecting
it ... it has already been priced in,"" he said. The European Commission may force Lloyds Banking Group to
sell all or part of its key Halifax subsidiary in compensation
for the billions of pounds of state aid the group has received,
the London Times reported. Lloyds shares gained 2.5 percent. The banking sector added the most points to the index, with
HSBC, Barclays and UBS up 1.4 to 2 percent. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 1.1 percent,
Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent and France's CAC 40 was 1.1
percent higher.  COMMODITIES GAIN Energy stocks were higher as crude steadied at $70 a barrel.
Tullow Oil gained 4.3 percent after the Financial Times reported
that the company and U.S. producer Anadarko Petroleum were set
to announce they have established a new oil frontier stretching
1,100 km along the African coast. BG Group, Repsol and Royal Dutch Shell were up 0.4 to 1.3
percent. Miners rose tracking firmer metal prices. Copper gained 0.5
percent, aluminium was up 1 percent and nickel was 0.8 percent
higher. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Eurasian Natural
Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto and Xstrata were 2.4 to 3.6
percent higher. Drugmakers took the most points off the index as investors
decided to switch out of defensives. Roche, Sanofi-Aventis and
AstraZeneca were down 0.3 to 0.5 percent. Aerospace and defensive stocks were also out of favour.
Zodiac Aerospace fell 6.1 percent after the French aerospace
supplier said current operating income rose less than 10 percent
in the year to Aug. 31, below its forecast for ""20 percent-plus""
growth. Bernanke said on Tuesday that the worst U.S. recession since
the Great Depression was probably over, but the recovery would
be slow and it would take time to create new jobs.    However,
some analysts were still cautious about the extent of a recovery
and warned the market could be set for further setbacks. ""Both sides of the Atlantic are saying we are now out of
recession, but growth is going to be slow and anaemic,"" said
Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management. ""This is where you are seeing a separation between economic
data and market attitude. The market still has an attitude that
money is to be invested and it is fair value, but the economy is
showing that there is still going to be weakness ... we could be
in a dangerous period,"" he said.

an MBA with a major in finance in Paris and started his career
in the pharmaceuticals industry with Roussel. * Became chief operating officer of Aventis' U.S. operations

architect of its integration with Genentech to head its drugs
business, closing a $47 billion buyout that sets the U.S.
biotech at the heart of the Swiss group's growth plans. Roche said on Tuesday that industry insider Pascal Soriot
would replace veteran William Burns as head of its pharma
division at the end of the year -- the final move in a
management reshuffle started when Severin Schwan took over as
chief executive last year.    The Swiss firm, which bought out
minority Genentech shareholders in the spring, now describes
itself as a biotechnology company and will continue to run its
U.S. operations under the Genentech name, underlining the
latter's strategic importance. ""Roche was a Genentech story and it will continue to be so
for some time, before Roche starts to bring its own products
through,"" said Karl-Heinz Koch, analyst at Swiss brokerage
Helvea. Roche is one of several major players in the sector looking
to biotech drugs, which are hard to copy and offer big sales
potential, as pharma manufacturers worldwide struggle to develop
and make money from traditional medicines. Genentech's research, development and commercial operations
will all remain at the U.S. group's San Francisco headquarters,
Roche said.  PLANNING AHEAD Soriot was appointed CEO of Genentech in April and has been
leading the integration of the business and planning the future
set-up of the combined company together with Arthur Levinson,
the previous head of the U.S. group.  A Frenchman who trained as a vet, and a one-time chief
operating officer of Sanofi-Aventis's U.S. operations, Soriot
joined Roche in 2006. Roche on Tuesday also named Daniel O'Day, who currently
heads its molecular diagnostics business, as new chief of the
diagnostics division and announced a series of other
appointments. The drugs unit accounted for some 80 percent of Roche's 2008
sales of 46 billion Swiss francs ($44 billion) and diagnostics
made up the remainder. Fourth quarter sales at Genentech
totalled $3.7 billion. Roche had previously announced Burns would step down at the
end of 2009. The 62-year-old Scotsman will be nominated to
Roche's board at the 2010 annual meeting. ""The management changes achieved two things -- (they)
significantly reduce the average age in the new executive
committee and the structure of the new body should ease the
decision-making process,"" Helvea's Koch said. Roche stock fell 0.1 percent to 165.30 Swiss francs by 1234
GMT, lagging a DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector that rose
0.15 percent. For full details of Roche's management changes, click here

fourth straight session on Thursday, pressured by energy and
pharma stocks, with analysts detecting no early resumption of
the market upswing without solid evidence of economic recovery. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.1
percent lower at 949.82 points after trading in a wide range of
947.37-958.02. It is up 14 percent this year and has surged 47
percent since hitting a record low in early March. Drugmakers took the most points off the index, with
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk,
Roche Holding and Sanofi-Aventis down 0.6-2.2 percent. ""We are going to see nothing but a phase of consolidation,
may be for several weeks,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist
at Brewin Dolphin. ""The survey data has been consistently positive all along
and the market has been pricing all these things in anticipation
of a recovery. We actually need to get a confirmation of the
survey data in the real economic numbers, such as GDP figures,
for the markets to move on now,"" he added. Data showed the euro zone services economy jumped back
almost to recovery in August and was on course to grow in this
quarter led by a resurgent Germany and France. Energy shares also featured among top losers, with BP, Royal
Dutch Shell, BG Group, Total and StatoilHydro shedding 1.0-1.2
percent. ""The rhetoric of recovery seems to have lost some of its
sheen of late ... Investors will be hoping that European finance
ministers will be able to devise a blueprint for a relatively
painless adjustment,"" said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at
IG Index. ""In the meantime though, the cloud of uncertainty hovering
above equities may have put an end to the raging bull market of
the past months.""  Britain, France and Germany said that although the world
economy was stabilising, the crisis was not yet over and urged
governments to implement fully their recovery plans while
ensuring that they did not create the conditions for new global
imbalances in the future.  FINANCIALS ADVANCE Banks were among top gainers, with HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank
of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Postbank gaining 0.3-9.9 percent. The market got some support from better than-expected-sales
data from key U.S. retailers in August, but continued weakness
in the labour market limited the impact. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its services
index rose to 48.4 in August, slightly above the 48.0 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters, while initial
jobless claims fell to 570,000 from a revised 574,000 the week
before, but that was above economists' forecast for 560,000. Investors awaited Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data. ""Any signs that the U.S. labour market is still in dire
straits could make the bulls minds up to cash in on their gains
and even attract speculative sellers compounding a move lower,""
Angus Campbell, head of sales, Capital Spreads, said in a note. The market showed little reaction to the European Central
Bank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low
of 1.0 percent. Pernod Ricard, the world's second-largest spirits group,
fell 4.5 percent after it predicted a tough year as the drinks
market stagnates and said it would focus on disposals and
generating cash to reduce its debt pile. British music, books and games retailer HMV fell 2.8 percent
after posting a 1.8 percent fall in underlying sales for the
first 18 weeks of its financial year. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 fell 0.4-0.6 percent.

(Adds details from news conference) By Edith Honan NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - All primary school-age
children in New York City will be offered free vaccines for
seasonal and H1N1 flu this year under a plan announced on
Tuesday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The vaccines are part of the city's strategy to combat the
new H1N1 swine flu strain that hit the city hard during the
spring, infecting an estimated 750,000 to 1 million people or
about 10 percent of the population. ""We've looked at every eventuality we thought was somewhat
probable and have planned for it. Hopefully, we won't have to
use any of it,"" Bloomberg told reporters. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
urged state and local health departments to prepare vaccination
plans ahead of an expected second wave of H1N1 as the northern
hemisphere enters the fall and winter months. Safety tests are being done on a vaccine for H1N1 and it is
expected to be made available in the second half of October,
according to the CDC. The CDC is expected to send 1.2 million vaccine doses to
the city by mid-October and an additional 500,000 doses every
week thereafter and also to cover the $30 million cost,
Bloomberg said. Five companies are making swine flu vaccine for the U.S.
market -- AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit, CSL Ltd,
GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA. New York's plan calls for distributing both conventional
shots and MedImmune's FluMist, which is sprayed in the nose. H1N1 has killed at least 2,185 people globally since it
began quickly spreading among humans earlier this year,
according to the World Health Organization. Because this virus is new, more people are susceptible to
it and the WHO has been predicting for months now that 2
billion people will likely become infected. White House advisers warned on Aug. 24 that it could infect
up to half the U.S. population, leading to as many as 1.8
million hospitalizations and 90,000 deaths -- more than double
the number of fatalities seen in a typical flu season. Swine flu disproportionately affects younger people, unlike
seasonal flu which mainly burdens the elderly. New York City's vaccination plan calls for each primary
school in the city to hold two vaccination sessions, about four
weeks apart, Bloomberg said. Older students can report to a flu
center in each of the city's five boroughs. The city will also turn some health clinics into
specialized flu treatment centers, launch a web portal to track
flu data, and dispatch hundreds of volunteer ""flu fighters"" to
senior centers, schools and houses of worship. The strategy was developed by experts from 15 city agencies
who met throughout the summer. (Editing by Daniel Trotta and Paul Simao)

looked like the market was not feeling altogether happy with

457,"Aug 30, 2009 01:33PM ET",ANALYSIS-Flu pandemic's impact seen as mixed for US stocks,nan," * Travel and leisure shares most at risk * Healthcare, home entertainment shares could get lift By Lisa Baertlein and Deepa Seetharaman LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Investors worried
about a severe U.S. swine flu outbreak this fall should
consider stocks that rise when people hunker down at home and
avoid companies that operate in crowded spaces. That might mean selling shares in airline, hotel and cruise
companies as well as mall-based stores that sell discretionary
items. Buys may include healthcare stocks, online retailers and
companies that provide entertainment and in-home comfort food. Retail and leisure analysts did not believe the spread of
H1N1 will be as dire as some health experts suggest. They also
said people could quickly adapt to living with the threat of
flu, particularly if the virus does not become more lethal. Still, a severe outbreak could set back the nascent
economic recovery and trigger an overall sell-off in the U.S.
stock market, analysts said. ""Most folks would agree that we're on a path to recovery,""
said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka. ""(A flu outbreak)
obviously makes the road to recovery even more difficult."" White House advisers warned on Aug. 24 that the H1N1 flu
virus, formerly known as swine flu, could infect up to half the
U.S. population, leading to as many as 1.8 million
hospitalizations and 90,000 deaths -- more than double the
number of fatalities seen in a typical flu season. ""Most of the market is a loser because any time you have a
pandemic, people just don't go out of the house,"" said Keith
Springer, president of Capital Financial Advisory Services. Yet the travel industry would be particularly hurt, said
Randy Bateman, chief investment officer at Huntington Funds. ""Your Deltas and your American Airlines, (any company) that
hold people in a confined area,"" he said. The Arca Airline Index struggled to maintain gains for two
months after the initial flu crisis erupted in the spring, but
is now outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Shares of hotelier Marriott International and cruise ship
operator Carnival Corp slumped in May due in part to the flu,
before recovering later in the summer. FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE ""Companies involved in making the vaccine are probably the
ones that stand to benefit the most,"" said David Rosenberg,
chief economist at wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff. Five companies are making a flu vaccine for the U.S.
market: AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit, CSL Ltd, GlaxoSmithKline
Plc, Novartis AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA. Sales of antivirals Tamiflu from Roche AG and
GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza likely would rise in a pandemic, but
potential gains may be priced in, with the Arca Pharmaceuticals
Index up 20 percent since late April. Sales volume in Kleenex tissue maker Kimberly-Clark Corp's
healthcare business was up in the latest quarter after the flu
scare drove sales of face masks. Clorox Co's disinfecting wipes
also have been selling well. Other specialty paper makers also are reporting higher
flu-related sales. Drugstore operators like Walgreen Co, CVS Caremark Corp and
Rite Aid Corp may benefit from sales of tissues,
over-the-counter flu remedies, prescriptions and face masks.
Walgreen aims to administer 5 million seasonal flu shots this
year, up from 1.2 million in 2008. CONSUMER STOCKS TO HURT There are hints that the U.S. economy is on the mend from
the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression,
but there are still few signs that consumer spending has
recovered. Widespread fears about getting seriously ill could
further delay a rebound in spending. Should there be a massive outbreak among school children,
""all that back-to-school buying disappears because they're at
home coughing,"" said Brean Murray, Carret analyst Eric Beder. A late fall rise in flu cases could dampen crucial holiday
sales or shift it online, benefiting names like Amazon.com and
eBay Inc and hurting mall-based chains such H&M and Zara that
don't do Web sales. The recession already has driven consumers to more home
cooking and cheaper forms of entertainment. A serious flu
outbreak could amplify those trends, possibly boosting sales
for companies including Netflix Inc, an analyst said. Chuck E. Cheese's parent company recently said the
recession and flu fears kept people out of its kid-friendly
restaurants. Hard-hit U.S. meat exporters remain vulnerable. Retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which sells a range of
items, could get a boost because shoppers can make one visit
and buy enough provisions to last several weeks. Victor Schiller, president of Investors Observer, said he
would consider investing in Campbell Soup Co using conservative
call option techniques. ""Campbell soup is the ultimate comfort food and easy to
prepare,"" he said. ""People would be home more and turning to
that kind of food if they are sick or feeling a little low."" (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein and Deepa Seetharaman;

in afternoon trading on Tuesday, tracking a rise in U.S. stock
futures, with oil stocks rebounding from earlier losses. By 1247 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 0.1 percent at 976.14 points after falling to a
low of 967.98 points earlier in the session. ""Volumes are low and considering what happened in China this

Telecom and Deutsche Telekom were up 1.4 to 3 percent. Drugmakers rose with Roche and Sanofi-Aventis up 1.2 percent
and 0.7 percent respectively. China's volatile Shanghai Composite index fell 2.6 percent,
but investors were not likely to overly concerned given its 7.5
percent rise over the three prior sessions. Futures for U.S. major stock indexes the S&P 500, the Dow
Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.5 to 0.6

early trade on Tuesday from the 10-month closing highs they hit
in the previous session as investors took profits and after
declines in Asia. At 0832 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.4 percent at 971.54 points. The European benchmark index is still up 50 percent from its
lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more confident
on the prospects for worldwide economic recovery. Data on
Tuesday confirmed that Germany, the region's biggest economy,
exited recession in the second quarter. ""We've enjoyed the euphoria. (The fall in shares) is
profit-taking and worries about China,"" said David Buik, senior
partner at BGC Partners. ""And the U.S. Budget deficit has reared
its ugly head again. But I don't see it as a serious correction,
which won't happen till people get back from holiday."" The sell-off was across the board, but the heavyweight
banking sector took most points off the index. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, UBS and UniCredit fell between
1 and 1.7 percent. Shares in France's Natixis, which reports on Thursday, have
been suspended from trading for the day, following a report that
majority owner BPCE will guarantee some of its toxic assets. Miners fell as metals prices retreated from recent highs.
Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Lonmin, Rio Tinto and
Xstrata fell between 1.5 and 3.7 percent. Crude prices slipped 0.8 percent to less than $74 a barrel,
impacting oil shares. Total, ENI, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and
StatoilHydro fell between 0.7 and 1.2 percent. British oil explorer Cairn Energy fell 2.7 percent after
warning that meeting targets for the next stages of the
development was becoming ""increasingly challenging"", as it
reported a first-half loss after tax. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down between 0.4 and 0.5 percent.  DEFENSIVES GAIN Defensive sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and telecoms,
were among the small number of risers. Mobile telecoms firm Vodafone gained 1.4 percent after
JPMorgan upgraded the telecoms sector to ""overweight"", and
advised exposure to the stock. The broker said the telecoms sector is favoured by cheap
valuations and seasonal trading patterns that have led the
sector to consistently outperform in the final months of most
years since 1995. It was also ""overweight"" in France Telecom,
which rose 1.8 percent, and KPN, up 1.6 percent. Among drugmakers, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis rose
0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively. Beauty products giant L'Oreal, which reports results on
Thursday, rose 1.5 percent after Jefferies upgraded it to ""buy""
from ""hold"". In other broker-inspired moves, German tourism group TUI
surged 7.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to
""overweight"" from ""equal weight"". Irish building materials group CRH fell 1.4 percent after
posting a sharp drop in first-half pretax profit and saying the
rate of decline would ease in the second half due to
cost-cutting and improvements in its core U.S. market. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.8 percent lower. China's
benchmark Shanghai Composite was down 2.6 percent, having been
down more than 5 percent earlier. Analysts pointed to the volatility in the Chinese market,
which has enjoyed a strong run, and said that in the longer
term, it is not correlated to other markets.
 Later in the session, investors' attention will switch to
key macroeconomic data from the United States on house prices
and consumer confidence.

By Joanne Frearson LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early
trade on Monday, hitting their highest level in more than 10
months, with banks and commodity stocks gaining as investors
become more confident about the prospects of a global recovery. By 0818 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 0.9 percent at 975.49 points, having hit a
10-month high of 977.93 points earlier. The index is up around 50 percent since reaching a lifetime
low in early March and is up about 17 percent for the year. ""There are no specific stories out there, there is no good
news and no bad news. Asian markets were ok overnight and the
outlook for the U.S. looks reasonable so there is not reason for
Europe to take the top off,"" said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at
BGC Partners. Banks added the most points to the index. Barclays,
UniCredit, UBS and Lloyds Banking Group were up 1.8 to 3.8
percent. Miners tracked higher metal prices with copper gaining 1.4
percent, aluminium up 1.1 percent and nickel up 3.5 percent on a
brighter economic outlook. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Eurasian Natural
Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto and Xstrata were 2.8 to 4.4
percent higher. Energy stocks were higher as crude rose above $74 a barrel
extending its rally to trade near a 10-month high. BG Group, Cairn Energy, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Tullow
Oil were up 1.2 to 2.6 percent.  DEFENSIVES FALL On the downside, defensive stocks were lower as investors
switched into cyclicals. Drugmakers were among the biggest losers on the index with
Roche and Sanofi-Aventis both down 0.5 percent. Turning to economic news, markets were given further support
as European Central Bank Governing Council Member Ewald Nowotny
said over the weekend that the European economy will improve in
the second half, driven by policy measures, but a sustained
recovery will likely not take hold until the beginning of 2010. But Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists who
accurately predicted the magnitude of the world's financial
troubles, sees a ""big risk"" of a double-dip recession, according
to an opinion piece posted on the Financial Times website on
Sunday.    ""Markets have been reflecting the government stimulus
around the world and getting far too excited. ... Not sure if
this is going to be sustainable as we head up towards the (UK)
bank holiday weekend,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at
Seven Investment Management. ""We have to be extremely careful of the market getting too
carried away and investors losing track of valuations,"" he said. Meanwhile, euro zone industrial new orders, due out at 0900
GMT, will provide a further gauge on the state of the region's
economic picture. Investors will also keep an eye on Chicago Fed

461,"Aug 18, 2009 01:20PM ET",UPDATE 1-Tamiflu shelf-life extension up to countries - WHO,nan," * WHO says Tamiflu shelf-life decision up to countries * US, Canada, Australia, EU have issued two-year extensions * Roche says filled government orders for 270 million people 
(recasts with Roche comments, adds details and byline) By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation 
said on Tuesday it was up to national regulatory authorities to
decide whether to extend the shelf life of the flu drug Tamiflu
by two years, as recommended by Swiss drug maker Roche. The United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and the
European Union's drug watchdog have extended Tamiflu's shelf
life to 7 years from 5 after company data showed the active
ingredient's longer stability, a Roche spokeswoman said. Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, is the frontline
antiviral being used against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as
swine flu, which is causing an influenza pandemic.  Capsules kept in government stockpiles worldwide or
currently on the market carry a five-year expiry date. ""It is WHO's view that shelf-life extensions are a matter
for national regulatory authorities,"" WHO spokesman Gregory
Hartl said in a statement sent to journalists. The WHO says most people infected with H1N1 have mild
symptoms and Tamiflu should be given only to flu sufferers at
high risk including pregnant women or those with complications
such as pneumonia. The European Medicines Agency has said it is acceptable to
apply the extension to current stocks of the drug during a flu
pandemic, a decision followed last month by Switzerland.  ""We are working with health authorities to also extend the
shelf life in other markets because it makes sense,"" Roche
spokeswoman Claudia Schmitt told Reuters.  270 MILLION COURSES Roche was providing its stability data to governments to
help them extend the shelf life of their stockpiles, she said. ""Governments have had stockpiles since the bird flu time,""
she added, referring to the H5N1 avian flu strain which erupted
in 2003 and also responds to treatment with the antiviral. Since 2004, Roche has filled government orders for 270
million Tamiflu treatment courses in 96 countries, Schmitt said. The drug manufacturer has donated about 10.65 million
treatment courses to the WHO for distribution and use in the
poorest countries. The first donation to the U.N. agency was
made in 2004 and the second in May as H1N1 spread more widely. ""A large amount of the second donation is newly produced. It
is a product that will expire many years from now,"" she said. The WHO spokesman said the agency did not have any new
estimate of global production capacity for vaccines now being
developed by drug companies. The WHO has previously estimated that drug companies could
produce up to 94 million doses per week but the amount will
depend on factors including whether one dose or two is needed,
and how much of the active agent will be needed per dose. In the United States, Novavax Inc reported on Tuesday a new
kind of flu vaccine worked against the H1N1 virus in ferrets,
the closest animal to humans when it comes to being infected
with influenza. Leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis,
GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Baxter, CSL and Solvay. In Dar es Salaam, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said
work on producing a vaccine was proceeding, now that
manufacturers in developed and developing countries had received
the seed virus from the WHO's collaborating centres. ""We expect vaccines, the first batch of which would be
available in September, October,"" Chan told reporters.

 (Writes through, adds detail, shares, background) LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - An H1N1 swine flu vaccine
developed by China's Sinovac Biotech is effective after just one
shot, its developer said on Tuesday. The news boosted shares in the Chinese vaccine company by 10
percent in U.S. trading. Until now, experts have predicted that two shots will be
needed to provide swine flu immunity. But Sinovac, which is the
first company worldwide to complete clinical trials for an H1N1
vaccine, said a single dose of its vaccine proved sufficient. Leading flu vaccine makers including Sanofi-Aventis,
GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Baxter, CSL and Solvay are racing to
develop a vaccine against swine flu. The H1N1 flu outbreak, which was declared a pandemic on June
11, has spread around the world and could eventually affect 2
billion people, according to the World Health Organisation. Officials are concerned that supplies of vaccine will prove
tight, but an ability to vaccinate people once instead of twice
would stretch stocks substantially. Sinovac said immunogenicity after one dose of its vaccine
had ""reached the international criteria for vaccines"". There
were no signs of severe adverse reactions, it added. Its clinical trials were initiated in Beijing in July and
inoculation was completed on Aug. 15, with a total of 1,614
participants over three years receiving the vaccine. Regulators around the world are expected to start approving
swine flu vaccines next month as more clinical trial results
come in, allowing governments to start mass vaccination
programmes from September, according to the WHO. Medical experts say vaccines need to available quickly and
in large quantities to have the greatest impact.  Vaccines arrived too late in the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics
to be of much use and flu vaccines had not been developed in the
1918 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic which killed an estimated 50
million.

463,"Aug 06, 2009 10:18AM ET",UPDATE 2-WHO sees swine flu vaccination from next month,nan,"0    * Flu vaccine development on track, WHO says * First clinical trial results and approvals in Sept * Vaccine yields higher after initial problems 
 (Adds further quotes, details, background) By Jonathan Lynn and Ben Hirschler GENEVA/LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The first vaccines to
combat H1N1 swine flu should be approved and ready for use in
some countries from September, the World Health Organisation
said on Thursday. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO director of the Initiative for
Vaccine Research, also said vaccine production yields were
improving, following a disappointing start that triggered some
worries about supplies. One of the virus strains used by vaccine makers now seems to
be yielding the same amount as seasonal vaccine, while early
indications were that pandemic H1N1 yields might be only 30
percent of normal. ""I don't want to say too early that the question has been
resolved but it really seems that we have found a way to go
round this problem,"" Kieny told reporters. ""We are on track in
development."" First results from clinical trials are expected early next
month and these tests will show whether one or two doses are
needed to provide immunity -- another big swing factor in
determining how many people can be vaccinated. Once initial clinical trial results are in, regulators will
be able to approve the vaccines from next month and the first
countries are expected to start mass vaccination programmes,
Kieny added. The H1N1 flu outbreak, declared a pandemic on June 11, has
spread around the world and could eventually affect 2 billion
people, according to WHO estimates. Fears the strain could become resistant to the anti-viral
drug Tamiflu have underscored the need to get vaccines to market
quickly. The H1N1 vaccines would be given separately from
regular seasonal flu shots. Leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis,
GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Baxter, CSL and Solvay. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan has said the H1N1 virus
is stable and there were no signs of it mixing with other more
dangerous types of influenza such as the deadly H5N1 bird flu
strain. At present, patients with mild symptoms generally do not
need any medicines to recover, and Chan has stressed hospital
visits are not necessary unless those infected with flu have
certain warning signs. These include long-lasting high fever in adults and a lack
of alertness in children. Pregnant women and people with health
problems including diabetes are also vulnerable to more severe
effects from the new flu strain.  FAST-TRACK APPROVAL 'SAFE' The WHO said vaccines had to be available quickly and in
large quantities to have the greatest impact and it insists that
fast-track approval will not jeopardise safety. Vaccines arrived too late in the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics
to be of much use, and flu vaccines had not been developed in
the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic which killed an estimated 50
million people. Some concerns have been raised because of serious side
effects and 30 deaths seen during a U.S. swine flu vaccination
in 1976. Kieny said vaccine production and purity levels had improved
significantly since but safety issues could arise during a
pandemic when a vaccine is administered on a mass scale, even if
they did not show up in safety trials. As a result, countries are being advised to conduct
intensive monitoring as the vaccination campaign goes on. (Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis; editing by Michael

464,"Aug 06, 2009 01:15AM ET",ANALYSIS-India's ailing drugmakers may seek foreign cure,nan," * More tie-ups likely between global, Indian pharma firms * Pfizer, Merck, Sanofi may be on lookout for deals * India's Cipla, Aurobindo seen as potential targets * Global firms seen benefitting from low costs in India * Indian firms to gain expertise, avoid legal battles By Pratish Narayanan MUMBAI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - For Indian generic drugmakers
struggling with cut-throat competition, regulatory hurdles and
expensive legal battles, a tie-up with a global pharmaceutical
giant may be just what the doctor ordered. The world's biggest drugmakers have been on an acquisition
spree over the past year and are eyeing Indian firms to gain
access to emerging markets and cheap production, as well as to
retake some of the business they've lost to inexpensive copycat
versions of their blockbuster drugs. Global heavyweight Pfizer is seen as the most likely suitor
of Indian rivals as it looks to replace revenue lost from the
lapse of key patents, while Merck and Sanofi-Aventis may also
seek to shake hands with Indian producers, analysts said. Indian drug companies, for their part, are grappling with
regulatory crackdowns that have made it harder to sell their
products in the key U.S. market, making a deal with a bigger
and better-funded global rival look increasingly attractive.
 Indian generic drug makers including Ranbaxy, Dr Reddy's and
Matrix Laboratories have all linked up with global players over
the past year. More deals are expected. ""The foreign companies can limit research expenses as the
cost of developing a product in India is lower than probably
anywhere else in the world,"" said R.K. Gupta, managing director
of Taurus Mutual Fund in New Delhi. ""While the Indian firm will get access to world-class
facilities and need not handle legal issues once the drug is
developed."" Analysts say India's Cipla, with its vast range of
products, including anti-cancer and anti-diabetic drugs, and a
market value of $4.5 billion, is attractive to foreign buyers. They add that smaller firms Aurobindo Pharma, Orchid
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Dishman Pharmaceuticals could
also be eyed by overseas firms. ""When foreign companies look at India, they consider two
things: the low cost of development and the chance to expand in
emerging markets,"" said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, a healthcare
analyst at Angel Broking in Mumbai. ""Cipla's valuations are expensive, but the company has a
strong asset base."" The company's shares trade at more than 20 times forward
earnings, compared with a 17.5 multiple for India's benchmark
BSE index. Rivals Sun Pharma, and Aurobindo Pharma trade at 17.9 times
and 7.3 times expected earnings, respectively. Ranbaxy and Sun,
the two biggest Indian drug makers by sales and market cap,
respectively, are the two worst performers in India's roaring
main index this year, with gains of less than 10 percent. India currently represents $6 billion of the $550 billion
global pharmaceutical industry and its share is increasing at
10 percent a year, according to consultancy KPMG. It is forecast that Indian companies will likely take
around 30 percent of the global generics market from around 22
percent now, KPMG said. EMERGING MARKET FOCUS Drug sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by
mid-teens percentage rates through 2013, against low
single-digits for mature markets, according to IMS Health, the
leading tracker of prescription drug data. Pfizer may pursue further links in India as it faces sales
declines in coming years from patent expirations, including for
blockbuster cholesterol treatment Lipitor. The company wants to add $3 billion in annual sales from
developing markets by 2012, and recently signed a deal with
India's Aurobindo Pharma under which Pfizer will gain rights to
about 60 products in more than 70 emerging markets. Other global firms such as Merck and Sanofi-Aventis may
also seek deals with Indian firms as efforts to control health
care costs in countries including the United States push global
drugmakers to find cheaper alternatives to branded drugs. In June, Dr. Reddy's signed a licensing deal with the UK's
GlaxoSmithKline, and No. 3 generics maker Mylan Inc announced a
partnership with India's Biocon. FDA TROUBLE Developing nations account for just 6 percent of worldwide
trade in medicines, the World Health Organization estimates. By
offering generic drugs that are a cheaper alternative to
branded drugs from big global firms, Indian companies have an
oppportunity to increase their share of this trade, say
analysts. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently been
finding fault with Indian firms' manufacturing procedures. A
tie-up with one of the bigger players would help them acquire
the know-how to better maintain quality standards. ""The FDA has been going no, no, no, no to so many drugs
from Indian firms,"" said Alex Mathew, head of research at
Geojit BNP-Paribas Financial Services. ""A tie-up with foreign players will not only give financial
stability, but access to technological upgradation that can
prevent more disapproval."" In late June, U.S. authorities seized drugs made by the
U.S. unit of India's Sun Pharma for manufacturing standards
violations. Last year, the FDA found 15 deficiencies at Indian
firm Lupin's manufacturing plant in central India. Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo's $4.2 billion takeover
in 2008 of Ranbaxy, India's top drugmaker by sales,
demonstrates the possibilities but also the potential pitfalls
that global players face when linking-up with Indian rivals. Ranbaxy shares plummeted late last year after a U.S. ban on
some of its products. The FDA in February said Ranbaxy had sold
misbranded or adulterated drugs in the United States, its
largest market, further hurting the company's market value. But analysts say Ranbaxy has been helped since being taken
over by Daiichi, which replaced Ranbaxy head Malvinder Singh
with its own executive in a bid to resolve problems.

465,"Jul 29, 2009 04:16AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS-Shanghai surprise fails to dent Europe gains,nan," * Chinese stocks fall 5 percent, hitting emerging markets * Earnings help lift European stocks 0.4 percent * Dollar, yen gain slightly  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - A late sell-off on Shanghai's
stock market depressed emerging market stocks on Wednesday and
took Asian shares off multi-month peaks, although the mood
failed to carry over into Europe. European shares were higher in early trade, lifted by
positive earnings news despite losses in China that have
sometimes heralded a global stock market retreat. Chinese stocks fell 5.0 percent in heavy turnover, posting
their biggest daily drop in eight months and ending a five-day
liquidity-driven rally. At one point, stocks were close to 8
percent lower. Investors were concerned that major Chinese banks may start
to restrict lending to cool various booming markets. Chinese
stocks, for example, had risen close to 89 percent this year
before Wednesday's fall. That led MSCI's broad emerging market stock index down 1.3
percent, after it hit a 10-month high on Tuesday. European shares gained, however, partly as a result of
positive results from Bayer and drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up
0.4 percent. Some investors have nonetheless been suggesting that the
global equity market rally that began in March is not
immediately sustainable. ""Given the speed and strength of the recent rally, we are  
tending toward a wait and see approach before adding to our     
overall equity exposures,"" U.S.-based money manager GMO said in
a note.  FLIGHT TO QUALITY The dollar and yen gained broadly while perceived higher
risk currencies came under heavy selling pressure, partly as a
result of the Shanghai sell off. U.S. data on Tuesday also showed a slide in consumer
sentiment during July, encouraging investors to take profits
from a sharp risk rally that has driven currencies such as the
Australian dollar higher, along with the euro. The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies and the euro lost about the same to $1.4166. ""We have had a very strong rally in risky assets and the
market has been looking for reasons to take profit,"" said
Michael Klawitter, senior currency strategist at Dresdner
Kleinwort. Euro zone government bonds gained traction on the Chinese
stock losses. The two-year Schatz yield was at 1.356 percent,
off an early high of 1.393 percent, while the 10-year Bund
yielded 3.427 percent, also off the session high of
3.511 percent.

466,"Jul 28, 2009 12:48PM ET","Banks, BP, US sentiment pull European shares lower",nan," * Deutsche Bank leads banking sector lower after results * BP weighs on sector after results * Drugmakers, Lagardere lend some support  By Dominic Lau LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday
after hitting their highest close for 8-1/2 months in the
previous session, as Deutsche Bank led banks lower and BP's
results put pressure on energy stocks. Weak U.S. consumer confidence also weighed on the market and
overshadowed news that U.S. single-family home prices rose in
May from April, the first monthly rise in nearly three years. U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in July,
the Conference Board said, recording its second consecutive
decline as sentiment remained hampered by a difficult job
market. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed
down 1 percent at 902.85 points. Volumes on the index were about
87 percent of the 90-day daily average. Banks were among the worst hit. Deutsche Bank sank over 11
percent after it raised its loan loss provisions in the second
quarter, overshadowing a nearly 70 percent rise in net profit
driven by its investment banks. BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Deutsche Postbank lost between 2.8 and 5.5 percent. However, BBVA advanced 4.5 percent after reporting its core
capital rose to 7.1 percent in the first half, supporting the
bank's recent declarations that it had no need for a capital
hike. ""The earnings season seems to be better than analysts'
expectations on an aggregate level. So far it seems to be
because cost cutting has been very effective ... improving
profitability despite declines in sales on top line,"" said Mark
Bon, a fund manager at Canada Life. ""There is some expectation that once you have this phase of
cost cutting there is a return of some top line growth from
refilling the inventory pipeline, an increase in sales,"" he
said, adding that it would be an importance phase for the market
to return to healthy earnings growth though it could be a long
process. The FTSEurofirst 300 has gained 40 percent since reaching a
lifetime low in early March, and is up 8.5 percent for the year. Oil producers were other standout losers after BP said it
had increased its cost reduction targets for 2009 by 50 percent
to $3 billion but reported a halving in second-quarter profits
due to lower oil prices and weaker refining margins. BP was 3.1 percent lower, while BG Group, Total and
StatoilHydro lost 2.1-2.8 percent. Miners were also weaker, with Xstrata down 6.5 percent
despite posting solid first-half production numbers. Anglo
American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Eurasian Natural Resources
 fell 3.1-6.9 percent. ""There is a little bit of rotation into stocks which lagged
behind and a little bit of profit taking on things that have run
very well recently,"" Bon said. ""It's a good development, as even
stocks that have lagged behind have the chance to be bought as
well."" Across Europe Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.3 percent -- ending
a record-equalling 11th-day winning run, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 lost 1.5 and 1.2 percent, respectively. LAGARDERE, DRUGMAKERS SUPPORT Lagardere soared more than 5 percent amid news that the
media group had been provisionally cleared by France's stock
market regulator in a long-running probe into suspected insider
trading at Airbus parent EADS. EADS, which Lagardere owns 7.5 percent, gained 2.3 percent,
benefiting from solid second-quarter results. Defensive drugmakers offered some support, with Novo Nordisk
, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA and Sanofi-Aventis up
0.7-3.1 percent. ""There is this sentiment in the market about the glass being
half full -- but there is a big gap between the euphoria and
reality, a bit like a supermodel without make-up,"" said
Commerzbank's chief strategist, Hans-Juergen Delp. ""Earnings expectations have been lowered so much that they
are easily exceeded.""

467,"Jul 28, 2009 09:24AM ET",Sanofi's Lantus avoids meltdown after cancer scare,nan," * Prescriptions for diabetes treatment holding up * Analysts review worst-case forecasts for Lantus sales * Sanofi expected to reiterate confidence at H1 results * Shares up 2.6 percent  By Ben Hirschler LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - One month on from a cancer scare
that investors feared might sink sales of Sanofi-Aventis's
diabetes treatment Lantus, the French drugmaker appears to have
escaped the worst. Prescription data showed demand for the long-acting insulin
was holding up, despite the release of studies on June 26
suggesting a possible link between Lantus and cancer, while U.S.
and European regulators have both backed the product. As a result, industry analysts have been reviewing initial
gloomy sales forecasts. Morgan Stanley, which upgraded the stock to ""overweight""
from ""equal weight"" on Tuesday, now believes the downside risk
to Lantus revenues will be closer to 5 to 10 percent, rather
than the more than 50 percent that had been modelled initially. Its analysts now forecast Lantus sales will rise to 3.8
billion euros ($5.43 billion) in 2015. Merrill Lynch is more
bullish, predicting 5 billion by 2014, or double last year's
level of 2.45 billion. Other analysts still caution that Lantus could be hit by more
negative news in September when the European Association of the
Study of Diabetes, whose journal Diabetologia published the
critical studies, discusses the drug at its annual meeting. Still, so far at least, Lantus has escaped the misfortune of
GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes Avandia, sales of which plunged in
2007 when it was linked to heart attack risk. According to Citigroup, four-week average U.S. total
prescriptions for Lantus were down only slightly in the period
ended July 17 at 292,700, against 297,300 up to June 26. Avandia prescriptions, by contrast, had fallen 30 percent by
the same stage and Glaxo's medicine went on to lose 60 percent
of its sales. The lack of widespread media coverage has been one key
difference in the two cases, since the European experts who have
questioned the safety of Lantus do not have the high profile of
U.S. cardiologist Steve Nissen, who led the attack on Avandia. Sanofi has also moved quickly to highlight methodological
flaws in the research concerning Lantus. The company's chief executive, Chris Viehbacher, is expected
to reiterate his confidence in Lantus prospects when he presents
half-year financial results on Wednesday. Shares in Sanofi were up 2.6 percent 1250 GMT, outperforming
a 1.1 percent advance in the DJ Stoxx European drugs sector,
also benefiting from news of a higher-than-expected price for
new heart drug Multaq.

473,"Jul 08, 2009 11:48AM ET",EU calls for more flu vaccination to protect old,nan," BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - The European Commission urged
EU member states on Wednesday to increase seasonal flu
vaccination and vaccine production to help the elderly and most
vulnerable. The executive Commission said it hoped that by 2015 some 75
percent of people over the age of 65 and 75 percent of people
with underlying health problems would be vaccinated annually. This would amount to nearly a quarter of the European
Union's population of almost 500 million people, it said. ""We need to act now to step up our vaccine capacity for both
seasonal flu and A H1N1, and we only have a narrow time frame to
do so,"" Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said. ""This initiative helps limit the effects of seasonal flu in
the most vulnerable groups,"" she said in a written statement. The Commission called for the 27 EU member states to report
annually on vaccination coverage, and then report progress every
three years after 2015. It called for more education and
training for health care workers dealing with influenza. The Commission proposed each member country adopt a national
action plan to meet the goals. Vaccination rates in the elderly
vary from a high of 80 percent in the Netherlands to a low of 2
percent in Lithuania, according to the Commission.  The elderly population and people with underlying medical
conditions such as diabetes or asthma are considered the most
vulnerable against seasonal flu, which results in an estimated
40,000 to 200,000 deaths each year in the EU.  Flu vaccine manufacturers increased production of seasonal
flu vaccines in June and aim to produce a vaccine against the
pandemic H1N1 flu virus.  At least 30 companies worldwide produce flu vaccine,
including Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis, Baxter International,
GlaxoSmithKline and Solvay. (Reporting by Caroline Linton, editing by Elizabeth

474,"Jul 07, 2009 12:18PM ET","EU actively pursuing some drugmakers, official says",nan," * EU actively pursuing a number of individual cases * No conclusions at this stage  * Kroes report to step up scrutiny of generics deals  By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - EU regulators are probing some
drug firms over suspected anti-competitive practices that
include deals with makers of cheap generics to delay medicines'
market entry, a European Commission official said on Tuesday. European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes will
say in a report on the pharmaceutical industry on Wednesday that
""we are actively pursuing a number of individual cases"", the
official, who has seen the 600-page document, said. ""The report will say that there are no final conclusions at
this stage to those cases being pursued,"" the official said,
adding that the document did not identify any companies. Kroes, tasked with ensuring fair play across the 27-country
European Union, will present the final report of her
investigation at 0930 GMT. In its preliminary report last November, the EU's executive
arm estimated that delays in getting generics on the market had
cost healthcare providers 3 billion euros ($4.2 billion), based
on a sample of medicines that lost patent protection in 17 EU
states between 2000 and 2007. The European Commission's final report will pave the way for
increased regulatory scrutiny of settlement agreements in which
brand-name companies pay generics makers for not competing with
them or set restrictions on competition, the official said. ""It will look at this on a case-by-case basis to see if
there is enough evidence that merits further scrutiny,"" the
official said. Kroes kicked off her investigation in January 2008 with a
series of raids on makers of brand-name drugs, including
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis. There were also raids on generic drugmakers suspected of
colluding to delay the entry of their products, sometimes in
exchange for payments from originator companies. Such settlement agreements have also come under fire in the
United States, where the Federal Trade Commission estimated last
month that they were costing consumers $3.5 billion a year. Legislation pending in the U.S. Congress would ban such
deals. Drugmakers blame most of the delays on regulatory and other
bureaucratic issues, rather than deliberate action by companies.

1.9 percent at 826.81 points by 1100 GMT after touching 825.95
points -- the lowest level since May 14. But the benchmark index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008,
is still up 28 percent from its lifetime low in early March. Energy stocks were among top losers on the index, tracking a
4.5 percent decline in crude oil on doubts about the prospects
of an early economic recovery and a firm dollar. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total
and StatoilHydro shed 2.4-3.4 percent. ""The road to recovery is still going to be incredibly bumpy
and there are still some major hurdles to overcome before the
markets could get tremendously excited about adding to the
rally,"" said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. ""We need to see some confirmation that the economic recovery
is on track and corporate profitability is going to return. And

nervous mood,"" he said. Financials also fell. Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays,
Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Commerzbank

percent, nickel was down 3 percent and zinc slipped 2.3 percent. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Xstrata, Lonmin
and Eurasian Natural Resources were down 3.4-9.2 percent. Rio Tinto fell 4.5 percent in line with the broader market.
The miner agreed to sell its Americas food packaging business
for $1.2 billion after last week raising $15.2 billion in one of
the world's largest-ever rights issues.  POOR ECONOMIC DATA  Recent macro-economic data also failed to cheer investors
and analysts said the market was cautious ahead of quarterly
results. ""There's a feeling corporate results are still going to be

three months of improvement. Automakers also skidded on concerns about vehicle demand.
BMW, Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG, Peugeot, Renault, Fiat were down
2-3.9 percent. Porsche was down 3.2 percent. The automaker denied a
newspaper report which said five more potential bidders have
emerged for a Porsche-owned derivatives package which controls
around 20 percent of Volkswagen voting shares. But pharmaceuticals, generally seen as defensive, gained
ground. AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline

 (Adds doctor comment in graphs 8-9) By Lewis Krauskopf and Susan Heavey NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration on Wednesday cast doubt on recent studies
that suggested possible cancer risk with Sanofi-Aventis'
 widely used Lantus diabetes drug, boosting investor
confidence in the blockbuster product. Shares of the French drugmaker, which have stumbled in the
past week over Lantus concerns, rose 3.1 percent in Paris after
the FDA also said patients should not stop taking their therapy
without consulting a physician. In a communication posted on its website, the agency
questioned four recently published studies over the cancer
link, saying they did not track patients long enough to
properly evaluate any such risk from the drug. Additionally, the FDA said, ""inconsistencies in findings
within and across individual studies raise concerns as to
whether an association between the use of (Lantus) and cancer
truly exists."" It added that there may be differences in the patients
studied that could have contributed to the studies' findings. Shares of the French drugmaker have plunged about 13
percent in the last week amid concerns that patients and
doctors worried about Lantus' safety would stop using the
product and turn to rival treatments such as Novo Nordisk's
 long-acting insulin Levemir. Lantus is a top seller for Sanofi, and it is seen as
particularly important as other key Sanofi products -- blood
thinners Plavix and Lovenox -- face possible generic
competition. Lantus tallied 2.45 billion euros ($3.5 billion)
in 2008 sales, a figure analysts have expected to grow over the
next five years. Dr. Richard Bergenstal, president-elect of medicine and
science with the American Diabetes Association, said it appears
the FDA was taking the risk posed by the Lantus studies
""seriously but cautiously."" ""I do think they were saying when you get confusing data or
conflicting data, don't make clinical decisions until we get
more,"" Bergenstal said. Sanofi has stood behind the safety of its diabetes drug,
and a company spokesman in Paris said on Wednesday it was
""committed to working with the FDA and other health authorities
and scientific experts to clarify the situation."" The FDA said it would continue reviewing the safety data
for Lantus, including the new studies, to better understand any
possible cancer risk. Earlier this week, the European Medicines Agency said it
was asking its scientific experts to perform a detailed
assessment of the European studies' results and any other
relevant information, since a link between Lantus and cancer
""cannot be confirmed nor excluded."" Mark Dainty, an analyst at Citigroup, said the stock's
recent drop meant the market was already discounting a
worst-case scenario. But the actual decline in Lantus sales might not be as
severe as the 60 percent drop seen in global sales of
GlaxoSmithKline's   Avandia, which was linked to
heart attack risk in 2007, he said. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Susan Heavey; Additional

477,"Jun 30, 2009 12:58PM ET",Banks and oils lead Europe shares lower,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index falls 1.1 percent * U.S. consumer confidence data drags shares lower * Banks and energy companies main fallers  By Brian Gorman LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday,
led lower by banks and energy companies, after U.S. consumer
confidence readings proved weaker than expected, but European
equities gained 15.9 percent over the second quarter.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1.1
percent to 850.17 points. The index rose 15.9 percent over the
second quarter, its best performance since 1999, having hit a
lifetime low on March 9. However, the rally has stalled in recent weeks, as some
analysts feel it had gone too far, relative to the evidence of
recovery. ""We're at that stage now, where bad news will make a bigger
dent than decent news,"" said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC
Partners, in London. ""And it doesn't take much. Volumes are so
low today, they're just tiny.""  U.S. consumer confidence fell in June after two straight
months of gains. The Conference Board, an industry group, said
on Tuesday its index of consumer attitudes dropped to 49.3 from
54.8 in May. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Societe Generale fell
between 1.7 and 2.9 percent. Lloyds Banking Group fell 0.9
percent after announcing 2,100 job cuts.
 Crude oil prices fell more than 3 percent to less than
$69.30 a barrel, hurting energy shares. Total, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol and StatoilHydro fell
between 1.2 and 1.7 percent. The price of copper and other metals was also hurt by the
fall in consumer confidence. Mining groups Anglo American,
Antofagasta, Rio Tinto and Xstrata fell between 1.8 and 2.7
percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down between 1 and 1.7 percent. Wall Street was lower as European bourses were closing. The
Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down between 0.8
and 1.4 percent.   CARREFOUR FALLS Carrefour shares dropped 3 percent on disappointment that
Europe's biggest retailer had not, by the time the market
closed, unveiled a big cost-cutting programme at an analyst day
in Paris. The company released information later.
  Marks & Spencer fell 1.1 percent, ahead of a trading update
on Wednesday.  Among the gainers, French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis rose 1.1
percent, recovering some ground lost recently, after saying it
will close eight of its 27 research and development sites,
without making forced layoffs, as it remodels R&D activities to
respond to changes in the drug industry. Newspaper publisher Daily Mail closed 4.2 percent higher
after UBS upgraded it to ""neutral"". European stock markets will make only modest headway for the
rest of this year after a surging spring rally was checked by
fears of a prolonged recession, a Reuters poll found. European macroeconomic data, like that in the United States,
was also downbeat. The British economy shrank at its fastest
pace in more than 50 years in the first three months of 2009 and
has been in recession for a whole year, boosting expectations
ultra-loose monetary policy could get even looser.(Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson; Editing by Simon

received any news yet from the U.S. health regulator on whether
it will clear the French drugmaker's heart drug Multaq, touted
as a blockbuster, for marketing. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Multaq
would be the first new key treatment in several years that
Sanofi has pushed out of its pipeline. The company needs new drugs to offset looming sales losses
as several of its blockbusters go off patent.  ""Sanofi-Aventis confirms that the FDA has not yet notified
the company of their final decision regarding the Multiq new
drug application,"" spokesman Jean-Marc Podvin said on Tuesday. ""We have been in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding
Multq and are awaiting a final decision."" He declined any further comment. Sanofi has predicted annual sales of more than 1 billion
euro ($1.41 billion) for Multaq, generically known as
dronedarone, while some analysts see sales of as much as 3
billion euro.  Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm in which

which can cause palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue
and raise the risk of more serious heart problems. An independent panel in March advised that patients with
severe types of heart failure, known as Class III and IV, should
not be allowed to use the drug and that Sanofi could not claim
the drug lowered the risk of death. Researchers have said Multaq could be a safer alternative to
amiodarone, a generic drug widely used to control irregular
heart beat although it is not approved for that condition and
can cause damage to the lungs and the thyroid gland. Sanofi shares were up 0.9 percent at 41.80 euros by 1428

midday on Tuesday, as a drop in retail and food stocks such as
Carrefour eclipsed gains in pharma shares, led by
Sanofi-Aventis's rebound from last week's selloff. Shares in Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer,
dropped 2 percent on disappointment the company had not, so far,
unveiled a big cost-cutting programme at an analyst day in
Paris. Other retailers and food and drinks groups lost ground, with
Tesco down 1.1 percent, Heineken down 2.1 percent and Unilever
down 1.4 percent. At 1137 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.03 percent at 859.34 points. The index, which is up 3.3 percent this year, has surged 33
percent since plummeting to a record low in early March, but the
spring rally has stalled since early May, as mixed macroeconomic
data dampened hopes of speedy economic recovery. ""Equities will remain stuck in the range that we've seen
over the past few weeks, with high volatility and low volumes,
as people are waiting for more visibility,"" said Victor Peiro
Perez, head of strategy at Caja Madrid Bolsa. ""That should go on at least until we get the second-quarter
results and outlook from companies."" The FTSEurofirst 300 is on track to record a 17 percent gain
on the quarter -- its best quarterly performance since 1999. But
Europe's benchmark index is still down 47 percent from a
multi-year high reached in mid-2007. But while the spring rally lost steam over the past few
weeks, investors continued to pour money into equities. A Reuters survey on Tuesday showed fund managers in
continental Europe pulled capital out of cash in June and
boosted stock holdings to their highest since August. The monthly survey of 14 investment houses in the region,
released on Tuesday, showed equity holdings rose to 47.1 percent
of their portfolios this month from 45.9 percent in May.  EARNINGS SEASON KEY A number of analysts say the real test for the equity rally
will be the second-quarter earnings season. The results were
expected to be relatively bad, but investors will look for any
signs of a turnaround in profit. ""One of the factors driving renewed investor pessimism is to
do with earnings, where the view is that expectations have moved
too far too fast, setting the scene for a disappointment,"" said
JPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka in a note. ""There were some high profile negative pre-announcements
over the past few weeks, and it is highly likely there will be
more, but in contrast to the popular perception, the
pre-announcement season has been rather benign so far."" On Tuesday, investors were digesting grim economic data that
showed euro zone bank lending has stalled and Japanese
unemployment at its highest level for six years, adding to
worries over the outlook for the global economy. Pharmaceutical shares gained ground, with Sanofi-Aventis up
2.6 percent, paring some of its recent hefty losses sparked by
worries over one of the company's main drugs, and
GlaxoSmithKline up 1.5 percent. Banks were also on the upside, with Barclays up 2.1 percent,
UBS up 1.6 percent and UniCredit up 1 percent. So far this year, the DJ STOXX energy index is up 9 percent,
and the banking index is up 21 percent, while the health care
index is down 4.6 percent. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index was flat, Germany's
DAX index was down 0.1 percent, and France's CAC 40 was down 0.1
percent.

 (Rewrites to add FDA decision on Multaq, updates shares) By Caroline Jacobs PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis
is reshaping its research and development, shutting some of its
sites and still awaiting the U.S. health regulator's final
verdict on experimental heart drug Multaq. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) marketing
approval for Multaq -- touted as the first possible blockbuster
in several years from Sanofi -- within hours. Changes to its R&D and the pending decision on Multaq are
key for Sanofi which is searching for promising new drugs
through partnerships or acquisitions to offset a looming drop in
sales as patents on some of its multi-billion euro drugs expire. Sanofi said on Tuesday it would close eight of its 27
research and development sites, without forced layoffs, making
the activity more efficient and open to outside collaboration to
boost innovation in response to changes in the drug industry. The new R&D model, to be in place by 2013, included measures
that group researchers in more productive structures, train them
to adapt to changes, as well as its earlier announced strategy
of working more closely with academics, hospitals and biotechs. Productivity will focus on diabetes, cancer and age-linked
diseases as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious
diseases, Christian Lajoux, head of Sanofi-Aventis France, said
in a conference call. He declined to give financial details of the reorganisation,
which entails closing four sites in France and sites in Britain,
Japan, Spain and the United States, referring to Sanofi's
second-quarter earnings presentation at the end of next month. Since the arrival of Chris Viehbacher as Sanofi's chief
executive in December, Sanofi has overhauled its pipeline of
drugs in development, slashing 14, while opening its doors to
partnerships to replenish it mainly with biotech products.  COMPLEX BIOTECHNOLOGY The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly shifting its
focus to research based on more complex biotechnology, which is
harder to copy and therefore less prone to generic arrivals,
from chemical-based innovation. ""We are living through radical times of change for
research,"" R&D head Marc Cluzel said in a statement, adding R&D
needed to be ""reinvented"", making ""use of novel technologies and
to create new concepts"" through ""knowledge from outside
sources"". Sanofi said no forced job cuts would take place but that a
plan for voluntary departures was being considered. The company, which has staff of 13,000 in R&D and
administrative posts, had no target for voluntary departures. Sanofi shares rose as much as 3.1 percent on Tuesday and
closed 1 percent higher at 41.87 euros, recouping some of their
losses after the company said European studies highlighting a
possible link between cancer and its diabetes drug Lantus were
of poor quality. Sanofi is counting on Lantus, vaccines as well as yet-to-be
approved Multaq to help make up for patent expiries from 2010 to
2013 on drugs that account for about a fifth of its revenues. ""Sanofi-Aventis confirms that the FDA has not yet notified
the company of their final decision regarding the Multiq new
drug application,"" spokesman Jean-Marc Podvin said on Tuesday. Sanofi has predicted annual sales of more than 1 billion
euro ($1.41 billion) for Multaq, generically known as

as 3 billion to 4 billion euros.  Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm in which

481,"Jun 29, 2009 05:25AM ET",Sanofi rivals to gain as Lantus faces sales drop,nan," * Analysts slash Lantus sales forecasts on cancer concerns * Novo, Merck, Amylin/Lilly, Astra/Bristol could all benefit * Novo gains 5 percent, Sanofi up 1 percent after last
week's losses  By Ben Hirschler, European Pharmaceuticals Correspondent LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Rival drugmakers look set to
gain from a possible link between cancer and Sanofi-Aventis's
long-acting insulin drug Lantus, which has prompted analysts to
slash sales forecasts for the product. Winners could include Denmark's Novo Nordisk -- provided its
rival long-acting insulin Levemir remains free of similar safety
issues -- as well as makers of two new types of diabetes
medicines, known as GLP-1s and DPP-4s. Shares in Novo Nordisk, the world leader in diabetes care,
jumped 5 percent on Monday as the group moved to distance itself
from Lantus by highlighting the technical differences of its
artificial, or analogue, versions of insulin. Novo stock had fallen 6 percent last week. Industry analysts said other potential beneficiaries
included Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly, which market the
GLP-1 drug Byetta; Merck & Co, which sells the DPP-4 treatment
Januvia; and AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which expect
to get approval soon for a new DPP-4 treatment called Onglyza. ""We imagine that Novo Nordisk, Merck, Amylin/Lilly will
actively step up their marketing efforts in the wake of the
Lantus safety concerns,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Baum said
in a research note. JP Morgan analysts said Novo could win on two fronts, if
Levemir succeeds in winning market from Lantus and the company's
GLP-1 drug Victoza, which is about to go on sale in Europe, does
well. Novo's Chief Executive Lars Sorensen, however, was cautious.
""It is too early to say what this will mean to the dynamics of
the market,"" he told investors in a conference call on Monday
morning.  KEY SALES PROP Sanofi moved quickly to stress that the findings from four
European registry studies identifying a possible link to cancer
were inconclusive. The data was released after the market close
on Friday. Still, the experience of past scares, involving drugs such
as GlaxoSmithKline's Avandia and Merck and Schering-Plough's
Vytorin, suggests many doctors and patients will play safe by
seeking alternative treatments. That threatens to knock away a key prop to Sanofi's sales
and profit growth. Lantus, which sold 2.45 billion euros ($3.43 billion) in
2008, has been seen as Sanofi's main driver as top drugs like
Plavix and Lovenox face the threat of generic competition. Morgan Stanley cut its Lantus sales and earnings per share
(EPS) estimates by 52 percent and 11 percent in 2010 and 85
percent and 23 percent in 2015, respectively. Societe Generale analysts said they now forecast zero growth
for Lantus for most of the second half of this year and just
mid-single digit growth from 2010 onward, implying 2012 Lantus
sales of 3.4 billion euros, compared with Sanofi's previous
guidance of at least 5 billion. That translates into a cut of around 10 percent in 2010/2011
EPS estimates, they added. SocGen cuts its price target for Sanofi to 47 euros a share,
but held its ""buy"" rating. Many other brokers moved swiftly to downgrade the stock on
Monday, including JP Morgan, Exane and Natixis. Shares in Sanofi, which had already fallen more than 12
percent on Thursday and Friday on mounting speculation that
damaging data was about to be published, edged up 1 percent to
41.30 euros by 0850 GMT. (Additional reporting by Karin Jensen in Copenhagen; Editing

minor gains by midday on Friday, retreating from morning highs,
with a higher crude oil price supporting energy stocks, while
pharma shares fell led by Sanofi-Aventis. Financials were mixed, with UBS falling after announcing
that it would issue shares and post a second-quarter loss while
analyst upgrades lifted CS Group. At 1115 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.4 percent at 849.32 points, having risen as much
as 1.3 percent earlier in the session. The European benchmark, which tumbled 45 percent in 2008,
has jumped 32 percent since hitting a lifetime low in early
March. It is on track for a weekly loss of around 1.5 percent. Strategists' outlook views were mixed. Credit Suisse saw ""some signs"" of hitherto risk averse
investors re-entering the market. ""The mentality has shifted completely to 'buy on dips' from
'sell into strength',"" Credit Suisse said. Deutsche Bank, citing its economists' estimate that German
gross domestic product would contract by 6 percent in 2009, said
Frankfurt's DAX index could drop more than 15 percent. ""Our strategists see significant downside in equity markets
and expect the DAX to fall back to 4,000 (points) in 2009,""
Deutsche Bank. ""The main reasons for their negative stance: continuing
earnings downgrades, disappointment from the real economic
development, demanding valuation and capital increases which
will absorb a lot of the liquidity."" London-based IG Index said it was difficult to see any
extended recovery in UK stocks. ""There is scope for the FTSE to extend the current recovery
up above the 4300 mark, but it still looks like the negative
sentiment that hit markets over the past couple of weeks could

dollar.""  SPOTLIGHT ON UBS  UBS fell 2.9 percent after the Swiss bank unveiled plans to
raise $3.5 billion in a share sale and forecast a second-quarter
loss. ""The capital increase is not good news, and represents an
about 8 percent increase in the number of shares. In very broad
terms, we might therefore expect a mid-single-digit EPS

after UBS raised its price target for the stock. UBS cited its
domestic rival's investment banking business, saying it ""is
gaining market share and is likely to benefit longer than
previously expected from increased margins in sales and
trading."" After energy, banks added the most points to the benchmark
index. The Bank of England said British banks looked in better
shape than six months ago but were still vulnerable to economic
shocks. The solvency of French banks was at a ""satisfactory"" level,

485,"Jun 26, 2009 07:41AM ET","Sanofi may suffer, whatever final Lantus verdict",nan," * Fear that damaging safety analysis will be published soon * Potential parallel seen to scare over Glaxo's Avandia * Lantus is key driver for Sanofi as other drugs decline * Sanofi shares fall 7 percent, Novo Nordisk down 4 percent  By Ben Hirschler, European Pharmaceuticals Correspondent LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - The history of past drug scares
suggests concerns over the safety of Sanofi-Aventis's diabetes
treatment Lantus will hit sales, whether or not a suggested link
to cancer proves real. Shares in the French drugmaker sank 7 percent on Friday,
extending losses from the previous session, on growing concern
that researchers are about to publish a damaging analysis of the
company's modern, or analogue, insulin drug. ""Our information is that indeed a study is likely to be
published soon raising the possibility of a link between
Lantus use and a certain cancer type,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst
Tim Anderson said in a research note. ""We understand this will not come out in a small medical
journal, but rather one of the major medical journals and it
will be the first time that such a high-profile analysis has
been published linking the drug to cancer in humans."" Although nothing is in the public domain yet, the widespread
talk is likely to negatively influence both doctors' and
patients' perceptions and uptake of Lantus. ""Even if Lantus were cleared of a potentially increased
cancer risk, media focus will likely dramatically alter the
growth profile,"" said Andrew Baum of Morgan Stanley.  Sanofi is relying on Lantus, which many analysts expect to
be its second-biggest seller this year, to offset a fall in
sales of other products, such as Plavix and Lovenox, that could
soon face generic competition. It cannot afford for Lantus sales to stall. Sanofi has not commented on future studies about the safety
of the drug, but a spokesman reiterated that past data from
trials involving more than 70,000 patients, as well as data from
post-marketing surveillance, showed a good safety profile.  AVANDIA AGAIN? The fear is that Sanofi might suffer the same fate as
GlaxoSmithKline in 2007, when safety concerns over its diabetes
drug Avandia saw prescriptions tumble almost 50 percent in the
United States within six months. JP Morgan analyst Alexandra Hauber estimates that a 50
percent reduction in global Lantus sales forecasts from 2010
onwards would cut 2010-13 earnings by between 7 and 13 percent. Most industry analysts expect Lantus to generate sales of
around $4 billion this year and consensus forecasts compiled by
Evaluate Pharma suggest this will rise to $6.4 billion in 2014,
making it the world's fifth biggest-selling medicine by then. At the moment, analysts are holding fire on revising their
forecasts, but that could change when any long-term safety data
is published. A link between Lantus and cancer does make some sense at a
scientific level, according to analysts, and the issue could
also affect other insulin analogues, such as Novo Nordisk's
Levemir. In fact, the theoretical possibility of Lantus being a
mitogenic, cancer-causing compound has been around for nearly a
decade, said Bernstein's Anderson, noting that U.S. Food and
Drug Administration review documents dating back to 2000
mentioned findings of malignancies in rodents. For Denmark's Novo Nordisk, whose shares fell nearly 4
percent on Friday, the issue is something of a two-edged sword,
according to Sam Fazeli of Piper Jaffray. Novo could potentially gain from problems at its rival, and
it might also benefit from any shift in demand towards its
short-acting insulins. But there is a risk that users will be
wary of all modern insulins and there may be a more general
switch to older, cheaper insulin products.

point, that we have seen this year, again any time soon,"" said

to raise about 3.8 billion Swiss francs by selling stock and
expected to post a second-quarter net loss. But the banking sector was in a positive territory after
falling in 7 out of 11 previous sessions. HSBC, Royal Bank of
Scotland, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse and
Deutsche Bank gained 1.3-3.8 percent. The Bank of England said British banks looked in better
shape than six months ago but were still vulnerable to economic
shocks. Miners got strength from higher metals prices. BHP Billiton
, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Eurasian
Natural Resources rose 0.4-2.9 percent. Sanofi-Aventis shares tumbled 9 percent, extending the
previous day's sharp losses, while Novo Nordisk lost 2.5
percent, on continuing concerns about the safety of Sanofi's
diabetes drug Lantus and modern insulins in general. Morgan Stanley downgraded Sanofi to ""equal-weight"" from
""overweight"" in the light of a debate among diabetologists over
the potential cancer risk of insulin analogues like Lantus,
while JPMorgan cut its rating on Sanofi to ""neutral"" from
""overweight"". Roche gained 0.5 percent as it filed its MabThera cancer
drug for approval in Europe as a first line biologic treatment
for rheumatoid arthritis. Peugeot fell 2.8 percent after Standard & Poor's said it may
cut its ratings on the carmaker into junk territory, saying weak
demand is likely to worsen the French company's financial
profile. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and

hit by data showing the number of U.S. workers filing new claims
for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 0.9 percent at 845.71 points. The index has rebounded
around 30 percent since it hit a lifetime low on March 9. Banks took the most points off the index. Standard Chartered

economic weakness would remain for a time and said it would keep
interest rates close to zero. ""The equities market had been a one-way bet but now there
are doubts about the recovery, given recent forecasts from the

Reserve reiterated concerns over the economic outlook. At 0900 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0.7 percent at 847.92 points, led lower
by pharma, chemical and energy stocks. Novartis  dropped 1.4 percent, Bayer  lost
1.6 percent and Total  fell 1.3 percent. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates near
zero and sounded a cautious note on the economy, despite some
hopes that the worst of the global economic downturn may soon be
over. The U.S. central bank, concluding a two-day meeting, said it
would hold overnight rates in a range between zero to 0.25
percent and gave no hint of an imminent exit from its easy
monetary policy. [ID:nN24163547] ""The Fed was cautious, but it's a good thing as it doesn't
fuel inflation expectations,"" said David Thebault, head of
quantitative sales trading, at Global Equities, in Paris. ""The weakness we've seen recently on the market has been
profit taking. We might move sideways during the summer, but
appetite for equities from institutional investors is definitely
rising and they could seriously start buying in the fall,"" he
said. French bank Credit Agricole  dropped 4.9 percent on
market talk that the lender's results could come in lower than
analysts' consensus, traders said. A Credit Agricole spokesman
declined to comment. ""Word is that the consensus is being readjusted to the
downside,"" a Paris-based trader said. Sanofi-Aventis  shed 3.5 percent, as dealers and
analysts cited concerns raised by some scientists that the
company's key blockbuster diabetes treatment Lantus might be
linked to cancer risk. There was also vague talk of a possible bid for AstraZeneca
, which was up 1.6 percent, although analysts were
sceptical. Officials at Sanofi declined immediate comment. On the upside, France's Bouygues  rose 4 percent
after Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy""
from ""neutral"". Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz  gained
1.1 percent after posting second-quarter profits above market
expectations. DSG International Plc  rose 1.1 percent after
Europe's second-largest electricals retailer posted a slightly
better-than-feared 78 percent slump in full-year profit. Porsche  surged 5 percent, propelled by renewed
speculation that the car maker was close to a deal with Qatar to
give the Gulf state a shareholding in Volkswagen, a move that
would clear the way for the two German car makers to merge. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index  was down 0.1
percent, Germany's DAX index  down 0.7 percent, and
France's CAC 40  down 0.5 percent. Since reaching a record low in early March, the FTSEurofirst

 (Adds spokesman's comments, details) AMSTERDAM, June 22 (Reuters) - Belgium's Solvay said on
Monday it missed out on a Dutch government contract to supply
the Netherlands with an H1N1 flu virus vaccine because it could
not supply the product within the required timeframe. Solvay shares extended losses after Solvay's announcement
and were down 3.8 percent at 57.93 euros at 1341 GMT,
underperforming a 3 percent decline in the DJ Stoxx chemical
index. The Dutch government said last week it had bought 34 million
vaccines from various vaccine makers, but did not identify which
companies. It added that it had agreed with suppliers the
vaccine had to be made available by the end of 2009. ""The Dutch government has placed its order with other
vaccine producers as Solvay cannot deliver pandemic vaccines in
the timeline asked by the Dutch government,"" Solvay spokesman
Erik De Leye said. But he added the option the Dutch government earlier placed
with Solvay for the supply of a pandemic vaccine remained valid.
 That option had been placed with Solvay prior to the World
Health Organisation declaring an influenza pandemic earlier this
month. Other leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis,
GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.There have been 105 people infected with the H1N1 virus in

 (Adds CFO comments, details) By Aaron Gray-Block AMSTERDAM, June 19 (Reuters) - Dutch biotech firm Crucell
 said on Friday it has lodged a tender to renew a UNICEF
contract for the supply of its paediatric vaccines, but will not
lodge a separate tender with Indian authorities. Crucell Chief Financial Officer Leon Kruimer told Reuters 
UNICEF expects the market for combined paediatric vaccines to
grow to about 140-150 million doses per year in coming years, up
from about 75 million in 2008 and he is confident the company
can maintain market share. Crucell, whose main rival for the UNICEF contracts is
GlaxoSmithKline, held a market share of about 50 percent last
year, but analysts have raised concerns about the fact contracts
with world health organisations end on Dec. 31 2009. ""We can't get to an 80 or 90 percent market share, but 50 or
60 percent is possible,"" he said. Kruimer added that Indian authorities had recently asked for
tenders to supply the Indian market and although Crucell would
be unable to lodge a tender within the required timeframe, the
Indian contracts would tie up capacity of the Indian suppliers. ""Whatever capacity there might be in India is focused on
India, so the market outside of India it is still for Glaxo and
us because nobody else will enter, apart from the Indian
companies,"" he said, adding that Indian rivals lack capacity. Crucell posted its first-ever full-year profit last year
based on continued growth in sales of its paediatric vaccine
Quinvaxem, which prevents five childhood illnesses. Kruimer added that Crucell, which produces flu, hepatitis
and typhoid fever vaccines, will not immediately produce a
vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus and will instead finish off
production of its seasonal flu vaccine first. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a flu pandemic
last week and Kruimer did not rule out the possibility of making
a pandemic vaccine either for the H1N1 strain or a new variant
if the WHO requested Crucell to help boost global supplies. ""If there is tremendous pressure on the industry to make it
and there will be if it's a real dangerous thing, they will need
all the capacity. Then we can help if we have excess capacity,""
Kruimer said, adding that Crucell would also need to buy the
antigen from its supplier. Crucell is a small player in worldwide flu vaccine
production in a market led by firms such as Sanofi-Aventis,
GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. Crucell had said at its first-quarter results that due to
the extra attention for the flu virus it expected sales of its
seasonal flu vaccines would be boosted this year, but Kruimer
said any boost would not be of material impact to its earnings. The company had previously been the target of a takeover bid
from U.S. drug maker Wyeth, but these talks were cancelled in
January after the acquisition of Wyeth by Pfizer. Kruimer reiterated that Crucell is not up for sale and added
that the company is focused instead on independent growth. It
also has potential takeover candidates. He did not say who the company was targeting, but added that
some of them are in Japan. Kruimer added, however, the Japanese
market is difficult to enter.

493,"Jun 17, 2009 11:17AM ET",Drug industry expects final EU probe report July 8,nan," * Preliminary report blasted firms for blocking generics * Industry hopes for some softening in final version By Ben Hirschler LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission looks
set to deliver its final verdict on competition, or lack of it,
in the pharmaceutical sector on July 8, the industry's trade
organisation said on Wednesday. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes blasted drugmakers
last November when preliminary results of her inquiry concluded
they were delaying or blocking the entry of cheaper generic
medicines. Thomas Cueni, who heads a European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations taskforce on the
issue, told Reuters he hoped for a reassessment in the latest
version but acknowledged a radical re-write was unlikely. ""The preliminary report was 420-odd pages ... it might be up
to 600 pages now. I would be surprised if it was totally
rewritten,"" he said. The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said
last year that delays in getting generics to market had cost
healthcare providers about 3 billion euros ($4.2 billion)
between 2000 and 2007. But drugmakers argue most of the delays were down to
regulatory and other bureaucratic issues, rather than deliberate
action by companies -- and Cueni is hoping there will be greater
recognition of this in the final version of the report. There could also be a couple of positive recommendations, he
added, such as backing for a common European patent, applicable
in all EU countries, and the introduction of a specialised
patent litigation system. Kroes kicked off her sector investigation in January 2008
with a series of raids on makers of brand-name drugs, including
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis. There were also raids on generic drugmakers suspected of
colluding to limit the entry of generics, sometimes in exchange
for payments from originator companies. The Commission's findings could open the door to action
against individual companies, with the potential for large fines
down the road.

on Tuesday morning with the leading index weighed on by
financials, and after the previous session's steep losses. At 0915 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.1 percent at 863.86 points, after having been up
as much as 0.3 percent earlier in the session. ""The questions is now whether the market correction will
continue,"" said Heino Ruland, market strategist at Ruland
Research in Germany, noting the heavy losses on Wall Street on
Monday and, to some extent, in Asia earlier on Tuesday. U.S. stocks fell on Monday after regional manufacturing data
dented optimism about the economy's health and resource shares
fell alongside commodity prices. Banks and insurers were the heaviest losers, with BNP
Paribas, UniCredit and Allianz down 2.1-3.6 percent. The European Central Bank had said on Monday that euro area
insurance companies may face ""significant"" balance sheet stress
ahead due to financial market turbulence and a weak economy. It also said euro zone banks faced potential further
writedowns of $283 billion through 2010. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.5 percent,
Germany's DAX index was flat and France's CAC 40 was up 0.2
percent.  PHARMAS GAIN, MACRO DATA EYED Pharma stocks added most points to the pan-European index,
and the DJ STOXX European health care index was up 0.8 percent. German Bayer rose 0.6 percent after its chief executive told
a newspaper that debt reduction and securing liquidity was
taking precedence over acquisitions during the economic crisis.
 Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline rose 2.3 percent and 1.8
percent respectively. Shares in Britain's biggest retailer Tesco rose 2.5 percent,
after the company reported its best quarterly sales rise in
Britain for two years. British consumer price inflation slowed less than
anticipated in May, staying above the Bank of England's 2
percent target. Investors will also look out for more macro data from the
United States later in the day, with U.S. building permits due

snapping a three-day winning streak, as softer commodity prices
weighed on energy and mining stocks, though demand for
pharmaceuticals offered support.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European companies closed
down 0.2 percent at 885.75 points, after hitting its highest
closing level in five months on Thursday. It has gained 1.5
percent this week.
Volumes on the pan-European index were about 75 percent of
its 90-day average daily volume. Oil producers were among the leading losers as crude prices
 slipped. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Repsol lost between
0.9 and 2.1 percent. Weaker metals prices hurt miners, with BHP Billiton,
Antofagasta, Vedanta Resources, Rio Tinto, Kazakhmys and
Fresnillo down 1.3 percent to 8.5 percent. Banks were mixed. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and
Lloyds Banking Group dropped between 0.7 and 4.1 percent. Societe Generale and BNP Paribas rose. Stephen Pope, chief global market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald, said the market could move higher as he expected
fund mangers who have mostly been sitting on their hands would
put their cash to use in coming months. ""Now that we have gone through the 200-day moving average
(on the chart) and we are holding on, and we are only few weeks
away from the end of the half year, there will be a lot of fund
managers thinking, 'My goodness, we are still in cash, and we
are not earning anything',"" Pope said. ""I do believe there is going to be this push of money that
comes in to start the beginning of the third quarter."" Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.5 percent,
Germany's DAX lost 0.7 percent and France's CAC-40 eased 0.3
percent. Data showed that euro zone industrial production shrank by
more than a fifth in April compared with a year earlier -- a new
record -- raising risks that second quarter GDP will be weaker
than expected. In the U.S., consumer confidence rose to a nine-month high
in June but failed again to surpass its level in September 2008,
when the spectacular failure of Lehman Brothers sent the world
economy into a tailspin, the Reuters/University of Michigan
Surveys of Consumers said.  EARNINGS OUTLOOK ""We believe that the 35 percent rise in European equities
since March 9 was a move to price out the 'fat tail' probability
of a 1930s/1990s Japan scenario,"" UBS said in a note. ""To move
higher from here, we think equity markets need to see a recovery
in earnings in 2010."" The broker forecast 15 percent growth in European corporate
earnings in 2010 after declining 25 percent this year. Drugmakers were in demand on Friday, lifted by news that the
World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic. Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca
were up 3 percent to 5.4 percent. Telecoms, another defensive sector, were also firmer.
Deutsche Telecom added 1.2 percent, Cable & Wireless advanced
1.3 percent, and Telefonica tacked on 0.5 percent. BT Group surged 4.1 percent after Banc of America-Merrill
Lynch upgraded its stance for the telecoms carrier to ""buy"" from
""neutral"" and raised its price target. Hedge fund firm Man Group soared 6.4 percent, lifted by
BlackRock's deal to buy Barclays Global Investors from Barclays
in a $13.5 billion deal. Traders said there was talk that Man Group could reduce its
18 percent holding in U.S. brokerage MF Global. The hedge fund
group declined to comment.

from an 11-month peak scaled in the previous session, with banks
slipping after British regulators set tougher-than-expected
terms on Lloyds'  exit from a government scheme. At 0908 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was 0.4 percent lower at 1,006.97 points. On
Thursday, it closed higher for the ninth session in 10 on
mounting hopes the global economy was on a recovery path. The index is up 21 percent this year and has jumped 56
percent since hitting a record low in early March. It has gained
18 percent this quarter and is on track to post the index's
strongest quarterly performance in almost a decade. ""As we enter the last trading session of the week, we see
markets taking a breather following the recent gains. Whilst it
is almost inevitable that there will be a pullback on some days,
it is the strength of the dips that will be in focus,"" said John
Murphy, analyst at ODL Securities. ""If we truly are in a bull run, investors will buy the dips.
If confidence is fragile, any dip could be perceived as the
start of the slump. Markets tend to overreact on both the long
and short side, so today could be a barometer for... confidence."" Banks , which have surged more than 170 percent since
March lows, were among top losers. Britain's Lloyds Banking Group  was down 0.6 percent
in line with the broader market trend. The bank said it was in
talks over scaling back its participation in a state-backed
scheme to insure it against credit losses, and was also weighing
up alternatives to the scheme. [ID:nLI109343] The news sent sterling to a four-month low against the euro,

498,"May 05, 2009 05:24PM ET",SCENARIOS-Make an H1N1 vaccine? Or not?,nan," By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, May 5 (Reuters) -  Health and Human Services
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Tuesday U.S. health
officials are working with vaccine makers to speed up
production of the seasonal flu vaccine and get ready to make a
H1N1 flu shot. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention agree it is too soon to decide whether to
go ahead with manufacture, but because making a flu vaccine is a
long process, work needs to start now. Vaccine makers germinate the virus in fertilized chicken
eggs in a process that can take four to six months. Here are some factors health officials will be considering
as they decide whether to make a swine flu vaccine: ONE VACCINE OR TWO: Vaccine experts say manufacturing of the seasonal flu vaccine
for the northern hemisphere is already under way and the best
approach will be to develop a separate vaccine for the H1N1 virus.
""If we make a vaccine, it will be two,"" said Dr. William Schaffner
of Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee and the
Infectious Diseases Society of America. Manufacturing of next season's flu vaccine is ""pretty much
finished,"" and manufacturers have not yet been given the green
light to make an H1N1 vaccine, Schaffner said. If they do, he said ""manufacturers could redirect their
entire manufacturing capacity to the new vaccine, which would,
we hope, become ready for use sometime in the fall. It would
become available in phases. We won't have it all available on
September 1."" WOULD THERE BE ENOUGH EGGS? One fear about making a new vaccine is that traditionally,
vaccine production capacity is limited by the number of available
eggs. But this may not be as much of a problem as once thought. ""The manufacturers have greatly increased their ability to
scale up egg production,"" said Dr. John Treanor of the University
of Rochester Medical Center, who tests flu vaccines in people. Vaccine maker Sanofi-Aventis says capacity should not be a
problem. ""We have enough eggs on a year-round schedule that we
have for our regular production and, because of the pandemic
threat, flocks that are in use year-round,"" said Rick Smith, a
vice president at the company's Sanofi Pasteur unit. ""We would probably be reaching the end of our routine
seasonal production anyway, and then those eggs would be
available for use in a swine flu vaccine."" Smith said it is too
early to speculate how many doses the company could make. IF THEY MAKE A VACCINE, WOULD THEY USE IT? The decision to make a vaccine and to use it are two very
different steps. Officials at the CDC and the WHO will be
closely monitoring how this new virus affects people in the
southern hemisphere, where flu season is just beginning. ""If this virus doesn't cause any mischief in the southern
hemisphere, or if it only produces mild disease, they might
well not deploy the vaccine,"" Schaffner said. He said it is possible that the new vaccine would need to
be given in two doses to be effective, and distributing that on
top of a seasonal flu shot would be a huge burden on the public
health system. It might not be worth that effort if the virus
only causes mild disease. ""Yes, we had to pay for it, but the juice is not worth the
squeeze,"" Schaffner said. HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD BE VACCINATED? ""There is much greater vaccine capacity than there was few
years ago, but there is not enough capacity to make vaccine for
the entire world's population for influenza,"" WHO's Keiji
Fukuda told a news briefing on Tuesday. One question is whether
adjuvants -- compounds that stimulate the immune system and help
make vaccines more effective -- will be added to make the vaccines
stretch farther. (Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Washington;

and government bonds and the low-yielding yen slipped as
forecast-beating earnings from European companies spurred share
buying ahead of key U.S. growth data. Germany's Siemens rose 5 percent after reporting strong
first-quarter figures, while Spain's Santander, the euro zone's
largest bank, gained nearly 5 percent after beating Q1
forecasts. French tyre maker Michelin rose 6.8 percent after it posted
first-quarter sales slightly higher than expected. Royal Dutch
Shell, Nordea and Sanofi-Aventis also posted
better-than-expected Q1 results.  Investors were eyeing first-quarter U.S. growth data and the
outcome of the Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central
bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent. ""The corporate news has been reasonably strong... which has
allowed us to get into positive territory,"" said Henk Potts,
market strategist at Barclays Wealth.
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.9 percent, edging towards
a three-month high hit last week, while the FTSEurofirst 300
index rose 0.8 percent. Emerging stocks rose more than 2 percent. ""People are starting to look beyond the worst and assuming
to some extent an economic recovery can be expected later on
this year,"" said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research. U.S. crude oil rose 1.4 percent to $50.63 a barrel. The June bund futures fell 40 ticks, as safety-seeking flows
waned. The yen fell 0.6 percent to 97.03 per dollar while the euro
rose 0.9 percent to $1.3254. The dollar fell 0.7 percent against a basket of major
currencies.  The Fed has left interest rates at a record low level since
December. After its meeting in March, the central bank announced
plans to pump an additional $1.15 trillion into the economy by
buying mortgage debt and long-dated U.S. Treasuries.

500,"Apr 28, 2009 06:56AM ET",UPDATE 1-Companies start initial work on pandemic vaccine,nan," * Genetic code of virus available, virus samples awaited * Production process will take months * WHO will only call for new vaccine if pandemic imminent * Making pandemic vaccine means sacrificing seasonal supply 
 (Adds comment from WHO spokesman, analysts) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Manufacturers have taken the
first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against a new
strain of flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and
threatens to become a pandemic. But the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it would only
call for large-scale production of such a pandemic vaccine if it
strongly believed the world was on the edge of an unstoppable
global outbreak of flu. Switzerland's Novartis AG said on Tuesday it had received
the genetic code of the new virus strain, enabling it to start
work on evaluating production, and it hoped to receive the
actual virus in its laboratories ""in the near future"". Still, it is likely to take between five and six months
before a  vaccine is commercially available, according to the
WHO. The delay is not for want of trying. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
already taken a sample of the H1N1 virus causing the disease,
produced a vaccine virus strain and is growing it up, marking
the first stage of the production process. These samples, which can then be distributed to companies,
must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs in a cumbersome
system that experts agree is outdated. New and more efficient
technologies based on cell cultures are, however, still a few
years away. While the race is on to prepare a pandemic vaccine, health
authorities and companies still have to make the tricky decision
of when, or indeed whether, to switch capacity from producing
seasonal vaccines to making the new shot. ""If you go to pandemic flu production, people won't get
normal flu shots -- it is a huge consideration,"" said WHO
spokesman Gregory Hartl. At least 20 companies, in addition to Novartis, make flu
vaccines, including Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Baxter
International, Australia's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune,
now part of AstraZeneca. They are currently geared to producing season flu shots,
which vaccine specialists say will not stop the new form of
swine flu spreading around the world, although people who have
been immunised may end up with milder symptoms. So-called swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 form of the
human influenza virus, but tests show the H1N1 component of the
current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new
strain. A big challenge facing manufacturers will be making
sufficient quantities of vaccine from a limited supply of active
ingredient, or antigen. One option to extend supply is to use an additive, known as
an adjuvant, to increase the body's immune response and reduce
the amount of antigen needed in each shot. Several companies are working on this approach. Glaxo, in
particular, said it believed its novel adjuvant technology could
make a significant contribution to antigen sparing. The British company previously developed a vaccine against
the H5N1 strain of bird flu -- originally thought to pose the
biggest pandemic threat -- using a special adjuvant that allowed
an extremely low dose of active ingredient to be used. Credit Suisse analysts said companies with the know-how to
make pandemic flu vaccines stood to benefit from additional
sales, adding there could also be an increase in seasonal flu
vaccine demand as disease awareness increases.

502,"Dec 18, 2008 07:40AM ET","Energy, bank stocks lead European shares lower",nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index falls 0.2 percent * Energy, banking stocks weigh * Defensive pharma stocks gain  By Christoph Steitz FRANKFURT, Dec 18 (Reuters) - European shares were slightly
down in choppy midday trade on Thursday with falls in blue chip
energy and bank stocks outweighing the rises in drugmakers. At 1157 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was down 0.2 percent at 827.10 points, having
traded between 823.20 and 833.02.  The index has fallen about 45 percent so far this year. Energy stocks led the fallers, taking the most points off
the index, as oil remained at less than $41 a barrel. BP, StatoilHydro, BG Group, and Royal Dutch Shell fell 1.2
percent to 3.6 percent. However, grim data about the euro economy appeared to be
already factored into the market. Germany's Ifo business climate index deteriorated sharply in
December, falling to 82.6 from 84.0 in November, the lowest
pan-German figure since reunification in 1990. ""It's not a new thing that little attention is being paid to
big European economic indicators,"" said Joerg Rahn, senior
economist at MM Warburg. ""The markets are already looking ahead, one step further and
special factors such as a year-end rally may play a role."" In the UK, British retail sales rose unexpectedly in
November, while public sector net borrowing rose to its highest
monthly total since records began, the Office for National
Statistics said. ""The bigger picture is fundamentally disastrous,"" said
Giuseppe-Guido Amato, investment analyst at Lang & Schwarz. ""But the sentiment of the market participants is bad enough
that I think we could very well see a rally based on hope."" ""What you need now is commodities and shares in companies
that have a good debt position.""  PHARMA UP Drugmakers added the most points to the index as investors
turned to the relative safety of defensive stocks. GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Sanofi-Aventis were up
between 1.5 percent and 3.3 percent. The DJ Stoxx European healthcare index has been the best
performer this year, falling 20 percent compared with a decline
of more than 60 percent for banks and miners as a credit crisis
shook investor confidence. Banks were lower with BNP Paribas retreating 7 percent after
it said it could not proceed with Fortis stake acquisition as
planned because of Brussels court decision.     HSBC fell 6.1
percent, investors worried about likely dividend cuts and
capital raising at the bank. Retail stocks were lower after French retail giant Carrefour
 fell 8 percent as it warned it expected sales growth of 6.5
percent in 2008 at constant exchange rates, down from a previous
target of about 7 percent. The DJ Stoxx European retail sector index was 1.1 percent
lower, with Metro and Marks & Spencer down 1.1 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.1 percent,
Germany's DAX was 0.9 percent higher and France's CAC 40 was
down 0.7 percent.
