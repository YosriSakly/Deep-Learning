1,"Jun 13, 2019 11:11AM ET",U.S. retailers' halting outlook reveals scale of tariff fear,nan,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Nivedita Balu(Reuters) - The first half of 2019 was expected to be a boon for U.S. retailers, buoyed by solid consumer sentiment at home and expansion in China - the market many of them have targeted for the future.Instead, new tariffs President Donald Trump slapped on some Chinese imports last month and fears that more could come in the escalating trade conflict between Washington and Beijing, had many investors bailing from the sector.The tensions have hovered as a potential risk for markets for more than two years. But what really unsettled investors in the latest round of earnings calls was retailers admitting that tariffs were starting to bite and how little they had to say on how they could soften the blow. Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) warned higher duties would put pressure on prices for U.S. consumers, while Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney Company Inc said their businesses would suffer if tariffs were extended to include apparel and footwear.Kohl's Corp said trade tensions were one of the reasons for a cut in its profit outlook and called the situation ""fluid."" ""We have been watching this tariff story play out,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research and a portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management. ""There doesn't seem to be in the immediate term (any sign) of things getting any better."" Many high-end brands have relied on China to boost sales and counter a slowdown in saturated developed markets and it is now by far the world's biggest market for luxury goods, fueled in particular by young shoppers.Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) has invested heavily, partnering with Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and WeChat to sell its products and targeting $500 million in revenue in China in five years. Asian sales have risen 18% in the past two years to over $1 billion. Capri Holdings' Michael Kors last year had Chinese actress Yang Mi visit their flagship store at Rockefeller Center in New York City for a fan meet-up event and PVH's Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Tapestry Inc's Coach have all hosted Chinese fashion shows and opened flagship stores in China.However, with China's economy growing last year at the slowest pace in nearly three decades and April data pointing to surprisingly weak retail sales, growth of the luxury market globally has slowed by around two percentage points to 6%-8% annually, according to Boston Consulting Group.CONSUMER SHIFT BACK TO MAINLAND CHINA Investors are on edge after any signs of a further downturn.Louis Vuitton owner LVMH's shares dropped more than 7% in October after it said sales growth in China fell from the high-teens to the mid-teens, dragging shares in Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA,  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) SCA and  Burberry  Group (LON:BRBY) PLC.Stocks have since recovered and some top brands have flagged a pick-up in mainland China, with Vuitton saying last week that demand for its handbags was still at ""unheard of"" levels. Spending by Chinese shoppers, however, is increasingly shifting from overseas shopping capitals like Paris or New York back home, encouraged by cuts in import tariffs and other measures by China's government to boost domestic spending. That trend has in turn dented sales at labels like jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) that are exposed to falls in spending by Chinese tourists to the United States. WHO CAN WITHSTAND THE TARIFF BLOW?Until early May, S&P 500 retail companies were outperforming the broad market, up 23% compared with 17.5% for the main index. Since Trump's May 5 tweet announcing tariffs would rise to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports, they trail by about 2% and the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF saw outflows of $162.4 million in May, Lipper flow estimates from Refinitiv show. Among the most exposed are firms who have poured much of the investment capital worked up in the good times into a near-future that they assumed would be largely Chinese. Shares of winter jacket maker Canada Goose fell 26% in one day after it reported the first slowing in sales growth in two years, undermining its plan to open three stores in China in the coming years on top of the six it has already.By contrast, analysts say  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart are among a few with the scale to force suppliers to absorb part of any tariff-driven rise in costs. Both have been working to trim China's role as their chief supplier by sourcing products elsewhere. ""Companies that are doing well and indicate they can mitigate tariffs are being rewarded while those that are missing are being doubly punished,"" said John Zolidis, president of New York-based investment advisor Quo Vadis Capital.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

2,"Jun 07, 2019 01:44PM ET",Hey big spender - how luxury brands are raising the stakes on Instagram,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Big-spending luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior are splashing out on everything from dance-fuelled fashion shows to teams of advisers as they target social media platforms in the hunt for young shoppers.Without the entry barriers of magazine advertising - where a one page glossy ad can cost tens of thousands of dollars - sites like Instagram, a fashionista favorite, have allowed unknown labels to find an audience with canny or eye-catching campaigns.But big bucks are changing the game as cash rich luxury goods groups like LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) hike their social media budgets, giving them vast means to drown out rivals on platforms once seen as a leveler for brands big and small.As the use of bloggers and influencers becomes mainstream, fees per sponsored post commanded by those with four million followers have reached well over 20,000 euros ($22,546), according to marketing experts.Less active than some smaller brands on networking platforms even five years ago, luxury's leading players are now leapfrogging the competition.Kering - owner of fast-growing Gucci, which scored the highest level of publicity impact on social media last year according to data trackers Tribe Dynamics - on Friday said that half its 2018 media budget was spent on digital advertising, up from 20 percent only three years earlier.""There's a big shift in how we're thinking about advertising and creating aspiration,"" Kering's digital chief Gregory Boutte told journalists on the sidelines of an investor day. ""Now with every type of social platform, you need different types of videos, of pictures. You don't create content on YouTube as you do on TV.""Kering does not reveal its total advertising expenditure. Its cross-town rival LVMH increased its total marketing spending at the fastest rate in seven years in 2018 to 5.6 billion euros ($6.3 billion), reaching 12% of group revenues - more than most brands that disclose this budget and topped only by another big online trendsetter, privately-owned Chanel. Louis Vuitton, LVMH's major sales driver, also now allocates half its marketing costs to digital media, the brand's CEO Michael Burke said at a closed-door briefing this week, according to Citi analysts.LVMH declined to comment. Vuitton, as well as LVMH's Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy labels were among Tribe Dynamics' top 10 brands last year, with Kering's Saint Laurent and Balenciaga also making the cut. The firm quantifies how much social media buzz is worth, including non-paid for content. EMBRACING THE NEWRewind three years, and Italy's Valentino, seven times smaller then than Vuitton, outflanked peers in the Instagram stakes, coming first in a listing by Engagement Labs which measured the most effective brands on social media. Valentino's formula was simple, mixing content generated by fans with its own professional photos, while answering online comments - a standard approach for labels now, but which helped fuel a sales spike at the Mayhoola-owned firm at the time. Valentino's Instagram followers have doubled to 12.4 million since, though revenue growth has slowed; Vuitton's followers have almost tripled to 32.1 million, and revenues are still expanding at a robust pace. Marketing investments are just one factor separating luxury brands riding high on demand from markets like China and those struggling to make a mark, with product designs and funkier store strategies playing a role too.And funds only go so far, with social media savvy also making a difference. Gucci co-designed a collection in 2016 with ""Guccighost"", a street artist who painted quirky versions of its logos around New York and posted them online, helping its social media credentials, Tribe Dynamics' co-founder Conor Begley said.""Gucci embraced those connections. Usually a brand would have sent attorneys after him,"" Begley said. ""That sends a message to other content creators who think 'Oh My God, maybe I'll get to work with Gucci' if I post about them"".BIG GROUPS, BIG MEANSAs digital investments rise, mid-sized luxury labels are now in an increasingly awkward spot as they try and stay visible. ""The ones that are suffering are those in the middle, of an average size, which are stuck between the small innovative pure digital players and the big groups with big means,"" said Michael Jais, CEO of Launchmetrics, which compiles digital data on the fashion industry. Italian shoemaker Tod's is among a clutch of brands in turnaround mode investing more in social media in a bid to revive sales - a strategy welcomed by analysts but which will likely keep weighing on its profit margins, some said.Analysts at HSBC, which have a ""reduce"" rating on Tod's, said in a note this week that it was losing ground and ""facing intense competitive pressure"" as LVMH and Kering pushed funds into online marketing. Just over 10% of social media influencers earned $100,000 or more a year in 2018, according to a Launchmetrics report, compared to 3.7% in 2017, though hiring the most popular bloggers is only one of the costs involved. ""The big groups understood they had to invest more in experiences - what happens around a catwalk show, exhibits, store openings,"" said Uche Pezard, CEO of Luxe Corp, which advises brands on strategy. ""That's what's expensive, not the technology. That's what's changed in the past five to eight years.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

3,"Jun 07, 2019 10:29AM ET",Exclusive: Italy to play low 2019 deficit card to avoid EU procedure,nan,"By Gavin Jones, Giuseppe Fonte and Angelo AmanteROME (Reuters) - Italian coalition officials say the country's public accounts are throwing up positive surprises this year, strengthening Rome's hand as it tries to ward off a possible European Union disciplinary procedure.Recent data suggest the deficit this year will not only be below the European Commission's forecast of 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), but could even be below the 2.04% agreed with Brussels in December, two senior coalition members said.However, it remains to be seen how far the anti-austerity government will actually slash its current 2.4% target, because some in the 5-Star Movement, one of the two ruling coalition parties, want the savings that are emerging to be quickly spent on new expansionary measures.The other ruling party, the League, is pushing for deep tax cuts, but only from 2020.It is also not certain that an unexpectedly low 2019 deficit would be enough to convince Brussels that Italy's finances are on a sustainable path. But the latest data at least give Rome fresh arguments - something that looked impossible a few months ago.The Commission on Wednesday paved the way to disciplinary steps against Italy, complaining that its debt had risen in 2018 instead of falling and would continue to do so. It said Rome had also not reined in its annual budget deficit as promised in 2018 and would continue to run excessive deficits this year and next.A disciplinary procedure, which could eventually end in fines, had already been averted at the last moment in December when Italy cut its original 2.4% deficit target for this year to 2.04%, with the agreement of the Commission.In April, Italy restored the original 2.4% target because of a slump in growth, while the Commission forecast 2.5%. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte surprised observers when he said on Wednesday, in response to the Commission, that a deficit of 2.1% was possible.But now, senior officials in the government of the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star say it could be even lower. Claudio Borghi, the League's economics chief, told Reuters 1.8% was possible if current trends continue. The main reason for the surprise trend is that two flagship government measures -- an early retirement option and a new means-tested welfare benefit -- are proving less popular, and therefore less costly, than expected.Taken together, it now looks as if the combined cost of the two policies will be 4 billion euros ($3.4 billion) less than was set aside in the 2019 budget, Borghi said.This estimate was confirmed by a government member closely involved in economic policy, who asked not to be named.TAX AMNESTIESBorghi said tax amnesties allowing people to settle disputes with the authorities by paying a limited sum had yielded more than expected, as had measures against tax evasion.Among these, the requirement from January this year that a copy of virtually all transactions must be transmitted electronically to the taxman produced squeals of protest from companies but has bolstered sales tax revenues.State coffers have also been swelled by out-of-court settlements with several large multinationals accused of tax evasion, the largest of them a 1.3 billion euro deal with  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the holding company of fashion house Gucci.A senior Treasury official declined to confirm Borghi's 1.8% 2019 deficit projection but said it now looked ""possible"" that the deficit would be 2% or lower.Public finance data so far this year has been encouraging. The central government deficit for the first four months was just 1.5 billion euros above last year's equivalent figure - below the trend projected in Rome's 2019 Stability Programme, which forecast that the full-year deficit would rise by 16 billion euros.Tax revenues through April were up 1.0% year-on-year despite a stagnant economy, compared with an official full-year target of 0.6% growth.In addition, dividend payments by the central bank and state-owned enterprises will also exceed the projections in the Stability Programme by more than 0.1% of GDP, the Treasury said in documents sent to Brussels this month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

4,"Jun 07, 2019 04:45AM ET",Gucci parent Kering moves to tighten grip on e-commerce,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) -  Kering  (PA:PRTP), owner of brands including Gucci, will tighten its grip on its e-commerce operations, focusing on its own branded sites to sell its luxury products or ventures where it can control its image and client data.After shifting into online shopping later than more accessible fashion labels, many luxury groups are now investing heavily in e-commerce while working on ways of retaining as much control of distribution and pricing as possible - two elements that help them maintain their aura of exclusivity. Kering had already said it would wrest back control of web operations for brands such as Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen which had been developed by Yoox Net-A-Porter (MI:YNAP) - an online retailer now fully owned by the group's rival Richemont.That joint venture with YNAP will take now end in the second quarter of next year, Kering's digital officer Gregory Boutte explained on the sidelines of a group investor day on Friday.Seeking to boost sales and margins, the company is also looking to turn more of its collaborations with third-party, multi-brand retailers such as Farfetch or Matchesfashion.com into what it calls online concessions, where it controls everything from the product assortment to their presentation. ""Each time we move from wholesale to a concession we see our top line increase in a material way,"" Boutte said.Kering was ""not against wholesale,"" and did not plan to end its relationships with third parties altogether, Boutte added.GROWING TEAMKering, whose rivals also investing in e-commerce including Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, did not disclose how much it was spending on expanding these operations. Its digital team has grown from four people in 2017 to over 80 people now. Boutte said Kering might be open to joining a blockchain technology platform which LVMH is developing to help track supplies chains and authenticate products in an industry that often has to grapple with counterfeit goods.Kering's total online sales - when including the business done through third party platforms, calculated at retail and not at lower wholesale prices - came to 9.4 percent of the group's 2018 revenue, it disclosed on Friday. Web sales through its own brand websites and online concessions made up 4.7 percent of revenue, it added. Across the luxury goods industry as a whole, e-commerce accounts for around 10 percent of business today and should reach 25 percent of sales by 2025, consultancy Bain estimates.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

5,"Jun 05, 2019 07:40AM ET",Trade Tremors Deepen Biggest Stock Dislocation in Generation,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Growth is so precious in stock markets these days that a millennial stock picker can hardly remember the last time investors were so enamored of it.In Europe as in the U.S., stocks promising high earnings and sales growth have hit a new record high relative to value stocks -- newly dubbed a “widowmaker” trade for their persistent losses -- in MSCI Inc. indexes going back to 1995.There are good reasons for investors to bid up so-called growth stocks. As fears build over an interminable U.S.-China trade war, a gauge of Europe’s inflation expectations has plummeted to an all-time low along with benchmark German bond yields, benefiting long-duration assets such as stocks holding the promise of earnings outperformance and killing cheaply valued sectors such as banks.For investors, it’s a tug of war between a desire to find the companies more insulated from an uncertain economic outlook on one hand -- and stretched positioning threatening a reversal on the other.“The market may be extrapolating some of those growth stories too far into the future,” said Ben Stapley, who oversees a growth fund at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in London. “The key is to avoid companies with high expectations of growth that then subsequently disappoint.”Growing speculation that worsening trade tensions will nudge the Federal Reserve toward rate cuts is only further deepening the value-growth divide.To add another lens on that gap: global stocks with high forecast sales expansion are now the priciest versus those with slower gains since the early 2000s, data compiled by JPMorgan Asset Management show.That spread mirrors the yield curve, which is inverting everywhere from the U.S. to Germany and Britain. Just as economic fears are driving fixed-income investors to snap up long-end bonds for safety, stock pickers are favoring shares that promise increased earnings far into the future, rather than those that swing along with the macro cycle.The extreme dislocations have befuddled strategists and investors alike, who are schooled in mean reversion. For some, the implication is that they need to be more selective with both growth and value.Stapley’s fund focuses on companies with growth that beats expectations, rather than just those expected to deliver sky-high expansion rates. So LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), rather than the online retailers, for instance, he said. Even within utilities and energy, sectors not traditionally associated with growth, he’s found attractive picks, such as Finland’s Neste Oyj and Verbund AG in Austria, which both tap into structural trends in renewable energy.Another dislocation has been underscored in recent days by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS): Europe’s luxury shares, favored for their faster earnings growth in recent years, are outperforming other quality stocks, despite the weakness elsewhere among Chinese proxies, suggesting a potential reversal, strategists led by Matthew Garman wrote in a note. It’s an odd divergence because luxury depends heavily on its Chinese fans.“European equity markets have been extremely bipolar,” the analysts said.Others haven’t given up on value so quickly. No pain, no gain, as they say.“With valuation spreads wider than at any point except for the few months after Lehman’s collapse, the upside potential is clearly there,”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA strategists led by Andrew Lapthorne wrote in a note.(Updates with Fed update in paragraph under first chart.)"
6,"Jun 03, 2019 02:10AM ET",Can a derivative turn Europe's green energy dream into virtual reality?,nan,"By Stephen Jewkes and Isla BinnieMILAN/MADRID (Reuters) - Italy's Ferrero is famous for its red-and-white Kinder chocolate eggs. But soon it may hope to be able to slap more green on the wrapper. The confectionery giant, which runs its own gas-fired power plant near its factory in northern Italy, is in early talks to help finance a new clean energy plant, possibly a solar farm in the sunnier south, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Like other companies in Europe, Ferrero is under growing pressure from investors and authorities to shift toward greener energy. But without enough wind or sunshine on its doorstep to provide a renewable alternative, it's looking to a new financial derivative known as a virtual power-purchase agreement.These complex contracts are effectively insurance policies for renewable project developers against the risk of falling power prices, with the premiums paid by companies like Ferrero to support sustainable energy even though they remain plugged into fossil fuels. Virtual PPAs are slowly beginning to gain traction in Europe, and other companies considering the option include French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), two separate industry sources told Reuters. Telecom Italia, Italy's No. 2 energy user, is discussing a possible PPA of up to 30 years, while Kering plans a deal involving funding a renewable plant in Italy, said the sources. Ferrero confirmed its interest in PPAs but said it was premature to make any decision, while Kering said it was looking at the idea. Telecom Italia also said it was interested and had been approached by energy companies. Many firms now fund schemes such as planting forests to offset emissions, but shareholders and authorities want companies to underwrite the direct addition of new renewable generation to grids.""Investors are increasingly calling on companies to go greener and offer 'additionality' to show they're serious about funding new clean projects,"" said Aldo Bonati, manager at Italian fund Etica Sgr which counts renewable group Erg and offshore wind developer Orsted among its investments.     Since PPAs do not require companies to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions, their direct contribution to tackling climate change may be limited. Nevertheless, advocates believe the instruments can help catalyze a broader shift to clean energy sources by financing projects. The European Union has urged states to boost green PPAs to help it meet a third of the bloc's energy demand from clean sources by 2030. Renewable energy accounted for 17.4 percent last year, little changed from 2016.  ""The big development in renewables in Europe in coming years to meet 2030 targets will mainly be through PPAs,"" says Antonio Cammisecra, head of green business at Europe's biggest utility, Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI). Graphic on renewable energy and CO2 emissions in EU: http://tmsnrt.rs/2XIzjC6 VIRTUAL CONSUMPTIONCompanies in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) struck PPA deals for clean energy projects with a total capacity of 2.3 gigawatts (GW) last year, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The level more than doubled from 1.1 GW in 2017. Big utilities like E.ON, RWE and Engie have all struck PPA deals to help finance renewable projects in Europe. To put the figures in perspective, 2 GW can power around one million households, but is still a fraction of the more than 500 GW of renewable energy capacity that was installed in Europe by the end of 2017. Europe still lags the United States, a more mature market where tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have used the instruments to bolster their green credentials. U.S. companies signed 8.5 GW of PPAs last year, almost triple the level of 2017 and more than 60 percent of global activity. The contracts are offered by middlemen, known as offtakers, often big energy trading companies like Switzerland's DXT and utilities like Enel. Under a typical PPA, an offtaker enters an agreement with a renewable developer, effectively guaranteeing it a fixed price for the electricity it produces. The offtaker will pay a refund if the price dips below the set rate. The offtaker in turn enters into a mirror agreement with a corporate customer. The company agrees to fix its own power costs at a set price for up to 10 years or more, but if those bills exceed the fixed price agreed in the PPA, the offtaker will refund the difference. The two agreements transfer the developer's main risk - that power prices will fall - to the offtaker, which in turn hedges its position by persuading a company to fix its power costs. In this way, the corporate customer ""virtually"" consumes the power from the renewable project. Without such an agreement, a new renewable project, exposed to the ups and down of the wholesale power market and unable to count on generous subsidy schemes that once held sway across Europe, could struggle to raise bank finance. RISKS VS REWARDSThere are, of course, inherent risks. For corporate customers, locking in large supplies of power for years can guard against rising prices, but can prove unfavorable if markets move lower. The converse is true for developers, who can lose out on income should prices rise. Other potential turnoffs include the sheer complexity of contracts and the legal complications in the event one link in the chain becomes insolvent and unable to maintain commitments.In the United States, energy group PG&E Corp is looking to rescind costly PPAs as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization.The fact PPAs have made a much slower start in Europe means there are fewer precedents than in the United States, which makes companies even more wary of committing to deals. As a result, only a few long-term PPAs - usually measured as more than 10 years - have been sold on the continent, many to companies with experience of the U.S. market. They include German carmaker Mercedes-Benz and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE). But some European companies are ready to take on risk. ""In Europe there is no liquid long-term forward market for power beyond 2-3 years so without price signals there is the risk of booking a loss,"" said Antonio Gozzi, head of steel group Duferco, which last month signed Italy's first corporate PPA deal for wind power.""But you have to offset that with the marketing advantages."" SUNNY SPAINSpain is emerging as a hot spot for PPAs, although deals are often structured differently with the middleman trading the renewable energy produced to various customers. Greenpeace has signed a deal to power its Madrid offices from a wind turbine in Barcelona. Under that agreement, accounted for as an advance payment, the provider gives a guarantee every hour for the origin of the electricity, meaning when the turbine stops for maintenance, Greenpeace knows it is paying for power from another renewable source.Spanish renewable energy producer Acciona is talking to some Spanish companies about virtual PPAs but discussions are primarily with U.S.-based multinationals, said Eduardo Sola, Acciona's director of global origination. ""Spain's potential is it has big solar and wind resources which allow us to be competitive in a virtual contract with the rest of Europe,"" he added. Enel, which counts Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Facebook among its PPA clients in the United States, recently signed a wind PPA with Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) and is talking to other EU corporates who are already clients. ""It's not an easy walk,"" said Enel CEO Francesco Starace. ""But in a few years PPAs will become common practice in Europe.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Whenever we see something improving we can't just say 'Oh OK let's relax, the momentum's going to go that way'. It won't continue to go that way, we have to continue to change the industry for ourselves.""Chinese actress Gong Li, the star of ""Farewell My Concubine"", was awarded a prize for her career at the event.At Cannes, four women are contending for this year's top Palme D'Or film prize, including Franco-Senegalese Mati Diop and France's Celine Sciamma, out of 21 entries - or just under 20 percent of the total. Elsewhere, the proportion has sometimes been higher, with over 40 percent of the films competing at Berlin's festival in February made by women. ""We hear a lot about how times are changing and improving, and it's true. The idea is to support that trend. (But) the figures still don't look good,"" said Delphyne Besse, a film sales specialist and one of the founders of 50/50 by 2020, the collective behind the gender parity pledge signed by Cannes.Of the 47 film festivals that have so far backed the drive globally, 38 percent have female heads, according to the lobby group's figures.SHORT SHRIFTIndustry insiders said the slow progress was reflected in everything from the short shrift female directors still got in the media to their under-representation at industry events.""Women have been making films for 11 decades now,"" British actress and star of zombie movie ""The Dead Don't Die"" Tilda Swinton told a news conference earlier this week. ""There are countless films by women. The question is why don't we know about them,"" she said, adding that even obituaries for female filmmakers tended to be dwarfed by those dedicated to men. Cannes' organizers have said they were not planning to introduce quotas dictating the gender balance of the films selected to compete at the festival.""Cannes is only at the end of the chain. This needs to start with encouragement at film schools,"" festival director Thierry Fremaux said last week.The cinema showcase is looking to include more women its board, however, and the festival jury this year was more balanced.""Atlantics"" director Diop said festivals were still a logical starting point to highlight women's work in the industry. ""It starts with the films, there is no festival without films, so it is an extraordinary exhibition that will give the films much bigger exposure,"" she told Reuters in an interview.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Overall guidance for the coming year was unchanged, disappointing investors hoping for a quick fix from Tisci’s new looks.While sales in the previous year were in line with expectations, the outlook suggests earnings before interest and taxes will decrease by a low single-digit percentage, Morgan Stanley analyst Elena Mariani said in a note.Tisci has helped put Burberry back in the fashion spotlight as new CEO Marco Gobbetti seeks to reinvigorate growth. While the company said his designs have drawn an encouraging reaction from consumers, it’s too early to measure commercial success as most products didn’t arrive in stores until February.Sales of runway fashions are up by double-digit percentage since then, Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said on a call. But that represents only about 10% to 15% of the product lineup, the company said.Burberry moved to appease investors who’ve stuck out the wait as the brand seeks a turnaround, announcing a share buyback of 150 million pounds ($193 million) even after net debt rose during the year.While China delivered low-single-digit percentage sales growth in the latest year, the company said consumers are shifting spending to the mainland as the country’s consumers buy more fashion items at home rather than elsewhere in Asia. Other luxury brands, led by  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA’s Gucci, are seeing double-digit gains from China.Worldwide comparable retail sales in the year ended March 30 rose 2%, roughly in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

15,"May 13, 2019 09:50AM ET",Here Are the European Stocks Most Exposed to U.S.-China Tensions,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war between the U.S. and China is raging once more and certain segments of the European stock market are feeling the pain.The spat has riled a number of sectors in Europe, particularly cyclical names in the manufacturing and mining subgroups. Automakers have taken another hit as U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up threats and markets worry the talks could be headed towards a stalemate. The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index has tumbled 12% since its peak in April.Exporters are also being hit by the euro rallying against the yuan, lessening the appeal of goods made by European companies for Chinese importers.Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the sectors which have a significant exposure to the Chinese market and could find themselves suffering should trade tensions continue to rise.Miners and SteelmakersChina is comfortably the most important market for metals demand globally, meaning that miners are very sensitive to tensions in trade with the country. For example, Kaz Minerals Plc gets 66% of sales from the Asian nation. Jitters in China can impact significantly on copper, iron ore and steel prices.Luxury GoodsWealthy Chinese consumers are a key end-market for luxury firms like  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Cie Financiere Richemont SA. The latter gets about a quarter of its revenue from China. The latest trading updates from the sector have indicated demand for their expensive handbags and watches has held up in the country so far, defying concerns that Chinese buyers were starting to rein in spending.CarsVehicle demand in China has been slumping, hit not only by the trade tensions with the U.S. but also a slowing domestic economy. Potential car buyers in the country are also awaiting possible government incentives to revive the market. European and U.S. car companies have become more reliant on the Chinese market as demand in Europe and North America wanes.SemiconductorsChina is an essential part of the supply chain for companies that make the chips that go into smartphones and cars, among other products. Semiconductor manufacturers also derive a large portion of their revenue from the Chinese market, so are often very sensitive to trade angst. Infineon Technologies AG, Europe’s largest chipmaker, makes 40% of its revenue in the country.ChemicalsChemicals companies also sell a huge amount of products to Chinese customers. BASF SE’s boss has predicted China will represent half of all chemicals industry sales by 2030. These firms also supply products to other cyclical sectors like car makers, so any impact on those sectors can hit the industry. It’s the same story for industrial equipment suppliers and, more broadly, European industrial names.PharmaceuticalsCompanies including U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc and Danish insulin manufacturer  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) A/S are increasingly eyeing the Chinese market. Their ambitions, however, have faced a speed bump from a local plan to start bulk buying drugs. But China remains a key growth market for the pharmaceutical industry. AstraZeneca already gets 18% of its revenue there, while Novo Nordisk gets about 10%.TestingTesting and inspection companies such as Intertek Group (LON:ITRK) Plc work on making sure goods that flow into the global market are safe and compliant with regulations. Broker Jefferies said in February that it estimates about 5% of Intertek’s revenue is from products imported into the U.S. from China which will be directly caught up in the tariffs.Below are a few other individual names and the percentage of revenue they make from the Chinese market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

The settlement, first reported by Reuters last month, is the highest ever agreed by a company with Italian tax authorities.Kering, which had denied avoiding tax, has a cash pile estimated by analysts at more than 10 billion euros, meaning it was equipped to absorb the cost.The company said under the settlement it would face an additional tax charge of 600 million euros in its 2019 financial accounts. ""The settlement will involve the payment of 897 million euros in additional taxes, along with further payment for penalties and interest,"" Kering said, adding that the total came to 1.25 billion euros. The allegations centered on Gucci, which Italian tax authorities accused of evading taxes on more than 1 billion euros in revenues over several years. Gucci offices in Milan and Florence were raided by Italian police in late 2017.Gucci revenues were booked through Kering's Swiss-based subsidiary Luxury Goods International and Italian prosecutors argued that tax should therefore have been paid in Italy, not Switzerland.Kering said in its statement that it acknowledged prosecutors' claim that Gucci had a ""permanent establishment"" in Italy during the 2011-2017 period under scrutiny.Gucci is Kering's star brand and drives most of its profits after a flamboyant remake under designer Alessandro Michele.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The tax authority could not immediately be reached for comment.Earlier this year, Kering said it faced a claim for 1.4 billion euros in unpaid Italian taxes, adding it contested the preliminary findings.The group has consistently denied avoiding tax, saying its activities were fully compliant with all tax obligations.The company's Swiss-based Luxury Goods International (LGI) subsidiary has been under investigation for allegedly avoiding tax on earnings generated elsewhere.Most of the allegations centre on Gucci, whose offices in Milan and Florence were raided by Italian police in late 2017.In November, Milan prosecutors wrapped up their probe into alleged tax evasion of more than 1 billion euros by Gucci for revenues booked in the years between 2010 and 2016. The prosecutors say that revenues booked through LGI should be taxed in Italy and not in Switzerland. By agreeing to a settlement, Kering would be spared from having to pay interest and sanctions for late tax payments, which one source said would have added around 500 million euros to the final bill.Gucci's Chief Executive Marco Bizzarri and former CEO Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation in the case.That investigation is expected to conclude with a separate settlement once the agreement on the tax dispute has been signed, one of the sources added. Lawyers for Bizzarri and Di Marco declined to comment.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.01 percent by 0940 GMT, retreating from an eight-month high and set to snap a six-day winning streak ahead of the Easter holiday. Losses in bank-heavy Milan and Madrid indexes led declines, while Germany's DAX edged higher.The yield on the German 10-year bund fell further after flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data unexpectedly fell to 51.3, a downturn led again by the bloc's manufacturing industry.The data came on the heels of the German government lowering its forecast for 2019 economic growth on Wednesday, which was overshadowed by better-than-expected economic data out of China. ""We ... have confirmation that we are in a bit of a weak spot in Europe, if you look at the services sector and the composite PMI, and this is the reason why you're seeing stock markets in Europe soften,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at CityIndex.""But I think the PMI data is the wrong data at the right time. We are coming to the end of a very short week,"" Odeluga added.Also due are retail sales data and flash PMIs from the United States.Bank stocks fell 0.7 percent, their steepest loss in three weeks.Shares in Osram were among the biggest percentage losers on the STOXX 600 after a German magazine reported that private equity groups Bain and Carlyle were losing confidence in their bid for the lighting group.SIGNS OF SLOWDOWN Kering  (PA:PRTP) dropped 3.6 percent and weighed heavily on France's CAC 40 after signs of a slowdown at the French fashion company's Gucci brand, particularly in the United States.Top gainer in Germany's DAX was  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn), after the Federal Network Agency cleared the way for the postal company to significantly increase the cost of sending letters after the company pledged to hire an extra 5,000 delivery workers.Not all earnings were disappointing.

24,"Apr 17, 2019 02:05PM ET","As Notre-Dame money rolls in, some eyebrows raised over rush of funds",nan,"By Luke Baker and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Pledged donations from French billionaires, companies and ordinary citizens for the restoration of fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral are approaching 900 million euros after just two days, a reflection of the landmark's resonance in the national psyche.But the outpouring has prompted questions from charities, politicians and commentators about why some of the business donors have offered so much so quickly, including speculation about how they might benefit from tax breaks on the donations. People on social media, both in France and abroad, have expressed frustration that other disasters - from the Syrian and Iraq refugee crisis to the Grenfell Tower fire in London - have not received anything like the same degree of support.The first major donation to Notre-Dame came from Francois-Henri Pinault, the billionaire head of luxury goods group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) that owns fashion brands Gucci and Saint Laurent. Pinault, 56, a celebrity figure in part because he is married to actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100 million euros ($113 million) as the blaze was still raging - a decision dictated by emotion, a spokeswoman for his family's holding company said.Hours later, his great rival Bernard Arnault, France's richest man and the head of Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, announced he was donating 200 million euros, moved by the alarming pictures on TV, according to a group spokesman. The Bettencourt-Meyer family, the largest shareholder in L'Oreal, followed suit a while later, pledging a combined 200 million euros alongside the global cosmetics group.Brand and reputation experts said the quick response by some of France's most recognizable corporate titans made sense, especially since the disaster involves a national symbol.Adrian Palmer, the head of the marketing and reputation faculty at the Henley Business School, said all three billionaire families and their companies were closely aligned with the nation, and benefit from reinforcing the link.""These brands stand for France and they sell around the world, so anything that puts the France brand at the center of people's minds is going to help them and how they are regarded,"" he said. ""It creates positive associations in people's minds, that they are generous, caring and good.""Online, LVMH's announcement of the donations was met with a host of comments on Twitter, from France and abroad, suggesting the money might be better spent in Africa or combating climate change than rebuilding a cathedral. Others suggested the generosity was little more than smart marketing.Palmer said that even from a non-marketing point of view, early offers of support could be beneficial for a company's political positioning. All three firms are broadly supportive of President Emmanuel Macron and want to be seen as helpful with backing for his calls to rebuild.""Macron has been facing protests,"" he said, referring to the ""yellow vests"" street demonstrations against the high cost of living that have rocked France for months. ""In a sense the disaster at Notre-Dame has become a unifying issue, so they want to show they are aligned.""TAX BREAKSStill, there has been blowback. Charitable donations benefit from a 60 percent tax deduction in France, which prompted immediate suggestions by critics that Pinault, Arnault and the others were being less magnanimous than initially appeared.""It's the public that will end up bearing the cost,"" said Gilles Carrez, a member of parliament for the center-right Les Republicains party, who sits on the finance committee.The Pinault family, which was at odds with Macron last year on issues of tax and the president's policies toward the poor, said in a statement on Wednesday it was renouncing any tax advantage it might get from its donation.LVMH - which had benefited from large tax breaks to build the Louis Vuitton Foundation in western Paris - dismissed the notion it was merely trying to boost its image. ""The only thing at issue here is to try and raise as much funding as possible to address this urgent issue, and that goes beyond any tax or accounting calculations,"" the LVMH group spokesman said in response to questions from Reuters. The Bettencourt-Meyer family has declined to comment on its donations.All three companies and the families behind them are already closely associated with the arts and cultural giving in France, which makes their rapid collective offer of half a billion euros to support a 12th-century Gothic masterpiece less surprising. ""No doubt big brands want to genuinely demonstrate their empathy and show support to the re-building of an artifact that is not just a building but a cultural symbol,"" said Keith Glanfield, a professor at Aston Business School.""By some this may be seen as no more than a cynical attempt to sell more product.""FROM THE GUTOn Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and in the auditorium of the European Parliament, the question was less about whether they and others should give, and more about why such generosity was going toward an old building hit by a disaster in which no one died.""We are very attached to where Father Pierre's funeral was held,"" said the Abbe Pierre Foundation, a homelessness charity named after a priest whose 2007 funeral at Notre-Dame was attended by then-President Jacques Chirac.""But we are equally committed to his cause. If you could contribute even one percent of the amount to the homeless, we would be moved,"" it said on Twitter.Speaking to European lawmakers on Tuesday, teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said she did not want to diminish the Notre-Dame fire, but wished there was an equal outpouring of support to combat issues such as climate change.Markus Renner, a professor of brand management in Switzerland and the founder of the International Brand and Reputation Community, said he was surprised to see Pinault, Arnault and the Bettencourts give so much so quickly.""Why not wait and find out how much is needed and then step forward?"" he said, pointing out that the billionaires and companies could have given the money silently, but chose not to.""It seems to be a little bit tactical and very much from the gut,"" he said, adding he doubted whether German companies would step up so promptly if Cologne cathedral burnt down.If the fire ends up being covered by insurance, the charitable donations may not end up being needed to finance the restoration.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Apr 16, 2019 05:56PM ET",Notre-Dame's famed rose window spared but blaze harms priceless artworks,nan,"By Sarah White and Elizabeth PineauPARIS (Reuters) - Four-hundred-year-old paintings hung high inside Notre-Dame were damaged by the immense fire that engulfed the Paris cathedral, but emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm's way.Notre-Dame's famed stained-glass rose windows and most of its many religious relics appeared to have escaped the worst of Monday's inferno as well, easing fears for the fate of the vast trove of artworks in the 800-year-old gothic cathedral.Among the most cherished articles to make it out unscathed was the ""Sainte Couronne"" (holy crown), made of braided reed brought to France from Constantinople in the 12th century. Though lacking its original thorns, the crown has been revered as an object of Christian worship for centuries. Gold, silver and gem-inlaid chalices, candelabras and many other artefacts survived the blaze thanks to quick-thinking firefighters, police and city employees who formed a human chain to move revered artefacts away from the flames.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted a picture of heavy-set candlesticks stacked in the safety of nearby Paris City Hall. Art specialists were still poring over the extent of the damage to Notre-Dame's 13th-century South Rose Window, measuring 10 meters across (33 feet), and other stained-glass masterpieces still standing after the cathedral's wood-beamed roof collapsed.""It seems they have not been destroyed for now, although we'll have to see what real state they're in, and whether they can be restored properly,"" said Maxime Cumunel, secretary general of France's Observatory for Religious Heritage. ""We have avoided a complete disaster. But some five to 10 percent of the artwork has probably been destroyed, we have to face up to that,"" Cumunel said. Four of the largest-scale 17th and 18th century paintings depicting scenes from the lives of the apostles had been damaged, at least in part, he added. Culture Minister Franck Riester said the paintings were mainly affected by smoke damage, rather than by flames. The artworks, which were dampened during the 15-hour battle to douse the blaze, will be removed from Friday and transferred to the Louvre museum, where other objects will also be kept, for attempts at restoration, he added. DAMAGE ""MAKES ME QUAKE""It remained unclear how well the cathedral's towering master organ, embedded into a sculpted wooden casing, had fared, as rescuers remained on high alert for the possibility that some of Notre-Dame's fragile vaults might come crashing down. The organ - which survived the French Revolution in the late 18th century, when it was used for recitals of patriotic songs - may have been slightly damaged too, according to Cumunel, though city hall officials said it was largely intact. ""What's happened is really disturbing and makes me quake,"" said Veronique Proust, a specialist guide who has led tours of the cathedral and its treasury for a quarter century. ""For 25 years I've shown these treasures, the exceptional quality of the stone carvings, now I've got nothing to show anymore.""Most of the sacramental artefacts in Notre-Dame's treasury - where they were traditionally kept as reserves to be sold off or melted down in times of need - date from the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not immediately clear how much Notre-Dame's treasures were worth, with Riester only pointing to the many ""years and hundreds of millions"" of euros of investment that would be required to restore the cathedral. A combined 460 million euros ($520 million) has already been pledged for reconstruction and restoration efforts, led by a 100 million euro donation from Francois-Henri Pinault, billionaire boss of Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), and 200 million euros from his rival Bernard Arnault, head of luxury group LVMH.Oil company Total promised 100 million and Paris City Hall a further 50 million. State-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots said it would donate oak timber from the forests it owns to help rebuild the framework under the cathedral roof, which went up in flames. Other relics that made it out of the wreckage included a tunic worn by Saint Louis, a 13th-century king of France, while the cathedral's 13-tonne bell, its largest, which rings sonorously on special occasions like Easter, was spared. Sixteen bronze statues that adorned Notre-Dame's collapsed spire - itself a 19th-century restoration - were airlifted out just days before the fire as part of ongoing renovations. A gold cross stood eerily intact above the altar on Tuesday, surrounded by debris - the first images from inside the cathedral that reached the wider world.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

26,"Apr 16, 2019 05:55PM ET",Insurers expect France to bear Notre-Dame rebuilding cost,nan,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Paul Arnold(Reuters) - Major European insurers expect France to bear the bulk of the cost of rebuilding the Notre-Dame Cathedral after a fire tore through the eight-centuries-old Paris landmark on Monday.The cost of a likely multi-year restoration project could itself take a year to become clear, industry experts said.""It is really going to be up to the French state and benefactors to help to restore and rebuild this,"" Robert Read, head of art and private client at Lloyd's of London insurer Hiscox told Reuters, adding it could take up to 20 years to restore the cathedral.""The scaffolding costs are going to be enormous, actually securing the building is going to be enormous. The cost of renovating the (British) Parliament is a similar sort of number,"" Read said. The cost of repairs and upgrades to the neo-Gothic fronted parliament building on the banks of the River Thames has been estimated at up to $8 billion. French President Emmanuel Macron has said France would launch a fundraising campaign to rebuild Notre-Dame, which ranks among the finest examples of French Gothic cathedral architecture.Several of France's business elite have already pledged money to help, including a 200 million euros ($226 million)donation from Bernard Arnault and 100 million from Francois Pinault, heads of luxury goods groups LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) respectively.""Rebuilding would be very tricky as some of the craft required to rebuild, the stone-masonry craft would probably have to be relearnt,"" Hiscox's Read said.Reinsurer Swiss Re said works of art in buildings such as the cathedral are generally not insured because they are often priceless. Any art works on loan from third parties would, however, be insured, Read added. While some of the large paintings at Notre-Dame could not be taken down in time, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said at the scene of the fire that a number of the many artworks in the cathedral had been rescued and were being put in safe storage.Notre-Dame was in the midst of renovations and industry sources said the contractor would have its own liability policy. ""Typically that would be for tens of millions of euros. But effectively that is going to be a drop in the ocean compared to what the actual cost of restoring the cathedral is,"" Read said. ""If they are deemed to be liable they would be carrying some cover, but it's not unlimited and it's definitely not going to be enough to rebuild the Cathedral.""(This story has been refiled to fix incorrect reference to ""stone-masonry"" craft in paragraph eight.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

President Emmanuel Macron declared that the cathedral would be rebuilt. Industrialists pledged hundreds of millions of euros. Ordinary people sang, wept and prayed below the cathedral that has towered above the capital for more than 800 years.More than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the gothic masterpiece. They worked through the night, finally quelling the blaze some 14 hours after it began.""Yesterday we thought the whole cathedral would collapse. Yet this morning she is still standing, valiant, despite everything,"" said Sister Marie Aimee, a nun who had hurried to a nearby church to pray as the flames spread.""It is a sign of hope."" From the outside, the imposing bell towers and outer walls, with their vast buttresses, stood firm, though the insides and the upper structure had been eviscerated.Paris public prosecutor Remy Heitz said there was no obvious indication the fire was arson. Fifty people were working on what would be a long and complex investigation, officials said. One firefighter was injured but no one else was hurt, with the fire starting at around 6.30 p.m. after the building was closed to the public for the evening.(Graphic: Map and timeline - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DgHcXP)Firefighters examined the facade, with its spectacular 10-metre filigreed stained-glass rose window still intact. They could be seen walking atop the belfries as police kept the area in lockdown. Investigators will not be able to enter the cathedral's blackened nave until experts are satisfied its walls withstood the heat and the building is structurally sound.The fire swiftly ripped through the cathedral's oak roof supports, where workmen had been carrying out extensive renovations to the spire's timber-framed supports. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into ""involuntary destruction by fire"". Police on Tuesday began questioning the workers involved in the restoration, the prosecutor's office said.Hundreds of stunned onlookers had lined the banks of the river Seine late into the night, reciting prayers and singing as they stood in vigil while the fire raged.It was at Notre-Dame that Henry VI of England was crowned ""King of France"" in 1431, that Napoleon was made emperor in 1804, and Pope Pius X beatified Joan of Arc in 1909. Presidents Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterrand were mourned there.Messages of condolence flooded in from around the world.Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, was praying for those affected, the Vatican said, adding: ""Notre-Dame will always remain - and we have seen this in these hours - a place where believers and non-believers can come together in the most dramatic moments of French history.""Britain's Queen Elizabeth expressed deep sadness while her son and heir Prince Charles said he was ""utterly heartbroken"". Chancellor Angela Merkel offered German help to rebuild a part of ""our common European heritage"".VOW TO REBUILDConsidered among the finest examples of European Gothic architecture, Notre-Dame is visited by more than 13 million people a year. It sits on an island in the Seine, overlooking the Left Bank hangouts of Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso.""Notre-Dame de Paris is the cathedral of the people, of the people of Paris, of the French people, of the people of the world. It is part of those references of our history, of what we have in common, of what we share,"" said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.The cathedral is owned by the state and has been at the center of a years-long row between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should finance restoration work to collapsed balustrades, crumbling gargoyles and cracked facades.Within 24 hours, companies and local authorities had pledged more than 700 million euros to rebuild it, including 500 million from the three billionaire families that own France's giant luxury goods empires:  Kering  (PA:PRTP), LVMH and L'Oreal. [L5N21Y4AG]It was too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the heritage charity Fondation du Patrimoine.Paolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace at which the fire spread through the cathedral had been stunning.

29,"Apr 15, 2019 10:18PM ET",Fire guts Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris; Macron pledges to rebuild,nan,"By Sybille de La Hamaide and Julie CarriatPARIS (Reuters) - A massive fire consumed Notre-Dame Cathedral on Monday, gutting the roof of the Paris landmark and stunning France and the world, though firefighters saved the main bell towers and outer walls from collapse before bringing the blaze under control. Flames that began in the early evening burst rapidly through the roof of the eight-centuries-old cathedral and engulfed the spire, which toppled, quickly followed by the entire roof. The fire, after burning for about 8 hours, was largely extinguished by 0300 CET on Tuesday. Earlier, in addition to battling to prevent one of the main bell towers from collapsing, firefighters tried to rescue religious relics and priceless artwork. One firefighter was seriously injured - the only reported casualty.""The worst has been avoided,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters at the scene shortly before midnight.Macron said France would launch a campaign to rebuild the cathedral, which is considered to be among the finest examples of French Gothic cathedral architecture, including fundraising efforts and by appealing to ""talents"" from overseas to contribute. ""We will rebuild it together. It will undoubtedly be part of French destiny and our project for the years to come,"" a visibly moved Macron said.The cathedral's main stone structure had escaped complete destruction by the time the fire came under control. ""We will continue to watch over any residual pockets of fire and cool down the areas that are still red-hot, like the wooden beam framework,"" a fire brigade spokesman said in the early hours of Tuesday. Distraught Parisians and stunned tourists gazed in disbelief as the inferno raged at the cathedral, which sits on the Ile de la Cite, an island in the River Seine and marks the very center of Paris. Thousands of onlookers lined bridges over the Seine and along its embankments, held at a distance by a police cordon. Some sang liturgical music in harmonies late into the night as they stood vigil, while others recited prayers. ""A SYMBOL OF FRANCE""World leaders expressed shock and sent condolences to the French people. A huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area. People watching gasped as the spire folded over onto itself and fell into the inferno.Firefighters battled smoke and falling drops of molten lead as they tried to rescue some of Notre-Dame's treasures. A centuries-old crown of thorns made from reeds and gold and the tunic worn by Saint Louis, a 13th century king of France, were saved, Notre-Dame's top administrative cleric, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, said. But firefighters struggled to take down some of the large paintings in time, he said. The Paris prosecutor's office said it had launched an inquiry into the fire. Several police sources said they were working on the assumption for now that the fire was accidental.Macron canceled an address to the nation that he had been due to give on Monday evening in a bid to answer a wave of street protests that has rocked his presidency. Instead he went to the scene of the blaze with his wife, Brigitte, and some of his ministers. He thanked and congratulated firefighters. The French Civil Security service, possibly responding to U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that firefighters ""act quickly"" and employ flying water tankers, said that was not an option as it might destroy the entire building.German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the cathedral a ""symbol of France and our European culture."" British Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the French people and emergency services fighting the ""terrible blaze.""The Vatican said the fire at the ""symbol of Christianity in France and in the world"" had caused shock and sadness and said it was praying for the firefighters.ART WORKS RESCUEDThe mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said at the scene that some of many artworks that were in the cathedral had been rescued and were being put in safe storage. The cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, features in Victor Hugo's classic novel ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame."" It is a UNESCO World Heritage site that attracts millions of tourists every year.It is a focal point for French Roman Catholics who like Christians around the world are celebrating Holy Week, marking the death and resurrection of Jesus. ""I have a lot of friends who live abroad and every time they come I tell them to go to Notre-Dame,"" said witness Samantha Silva, with tears in her eyes. ""I've visited it so many times, but it will never be the same. It's a real symbol of Paris."" The fire at Notre-Dame has already prompted fundraising appeals in the United States, while in France the billionaire chief executive of  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the luxury group behind brands like Gucci, was quoted in a statement to AFP as saying he would pledge 100 million euros ($113 million) to rebuilding efforts.The cathedral, which was built over a century starting in 1163, was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding, and bronze statues had been removed last week for works.Notre-Dame is renowned for its rib vaulting, flying buttresses and stunning stained glass windows, as well as its many carved stone gargoyles.Its 100-metre-long (330-foot) roof, of which a large section was consumed in the first hour of the blaze, was one of the oldest such structures in Paris, according to the cathedral’s website.A center of Roman Catholic faith, over the centuries Notre-Dame has also been a target of political upheaval.It was ransacked by rioting Protestant Huguenots in the 16th century, pillaged during the French Revolution of the 1790s and left in a state of semi-neglect. Hugo’s 1831 work led to revived interest in the cathedral and a major – partly botched – restoration that began in 1844. The wood-and-lead spire was built during that restoration, according to the cathedral's website.""I asked our Lord - but why?"" Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, the top administrative cleric at Notre-Dame, said at the scene. ""It's terrible to see our cathedral damaged like this.""

31,"Apr 11, 2019 04:02AM ET",StockBeat - Luxury Goods Shine After Another Big Quarter for LVMH,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s been a tough 12 months for most sectors in Europe’s stock market. Exporters of capital goods have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, banks and financial services hobbled by negative interest rates, consumer stocks struggling to escape the shackles of low wage growth and demographic decline.But one sector has been a relatively constant bright light, and it’s leading the way again this Thursday. Luxury goods makers are roaring ahead after another strong quarter for LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French drinks-to-fashion group.LVMH announced after the bell on Wednesday that its revenue grew 16% on the year in the first quarter and said the positive trends that had helped it to a record year in 2018 were still in place. Most remarkably, in a world economy that is supposedly suffering a synchronized slowdown, the group said that “all geographic regions are experiencing good growth.”The news has sent the stock up 3.1% on a day when most indexes are down, due in part to frustration at the prospect of another six months of uncertainty over Brexit.  As of 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was at 385.12, down 1.56 points or 0.4%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while the German DAX was down 0.4%. The Paris CAC 40 was outperforming, down less than 0.1%, thanks mainly to its luxury names.As has often been the case, LVMH’s performance is supporting the rest of the sector. Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and scarf-maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) were close behind it at the top of the CAC 40, while Italian rivals Salvatore Ferragamo  (MI:SFER) and Moncler (MI:MONC) were also both among the best performers in Milan.The results have distracted attention away from one less pleasant piece of news that may come back to haunt the sector in due course. French police raided the premises of some of the country’s drinks makers on Wednesday on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a drinks maker that doesn’t have the same exposure to fashion as the other stocks in the sector, is the notable laggard this morning, rising only 0.3%."

And as the Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank merger plans show, it's not like there is an abundance of other bright ideas out there for saving a sector riddled with zombies.At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.32 points, or 0.4% at 378.60. It’s now up 12.0% for the year, while the Euro Stoxx banks sectoral index is up only 2.7%, the worst performing of all the major sectors.Germany’s Dax was up 0.4%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.7%, sauced by another dip in sterling after Wednesday's inconclusive Brexit votes.Of course, Europe’s banking problems don’t end with the ECB.  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) is among the worst performing bank in Europe this morning, down 3.8% as three major shareholders withhold their support from CEO Birgitte Bonnesen over a widening money-laundering scandal. According to the Financial Times, U.S. authorities are now investigating the bank for whether it lied to them about the extent of its involvement in money-laundering documented by the so-called ‘Panama Papers’ leak.Elsewhere, German chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN) is down another 1.4% after a U.S. jury said it must pay $80 million to a man for causing his cancer with its weedkiller Roundup. The company faces over 10,000 similar cases but continues to dispute the science behind the ruling. Fiat  Chrysler  (MI:FCHA) is down 1.0% as takeover speculation cools after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) reportedly ruled out any form of combination with it.On the bright side,  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) are higher after a tobacco sector upgrade from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), according to Bloomberg, while luxury names such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) continue to attract bids, being seen as relatively immune to an economic slowdown."

The TV talk show star, who has repeatedly quashed speculation she could run for president, is supporting McCartney's campaign to protect trees in the endangered Leuser Ecosystem, a forest in Indonesia. Her appearance at the runway show, held in Paris' sumptuous Opera Garnier, left even the British designer starstruck. ""Oprah Winfrey is just mindblowing, she gives me goose bumps ... A couple of days ago, she texted me to say she was in Paris and coming to the show. My blood drained from my body,"" McCartney told Reuters after the show. The designer - who is buying back full control of her eponymous brand from French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) - is well-known as a pioneer in using recycled or sustainable fabrics and in shunning animal fur in an industry that is increasingly following that lead. The autumn/winter 2019-2020 collection, described in show notes ""as a contrast of strength and softness"", featured dresses made of old T-shirts that were stripped and knotted together. Coats in autumn colors came with oversized shoulders, while models also flaunted flowing dresses in bottle-green, pink or yellow hues. Others wore burgundy-brown faux-fur coats and were tattooed for the occasion with statements such as ""There is no planet B"" and ""Earth day every day"". McCartney's style also privileges comfort and practical looks, such as a khaki jumpsuit cynched at the waist and worn by teen supermodel Kaia Gerber. Others sported clunky, reliable rain shoes. Until March 5th, Paris hosts the last part of the month-long series of fashion weeks which began in New York before moving to London and Milan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That may still be true, but what is also true that when China gets off its sick bed, Europe’s stock markets go for a run.After a brief setback on Thursday morning in the wake of the U.S.-North Korea summit breakdown, European markets are again racing higher, taking their cue from Asian markets.The Stoxx 600 was up 0.7% at 375.46 by 04:20 AM ET (0920 GMT). Germany's Dax led the way, rising 1.2%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 lagged, rising only 0.6%.Asian markets had rallied on two things overnight: first, MSCI announced it would give a much greater weighting to China’s mainland shares in future, triggering a sharp rally in that market; second, the Caixin manufacturing survey showed a surprising uptick in February, further raising hopes that the global economy is bottoming out after the slowdown at the end of last year.Add stronger-than-expected retail sales out of Germany this morning, a slight upward revision to the Eurozone purchasing managers index for February and a much steeper-than-expected fall in joblessness in Germany, and a very broad-based rally this morning becomes easier to understand.However, it also weakens the case for action by the European Central Bank at its policy meeting next week. Normally, that would be a negative for stocks, but as former IMF economist Ashoka Mody argued in a recent blog post, the Eurozone economy now appears to react less to ECB policy than it does to developments in global trade.The fact that the narrower Stoxx 50 index is being led this morning by luxury goods groups  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) and a bunch of trade-sensitive auto stocks seems to support Mody’s argument.Among the other individual stocks standing out are U.K. fund manager Jupiter (LON:JUP), which is up 10% after accelerating a changeover of its top management and publishing full-year figures that were less awful than expected. The stock has been one of the most shorted in the London market, and was thus vulnerable to short-covering. Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa), meanwhile, is trailing the market, rising only 0.3% after news that Dutch prosecutors are preparing to charge it over allegations of bribery in Nigeria."

Italy's Pirelli and Germany's Continental were among the top gainers in their domestic markets and on the STOXX 600.London indices underperformed their euro-zone peers amid caution ahead of a parliamentary address by British Prime Minister Theresa May later in the day as she struggles to secure a Brexit deal.Highlighting the headwinds that threaten the rally in global equities so far this year,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it was shifting to a 'neutral' stance on global equities, taking profit on its 'overweight' view.""While we continue to expect overall attractive total returns from global equities this year, we recognize certain mounting short-term risks,"" it said.""In particular, we note that investors remain thin-skinned after last December's correction.""Furthermore, the U.S.-China trade conflict could lead to renewed volatility, while growing political tensions in Italy, France and Germany and the still uncertain Brexit outcome could weigh further on European stocks, it said.Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) shares turned positive in midmorning trade as investors took comfort from upbeat comments about the Q1 outlook.Shares had fallen as much as 3.3 percent in early deals as the better-than-expected sales failed to impress investors, a sign of the demanding expectations for luxury brand earnings following solid numbers from the sector, including LVMH last week.Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) shares fell 2 percent after its mixed report.

Its shares, which lost over 30% in 2018, rose over 10%, also pulling rivals Continental (DE:CONG) and Pirelli (MI:PIRC) higher.The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index was up 2.1% by 04:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), while the benchmark Stoxx 50 was up 0.7% at 3,189.15.Tiremakers, like most automotive stocks, have been seen by some analysts as oversold after a relentless stream of bad news last year, most of it related to the U.S.-China trade war.The news continues to be largely negative – Nissan slashed its profit forecast by nearly 20% this morning for the fiscal year ending in March, and there is no sign of a breakthrough yet in the trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Beijing. But the reaction to the Michelin numbers suggest that, for now at least, more than enough bad news has been priced in already.Elsewhere, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) more than met expectations for the fourth quarter, but its shares added only 0.6% after rallying 14% already this year on the back of strong earnings from its peers in the luxury sector.While all the noise around luxury groups has been mainly about Chinese demand holding up well, it was the U.S. which gave Kering the biggest kick to sales last year: revenues from North America rose 37.8%, while those in Asia-Pacific rose ‘only’ 33.8%."

French Cosmetics giant L'Oreal said strong demand for luxury skin creams helped it beat fourth-quarter sales forecasts - another company reporting better-than-feared demand from China after LVMH last week.Its shares rose 1.2 percent in early deals before giving back gains to trade up just 0.4 percent. Traders put the move down to profit-taking after a strong run - L'Oreal hit a record high on Feb 5. Luxury handbag maker Hermes topped the CAC 40 with a 1.5-percent gain after it also said sales momentum in its Chinese stores stayed strong. Luxury rivals  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH also rose 0.6 percent each.Swedish electronics group Dometic shone, topping the STOXX with a 16-percent jump after reporting fourth-quarter profit rose and giving a positive outlook for 2019 sales growth.On the flipside, Belgian chemicals and cobalt refiner Umicore fell 4.7 percent after saying it expected 2019 growth to be hit by subdued demand in cars and consumer electronics, and R&D costs.Construction was a weak spot with Denmark's Rockwool sinking 13 percent after full-year earnings missed expectations, and Sweden's Skanska losing 7.8 percent after it cut its dividend and lagged profit estimates.Autos fell 0.8 percent, extending losses from Thursday when the sector suffered its biggest one-day drop since the Brexit vote aftermath in June 2016.Tata Motors warned Jaguar Land Rover would swing to a loss due to weak sales, and that latest negative news on car demand weighed on auto suppliers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Faurecia, down 2.6 to 3 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told the Wall Street Journal that spending by Chinese customers either in China or on trips abroad grew by double digits for most of its major brands in the quarter, and that there had been no visible slowdown at the end of the year. LVMH shares were up 6.9% by 04.55 AM ET (09.55 GMT), and the results also pulled rivals Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) up to the top of the French CAC 40 index.

Britain's FTSE 100 jumped 0.9 percent thanks to a weaker pound boosting London-listed multinational exporters.LVMH shares jumped 6.5 percent after upbeat results from the luxury conglomerate, which said it is ""cautiously"" confident as fourth-quarter sales held up despite fears of a China slowdown.Hermes, Richemont, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Moncler and Burberry were among the top boosts to the STOXX 600, rising 1.8 to 3.8 percent.Even Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo, which reported a drop in sales, climbed 2.7 percent as the LVMH beat lifted the luxury sector.Industrial conglomerate Siemens fell 1.2 percent after reporting weaker-than-expected industrial profit for its first quarter due to profits at its power business plunging.Shares in French IT consulting firm Atos surged 10 percent to top the STOXX 600 index. The company said it would distribute 23.4 percent of shares in its subsidiary Worldline to shareholders. Atos peer Alten also gained 6.1 percent after it reported full-year revenue rose in 2018.Meanwhile pharma giant Novartis was the biggest drag on the STOXX, down 2.5 percent after analysts said its 2019 earnings growth guidance was disappointing.Swiss drug ingredients maker Lonza tumbled 6.9 percent after it said Chief Executive Richard Ridinger was retiring and reported sales below expectations.Dutch telecoms firm KPN was another loser after results, falling 3.8 percent after it reported earnings that missed estimates and guided to lower cash flow for this year, and its shares are set to fall 2 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The STOXX 600 was down 0.4% at 356.48 at 06:05 AM ET (11:05 GMT).Vale's biggest rivals,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) outperformed local markets in the U.K. Monday on speculation they would profit from higher prices if Vale's production plans are disrupted.The world’s largest iron ore producer, Vale is the operator of a tailings dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais that burst last week, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds more missing. Over the weekend, Standard & Poor's put its credit rating on review for a downgrade, while the Brazilian authorities froze $3 billion of its assets to cover potential penalties.Vale’s ADRs in New York lost 8.1% on Friday and are set to open down another 7.5% on Monday.Earlier, there was more gloom about the state of the global economy after research institute Ifo reported Germany’s exporters have sharply cut their expectations for 2019. It said the key auto, chemicals and engineering sectors were all downbeat about their prospects. Bayer (DE:BAYGN) fell 1.2%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, were down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.Luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) were also among the biggest losers in Europe on nervousness for Chinese demand ahead of key trade talks between the Chinese and U.S. governments on Wednesday. Gucci owner Kering was also suffering after weekend reports that it faces a $1.6 billion tax bill in Italy."

Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares (F:AAPL) fell 7.9 percent after the tech giant cut its sales forecast, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been hit by a trade war with the U.S.Germany's DAX (GDAXI), highly sensitive to Chinese growth, fell 0.9 percent.Chipmakers that supply parts to Apple were the worst hit.

Oil had been the last sector holding onto gains in Europe, and all the STOXX 600 sector indices are now in the red (with falls of 26 percent for autos and banks) or flat on the year.Shaunak Mazumder, a senior fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said a combination of worries about the U.S.-China trade row and the Brexit vote was weighing on the market. ""The market is lacking proper conviction. If the U.S.-China issue blows over, that could give support to the market. But it's difficult to call,"" he added. Shares in BASF (DE:BASFn) fell 4.7 percent after the German chemicals firm slashed its forecast for 2018 profits on Friday.It said the decline was mainly due to its chemicals business, while low water levels on the Rhine and weak automotive demand especially in China were also to blame. BASF peer Symrise (DE:SY1G) also tumbled 3.1 percent, Sika (S:SIKA) fell 5.1 percent and  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) lost 5 percent, helping to drag the pan-European chemicals index (SX4P) down 2.5 percent and making it the worst-performing sector.Construction and materials stocks (SXOP), also highly sensitive to economic growth, fell 1.5 percent, while autos stocks (SXAP) declined 1.3 percent as trade tensions took their toll. Unless U.S.-China trade talks wrap up successfully by March 1, new tariffs will be imposed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday, clarifying there is a ""hard deadline"".Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) fell 2.9 to 5.1 percent as investors ditched the tech sector.Outside of trade, politics drove some of the biggest moves. French retail, hotel, and transport stocks tumbled anew after a fourth weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests which are disrupting the economy.LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among the biggest drags on the STOXX. But France's CAC 40 (FCHI) overall did not underperform European peers, down just 0.6 percent. Shares in British energy utilities  Centrica  (L:CNA) and SSE (L:SSE) fell around 3 percent as investors held their breath ahead of a crucial vote on Brexit on Tuesday. Traders said a Sunday Telegraph report flagging a risk Centrica may struggle to pay its dividend was also hurting sentiment. British housebuilders Berkeley Group (L:BKGH),  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) fell 1.5 to 2.5 percent as nerves built and Peel Hunt cut its ratings.Outside large-cap moves, shares in  Interserve  (L:IRV) plunged as much as 71 percent, last trading down 51 percent, after the embattled British outsourcer said it was in talks with debtholders and considering converting debt to equity.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.8 percent, set for its strongest day in eight months. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a truce at the G20 meeting on Saturday, halting additional tariffs and agreeing to fresh talks aimed at reaching an agreement within 90 days.Although markets reacted positively, some investors and analysts said there remained much for the two to agree upon. ""While President Trump described the bilateral meeting with China as ""amazing and productive"", we believe the rivalry between the U.S. and China will not be easily overcome, especially over the issue of intellectual property and market access,"" said UBS Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele in a note.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said the announcement strengthened their view that ""Trump is likely to want to conclude an agreement - even if it does not include a full rollback of tariffs - well ahead of the 2020 presidential election"".Financials were the biggest driver of European shares as China-exposed bank HSBC (L:HSBA) rose and investors cheered the prospect of a end to a trade war which has dented growth.Mining stocks (SXPP) led the gains and were up 5.1 percent on the news which gives China, the world's biggest metals consumer, more wiggle room in the next few months. Antofagasta  (L:ANTO),  Anglo American  (L:AAL), and  Glencore  (L:GLEN) were up 6.2 to 8.6 percent.Car stocks (SXAP), which have been battered by fears of rising tariffs, jumped 4.2 percent after Trump said China agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars.German carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) climbed 4.8 to 6.2 percent, while tire maker Continental (DE:CONG) gained 4.1 percent and  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) rose 6.9 percent.Tech stocks (SX8P) jumped 3.1 percent with chipmakers the best-performing. Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and AMS (S:AMS) gained 5.8 to 6.7 percent. Overall analysts have cut their 2019 earnings growth expectations for world stocks over the past month as concern grew that a trade war would compound the impact of a slowing global economy. The oil sector (SXEP) also jumped 2.7 percent as crude soared ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting, expected to result in a supply cut.Luxury stocks highly sensitive to China were also among top gainers, with heavyweight conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH) up 5.9 percent and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) rising 6.1 percent.Away from the trade war relief, shares in French supermarkets  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), underperformed after riots in Paris on Saturday.Carrefour was down 1.1 percent and Casino was up just 0.5 percent, while France's main CAC 40 rose 2 percent.Argenx (BR:ARGX) topped the STOXX with an 11.3 percent gain after the Netherlands-based biopharma company said it signed a deal worth potentially up to $1.6 billion with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) affiliate Cilag to develop its Cusatuxumab drug in certain types of cancer.Graphic: global earnings growth expectations dec 3 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Q9fNPZ  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

66,"Nov 30, 2018 09:15AM ET","Gucci to add sparkle with high-end jewels, Kering's Pinault says",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci, the Italian fashion label driving revenue growth at French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP), will branch into high end jewelry with a collection in June or July, Kering boss Francois-Henri Pinault said in a newspaper interview on Friday. Jewelry has been one of the best performing corners of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the 18 billion euro global market were set to progress 7 percent this year. That puts growth on a par with footwear, and above high-margin categories like handbags where fashion groups such as Gucci tend to make most of their money. Most labels produce earrings and other accessories but high-end jewelry is a more rarefied world, occupied by the likes of Switzerland's Chopard, or Boucheron, a label owned by Kering into which it is also plowing resources. ""The two hundred pieces, with many colored gemstones, will be made in Italy,"" Kering's Chairman and CEO Pinault said in an interview with France's Le Figaro. Kering confirmed the launch at Gucci but did not immediately provide further details. Gucci has been one of the fastest growing luxury brands in recent years, thanks to a flamboyant makeover under designer Alessandro Michele. That has raised questions over how long its boom can last, and the brand has already been beefing up new lines in homeware and beauty products. Overall revenue at Kering reached 3.4 billion euros ($3.90 billion) in the third quarter, up a better-than-expected 27.5 percent on a comparable basis thanks largely to the thriving sales at Gucci. Pinault also said in the interview that Kering aimed to use ethically-sourced gold for all its jewels in two years' time, up from 70 percent now.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the most sensitive to China due to its big exporters, fell 0.6 percent. The DAX was set for its fourth straight month of losses - its longest losing streak since 2008. The pan-European STOXX was set for its second straight month of losses as November, and a disappointing earnings season, draw to a close.Investors' hopes of a partial recovery in stock markets in December - known as a ""Santa rally"" - hang on the leaders' discussions resulting in a truce or de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.""There are only two people in the world that can deliver a Santa rally, Trump and Xi, and I don't see that happening,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Garnry saw a 60 to 65 percent chance of the Trump-Xi talks resulting in ""no deal"".China reported its weakest factory growth in more than two years on Friday, reigniting fears about growth ahead of crucial trade talks.""The weak data out of China is increasingly a little bit of a surprise. Most investors would have anticipated that at least some of that stimulus six months ago would have had an impact, but this really tells us how big the headwinds are,"" said Garnry.Autos stocks (SXAP) were the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent, on the data and anxiety over tariffs.German car bosses are finalizing plans to visit the White House next week to discuss trade policy, German and U.S. officials said.Car parts makers were among the worst-performing stocks, with Hella (DE:HLE),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), and tire maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) down 2.4 to 4.9 percent. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) dragged the DAX down with a 2.7 percent fall, while peers BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent. ""The problem with Europe is that... quite a lot of our industrial supply chain and capital goods manufacturers have at least some exposure to the autos sector, so you can't get away from it,"" said Ian Ormiston, European smaller companies fund manager at Merian Global Investors. HSBC analysts downgraded both Faurecia and Daimler to ""reduce"" from ""hold"", saying a re-rating for the sector next year is ""hard to imagine"". Tariff fears have led analysts to slash their earnings growth forecasts for the sector.Mining stocks (SXPP) fell 1.1 percent, hit by growth fears over China, the world's top metals consumer.Among the biggest drags on the STOXX were also luxury goods conglomerates  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), down 1.8 percent each. Luxury stocks have been especially sensitive to slowing growth in China, high-end brands' biggest market. In single-stock moves Altice (AS:ATCA) shares surged 9.4 percent after the telecoms and cable firm announced its French unit had agreed to sell a 49.99 percent stake in its fiber optic business.Zalando (DE:ZALG) fell 4.2 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its price target on the stock, saying it has become more skeptical about the long-term potential for margins at the online retailer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

68,"Nov 30, 2018 02:23AM ET",Chinese sneeze could give Europe Inc. a nasty flu,nan,"By Julien Ponthus, Helen Reid and Danilo MasoniLONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - With sluggish growth translating into the most disappointing earnings in years, European stocks are set for a tough ride if a full blown Sino-U.S. trade war erupts following Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping's G20 dinner on Saturday.The ongoing tariff dispute has already made the Chinese economy sneeze and given a cold to some of Europe Inc's most iconic powerhouses due to their heavy exposure to the world's second biggest economy. This drag is set to continue even if Trump and Xi's meeting ends cordially. If relations between the economic superpowers deteriorate further, the impact on many of Europe's top firms could be profound.Upmarket German car makers like BMW (DE:BMWG) or French luxury houses such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) have already been tagged as collateral victims of the Trump administration's trade policy after sharp falls in their share prices this year. With about six percent or roughly 80 billion euros of its constituents' revenues originating from China, Germany's DAX (GDAXi) is typically used as a proxy to bet on a trade war and is lagging, with a 12.5 percent fall year-to-date, the less exposed pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark.BMW will make 18 percent of its revenue in 2018 from the world's second-largest economy, while Volkswagen's share stands at 14 percent, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Even if Germany, whose bilateral trade with China hit a record 188 billion euros last year, is a key concern, worries among investors are widespread. A study conducted for Reuters by business insights platform AlphaSense shows a threefold increase in the number of times a China slowdown was mentioned during European earnings conference calls between July and September this year.While just 16 companies in the MSCI Europe index mentioned China in the context of a slowdown between April and June, that number climbed to 49 companies, in earnings calls during the following quarter. The mention of China, in any form or way, jumped from 361 to 540 during the same period.For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2QLBKAN.(GRAPHIC: European companies increasingly cite China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QLBO3v) If some of the underperformance of European bourses in comparison to Wall Street can be partially explained by the Trump's administration tax cuts, many analysts believe the key lies elsewhere. ""Europe is very much exposed, being very cyclical, it's an open economy and its stock markets already reflect that"", explained Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).""European markets are quite vulnerable to a slowdown in emerging markets, not less given the domestic dynamic which is polluted by the political problems in Italy or Brexit,"" he added referring to Britain leaving the European Union and the Italian government's tug-of-war with Brussels over its budget.An escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war would force Dutch asset manager NN Investments to reassess its view that European stocks are due for a comeback in 2019. ""It's the biggest threat,"" said Valentijn van Niewenhuisen, head of multi-asset at the firm. Acknowledging slowing growth, the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for China and since then indicators from automobile sales to e-commerce trends and production data are suggesting the world's second biggest economy is cooling somewhat.With creeping corporate and household debts, China is believed to have little room for maneuver for fiscal stimulus if it doesn't want to weaken its currency, which the Trump administration believes gives it an unfair trading advantage.Data compiled by Morgan Stanley shows how European miners are not the only ones dependent on the appetite of material hungry China.

""It would appear that the reverse threat is now in place in the Personal Luxury Goods sector with fears of a sharp slowdown in China threatening to contaminate the entire sector starting in 2019.""Other companies under threat are the big German industrial powerhouses such as  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) or BASF (DE:BASFn).""We're concerned about what's embedded in German industrials' share prices. They embed continued profitability in China that's very strong and continued growth and we're skeptical that's sustainable,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn, director at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners, where he helps manage $30 billion.But the reliance on the Chinese market isn't only worrying investors. A new strategy paper from Germany's influential BDI industry federation calls on firms to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market. While their presence there was once seen as a strength, it is now unsettling German politicians and industry as Beijing asserts control over the economy under President Xi Jinping.This weekend's G20 meeting between the leaders of the world's top two economies will be key for market sentiment, which has been battered by the months-long trade spat.But investors aren't betting on an end to the dispute any time soon.""Ultimately it's hard to see China will be able or willing to offer enough to meet U.S. demands so things could get worse,"" said Royal London senior economist Melanie Baker.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Gucci Chief Executive Marco Bizzarri and former CEO Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation in the case, the source added.

70,"Nov 26, 2018 01:22PM ET",Kering takes e-commerce in-house in online luxury battle,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) -  Kering  (PA:PRTP) said on Monday it would develop its own online shopping sites by 2020, ending an outsourcing joint-venture for brands like Balenciaga, showing how major luxury companies are speeding up e-commerce plans. After a slow start shifting sales onto the web, wary that it would dilute their brands' image, high-end fashion and jewelry labels are rapidly building up their own tech teams. Kering said it would end a joint venture with Yoox Net-A-Porter (MI:YNAP) dating back to 2013, depriving the online retailer, which also helps third party brands develop their sites, of one of its big name clients. The French company did not detail how much it would spend on developing its own on-line sites.Kering brands will still sell clothing and other items through platforms like Net-A-Porter.But YNAP, which Richemont took control of earlier this year, had set up and managed e-commerce operations for seven Kering brands, including Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta, with the notable exception of Gucci which the French luxury group set up itself. Kering's decision to take more online activities in-house shows how industry players with financial muscle are deciding to build their own digital operations, giving them full access to information such as client data.Kering's larger rival LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, last year launched its own multi-brand website known as 24 Sevres and has developed websites for its labels in-house. The Kering/YNAP joint venture included an option for the French group to buy, and for YNAP to sell its stake after seven years. This meant a break-up was always a possibility, but the Richemont takeover has called into question whether more brands might exit their YNAP partnerships. ""We believe that an increasing number of luxury brands may also end their flagship partnerships with YNAP,"" analysts at Berenberg said in a note. For now, YNAP will still manage online stores for over 20 clients, from Italy's independent Armani to puffer jacket maker Moncler, in a business that made up 10 percent of its 2.1 billion euros ($2.39 billion) revenues in 2017. ""This is a natural evolution for a large group with the scale of Kering,"" YNAP said in emailed comments, adding that its e-commerce management business continues to thrive and included new services like designing mobile phone apps. Richemont, also the owner of Cartier, declined to comment. Brands are still exploring partnerships with third parties in specific areas or regions. Kering also said on Monday it was working with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). on applications for use by sales assistants to scan inventories. Rivals like France's Chanel and Britain's Burberry have partnered with Farfetch on similar services. Some Kering brands also work with JD.com and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in China.Kering's online sales made up 6 percent of its 6.4 billion euro turnover in the first half of 2018, and grew by 80 percent in the third quarter, faster than revenue growth in department stores or its own shops.

Chinese buyers account for more than a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, and are increasingly shopping at home rather than on overseas trips. Users slammed the video campaign in which a Chinese woman struggles to eat pizza and pasta with chopsticks while the narrator offers eating lessons in a patronizing tone.The blunder was compounded when screenshots were circulated online of a private Instagram conversation, in which designer Stefano Gabbana makes a reference to ""China Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia"" and uses the smiling poo emoji to describe the country. The company said Gabbana's account had been hacked.In a video apology on Friday, Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce said they had ""reflected seriously"" and were saddened by the impact of their words.""In the face of our cultural misunderstanding, we hope that we can earn your forgiveness,"" Dolce, speaking in Italian, said in the video of the two designers seated side-by-side. The 85-second video with Chinese subtitles was posted on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. Gabbana also asked for forgiveness and offered a formal apology to Chinese people around the world. The designers ended the video by saying sorry in Mandarin.""We will never forget this experience and lesson, and this sort of thing will never happen again,"" Gabbana said.It's not the first gaffe by Dolce & Gabbana in China, where the brand came under fire on social media last year for a series of advertisements showing the grungy side of Chinese life. Other upsets have come and gone in China without appearing to cause lasting damage, including at brands like Kering's Balenciaga, which apologized in April amid a backlash over how some Chinese customers had been treated in Paris.However, the crisis for Dolce & Gabbana showed no sign of easing on Friday. Retailer Lane Crawford said it would pull the brand from its stores and online sites in mainland China and Hong Kong after customers had returned Dolce & Gabbana items.Most of the comments posted under the apology video on Weibo were also critical.""We don't have to accept your apology. Go and make money in other countries, there's none for you here in China,"" one user wrote.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Nov 15, 2018 06:44AM ET",China's stay-at-home shoppers propel luxury sales: Bain,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Luxury brands will increasingly have to court Chinese shoppers on their home turf, as local purchases soar among a clientele who are forecast to generate nearly half the industry's sales by 2025, a study showed on Thursday. Global sales of personal luxury goods like handbags and watches are on course to grow 6 percent at constant currencies this year, on par with 2017, according to consultancy Bain and Italian manufacturers association Altagamma's report, which valued the market at 260 billion euros ($294 billion) in 2018.That pace will slow in the medium term to 3 to 5 percent per year, they forecast, with potential ""bumps"" along the way like the risk of a U.S. recession or an easing pace of China's economic growth. But leaving aside worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war's impact on high-end labels, Chinese consumers will continue to grow in stature for the luxury industry. Accounting for 33 percent of purchases now, they will anchor 46 percent of the market by 2025, the report said. Half of those sales are forecast to take place within China by then, up from a quarter today, against the backdrop of a global industry landscape that for the most part remains benign. ""The market fundamentals are very sound,"" Federica Levato, a partner at Bain, said. ""There could be some slight slowdown in the near future, in the next 12 to 18 months, (but) we don't think this will distract brands from a very solid market.""China's luxury shoppers are already propelling sales bounces at brands from France's Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), to Italian puffer jacker maker Moncler (MI:MONC). At one of the fastest-growing labels, Italy's Gucci, some 45 percent of Chinese clients' purchases already take place domestically, executives at parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) detailed in October. Narrowing price differentials compared with other regions for goods like handbags, import tax cuts by Beijing and spikes in the euro against the yuan have all helped to repatriate spending.GEN Z ON THE RISELuxury items cost 70 or 80 percent more in China than in Europe as recently as 2015, Levato said, with the average premium closer to 25 or 30 percent now. Habits are evolving rapidly as a result, with Chinese tourists no longer visiting fashion capitals like Paris just to pick up bargains.""They are now traveling for the experience. Of course they will also buy luxury goods, but it's not the first driver of traveling,"" Levato said. Rather than open more shops, brands are expanding online in China and considering partnerships with Chinese e-commerce giants like  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) to reach potential consumers in far-flung cities.In China and beyond, the dominance of ever-younger consumers is pushing labels to invest in social media marketing or churn out collections more often to cater to the smartphone generation who are used to shopping differently. Millenials, or those now roughly aged between 22 and 37, and the ""Gen Z"" generation right behind them, were the exclusive drivers of global sales growth in 2018, Bain said. From around a third of the market now, those younger shoppers are forecast to account for some 55 percent of revenues by 2025. The shifting age profile of luxury buyers is also reflected in sliding footfall in department stores, one sales channel that lost ground in 2018, while online shopping picked up. In China, luxury sales at constant currencies are on course to grow 20 percent in 2018 from 2017, but momentum has been weaker in Europe and the United States, where luxury goods sales are forecast to expand 3 percent and 5 percent respectively.

76,"Nov 09, 2018 05:46AM ET",European shares slip as Fed saps post U.S. midterms rally,nan,"By Julien PonthusLONDON (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Friday, joining a global market retreat that spread from Wall Street to Asia after the Federal Reserve appeared to remain on track to raise its key interest rate next month.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.5 percent at 0930 GMT, while the leading index of euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) was 0.7 percent lower. All European bourses and most sectors were in negative territory with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) losing 0.7 percent.""Just as the feel-good factor was beginning to return to the markets, buoyed by the result of the U.S. midterms, the Fed swooped in and brought everyone back down to earth"", Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note.Some investors had hoped that the sharp share price falls during what has been called ""Red October"" might have encouraged the U.S. central bank to take a more dovish approach toward monetary policy.A number of disappointing corporate earnings in Europe weighed on the market mood, as Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) fell to its lowest levels since July 2016 after cutting its profit outlook for the second time this year.The steel-to-submarines conglomerate, under a cartel probe, cut its profit outlook for the second time this year, adding to a string of bad news for the group.Shares in Thyssenkrupp fell about 8 percent, its biggest fall in about two years and weighed on the Basic Resources sector (SXPP), down 2.35 percent and hit by lower metals prices. Thyssenkrupp was the STOXX 600's second-worst performance, behind France's  Rubis  (PA:RUBF). The French oil storage and distribution group led losers with a 14 percent fall after a disappointing trading update and brokers lowered their recommendation for the stock.The energy sector also acted as a drag with oil majors weighing on indexes as rising supply and concerns of an economic slowdown pressured prices, with U.S. crude down by around 20 percent since early October.Another blow for investors was luxury goods group  Richemont  (S:CFR), which fell 5.8 pct after it said first-half net profit fell and sales growth slowed toward the end of the period. The results knocked Swiss peer Swatch (S:UHR), which fell 4.1 percent, and French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the worst performer among the 40 constituents of Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) with a 3 percent decline. Italian state-controlled defense group Leonardo (MI:LDOF) was another big loser, tumbling 7.7 percent after a disappointing trading update.The euro zone banking sector (SX7E) was also deep in the red, down 2 percent. The euro and euro zone bond yields were pushed lower after the head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi said late on Thursday that the bank could change its monetary policy guidance if the economic outlook darkens.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The miss was the first since the quarter ended December 2016.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.27 per share, above analysts' estimates of $1.10 per share.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

78,"Nov 04, 2018 06:30PM ET",Vying for Vuitton: China's e-commerce rivals seek luxury stranglehold,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - China's online giants  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) are taking their battle for relevance in the lucrative luxury goods market to a new level, as they aim to crack e-commerce tie-ups with top brands that usually shun selling through third parties.From  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) to La Perla underwear, the online shopping giants have recruited dozens of labels since launching their rival luxury sites in mid-2017, touting their access to a trove of consumer data and their grip on local payments systems in the world's biggest market for high-end fashion.But some of the most prized names have so far remained aloof, and the race is on to attract the likes of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton: a brand notorious for only selling its handbags and other wares through its own stores and websites.Both are banking that even elusive outsiders will tire of trying to fly solo in China, where potential clients shop far more by mobile phone apps than in the United States or Europe, and those in smaller, far-flung cities are hard to reach. ""It's a matter of time,"" said Xia Ding, the head of fashion at China's No.2 e-commerce player JD.com and of its luxury site Toplife, adding the platform had held talks with all major brands. That echoes a similar message from its bigger competitor Alibaba and its Luxury Pavilion platform.As they chase labels, the firms are willing to go where the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN) will not.That includes giving them control over their image and prices - some of which, like $97,926 Tiffany (N:TIF) jewels, have reached eye-watering amounts - while offering advantageous fees compared with Western equivalents.And while some brands like Italy's independent Armani signed up early on to both sites, the platforms have since devised more elaborate deals to win over and retain others. Alibaba is developing a specific app for Chinese travellers with its most significant luxury client to date, Cartier-owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) and its Net-A-Porter online shopping portal, and it teamed up with Italy's Moncler (MI:MONC) to sell a collection of its fancy puffer jackets designed solely for Pavilion.Alibaba, behind mass market shopping sites Tmall and Taobao and YouTube equivalent Youku, has already bagged distribution or content-sharing alliances ranging from U.S. coffee behemoth Starbucks (O:SBUX) to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS).JD - which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), owner of social media platform WeChat, as an investor - also has partnerships with the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), helping it gain a foothold beyond China and Southeast Asia. In luxury, it has cracked some top brands at LVMH's rival, Paris-based conglomerate  Kering  (PA:PRTP), signing Balenciaga, known for its luxury sneakers, and fashion house Saint Laurent on to Toplife. SOLO EFFORTSVuitton, one of the market leaders in the luxury sector with annual revenues estimated at more than 9 billion euros, is fiercely protective of its distribution as a means of controlling prices and supply.That has helped Vuitton, and a handful of rivals such as Hermes , maker of $10,000-plus Birkin bags, sustain their status at the upper end of the luxury hierarchy, a high-margin sphere to which others like Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) aspire. In China, Vuitton - like Kering's Gucci or Hermes - has ventured online but on its own terms, with a WeChat store and a standalone e-commerce site launched in 2017 that it says is doing well, though it does not publish earnings. ""Everyone told me you couldn't go it alone in China, that no-one went to a 'brands.com' and I think we've proven that to be incorrect,"" Ian Rogers, who runs the digital operations at parent LVMH. ""When you have a product people really want, they're going to get it the way that's possible to get it.""Chinese customers are critical for Vuitton and its peers, already accounting for at least a third of all industry sales. Many are starting to spend more at home rather than on overseas trips, encouraged by government measures such as cuts in import duties, leading labels to lower prices accordingly.But while Vuitton has stores in 20 Chinese cities, it is relying like rivals on online sales to reach clients beyond that base. ""A third of potential buyers are in cities where there are no luxury stores. Their only access to products is e-commerce,"" said Sebastien Badault, Alibaba's managing director for France. The group says it can give luxury brands visibility and access to those areas, and also crunch data from its more than 600 million online shopping clients to help them identify pockets of demand. EDUCATION PROCESSLVMH did not comment on what it would take for Vuitton to join forces with either of the Chinese players.The two offer some subtly different services, with JD also handling inventories and storage for those who want it, or offering to ease brands' set-up within WeChat, a platform with a billion users. The sites offer to share client data and take commissions per sale, which at Alibaba's Luxury Pavilion sit at up to 5 percent, Badault said. That is in line with the broader online shopping sector in China, but lower than the 12-15 percent average on U.S. or European equivalents, he added. JD declined to give details.Other LVMH brands have already taken the plunge, including several cosmetics labels such as Benefit, which retails on Tmall. Upscale fur house Fendi has experimented with a pop-up store on JD's Toplife - a method used by the group to lure brands in. ""We're open to doing that because we know it's an education process,"" Ding said, adding that JD had constant exchanges even with the reticent brands like Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci. ""We are invited by them to give lectures, to share our findings and experience.""PEANUTSHermes has already signaled it could cave eventually - a major departure for a brand that also only sells in its own networks. Gucci has made its red lines clear, demanding more of a crackdown on fake luxury goods circulating on the likes of Tmall. JD and Alibaba will still have to persuade brands that their platforms can deliver. They aim to eventually reach a universe of 200 to 250 luxury labels, up from the 80 Toplife expects to have by year end or the 75 Pavilion now boasts. Moncler, which launched on Pavilion in late September, said in October it was happy with the project, though the impact on sales volumes was ""not yet"" material.But luxury players are also increasingly open about their struggle to break China's online market alone. ""Our business is on fire and when I look at the e-commerce that we do (in China) it's basically peanuts,"" Fabrizio Cardinali, chief operating officer at Italy's independent Dolce & Gabbana, told a Financial Times Business of Luxury conference earlier this year. ""We need to find a way to break through, and it's not just for us, it's for everybody.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Fears of a full-blown trade war, rising U.S. bond yields, slowing Chinese growth, political risk in the form of Brexit or Italy's populist government have all been blamed for last month ""red October"" during which indexes worldwide sustained some of their worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis.Markets' new found optimism is however pushing European shares up over four percent this week, their best performance since December 2016. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) jumped 1.6 percent, in what would be its biggest daily rise since July, lifted by the big exporters among its constituents, such as car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), up 4 percent. The European automotive index (SXAP) was the best performing one, jumping 3.5 percent and all other sectors were in positive territory except for a minority of defensive sectors. Both telecoms or utilities traded slightly or on the verge of negative territory. Boosted by a upgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), France's  Kering  (PA:PRTP) topped the euro zone blue chip index (STOXX50E) with a 5.5 percent rise. Other luxury stocks such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) or  Burberry  (L:BRBY) did well, up 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent. Following Asia's lead, European tech stocks shrugged off Apple's (O:AAPL) disappointing results, which saw the iPhone marker's shares tumbled about seven percent after the bell.Apple supplier AMS however was down 5.3 percent and suffered the worst losses in the pan-European index. The banking sector (SX7P) was showing no angst about the results of European stress tests which will be divulged after the close.Italian lenders are under the spotlight with their heavy exposure to sovereign Italian debt, which is suffering from the populist government’s spending plans and its row with the EU's executive body.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

87,"Oct 11, 2018 11:20AM ET",Puma commemorates 'black power' salute in U.S. market push,nan,"By Emma ThomassonBERLIN (Reuters) - Puma (DE:PUMG) is launching a campaign to mark the 50th anniversary of U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith's black-gloved salute at the 1968 Olympics, shortly after rival  Nike  scored a hit with an ad featuring a modern-day activist for racial equality. Nike (N:NKE) saw a jump in sales after its advertisement with American footballer Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the U.S. national anthem at NFL games in 2016 to protest against police shootings of unarmed black men - a gesture that has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.Puma's #REFORM campaign will see brand ambassadors such as rapper Meek Mill call for people to post images of themselves online with a raised fist to commemorate Smith's silent salute at the Mexico Olympics on Oct. 16, 1968.The brand is working with rap mogul Jay-Z's Roc Nation on live and social media events to fight racism and sexism, and will match donations to charities such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), up to $100,000 in total.Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said it was a coincidence the anniversary comes soon after the Kaepernick ad, and also shortly after Puma launched its garish orange and black ""Clyde Court Disrupt"" basketball shoes - marking its return to a sport with close links to the social justice movement. ""We are not trying to make commercial advertising out of this but we think it is good for the brand because it is part of our values,"" he told Reuters.Puma has sponsored Smith for more than 50 years. He took a pair of their shoes onto the platform when he did his salute.Puma is launching a collection of shoes called ""Power Through Peace"" on Oct. 16, with the proceeds going to charity.Gulden said Smith was a trailblazer for other athletes like Kaepernick, who could not find a job for the 2017 season and is still without a team. Smith never competed again after 1968, received death threats and struggled to make a living for years.""What he did then ... was the bravest thing an athlete has ever done when you think about the consequences,"" Gulden said.Nike sales jumped after the Kaepernick campaign, but its shares fell late last month when that did not feed through to an increase in the company's full-year forecast.Both Puma and German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn) have been taking share from Nike in its home market in the last couple of years, helped by the popularity of their retro fashion styles.RETURN TO BASKETBALLCEO since 2013, Gulden has rebuilt Puma's flagging business by putting a big focus on soccer and running, while partnerships with celebrities like singers Rihanna and Selena Gomez have revived its popularity among women.It is now making a drive to widen its appeal in the U.S. market by returning to basketball, naming Jay-Z as its creative director for the sport and signing sponsorships with four top picks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft.""We are doing it not only to sell basketball shoes ... but to sell more soccer shoes, to sell more training and running shoes in America to that kid who then perceives us a performance brand,"" Gulden said. ""Doing basketball is a real commitment to the American market and a necessary one to be a successful global company in the long-term.""Puma's global marketing head Adam Petrick said basketball had a tradition of supporting social justice, with the NBA backing those who speak out such as Puma athlete Skylar Diggins-Smith, who is fighting unequal pay for female players.""If we're going to participate in the basketball culture, then we have to participate in all aspects of that,"" he said.Puma's core consumers aged between 14 and 30 have shown an increased interest in activism since the financial crisis in 2008, and Trump's election in 2016.""As a brand we can't be worthy of their business unless we are sensitive to that,"" Petrick said.Adidas faced brief boycott calls in May after the rapper Kanye West, who makes its Yeezy brand, described slavery as a choice and praised Trump.Apart from that, it has not ventured into race politics in the same way as Nike and Puma, although it has scored with consumers with an environmental conscience, who have snapped up its “Parley” shoes made out of recycled ocean plastic.Matt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD, said the sports industry was ahead in seeking to align with the values of its consumers, with Puma's rivals like Patagonia and Vans-owner VF Corp (N:VFC) putting a focus on sustainability.He predicts Puma's ""fist-raising"" campaign will bring only a limited boost to sales but will help the brand longer term.""The consumer ... wants brands to take visible and vocal stands on social issues,"" he said. ""There are many more people who would respond positively than negatively.""Puma saw second-quarter sales jump almost 19 percent in the United States, after stripping out currency effects. Gulden declined to comment on current trading ahead of third-quarter figures on Oct. 25. Analysts expect the focus on the United States will help boost profitability, which lags well behind Adidas and Nike, as Puma currently lacks scale and distribution muscle in the world's biggest market for sportswear.Puma's shares, which dipped in January when former French parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) said it would spin off the brand, have since rallied on an upbeat 2018 outlook and are trading up almost a third in the last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

91,"Oct 04, 2018 09:04PM ET",Gucci boss reassures staff over looming era of slower growth,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - The head of Gucci has reassured shop staff over a looming slowdown in the pace of sales growth after a revenue explosion at the  Kering  (PA:PRTP)-owned label, according to an internal video message seen by Reuters. Italy-based Gucci - the biggest earnings driver at the French luxury conglomerate - has outperformed most of its peers since 2016 thanks to a flamboyant makeover under designer Alessandro Michele. The boom has lasted longer than many fashion analysts expected, even as rivals invest in competing brands. Marco Bizzarri, Gucci's chief executive since 2015, said in a message to store employees they should not be daunted by any sign of a slowdown or variations in daily performances, which he said would be normal after rapid growth and at a time when year-ago comparisons are growing tougher. ""I am here today to reassure you in the sense that Gucci is stronger than ever,"" Bizzarri said in the video message, adding Gucci was maintaining its competitive advantage over ""any other brand in the arena.""Kering executives had already flagged to market watchers a ""progressive normalization"" of sales growth in 2018. The nearly four-minute-long video was presented to staff in the past week following Gucci's catwalk show in Paris, which was highlighted by Bizzarri in his comments.A copy of the video was shared with Reuters by a person who had received it in the fashion industry.Kering declined to comment. ""ENJOY THE RIDE""Gucci, like its rivals, has been carried by strong demand from Chinese consumers. Comparable sales at the label increased 40.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. That was a touch below forecasts following better-than-expected 48.7 percent growth in the previous three months, but still a faster pace than rivals like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, a brand Gucci wants to overtake one day as it aims to increase annual sales to 10 billion euros, from 6.2 billion euros ($7.15 billion) in 2017.""We need to recognize the fact that at a certain point we're going to slow down, we cannot keep on growing 50, 60 percent per month, it's impossible,"" Bizzarri said in the video, adding that growth was still ""exceptional"" and telling staff to ""enjoy the ride"". ""I'm happier now than I was two years ago, I'm very very confident,"" Bizzarri said.Kering's shares have risen more than 20 percent this year, driven in large part by Gucci's strong performance. Its Saint Laurent and Balenciaga brands are riding high too, though Gucci accounts for over 70 percent of group profits. Gucci is investing in e-commerce and store facelifts to keep growing the brand, as well as building up areas like cosmetics and perfumes to maximize revenue from non-core products.Quirky runway styles have helped it attract younger shoppers at a time when not all luxury firms have profited from a benign industry backdrop. Yet Gucci's distinctive look could make it vulnerable to brand fatigue, analysts have said. Broader market worries about a potential slowdown in China rattled luxury stocks from LVMH to Kering and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) on Thursday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The move is also aimed at reviving Versace, which returned to a net profit last year.It is the latest in a string of foreign takeovers of Italian luxury brands in recent years.Milan-based Versace, known for its bold designs and its Medusa head logo, was one of a clutch of family-owned Italian brands cited as attractive targets at a time when the luxury industry is riding high on strong demand from China. ""With the acquisition of Versace we have created one of the world's leading fashion and luxury groups,"" said John Idol, chairman and CEO of  Michael Kors Holdings .Michael Kors has agreed to buy all of Versace's outstanding shares for a total enterprise value of 1.83 billion euros ($2.2 billion) to be funded in cash, debt and shares in Michael Kors Holding Ltd, which will be renamed Capri Holdings Ltd.Idol later ruled out any further acquisitions by Capri, which will focus on developing the three brands. Talks started before the summer, when Versace was on the radar of several investors, as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) intended to exit the group, a source close to the deal said. The U.S. private equity firm, which bought 20 percent of Versace for 210 million euros in 2014, will make a 156 million euro capital gain by exiting its investment, Reuters calculations show. The Versace family, which owns 80 percent of the Milan-based fashion house, will receive 150 million euros of the purchase price in Capri shares.""We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace's long-term success. My passion has never been stronger,"" said Donatella Versace, the sister of its late founder who is its artistic director and vice-president.Versace CEO Jonathan Akeroyd will remain at the helm of the company, while Donatella Versace will ""continue to lead the company's creative vision"", Idol added. The deal is expected to close in the fourth fiscal quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were among the advisers. BIG FASHIONBudding conglomerates like Michael Kors have been trying to make inroads into an industry dominated by European players such as Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP).""The Versace brand has strong global growth potential which is untapped across all regions, particularly Asia and North America,"" Cowen analysts said in a note. Idol said his group plans to grow Versace's global sales to $2 billion globally, reach profit margins in the ""high teens range"" and open about 100 new stores as well as bolstering online sales. It also plans to raise the share of higher-margin accessories and footwear to 60 percent of sales from 35 percent. ""Versace is terribly under-developed.

The brand recently outlined its ambition to one day overtake LVMH's Louis Vuitton as the world's biggest luxury brand by sales, including with more store facelifts and by further developing its e-commerce operations.High margin leather goods are central to its strategy, and the brand's latest collection for spring and summer 2019 featured several new bag models - including chunky backpacks.Paris Fashion Week runs until Oct. 2.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Would Michael Kors have what it takes to succeed in this? I wonder. The plan seems ambitious.""Shares in Michael Kors fell in early U.S. trade and were down 8.7 percent by 1526 GMT.The move is in line with the U.S. brand's ambition to aggregate various luxury brands - including fashion, shoes and accessories - under one larger group. The deal - which is expected to be announced imminently - will give Michael Kors a mega-brand and red carpet favorite that is among the most recognizable and followed fashion labels in the world. Two of the three sources who spoke to Reuters said the company had agreed to pay a large premium for Versace.Michael Kors could not be reached for comment. Versace declined to comment.Donatella Versace, sister of late founder Gianni who doubles as artistic director and vice-president of the Milan-based group, has called a staff meeting for Tuesday, according to a person who was briefed by a company employee. The Italian fashion icon has been considering a market listing after U.S. private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) bought a 20 percent stake in 2014 to fund overseas expansion, although Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd told Reuters earlier this year there was no rush for an IPO.After investing in Versace at a high multiple, Blackstone found its performance insufficient to justify a market listing, said one of the sources, who is close to the family. ""They gradually persuaded the family to look into a possible sale and introduced them to a series of buyers, including Michael Kors,"" the person added. ""Blackstone wasn't going to put any more money into it. They needed a buyer who could make heavy investments.""""OVERPRICED"" French fashion houses including Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among those holding talks with the Versace family, the sources said, but considered the price too expensive.""They didn't feel the need to invest so much money into another Italian fashion brand. It was overpriced,"" the source said. Kering declined to comment.As part of the deal, Blackstone will fully exit Versace, while the family, which owns the rest of the fashion house via a holding company called Givi, will keep a role, the sources said.Givi in turn is half-owned by Allegra Versace Beck, daughter of Donatella and niece of late founder Gianni. Donatella herself owns 30 percent of the holding, with the remainder in the hands of her brother Santo.Blackstone, whose stake acquisition valued Versace at $1.4 billion in 2014, declined to comment.Versace does not disclose its financial details, but documents deposited with the Italian chamber of commerce show that last year it posted sales of 668 million euros ($786 million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation (EBITDA) of 44.6 million euros.Since Akeroyd's appointment in 2016, Versace has been working on streamlining its management structure, cutting costs and pushing to increase sales online. Last year it returned to a net profit of just under 15 million euros compared with a net loss of 7.9 million euros the previous year. ($1 = 0.8499 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

London-based Farfetch - a 10-year-old site that connects shoppers to hundreds of boutiques and fashion labels but carries no inventory - is one of a clutch of rapidly-expanding multi-brand platforms that got an early foothold in the market.The company's shares were trading as much as 39 percent above its initial public offering at $20 per share on the New York stock exchange on Friday - surpassing the range of $17 to $19 that already had been increased. It will raise $885 million in the listing, with the company issuing 33.6 million new shares and existing shareholders, including early backers such as Advent Venture Partners and Vitrurian Partners, selling 10.6 million. The IPO values Farfetch, founded by Portuguese entrepreneur Jose Neves, at $5.8 billion according to the share count available in its latest filings. When including employee share options this would rise to $6.3 billion, the company said. Existing Farfetch investors include JD.com (O:JD), China's second largest e-commerce firm, which bought extra shares along the listing in a private placement. The flotation comes at a time of growing competition among independent online fashion retailers and luxury groups rolling out their e-commerce operations, including cash-rich luxury heavyweights like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), which is experimenting with its own multi-brand site.  Richemont  (S:CFR), the Swiss conglomerate that owns jeweler Cartier, this year took control of now delisted Farfetch rival Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, in a deal that valued that platform at 5.3 billion euros ($6.2 billion). Farfetch - which has never turned a profit, but posted a 59 percent jump in revenues last year to $386 million - drew investment from prominent industry players in its IPO, like the Pinault family that controls  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the French group behind brands such as Italy's Gucci. To stand out from the crowd, the platform is investing heavily in technology, including for digital store services it is trialing with France's Chanel, one of Farfetch's big name tie-ups. ""It is an industry that, rightly so, chooses their path and their channels very carefully,"" said Farfetch Chief Executive Jose Neves, adding that, for most luxury retailers, it is all about brand image, aesthetic and high-end customer service.""But I think the industry has seen the potential of reaching key demographics like the new millennial customer that thinks digital first. These customers are online - they’re not offline.""Online sales are set to make up a quarter of the luxury industry's revenues by 2025 from just under 10 percent now, according to consultancy Bain, thanks in part to demand from young shoppers in tech-savvy markets like China.($1 = 0.8493 euros)""That is an incremental $100 billion opportunity just in online luxury fashion,"" Neves said. ""This is Chapter 2. We want to be a category leader and we want to continue to gain massive share in this space,"" Neves said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Founded in 1948, Longchamp, best known for its folding Pliage handbags, is one of the last remaining independent family-owned leather goods makers in France with a global presence. At a time when some top-of-the-range luxury brands, such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton and Hermes (PA:HRMS), are riding high on strong demand from China, others are having to refresh their designs or marketing strategies to keep young shoppers in particular hooked. Longchamp, which does not publish its earnings, saw sales grow at a ""less vigorous"" pace in 2016 and 2017, having tripled in the decade before, Chief Executive Jean Cassegrain, grandson of the firm's founder, said in an interview. The company - whose top market is French, followed closely by China - took a hit as tourist numbers in France fell following deadly Islamist militant attacks in 2015. But by next year, Cassegrain said Longchamp aims to outperform growth in the broader luxury industry, which according to consultancy Bain, should rise 6 to 8 percent globally.The firm had said it made sales of 560 million euros ($658.11 million) in 2015, and they are estimated by industry watchers to still be in a 500 million to 600 million range.Longchamp, which sells its bags and accessories in China through Tencent's (HK:0700) messaging site WeChat, plans to launch its own e-commerce platform there in 2019 to increase sales, following similar moves by rivals LVMH and Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci. The handbag maker has largely finished expanding its worldwide store network, with 1,500 sale points in department stores and 300 of its own shops, although it plans to open a few more in the United States, including one in Beverley Hills.""We're entering a different phase of growth, it's no longer about store openings but about improving the performance of our current network,"" Cassegrain said. Longchamp, which manufactures about half its bags in France with the rest in countries including Tunisia and Romania, recently marked its 70th anniversary with its first fashion show in New York and picked celebrity model Kendall Jenner as the face of its campaigns to raises its U.S. profile.

102,"Sep 06, 2018 09:01AM ET",Burberry ends bonfire of the luxuries after waste outcry,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Burberry will no longer burn unsold luxury goods to protect its brand after an admission that it destroyed almost $40 million worth of stock last year sparked a furor over waste in the fashion industry.Burberry also said on Thursday it would no longer use real fur such as mink and racoon, in another step to improving its social and environmental credentials which was immediately welcomed by animal rights campaigners. The waste revelation in July from Burberry came only months after the owner of Cartier and Montblanc admitted to destroying some of their unsold watches and coincides with growing public awareness of waste and its environmental impact.""Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,"" said CEO Marco Gobbetti, who is in the process of taking Burberry, where coats sell for more than 2,500 pounds ($3,234) and handbags are priced at up to 1,500 pounds, more upmarket. Many retailers have been called out in recent years for destroying unsold stock, including by slashing or punching holes in garments before throwing them out.Richemont, owner of luxury watch brands, said it bought back unsold stock from dealers during a recent downturn and recycled the precious metals and stones that were in the high-end pieces. Burberry physically destroyed 28.6 million pounds worth of finished goods in the financial year to April, up from 26.9 million pounds the previous year, including 10 million pounds worth of beauty products such as perfume. The products are generally those that did not sell via discount outlets and are more than five years old. Burberry said it would try to reuse, repair, donate or recycle its products while a strategy to make fewer, more targeted collections should help reduce excess stock. It is also working with the sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse to transform 120 tonnes of leather offcuts into new products over the next five years.GROWING AWARENESSExane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca said Burberry's announcement could put pressure on other luxury names to be more transparent about how they handle unsold goods. ""Concerns about sustainability are slowly but surely becoming more relevant for luxury goods consumers,"" he said.Some luxury groups also offer sales to employees and journalists to limit the amount of unsold stock. Both  Kering  (PA:PRTP), owner of Gucci and Alexander McQueen, and LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Celine, Christian Dior and Givenchy, declined to comment. In the mass market, major brands have also struggled to shift stock in a fast changing environment. H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after  Inditex  (MC:ITX), has said in the past it burns stock, but only when it is damaged or, for example, has high levels of chemicals in it. At the end of May the Swedish group had $4 billon of unsold stock that it said it hoped to sell. ""Under no circumstances do we destroy clothes that are safe to use,"" a spokeswoman said. Burberry is following the likes of Versace, Gucci and the trailblazer for ethical fashion, Stella McCartney, in removing real fur from its ranges. The moves are part of a series of changes at Burberry where Gobbetti is pinning his hopes on new designer Riccardo Tisci to transform the quintessentially British fashion house. Former Givenchy star Tisci has previously designed costumes for Beyonce and Madonna and releases his debut collection in September. ""We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products,"" Gobbetti said. PETA, the campaign group for the ethical treatment of animals, welcomed Burberry's move to stop using fur, which it said was a sign of the times. ""The few fashion houses refusing to modernize and listen to the overwhelming public opinion against fur are now sticking out like a sore thumb for all the wrong reasons,"" PETA's director of international programs, Mimi Bekhechi said.Campaign group Humane Society International said animal charities would unite during this year's major fashion shows to call on Italian brand Prada to follow Burberry's lead.The head of the International Fur Federation, Mark Oaten, said substituting natural fur with ""plastic petroleum-based materials, like fake fur"" was neither luxury nor responsible.(This refiled version adds dropped words ""said CEO"", paragraph 4.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

105,"Aug 19, 2018 07:10PM ET","Global luxury brands again chase China's young, rich and spendthrift",nan,"By Farah Master and Donny KwokHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada (HK:1913) to LVMH (PA:LVMH) are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows.Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster.The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said.""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said on a call with analysts.""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands.""Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewelry and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say.Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialization and urbanization. ""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. TRADE WAR JITTERSChinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. Brands including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy.The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said.Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC) has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. ""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here.""SMALLER CITY PUSHTo capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth.Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's.LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewelry brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September.Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates.""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus,  Kering  group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs.""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said.Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers.Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year.Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country.Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

106,"Aug 10, 2018 04:45AM ET",Trade war threatens reign of luxury stocks,nan,"By Helen Reid and Sarah WhiteLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - An escalating trade war between the United States and China could abruptly end a glittering stock market run for luxury goods firms, with some investors already put off by lofty valuations in a sector powered by shoppers in the two countries. From pricey handbags to designer shoes, booming sales at the European companies that dominate the industry like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have made them investor favorites, with shares still near record highs. But the possible trickle down effect of tit-for-tat tariffs hikes on consumers is adding to jitters over heady valuations, even though luxury firms are not as directly threatened by rising protectionism as carmakers and industrial companies.The sector has an average valuation of 21 times 12-month earnings forecasts, according to Reuters data, down from its May peak, but still 23 percent above its 10-year average. ""We are not making a call that they are bad companies, we think they're great companies. But they're bad investments,"" said Edinburgh-based David Keir, co-manager of the Saracen Global Income and Growth fund, which dropped its LVMH holdings last year and sold out of German suit maker  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in early July. ""Now there's an incremental risk from the great unknown of trade tariffs as well.""It would not be the first demand-driven wobble the luxury industry has faced. In 2012, a Chinese crackdown on corruption caused purchases of premium cognac and other high-end goods used as gifts to fall sharply, taking the likes of LVMH and Remy Cointreau shares down with them. This time, tariffs threaten consumers' spending power in both the United States and China – the world's two biggest consumers of European luxury goods, which make up just over half the industry's revenues. The impact on confidence in China's markets, including the depreciation of the renminbi that would eat into Chinese tourists' budgets for shopping in Europe, is among risks that may not be fully reflected in stocks yet, analysts warn. ""We see very little priced in so far,"" said UBS analysts, who forecast as much as a 30 percent share price drop in the sector index in the event of a fully-fledged trade war.Among the stocks that would be worse affected, UBS included Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY). The two brands are in the midst of turnaround plans that have yet to fully hit their stride. For a related graphic, click https://reut.rs/2MxNtB9CHINA THRIVINGSo far, the knock-on effect on revenues has been muted. If anything, Chinese demand for Louis Vuitton's leather goods ticked up in the second quarter compared to the first, LVMH reported, while most firms argue their core clientele is here to stay. ""We have still an expansion of the middle and upper class in China,"" Kering's group managing director Jean-Francois Palus told analysts following the company's half-year results. Sales in China have been largely driven by a young clientele unafraid of splurging on branded goods, and often financed by their parents and grandparents, with rising property prices also providing a source of wealth.Even a moderate slowdown in the pace of revenue growth, as is expected regardless of the trade spat after two years of rebounding demand in China, is not enough to spook some drawn to the sector's underlying strengths. ""Demand is really healthy,"" said Andrea Gerst, co-portfolio manager of GAM's Luxury brands fund, which has stakes in many major European labels. ""If comparatives get more difficult, then the absolute madness may not be as strong, but there'll still be healthy growth.""More broadly, global luxury sales are driven by some of the world's wealthiest shoppers who might shrug off any direct impact from tariffs were it to come to that. ""With luxury you've got people who are far less price-sensitive as your customers and so you ask yourself if there's a tax put on and the price goes up a bit, how much is that really going to change the demand?"" said Fergus Shaw, partner and portfolio manager at Cerno Capital.Shaw said his fund owns LVMH shares, and he has not been tempted to sell out, expecting any impact from tariffs to be much smaller than the anti-corruption drive was. For a related graphic, click https://reut.rs/2MxI3WwNERVESYet market nerves around the sector are becoming more evident, and luxury companies and industry lobbies are on alert. Even good or in-line results from luxury companies for the second quarter prompted some sharp sell-offs on results day.Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the luxury sector at the start of July to ""underweight"", citing trade war worries. Italy's Confindustria Moda, the national association of textile and fashion companies, said its entrepreneurs feared a possible rise in tariffs and that it was monitoring the situation in the hope of avoiding ""a protectionist escalation"".It estimates goods in the sector are already subject on average to 12 percent trade tariffs, and are unlikely to be targeted for increases, however. Though the bulk of luxury manufacturing is still anchored in Europe, some firms are also weighing whether to make changes to their supply chains should they get caught in the crossfire. ""This is an industry in which we have the capability, as we do and as we have done in the past, to switch capacity from one location to the other as is necessary,"" Ray-Ban maker Luxottica's (MI:LUX) finance chief Stefano Grassi told analysts following second-quarter results. The Italian group, which makes designer sunglasses for Chanel and Versace among other labels, could for example shift more production to the United States if needed, where it has a factory. It also has three in China, while the majority of its plants are in its home base.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

115,"Jul 10, 2018 05:22AM ET",European shares extend recovery rally as oil stocks lead,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday as investors shifted from worrying about a trade war to focusing on a corporate earnings season expected to deliver solid results.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rose 0.2 percent by 0830 GMT, a 2 1/2-week high, and headed for its sixth straight day of gains as commodities shares supported the market in the face of rising protectionism. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) declined 0.1 percent, however, as the pound recovered from Monday's drop after top-level government resignations. Fading concern over trade had pushed Wall Street and Asian stocks up overnight as well. ""It’s more of an absence of bad news rather than outright positive news that has driven the trade story over the last few days,"" said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.Oil stocks (SXEP) were the biggest boost to the index, rising 1 percent. Crude prices climbed on concern over potential supply shortages as Norwegian oil workers prepared to strike later in the day. Industrials stocks like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn),  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), among the worst-hit by news of tariffs, also boosted the European index. Trade-sensitive luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) extended their recovery rally.Overall, analysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the STOXX 600 before Europe's earnings season kicks off in earnest. But on Tuesday disappointing results caused the most eye-catching moves. Shares in interdealer broker TP ICAP (L:TCAPI) sank as much as 31.5 percent to a two-year low, on pace for their worst day ever. The company announced its CEO would depart and warned on profit, blaming Brexit-related costs.Ocado (L:OCDO) shares fell 2.4 percent after the online supermarket said its 2018 pre-tax loss would exceed market consensus as investment spending cut into first-half earnings.Among notable gainers, speciality chemicals firm  Wacker Chemie  (DE:WCHG) rose 2.8 percent after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts raised the stock to buy from hold.""We think the market is overestimating the impact of renewed price pressure in polysilicon for solar and at the same time underestimating the value of Wacker's Silicones business,"" they wrote. Airbus (PA:AIR) shares rose 2.7 percent, with traders saying Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill-Lynch added the stock to its ""Europe 1"" list of preferred stocks. Shares in German wind turbine maker  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) jumped 5.6 percent after it won its biggest single contract ever, for a 595-megawatt wind turbine order in Brazil.Biotech and pharma shares (SXDP) rose 0.4 percent as M&A and drug trial results boosted some small caps in the sector. UK specialist healthcare services company Cambian (L:CMBNC) soared 35 percent to the top of the small-cap index (FTSC) after saying it got a $536 million takeover offer from Caretech Holdings (L:CTH).Switzerland-listed biotech company Cassiopea (S:SKIN) jumped 37 percent after positive trials for its Winlevi acne treatment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"Jul 10, 2018 02:32AM ET",Old fashion: Vintage boom buoys RealReal and jolts luxury labels,nan,"By Sarah White and Melissa FaresPARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Second-hand fashion, once confined to thrift stores, is outstripping sales growth in the primary luxury goods sector, helping market leader The RealReal expand its business and prompting international labels to look at tie-ups.Sales of second-hand, or vintage, luxury goods - from Chanel handbags and Gucci dresses to Rolex watches - are thriving on dedicated web platforms that are drawing a younger clientele seeking bargains and championing recycling.The RealReal could be ready to list on the stock market within two years, when it expects the value of goods sold on the site to have roughly doubled to $1 billion annually, its founder and CEO told Reuters.The seven-year-old U.S. company is also in talks with high-end brands like Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) over potential partnerships, Julie Wainwright said. Luxury labels have hitherto shunned the second-hand trade, fearing diluting their exclusivity and cannibalizing their sales. But they are now finding it hard to ignore a second-hand luxury business that is worth $25 billion in annual revenue and is expected to grow by up to 10 percent annually in coming years, according to Berenberg analysts. That is more than twice the projected pace of growth of the much larger primary market.While there are few indications so far that they are planning in-house ventures, brands including LVMH and Kering are now talking to vintage sites as they try to figure out how they might extract some value from the burgeoning sector, The RealReal and executives from other resellers said. LVMH did not return requests to comment. Kering has said it is ""testing things with The RealReal"", without elaborating. FRIEND OR FOE TO BRANDS?Second-hand platforms make their money by taking a cut of the resale price of an item, anything from 10 percent to 50 percent depending on the product and how much the seller has sold via the site.The RealReal is facing growing competition from rival resellers looking to cash in on the booming market, including thredUP, which branched into luxury last year, and established players like Vestiaire Collective. For The RealReal and its rivals, partnerships with big brands could raise their profile and give them an edge. They declined to disclose details about the tie-ups they were discussing. But some executives, including Vestiaire CEO Sebastien Fabre, said deals could include data-sharing that allow brands to track what kind of people were buying and selling their products, and how items' value was holding. Such information could inform their marketing campaigns and pricing.The RealReal's existing partnership with British label Stella McCartney could also serve as a model. The brand actively encourages shoppers to recycle its clothes by offering $100 vouchers, half paid for by The RealReal, to spend on new products in stores for every old Stella McCartney item they sell on the site. Resale platforms are betting most luxury firms will prefer to opt for strategic alliances rather than to go it alone, in part because the logistics of second-hand sales can be daunting. Resellers said labels were also increasingly convinced by their argument that rather than threaten luxury sales, they may help funnel money back to brands. The RealReal's Wainwright said about a fifth of the money that sellers made was spent on buying items on the site, suggesting a significant proportion might go back into the broader apparel market. ""I think we're past the point where they may have felt we were a threat,"" she said. ""For many millennials it's their first-time experience with a luxury brand on our site.""'I ALSO SHOP AT PRADA'The RealReal has a 100-strong team of anti-counterfeiters to weed out fakes, and processes between 200,000 to 300,000 products a month. Vestiaire, which also works with authenticators, adds 6,000 new products a day to its site, after 30 percent of all items submitted for resale are rejected. Prices and discounts vary considerably, with determining factors including the condition of the item and how in demand a brand if at that moment.For example, shoppers on The RealReal can buy a 2015 black lace top from Givenchy for 1210 euros ($1,416), around a third of the original price, while polka-dotted Balenciaga high heels from last year were down to 374 euros from around 876 euros.Yet some things hold their value or even fetch premiums second-hand. A maroon Hermes Birkin bag made of ostrich leather from 2009 is on the RealReal at 21,130 euros when its 2017 retail price as a new product was around 15,000 euros.In New York's Soho district, Chinese student Fan Tu shopped for pre-owned items from Prada (HK:1913) and LVMH label Celine at The RealReal's store - its first, with a second due to open in Los Angeles in August. Tu, who had raised about $4,500 from selling used clothes via The RealReal this year, said she was not just after bargains - rather anything that caught her eye from her favorite labels, new or old. ""I also shop at Celine, right across the street, and at Prada, two blocks away,"" she said, clutching a pair of her old Chanel boots and Dolce & Gabbana loafers destined for resale.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

120,"Jun 26, 2018 05:18AM ET",European shares crawl up from trade war sell-off,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares made a modest bounce on Tuesday, recovering slightly after trade tensions sent stock markets into a spiral as investors shed risky assets. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.3 percent by 0837 GMT, but was far from making up all the previous session's 2 percent losses. The index hovered near its lowest level since mid-April. Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI), which has been the most sensitive to trade tensions, managed a 0.4 percent gain. The sectors worst hit by the trade-related sell-off were Tuesday's strongest gainers, with basic resources (SXPP), banks and oil stocks (SXEP) leading the way, while tech stocks (SX8P) also recovered. Autos (SXAP), a sector in the firing line of higher tariffs, managed a 0.5 percent gain having hit a fresh 9 1/2 month low on Monday, with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) leading Italy's FTSE MIB. Multinational consumer firms LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Richemont and Swatch all rose too. Concerns over trade have gripped global markets over the past weeks, wiping $1.5 trillion off the MSCI All-Country World since June 12. Trade disputes and slower economic growth have hit European stocks hard, with the STOXX 600 down 3 percent year-to-date and euro zone stocks (STOXXE) down 2.4 percent.Chris Hiorns, senior fund manager at EdenTree, said he thought European stocks would perform more robustly ""if we could really see growth come through and become self-enforcing, a virtuous circle of growth driving higher demand.""But, he added: ""If we are looking for triggers then what we'd want is for Trump to stop his trade war with China.""On the stock level, merger and acquisition news drove the biggest movers. British satellite firm  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) fell 6.3 percent, the worst on the STOXX 600, after France's Eutelsat (PA:ETL) said it did not intend to make an offer for the firm, having said on Monday it was considering a possible bid. Eutelsat shares rose 2.9 percent.Bid speculation meanwhile boosted French payments processor  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) 4.2 percent after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the firm was drawing preliminary interest from several private equity firms.In results-driven moves, the food and biopharma testing firm Eurofins (PA:EUFI) jumped 5.4 percent after saying it was raising its revenue target for the year, having received antitrust clearance for its acquisition of U.S. food company Covance.Austrian paper pulp maker Andritz (VI:ANDR) rose 3.1 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to a ""buy"", a day after the firm clinched a deal to buy U.S. company Xerium Technologies.Ambu (CO:AMBUb) shares fell back 5.2 percent, having risen as much as 9 percent on Monday after an ""overweight"" rating from JP Morgan. While investors were concerned about the potential deepening of a trade spat which has shifted from a bilateral U.S.-China dispute to one involving more regions, including Europe, some analysts said the economic impact would ultimately be limited. ""Trade negotiations have also been distracting attention from decent economic fundamentals, especially in the U.S., and strong corporate earnings growth,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Bankers, billionaires balk at Macron's elitism",nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - Perhaps only in France would a billionaire and one of the nation's most powerful bankers both publicly chastise the president for neglecting ordinary people.But such is France's professed attachment to its egalitarian tradition that such unlikely critics took aim at Emmanuel Macron on Friday over his promotion of a more meritocratic culture.""Macron doesn't understand the little people. I'm afraid he's leading France toward a system that leaves the least favored behind,"" Le Monde quoted Francois Pinault, whose business empire includes the Gucci fashion house, as saying.The man who led Macron's presidential campaign last year, Richard Ferrand, reacted with irony. ""No doubt only billionaires can understand others,"" he tweeted in response to Pinault, one of France's richest men.Macron, who defeated a far right populist in the 2017 election, questions his predecessors' preference for hefty welfare transfers from the rich to the poor to ease inequality.Instead, he believes in removing barriers to success for the most talented in France, who will then pull society up generally by starting companies and creating jobs.The 40-year-old former investment banker has justified the scrapping of the wealth tax, for example, with the metaphor of a lead mountaineer drawing up companions clinging to a rope below.But Pinault, the founder of the  Kering  (PA:PRTP) luxury goods group, is not alone in worrying about poorer citizens, many of whom live on suburban housing estates that ring French cities.Matthieu Pigasse, who heads the Lazard investment bank in France, said: ""He lacks an essential social dimension and a policy to fight against inequalities in all forms.""""Where are the plans for the suburbs, the fight against poverty and extra efforts for higher education?"" the dealmaker who part owns Le Monde and other media, told Les Echos business newspaper.NEW PLATES AND POOLWhile France has inequality problems, they are not as severe as in other rich countries, OECD data show. This is largely due to the large social transfers, which Macron criticized this month for costing ""too much dough"" and which help explain why French taxes are among the highest in the world.Macron's comment went down poorly with the French left, and others, adding to perceptions that he is out of touch with ordinary folk.Then this week reports emerged that taxpayers' money will fund dinner plates at the Elysee Palace and a new swimming pool at a presidential retreat on the Riviera.Voters are unconvinced his meritocratic push is reducing inequalities. More than half believe they have worsened under his leadership, according to an OpinionWay poll last month.However, Pigasse said: ""I wish him success, because he's the last bastion against populism in France.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to some of the carmakers that Trump has explicitly targeted in his tariffs rhetoric, fell the most, down 1.2 percent. BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 0.8 to 2.4 percent. The STOXX 600 autos sector (SXAP) hit a seven-month low.""The automotive sector is one of the main sectors that could potentially be impacted by import tariffs,"" said Weidenbach, adding that the impact on different German carmakers may depend on how much of their production is U.S.-based.Europe's companies in general are more exposed to the global economy than their U.S. counterparts, making them more vulnerable to countries imposing higher tariffs on goods. Some 18 percent of European company revenues comes from North America and 9 percent from China. Thirty-two percent is derived from emerging markets.U.S. companies get just 4 percent of their revenues from China and 10 percent from Europe, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Multinational sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell 2.5 percent, as the fear of an end to unfettered access to global markets also bruised luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS), LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Moncler (MI:MONC).Industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX, along with French planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). Mining shares (SXPP) tumbled 2.4 percent, tracking a decline in London copper prices amid the escalating trade tensions.Highly valued tech stocks were also selling off as investors shed the sectors that have led the strong equity rally. The tech sector (SX8P) fell 1.4 percent, having hit a 17-year high as recently as Friday.The most impressive falls were in the UK retail and housing sectors.  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares plummeted 10 percent after the British department store warned on profits for the third time in six months, blaming its poor trading on increased competitor discounting and weakness in its key markets.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

125,"Jun 09, 2018 03:52PM ET","With sales boom in mind, Gucci tightens grip on suppliers",nan,"By Sarah WhiteFLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - Kering's (PA:PRTP) fashion powerhouse Gucci is bringing more manufacturing in-house, as luxury firms step up efforts to meet rampant demand from Chinese shoppers with slicker operations. Gucci, which said this week it could one day overtake LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton as the world's top luxury brand by sales, also outlined plans at its strategy update to almost halve its reliance on independent leather goods suppliers. The step comes as labels including Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and France's Vuitton begin to levy greater control over their production or invest in speeding up internal processes to ride a rebound in luxury goods sales.Gucci, one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in 2017 following a flamboyant design makeover, plans to cut its use of independent suppliers to 40 percent of its leather goods production over the long term, from 75 percent now. The Italian brand aims to halve the turnaround time between a product's conception and delivery in store as a result, CEO Marco Bizzarri said, as well as secure the production capacity it needs to match its punchy sales ambitions. ""We want to reduce the lead time, and it's not possible if you're too scattered with small suppliers,"" Bizzarri told reporters, speaking at Gucci's new ""ArtLab"" site outside Florence, where it will do prototypes of bag and shoe designs. ""We also need to make sure other brands are not stealing supply. Because of the growth that we're having we need to protect our artisans,"" Bizzarri added. Italian brands have traditionally worked with an external network of dozens of local artisans on items such as handbags, when French peers Hermes  and Vuitton almost exclusively use their own workshops. Gucci has bought out 10 local suppliers and said it was closing in on another 10, though the shift to what the brand considers internal production will for the most part involve creating joint ventures with external workshops or giving them exclusive contracts.FAMILY WORKSHOPSEven that can help to stabilize production, however, when some manufacturers in Italy are vulnerable.Some are ""tiny, almost family-like workshops which have know-how but where there are often questions over whether they are sustainable, or regarding succession,"" said Olivier Salomon, managing director at consultancy Alix Partners in Paris.Other brands with a big focus on leather goods like Milan-based Prada (HK:1913) are grappling with these issues too as they also consider taking more production in-house, partly to help nurture new generations of skilled workers. ""One of the problems with outsourcing is one of quality. You need artisans ... and the problem with craftsmanship is one of training, you can't find these kind of people everywhere,"" Prada Chairman Carlo Mazzi told Reuters, as the label inaugurated a new industrial site in eastern Tuscany on Friday.While traditional skills are in demand, fashion brands are also seeking to build-up internal expertise at a time of radical innovations in the materials used in fashion. Gucci's Bizzarri cited leather grown in laboratories as one potential industry game-changer, albeit a far-off one. Part of Gucci's ArtLab remit is research and development, as the brand seeks to perfect production methods new and old.At the site on Thursday, workers buffed python skins dyed orange and blue for use in samples; elsewhere, a robot stress-tested sneakers, rhythmically bending them back and forth. ""If you internalise production you are able to experiment much more in terms of innovation,"" Bizzarri said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

126,"Jun 08, 2018 01:11PM ET",Italy's luxury brand Prada paves way for family succession: CEO,nan,"VALVIGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Prada (HK:1913) Chief Executive Patrizio Bertelli said on Friday his family would not sell its 80 percent stake in Italy's biggest luxury goods group and said his son Lorenzo may one day head the company.The Milan-based firm is run by the husband-and-wife team of Patrizio Bertelli and designer Miuccia Prada, whose grandfather founded the label in 1913. The couple's eldest child Lorenzo, 30, joined Prada to run its digital communications last year, the company confirmed this week following a Bloomberg report. Bertelli said his son was being prepared to take over. ""Lorenzo is getting ready to become one day - if he wants to - the head of Prada,"" Bertelli said, at the inauguration of a production site in Italy, although 72-year-old also said it was ""too early to retire.""The succession question comes as Prada looks to cement early signs of a turnaround following several years of falling sales. Chinese consumer demand rebounded in the past 18 months, fuelling rapid growth for some rivals like Kering's Gucci (PA:PRTP) or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, but Prada was slow to catch on to trends such as the rise of high-end streetwear like sneakers. It is also playing catch up with online sales, and trying to build a bigger digital presence by forging ties with influential fashion bloggers, especially in China. Sales trends improved in the second half of 2017.Other famed Italian fashion houses such as Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) are also in the midst of a turnaround, as some brands struggle more than others to grab younger shoppers' attention with new products and eye-catching looks. That has sparked speculation that names like Prada or Ferragamo could become takeover targets, though both are tightly controlled by families seen as unlikely to let go easily.""We're not selling, we'll never sell,"" Prada's Bertelli said, adding that there were no acquisitions in sight either because of ""really crazy"" prices.The luxury industry's biggest, cash-rich players - French conglomerates  Kering  and LVMH - have succeeded in picking up some Italian family brands in recent years, however. LVMH grabbed jeweler Bulgari in 2011, while Kering bought into smaller Italian jewelry brand Pomellato in 2013.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

132,"May 30, 2018 01:20PM ET",Moncler aspires to give its puffer jackets a monthly makeover,nan,"By Sarah White, Giulia Segreti and Claudia CristoferiMILAN (Reuters) - Italian label Moncler (MI:MONC) has already turned luxury fashion on its head by transforming casual skiwear into trendy items with its sleek puffer jackets.Now it wants to lead the sector in fast-paced production, and Chief Executive Remo Ruffini said he hopes his company can one day offer new products for all of its down coat collections on a monthly basis. The shift highlights luxury brands' race to adapt to changing shopping habits as the sector attracts younger consumers and those more influenced by the fast pace of social media, who are constantly seeking eye-catching new items. Moncler has already announced that, under what it calls its ""Genius"" strategy, it will from June offer each month a limited edition collection of down jackets specially produced for the label by a world famous designer, starting with Japanese streetwear king Hiroshi Fujiwara.But the shift could be more wide-ranging, Ruffini said, eventually encompassing Moncler's main puffer ranges - which account for 80 percent of its sales - and which are now phased into stores on a more drawn-out basis. ""I think and I hope that if everything goes well, we will work on a monthly basis for all collections,"" Ruffini told Reuters in an interview at Moncler's headquarters in Milan, adding that the overhaul was still in its early stages.""When you go to a store in July you find one concept, and when you go in September you find a totally different one, the one launched in that moment,"" he said. The overhaul also responds to a particular Moncler challenge: how to keep growing a business with a market value of 10 billion euros ($11.5 billion) that revolves around one star product, down jackets that can cost up to 2,000 euros.Ruffini is credited with reviving the company after buying in 2003 what was then a French mountain gear brand on the verge of bankruptcy.Adapting to the Genius plan involves an upgrade of technology and logistics, including investments in a new facilities center in Piacenza, near Milan, tightening oversight of Moncler's supply chain and bringing quality control in-house. ""It's really challenging. It's a change of culture in the company from logistics to production,"" Ruffini said, adding that most of the manufacturing will remain outsourced so that Moncler can easily raise or cut production at will. ""Flexibility is particularly important when you think on a monthly basis,"" the 56-year-old Italian entrepreneur said. Since Ruffini snapped up Moncler, the company's valuation has soared and it now trades at a premium to many luxury peers. Analysts have warned further upside could be limited, but are encouraged by the Genius strategy. (Graphic: Moncler recommendations May 30 - https://reut.rs/2L9behN)NEW ENERGYRuffini said Genius sales would be small, yet higher than the Gamme Bleu and Gamme Rouge catwalk collections which Moncler said in November would be phased out.""It's not a matter of revenues and top line... it's to give energy to the brand,"" he said. Analysts estimate those ranges accounted for less than 10 percent of Moncler's 1.2 billion euro in annual sales.Despite the Instagram-friendly nature of glitzy launches planned in stores, Ruffini said he wanted Genius, and the brand as a whole, to appeal in the same way to ""millennials and the ladies with the Hermes bag"", but without being skewed towards younger generations, seen as more fickle.""We believe the benefits from greater frequency drops far outweigh low probability execution risks from this revised approach,"" said Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Over time we may see other luxury apparel brands follow.""Luxury labels from Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to LVMH (PA:LVMH)'s Louis Vuitton do several mid-season collections beyond the traditional two a year, though none match the frequency of Moncler's planned ""Genius"" collections. ""The main concern with Moncler is the fashion risk,"" said Chiara Rotelli, an analyst at Mediobanca. ""The Genius project is reducing that concern ... showing that it is able to enlarge its proposition to reach a wider customer base."" Moncler's knitwear, shoes and accessories are also attracting more customers, but will never outshine the main product. ""I will always base my strategy on jackets, it's the uniqueness of Moncler,"" Ruffini said.(Graphic: Moncler catches up with  Kering  - https://reut.rs/2JgmXNZ)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

134,"May 24, 2018 07:31AM ET",Fashion and sport brands clash in luxury sneakers race,nan,"By Giulia SegretiMILAN (Reuters) - What do you get when luxury fashion meets sport? $10,000 sneakers.High-end brands such as Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci, Prada (HK:1913) and Balenciaga are increasingly looking to sneakers for growth, putting them in direct competition with sportswear giants like  Nike  (N:NKE), Puma  and Adidas (DE:ADSGn), and giving rise to ever-more striking and expensive designs. Luxury groups say they are now increasing investments and marketing budgets to face down their new opponents. ""When I saw sneakers were going to be a thing, I fought it for a bit,"" Salvatore Ferragamo's (MI:SFER) designer Paul Andrew said at a conference. ""We're definitely now investing heavily in that category, getting in very specialized people"". Global sales of sneakers - or trainers - rose 10 percent to 3.5 billion euros last year, outperforming a 7 percent rise in handbags, according to consultancy Bain & Co. ""It's not really even a trend anymore - it's become a category,"" said Bruce Pas, Men's Fashion Director at U.S. department store Neiman Marcus. Both luxury groups and sports companies are looking to cash in on a booming market. Premium sneakers can start at around $400 but can easily rise as high as $3,000, for a pair of Christian Louboutin's leather, crystal-embellished sneakers.Limited editions can sell for well over $10,000, including the Chanel X Pharrell Hu Race Trail or Nike's Air Jordan 3 Retro DJ Khaled Grateful. Sneakers are a big driver of the luxury shoe business, which accountancy firm EY says is the fashion industry's fastest-growing area.The rise of luxury sneakers is part of the growing influence of casual and streetwear in high-end fashion, where it is now acceptable to team sneakers with a tailored suit.Upmarket brands are tapping into street style to refresh their looks and young buyers are driving the shift. ""Millennials"" - born between the early 1980s and mid-90s - already represent a third of the luxury market, according to Bain. Several luxury group executives recently noted the importance of sneakers for their business and the need to step up their game to face the rising competition. Emilio Macellari, finance chief of Italian luxury goods company Tod's (MI:TOD) - a pioneer in the sector, having launched its first Hogan luxury sneaker in 1986 - said ""there is no brand that is not currently considering its (sneaker) offer"". Pointing out how times are changing, he said luxury brands were now ""under attack"" from sportswear companies, on top of the usual competition from their luxury peers.But so-called ""sneakerisation"" could steal market share from more traditional and formal-looking footwear, industry operators say. ""After many seasons of comfortable shoes, it will be hard to bring women back on heels,"" said Federica Montelli, head of fashion at Milan's renowned la Rinascente department store.BLUE SNAKE AND PROFIT MARGINSIn central Milan a pair of Nike's black leather, ankle-high Air Jordan 5 Retro Premium sneakers sell for over 400 euros ($470). Only steps away, in one of the city's most exclusive shopping areas, clients buy a pair of Gucci's ACE made with the GG logo canvas, with a blue snake-leather detail for 450 euros.""What has changed is competition, with a clear overlap,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, partner at Bain & Co. ""Luxury consumers are buying Nike and Adidas and vice-versa"". Ilaria, a young saleswoman in Milan streetwear shop One Block Down, said that many customers walk in carrying shopping bags from the nearby luxury boutiques.Sports groups say they are not worried by the competition. ""If (luxury groups) go the sports way... it is only positive,"" said Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said. ""If that is a trend that pulls the sneaker market up, we can only be happy.""Analysts also say the intensifying competition is unlikely to erode profit margins because the market is expanding. ""There is large space for prices moving up,"" said Erwan Rambourg from HSBC. ""The 'luxurisation' of sneakers could possibly impact margins positively"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

143,"Apr 25, 2018 03:40AM ET","Kering, Credit Suisse earnings fail to boost European shares",nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares declined on Wednesday in early deals as worries over rising bond yields trumped a slew of well-received earnings updates from  Kering  and  Credit Suisse , while  Shire  bounced after accepting an improved offer from Takeda. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.5 percent, pulling further away from its highest level since the beginning of February, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.4 percent.Concerns over higher bond yields continued after the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury breached the symbolic 3 percent level on Tuesday, raising questions over the relative attractiveness of equities and sectors which pay steady dividends.On the day, almost every European sector was in negative territory, with shares in oil and gas stocks among the biggest fallers as the oil price inched away from recent highs. Even some upbeat earnings reports failed to boost sentiment. Shares in Kering (PA:PRTP) were the biggest STOXX gainers, up 7 percent after the luxury goods company posted an impressive performance in its first quarter results thanks to flying demand for its Gucci clothing and handbags.Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) stood out among banks, its shares jumping 4.6 percent after beating first-quarter profit expectations as a revamp at the bank bore fruit.While concerns around semiconductor stocks, in particular those in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain, have weighed on chipmakers this week, STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) saw its shares rise 4.8 percent after an upbeat assessment on second-half demand for its smartphones-focused products.In M&A news, shares in Shire (L:SHP) popped 1.4 percent after saying that it would recommend Takeda's (T:4502) sweetened $64 billion bid offer to shareholders.But a number of companies saw their shares punished. Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) dropped 11 percent after cutting its guidance, while Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa) fell 7.2 after reporting results.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is also teaming up with Spanish brands, international president Winston Cheng said in Madrid.""We are looking for other venues as we expand,"" he told journalists at the World Retail Congress. ""We have one of the highest quality bases of consumers inside China, growing very rapidly.""Both JD.com and Tmall are major sponsors of the congress, an annual gathering for executives, and both held competing lunch events as they made their pitches to brands.In October, JD.com launched Toplife, a platform which aims to woo luxury buyers with same-day deliveries and premium services, including extra clean and secure warehouses with special air filters.It rivals Luxury Pavilion, a similar portal launched in August which is backed by Alibaba's Tmall platform and features products from fashion groups such as Burberry. Tmall launched a membership program for Pavilion users last week.In its pitch to brands, Tmall puts a focus on the technology and customer data it can offer, such as a smart mirror it had on display in Madrid where users can try on different outfits. ""That is how we fundamentally differentiate ourselves from e-retailers. We are not a retailer. We are a platform to enable brands and retailers,"" Tmall President Jet Jing told Reuters.DIGITALISED MARKETJing said brands can get new ideas from China, citing the example of connecting customers in remote Chinese areas to online beauty advisers from cosmetic company Estee Lauder .""It is the best testing bed for all the European brands and retailers to try out in this mobilized and digitalized market for a new way to run a business,"" he said.JD.com puts the focus on its advantage over Alibaba of running all its own logistics, allowing it to promise same and next day delivery on more than 90 percent of orders, as well as its ""zero tolerance"" policy towards counterfeit goods.""Fake goods is a big issue in China. Our focus on authenticity has led to our success,"" Cheng said.Chinese shoppers made up 32 percent of the worldwide luxury market in 2017, more than any other nationality, consultancy Bain & Co said, making it a crucial market for fashion brands.Cheng said Toplife had already signed up 20 brands, including names from the  Kering  (PA:PRTP) group such as Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen.He said they have been attracted by its offer of delivery within one or two hours by white-gloved employees in suits, with the tallest and best-looking chosen for the task, some of them former soldiers.He noted growing Chinese demand for luxury products, with the Gucci brand getting 100,000 searches a day on its site and sales of premium Spanish ham up 700 percent last year. While JD.com is focusing for now on southeast Asia for expansion outside of China, Cheng said the company could eventually make moves into Europe.""There are a lot of offline players and even online players reaching out to us because of our scale and because of our willingness to partner,"" he said, adding that any deal would have to be with ""a very large retailer"".""Europe seems to be a battleground between maybe the Chinese and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),"" he said, noting that the American giant had an advantage because of English being a global language.""When we try to expand, particularly in Europe, we need to make sure we're ready from these two aspects: language and culture.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

150,"Apr 10, 2018 04:30AM ET",Autos drive European shares higher after Xi pledges tariff cut,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, led higher by gains among automakers after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised a considerable reduction in auto import tariffs this year.More broadly Xi's speech helped calm investor jitters over an escalating U.S.-China trade row that roiled markets last week, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark up 0.5 percent by 0756 GMT.The auto index (SXAP) was among the strongest, up as much as 2.1 percent with Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) leading the way.Xi promised to open China's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars in a speech seen as conciliatory amid rising trade tensions with Washington.""We would see this as a major step towards opening the Chinese economy and to easing the very tense trade atmosphere... The primary beneficiaries would be German carmakers and the German economy as a whole,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote.According to their estimates this could lead to earnings tailwinds of up to 4.5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) for German carmakers. BMW is expected to benefit most, followed by Daimler and VW. Xi also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the auto sector ""as soon as possible"" and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector.Elsewhere mergers and acquisitions activity and earnings dominated trade. Bayer (DE:BAYGn) rose 4.9 percent after the WSJ reported that the U.S. Justice Department will allow the German drugs and pesticides group to acquire  Monsanto  (N:MON) in a $62.5 billion deal, after the companies agreed to sell more assets to win antitrust approval.If confirmed the approval would remove the last major obstacle to the deal, which Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said would be highly accretive for the German group.""If the Monsanto deal takes place, the implied portfolio change together with a potential agrochemical cycle recovery might lead to a re-rating,"" Mayer said.LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 4.9 percent to record highs after the Louis Vuitton owner posted better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter, helped by thriving Chinese appetite for luxury goods. Its solid update boosted shares in other luxury companies such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP), up 3.7 percent.Higher-than-expected quarterly revenues lifted TGS Nopec (OL:TGS) up 12.9 percent to lead STOXX gainers.Givaudan was a weak spot after the fragrance and flavor maker reported a weaker-than-expected sales increase during its first quarter despite a boost from new contract wins and acquisitions.According to Thomson Reuters data, STOXX 600 earnings are estimated to rise 3.4 percent in the first quarter, with sales seen up 1.1 percent. Energy companies are expected to be the main drivers of growth. That compares to 18.5 percent earnings growth expected for the U.S.'s S&P 500 (SPX) index.The basic resources index (SXDP) was one of the strongest sectoral gainers, up 1.8 percent, as it recovered from large losses on Monday when stocks with exposure to Russia were hit after the United States unveiled fresh sanctions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

152,"Mar 28, 2018 02:34PM ET",Stella McCartney to buy brand in full from Kering,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and fashion label Stella McCartney said on Wednesday they had agreed to end their 17 year partnership, as the British designer behind the brand buys the 50 percent owned by the French luxury goods group.They did not disclose financial terms for the deal. McCartney, known for her understated designs and commitment not to use fur or leather, had an option until March 31 to buy out half of her label under the terms of the partnership.""It is the right moment to acquire the full control of the company bearing my name,"" McCartney said in a statement. A spokesman for the label declined to comment on how the acquisition would be financed. Following the agreement, Kering will continue to lend some support and services to the brand for a year, and the split will be final by the end of the first quarter of 2019, according to a spokeswoman for the French group.McCartney will stay on as a board member of the Kering Foundation, which works to stop violence against women, and the companies said she would collaborate with Kering ""in the field of sustainable fashion"" - an area that has become her hallmark. London-born Stella McCartney, daughter of the Beatles' Paul McCartney, first made her mark at Richemont-owned fashion label Chloe. She launched her eponymous label in partnership with the Gucci Group, formerly a division of what is now Kering, in 2001. Kering, run by Francois-Henri Pinault, the scion of the group's founding family, does not break out earnings for the brand, but it is a much smaller contributor to sales than labels such as Gucci or Balenciaga. The conglomerate's latest financial report said revenue growth at Stella McCartney was buoyant but had slowed in 2017 compared to previous years.The split with Stella McCartney comes as Kering prepares to spin off German sportswear label Puma to its own shareholders, as it focuses more squarely on its high-margin luxury brands and builds up those with a high growth potential. Stella McCartney presented her latest collection for next autumn and winter at Paris' sumptuous Opera Garnier in early March. It was the label's first show catwalk show to mix men and women's clothing, and some designs such a jacket were made from materials like alter nappa, an alternative to leather.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

154,"Mar 16, 2018 03:01PM ET",Kering says Swiss activities tax-compliant,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) has complied with its tax obligations in Switzerland, it said on Friday, responding to newspaper reports alleging that the company used a Swiss-based scheme to evade taxes on earnings from brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. France's Mediapart and Germany's Der Spiegel alleged that Kering had saved on taxes it should have paid in countries such as Italy by billing some business carried out elsewhere to a Swiss site. Mediapart, which cited documents linked to an Italian tax investigation, said it estimated that since 2002 Kering had saved 2.5 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in tax in this manner. The newspapers said that wholesale activities -- the sale of products to retailers such as department stores -- are largely carried out by Kering staff in cities such as Paris, Milan or London but that the group benefited from a low tax rate of about 8 percent by billing them through the Swiss region of Ticino. Kering said that its Swiss businesses, home to more than 600 employees, were an important part of its inventory management, billing and supply chain logistics and that their activities were directly linked to its brands. Kering said that all of its companies there carried out tangible business activities""The group pays its due taxes in Switzerland, in compliance with the law and the fiscal status of the company. This business operating model is known by French and other competent tax authorities,"" Kering said in a statement sent to Reuters. The bulk of the allegations are centered on Italian fashion brand Gucci, which is subject to a tax investigation by prosecutors in Milan. Police raided Gucci offices in Milan and Florence late last year. [nL8N1O20DQ]Kering has said it is collaborating with that investigation.The group run by French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, scion of Kering's founding family, said in February that it had yet to set aside funds linked to the investigation. ""The related tax risk cannot be measured reliably at this point in the proceedings and therefore no specific provision was recorded in 2017,"" it said in its last annual report.

158,"Feb 20, 2018 03:54AM ET",Fashion firms dither over instant shopping on the catwalk,nan,"By Sarah WhitePARIS (Reuters) - Fashion labels may be falling over themselves to court young, smartphone-wielding shoppers, but there's one millennial-inspired trend that is only catching on slowly: catwalk shows where clothes are available to buy instantly rather than months later. The timing of product drops is becoming an experimental battlefield for luxury goods companies juggling a constant demand for novelty and the lengthy manufacturing cycles needed to make sumptuous fabrics or hand-stitched handbags. Britain's Mulberry is the latest label to usher in a ""see now, buy now"" model - cutting out the usual six-month delay in delivering a runway collection to stores - two years after Burberry embraced the idea and set rivals abuzz. Yet it is still far from becoming an industry standard even as brands take other steps to modernize, with more frequent collections rather than just two a year, and questions linger over its benefits.At Mulberry, known for its leather handbags made in southwest England, the strategy should boost sales of full price goods, extending the time they are in store before seasonal clearance periods, said Chief Executive Thierry Andretta.Its linen suits unveiled during London Fashion Week last Friday are already on sale, while most brands still present spring and summer looks in September and deliver them around March.""We make luxury that is relevant for a younger generation,"" Andretta said in an interview in the weeks before the show. ""As soon as they've found something online they want to buy it immediately. If it's not there, in the majority of the cases ... they will not wait for months."" But some early adopters of 'see now, buy now', such as U.S.-based designer Tom Ford, found it backfired. Ford dropped his one-season dalliance with the concept in 2017, and was quoted in industry media saying that his label lost out on a month of selling while clothes sat in storage before the runway presentation.""There are people who have been tempted by this model and have turned back on it,"" said Eve Corrigan, whose Paris-based business Malhia Kent makes fabrics for Chanel, LVMH's Louis Vuitton and other labels. BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARSOne challenge is to keep up the pace of sales after an initial rush when an ""instant"" collection goes live. Burberry tweaked the format at its latest show, offering some items such as 350-pound ($490) sneakers in rainbow-colored check for sale immediately, with others to land in the coming months. That twist comes as Italy's Moncler, maker of 1,000 euro-plus puffer jackets, ditches the usual fashion calendar altogether in favor of monthly product launches. It will unveil designs under the new strategy later on Tuesday ahead of Milan Fashion Week, and aims to start selling the first ones in June.Much depends on brands' aspirations and business set-up, including whether, like Mulberry, they own the majority of their own shops, meaning they are less reliant on the needs and orders of intermediaries like department stores.To make the instant shopping format work, fashion houses would have to order textiles well in advance of shows, and get early feedback from commercial buyers so they can avoid the risk of unsold stocks piling up. But many argue designers need to be free to make last-minute changes before a show and run with their emotions.""Our clients would be tempted to make more low-key clothing to ensure it will be sold, which would be detrimental to their creativity,"" Corrigan said.Top couture houses from France's Christian Dior, part of LVMH, to Italy's Gucci, owned by  Kering  (PA:PRTP), have so far resisted the instant runway-to-shop model. ""The fact we question the way of working is intelligent,"" said Laurent Garigue, a London-based luxury textile producer.""(But) we have to make sure fashion doesn't become less beautiful by organizing it in a way that makes it easier - it's about blood, sweat and tears.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

159,"Feb 18, 2018 07:10PM ET","Chanel, Farfetch pair up for digital push at fashion label's stores",nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - French couture house Chanel has taken a minority stake in London-based online retailer Farfetch, the companies said on Monday, as part of a tie-up to develop digital services such as chats to connect the label's clients with store assistants. Luxury goods companies worldwide are trying to expand their digital services to court younger or more tech-savvy clients.Privately-owned Chanel, famed for its tweed suits and quilted leather handbags, has been an outlier in the industry push to move more shopping online by deciding not to roll out web sales of its clothing and leather goods. Under the new deal, the label will not sell its wares through Farfetch but would work with the platform in coming years on digital innovations linked to customer services, said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's fashion president. These could include smartphone applications allowing people to flag their preferences and sizes online before entering a store, meaning assistants can cater to their needs, or help them locate an item spotted in a magazine for instance, he said. ""This is about how to enrich our relationship with our customers,"" Pavlovsky told Reuters, adding that Chanel was not trying to take a ""Big Brother"" approach of tracking clients but giving those who wished it more tailor-made assistance. He did not give any financial details about the tie-up. Farfetch has long been tipped for a stock market listing, and investment banks were recently pitching to work on a U.S. flotation later this year, sources said in January.Farfetch's other investors include Chinese online retailer JD.com (O:JD), French investment company Eurazeo (PA:EURA) and Singapore state investor Temasek. The online retailer's shopping platform connects buyers to luxury fashion items from more 700 boutiques worldwide. The firm has also invested in developing digital functions for stores, which can be adapted to suit its partners. Britain's Burberry said on Thursday it would team up with Farfetch.""The challenge for our luxury industry is that our clients are used to ultra-personalized experiences,"" Farfetch's Portuguese founder and Chief Executive Jose Neves said. ""When you walk into a store, people don't know you.""Chanel already offers select clients some digital support but wants to make this more widely available, Pavlovsky said, adding the firm would start testing new services this year.The brand has close to 200 stores. It sells cosmetics, eyeglasses and perfumes online, but says releasing other items on the web would make them less exclusive.Rivals such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton,  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci or Hermes (PA:HRMS) have taken a different tack, chasing sales growth by selling more online.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Unlike some competitors it does not carry stock.Analysts expect online shopping to account for a quarter of all luxury goods sales by 2025, up from close to 10 percent at present, making it a major motor of growth in an industry trying to ride a recovery in demand from key Chinese consumers.Burberry's performance has recently lagged that of many of its competitors and the UK label is in the midst of an overhaul as it looks to move more upmarket.Farfetch will provide around-the-clock deliveries in London of Burberry's latest collection in the 24 hours after it is presented during the city's fashion week on Feb. 17, the brand said.The catwalk show will be the last by designer Christopher Bailey, who is leaving after 17 years at Burberry.

163,"Feb 13, 2018 04:47AM ET",European shares go sideways as skepticism looms on recovery,nan,"By Julien PonthusLONDON (Reuters) - European shares faltered on Tuesday morning in contrast with Wall Street which bounced back for a second day overnight, and as a flurry of corporate results failed to lift indexes. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was just slightly negative, down 0.02 percent at 0920 GMT with bourses and sectors trading sideways in the absence of a clear upward or downward trend. ""Wall Street is looking to build on a big two-day rally but there is as yet no real conviction behind this, as evidenced by the softer performance in European indices this morning,"" commented Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. ""We are yet to build consensus around this rally and it could run into trouble if conviction is lacking"", he added.A flurry of corporate results yielded both positive and negative reactions on European trading floors. The telecoms sector suffered after Telenet reported 2017 results. The Belgian operator fell over 7 percent, the worst performer on the STOXX. Shares in Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) slid 2.6 percent despite the luxury group reporting stronger-than-expected Q4 sales growth. Rival LVMH lost 1.2 percent. Smelter Aurubis fell about 4 percent after its results fell short of the average forecast in a Reuters poll. On the other hand, shares in French video game producer Ubisoft rose 5.1 percent after a trading update which took it to the top of the STOXX 600. Randstad, the world's second-largest staffing company and a bellwether for the economy, saw fourth-quarter core profit rise 15 percent, buoyed by a strong recovery in the European job markets. Its shares gained 0.9 percent. European travel group TUI was the best performer of the FTSE and rose 4.6 percent after reporting that summer bookings for Turkey were recovering, echoing comments by rival Thomas Cook and adding to hopes that pressure on profit margins for tour operators may ease.The travel and leisure sector was among the few to trade firmly in positive territory, up 0.9 percent, with Lufthansa and Easyjet up 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

165,"Feb 09, 2018 01:20PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/INFLATION GYRATIONS Whether world markets settle down now or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave may be determined by next week's consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States.They are expected to show U.S. consumer prices rising at the 2.1 percent year-on-year rate they grew at in December but any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes, potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds - don't forget this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2 U.S. jobs data showed the strongest year-on-year wage growth since 2009.If U.S. inflation does accelerate, markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3 percent level that several investment banks had set as their year-end target.U.S. inflation is not the only game in town though. British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England's recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation.(Graphic: Market inflation expectations on the rise - http://reut.rs/2BlqSVJ)2/VOLATILITY DON'T PULL YOU THROUGHMarket volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded this week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history. Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wall Street's near 10 percent drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War.Have we now moved to a ""high vol"" regime from a ""low vol"" regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues next week. Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is.(Graphic: S&P 500 fall vs historical average - http://reut.rs/2Bl8MDd)3/CAN EUROPEAN EARNINGS TEMPT BACK THE BULLSAnother heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent vol jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region's stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back.So will the results will stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts' predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago.What's more, the earnings ""beats"" in Europe are currently 48.2 percent - compare that to 78 percent for the S&P500 index. Even in Europe, ""beat"" levels in an average quarter run at 50 percent.Companies due to report next week include Heineken (AS:HEIO),  Kering  (PA:PRTP),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Airbus (PA:AIR), Nestle (S:NESN), Allianz (DE:ALVG),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Eni (MI:ENI). One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those who fall short of expectations. In the end though it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings.(Graphic: Fading earnings enthusiasm - http://reut.rs/2Bhj1Z7)4/HAPPY (LUNAR) NEW YEAR It's a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays. Even though the People's Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth. It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year - and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week. That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks' cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with. Longer term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January and haven't kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening. Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese new year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC's gift.(Graphic: China keeps cash conditions easy - http://reut.rs/2Eui4ys)5/SUBMERGING MARKETS?Emerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak out leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up.EM dollar debt spreads -- the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries -- have been rising but it hasn't been earthshaking and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017.That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch the resistance could be broken.One of the long-running EM issues - Jacob Zuma's departure from South Africa's Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn't want interest rates to go up.(Graphic: EM Spreads - http://reut.rs/2BOuSiu)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

169,"Jan 31, 2018 01:31PM ET",Farfetch gears up for fashion store of the future,nan,"By Sarah WhiteLONDON (Reuters) - London-based online fashion retailer Farfetch plans to roll out new technology to revolutionize shopping in stores in the coming months, its chief executive said on Wednesday. Farfetch, long tipped for a stock market listing, runs an online marketplace allowing people to buy luxury clothes or accessories from more than 700 brands and boutiques worldwide.After buying London boutique Browns in 2015, Farfetch is also working on technology that allows customers to flag a wish list of items via their phones when they stroll into a store, or even tell assistants that they are not feeling chatty.Portuguese CEO and founder Jose Neves, who previously started a shoe brand, said Farfetch is trialing such services and will start adapting them for other brands or boutiques.""The plan is to this year start rolling out very selectively to other partners,"" Neves said in an interview. ""We think it's a tremendous opportunity and it's actually inevitable. Retail shops still operate in the 80s.""Luxury goods firms including industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) or Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have recently made a big push to sell their wares online, launching and revamping e-commerce sites for various labels. Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) last week said it would bid for full control of Farfetch's larger rival, luxury retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter (MI:YNAP), as it tries to do more on the web.Unlike Yoox, Farfetch does not have to stock inventory. LISTING ON THE CARDS? Online sales of high-end items such as shoes, clothing, jewellery, perfumes and handbags should rise to at least a fifth of the luxury goods market by 2025 from 8 percent in 2016, consultants McKinsey said in a report this week. Neves did not disclose how much Farfetch was investing in technology, and declined to comment on when the firm would turn a profit or potentially float. Farfetch doubled its pool of engineers to just under 1,000 between 2016 and 2017 - out of a total staff of 2,000 - and expects that figure to reach around 1,600 this year, with some 90 engineers working on the ""store of the future"", up from 60 now, Neves said. According to the latest available UK filings, Farfetch revenues increased by 74 percent in 2016 to 151.3 million pounds ($215 million), while net losses widened, to 34 million pounds. Neves said in late 2016 that a flotation could be on the cards in two or three years, while investment banks have recently been pitching to work on a possible U.S. listing, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. A fundraising round in 2016 valued the firm at around $1.5 billion. China's second-biggest e-commerce site, JD.com, has since invested in and partnered with Farfetch.China is one of Farfetch's fastest growing markets, Neves said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

170,"Jan 31, 2018 04:15AM ET",China's young shoppers breathe new life into luxury market,nan,"By Adam Jourdan and Farah MasterSHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Guo Jiaxi is typical of a new generation in China that is driving a sharp revival in luxury spending: young, female and unafraid to spend. An accountant in eastern Suzhou, Guo, 24, likes Coach and Louis Vuitton, and has bought Acne Studios scarves, a Daniel Wellington watch and a Mont Blanc belt as gifts. Of an annual salary of 50,000 yuan ($7,898), she spends one-fifth on luxury items.""Luxury is not a total necessity for me, I suppose, but whenever I've got enough money to spare, then I'll buy,"" she said.Guo and her peer group are behind a dramatic spike in luxury spending in China last year, according to consultancy Bain & Co. They are the key demographic for luxury brands from LVMH to Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and France's Hermes in tapping the world's top luxury consumers.Their willingness to spend - often more than they can afford - comes with a note of caution. These consumers are typically less loyal to traditional brands, swayed by shifting trends online and increasingly looking for deals.""Some of these youngsters, even when they don't really have enough funds, they're still going out and buying luxury products,"" said Huang Yue, 27, who runs the fashion section at the website ""Loving Luxury."" Yue added that the shift to millenials, those aged roughly 20-34, had been dramatic. It spurred the rise of new areas such as luxury ""streetwear"" and sporting attire, which Bain said were behind the recent fast growth.""In terms of the impact on the market, it's really given it a shot in the arm,"" Yue said.Driven by general optimism, attracted by the ease of online shopping and helped along the way by parents who benefited from the country's fast growth and rising home prices, Chinese millennials are buoying the luxury market at home and abroad. Millennial shoppers pushed the Chinese market up to 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) in sales last year, about 20 percent higher than the year before. It is by far the steepest jump in over half a decade of sluggish growth, according to Bain.Luxury goods purchased in China make up 8 percent of the global total, while Chinese shoppers - who make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas - drive 32 percent of sales worldwide.LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said China was a ""very dynamic"" market in which the Louis Vuitton brand was doing well.""China has had a good comeback,"" he told reporters last week. The company has seen a slow recovery in China since a weak start to 2016. Gucci and cognac maker Remy Cointreau are among other well-known companies citing stronger growth in the market.Analysts and industry insiders, however, said shoppers were widening the range of brands they looked at, a challenge for some more traditional players.Tapestry Inc's Coach and British fashion house Burberry both reported weaker ends to last year. Prada – which had seen sales slump in China - has been building partnerships with influential internet personalities and launched an online shop in December. Online retailers like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and JD.com have launched their own luxury platforms and lured in brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. ""Chinese consumers are going through several changes,"" Liao Jianwen, chief strategic officer at JD.com, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that shoppers now want high-quality products at ""competitive prices."" BRAND NEW SECOND HANDEven as consumers spend more, they are becoming thriftier.Zhang Xia, 24, an investment professional in the southern metropolis of Chongqing, has bought Dior bags, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari jewelry, and once paid 150,000 yuan ($23,695) for a Piaget watch. She's now less easily won over.""Increasingly what I'm after now is original patterns and designs,"" she said, adding that, like Guo, she sometimes gets help paying for her purchases. ""It's more about the quality and feel of the product, so if I can find that I won't necessarily choose a luxury brand.""The shift has meant the rise of areas not previously seen as being in the same space as traditional luxury, including casual wear, ""streetwear"" and even premium sports clothing.Shoppers are also more willing to buy used goods. That means people making new purchases can sell their goods later, defraying the cost of a big-ticket item.""Because people know that they can sell things on second hand, they're not so strict with their luxury budgets,"" said Deng Yun, 33, the chief operating officer of used luxury goods trading platform www.luxusj.com.He said the most popular brands on the site were handbags from Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci and Fendi. Chloe, owned by luxury house Richemont, is popular with younger shoppers, while Hermes still has good cachet, he added.The premium sportswear firm Lululemon, seeing strong demand from China’s youth, is now ""focused on exploring and developing new approaches to capture this audience,"" said Amanda Casgar, Lululemon’s Asia Pacific director of brand & community.Winning over the parents of young shoppers like Guo could be helpful too – they are often a source of funds for a generation increasingly inclined to borrow or use credit.""Of course my salary is pretty low, so mum and dad do help me out a little,"" Guo said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

174,"Jan 17, 2018 01:10AM ET","China luxury sales rebound as millennials snap up cosmetics, handbags: report",nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's luxury goods market is back in fashion.Domestic sales of Gucci handbags to Chanel cosmetics, sluggish in China for years, rose at the fastest pace in over half a decade last year and are poised to consolidate the gains in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co.That could provide a major fillip for brands targeting the world's top luxury spenders, though who benefits most will depend on which brands are able to lure in China's big-spending youth - now the driving force in the market.Sales of luxury goods in China hit 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) last year, up around 20 percent from the year before, Bain & Co said in a report on Wednesday. That's the sharpest growth since 2011, when luxury sales started to be hit by slower economic growth and a fierce crackdown on corruption.China's shoppers are the biggest spenders worldwide on luxury products, making up 32 percent of the 262 billion euros ($308 bln) global market last year and propelling France's LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP).""It's essentially been a flattish market for the last five years; now 2017 is plus 20 percent, that's an amazing rebound,"" said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain, adding lower pricing and government support were key drivers.The sharp rise - which saw particularly strong growth for women's clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, shoes and handbags - follows tepid growth in 2016 and dips in both 2015 and 2014.Beijing has been pushing for greater domestic spending, cracking down on shopping agents known as ""daigou"" bringing products into China from overseas, and cutting high tax rates on imported luxury goods sold in the country.China's domestic market makes up 8 percent of global luxury sales, according to Bain, and despite fast growth at home Chinese shoppers still make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas.MILLENNIAL DRIVERSBain said China's luxury market should also see robust growth this year ""fueled by millennials and ready to wear"" attire, though the growth rate would likely slow down to ""low-mid teen"" levels given the fast growth in 2017.The revival is being driven by China's tech-savvy millennial generation aged between 20 to 34, who generally prefer ready-to-wear and fast fashion over more traditional design, helping propel new areas like luxury casual wear and sports wear.""This is a new China coming in as opposed to the old China coming back,"" said Lannes.That shift creates a challenge for more traditional brands like Prada (HK:1913), which is having to play catch up with newer rivals like Coach.Others like Hermes (PA:HRMS), France's LVMH and Kering are seeing revived appetite from China, helping boost their global sales last year.Luxury spirits makers, including China's own Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) and France's  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP), saw a pick up in China sales too.Lannes added the fast growth would see winners and losers emerge, depending on who could crack the code of China's youth.""A new China is emerging with new consumers that were not there five years ago that have different profiles, different expectations and different tastes,"" he said.

176,"Jan 11, 2018 03:26PM ET",Luxury group Kering to spin off Puma to its own shareholders,nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Pamela BarbagliaFRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) plans to spin off German sports brand Puma (DE:PUMG) to the French conglomerate's shareholders to focus squarely on its luxury brands. Kering said on Thursday it planned to distribute 70 percent of Puma shares to its investors, leaving it with only a 16 percent stake, confirming an exclusive Reuters report.Puma shares were down 4.4 percent at the close as some investors worried about the company losing a powerful backer. Kering stock was down almost 1 percent.The deal comes after a recent turnaround at Puma, which struggled for years following Kering's 5.3 billion euros ($6.4 billion) purchase in 2007. The French firm, meanwhile, has long wanted to focus purely on its high-margin luxury business, where it rivals larger groups such as French conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH). ""We found ourselves in a sort of imbalance, linked to the outperformance of the luxury sector,"" Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists, adding the group would also look at options to shed its remaining sportswear label, Volcom. Kering is a little more than 40 percent controlled by France's Pinault family, which would receive about 29 percent of the sporting goods company, while Puma's free float would stand at about 55 percent. The French company was retaining a stake in Puma to reap some benefits from the brand's recovery, Duplaix said, as Kering will make no cash gains from the deal. The price of the transaction, which will be put to Kering shareholders in April at the group's annual meeting, has yet to be determined, he said. The disposal was likely to be a boost for Kering shares, analysts said. ""The Puma divestiture materializing sooner - rather than later - will add oomph to the stock,"" Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca said in a notePUMA TURNAROUNDUnder Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, appointed in 2013, Puma has refocused on its core sports business after sales were hurt by a shift into fashion products, ousting  Nike  as sponsor of English soccer club Arsenal.A distant third in the global sportswear market behind Nike and Adidas, Puma has focused on the world's most popular sports, such as soccer, running and motorsport, and launched a new drive to tap into booming sales of women's sportswear by appointing singer Rihanna as creative director in 2014. Puma said it welcomed the transaction because it increases the company's free float - or freely tradable shares. It added the move would not affect its current strategy. Puma will likely now be a candidate for inclusion in Germany's mid-cap index (MDAXI), Duplaix said. The sports goods company is due to report full-year results on Feb. 12, having increased its profit guidance three times last year on the popularity of the collections designed by Rihanna, and shoes worn by Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt.Like German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Puma has enjoyed a revival in the United States as shoppers snap up its retro styles instead of basketball shoes, hurting Nike (N:NKE) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA).Puma's shares have risen by 45 percent over the past year, bringing its market capitalization to 5.3 billion euros, back at the level at which Kering bought. Kering emerged as one of the big winners in a luxury goods revival last year as Chinese demand picked up, with a stellar turn at brand-of-the-moment Gucci helping earnings, and other labels such as Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga doing well.

It rivals Luxury Pavilion, a similar portal launched in August which is backed by Alibaba's Tmall platform and features products from fashion groups such as  Burberry  (L:BRBY).Chinese shoppers made up 32 percent of the worldwide luxury market in 2017, more than any other nationality, consultancy Bain & Co said, making it a crucial market for fashion brands. KPMG has projected, meanwhile, that half of China's domestic luxury consumption could come from web sales by 2020. Online shopping has proved a potent earnings driver for fashion brands even if many were initially reluctant to distribute their wares too widely. Top labels such as Kering's Gucci or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton recently started marketing directly to Chinese buyers with their own websites in the country.High-end fashion houses are still wary of alliances with mass-market platforms such as Amazon (O:AMZN), however, fearful they will lose control of their image.JD.com and Alibaba's specialist luxury platforms have already lured several other brands, touting themselves as more exclusive, selective sites.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

192,"Nov 06, 2017 01:20PM ET",Exclusive: France's Lanvin in financial straits as sales slump - sources,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Auditors for Lanvin, France's oldest fashion house, have filed a warning with a commercial court in Paris over financial troubles at the label as it struggles to stem slumping sales, two sources familiar with the company's performance said.The privately-owned label, founded in 1889 and long synonymous with Parisian chic, does not publish its earnings. However, the sources said the company's provisional forecast for the year shows sales will fall 30 percent in 2017 after a 23 percent drop last year.Under French company law auditors have to inform managers and file court warnings when a firm's operations risk being compromised by its financial situation. Lanvin and the auditor did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Lanvin has had trouble inspiring buyers since it stunned the fashion industry two years ago by firing star designer Alber Elbaz. The label has changed artistic director twice since then. ""The auditor has now alerted the Paris commercial court over the company's very worrying situation,"" one of the sources said. The sources said Lanvin needed an injection of cash to buy some breathing space or it may not be able to pay employees' salaries in January. However, they added that a recapitalization originally discussed for September may yet happen by the end of the year. The company is majority held by Chinese-born businesswoman Shaw-Lan Wang. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. They forecast that losses were set to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017.STRUGGLING FOR ORDERSLanvin's financial struggles come as rivals including France's Louis Vuitton, part of LVMH (PA:LVMH), and Italy's Gucci, owned by  Kering  (PA:PRTP), enjoy a sales bounce driven by resurgent demand from China. New artistic chief Olivier Lapidus - who has designed menswear for Balmain as well as wedding dresses and furniture -- has yet to make his mark. Industry analysts acknowledge brand reiventions can take several seasons before translating into an earnings boost. Lanvin unveiled its latest collection in September. Orders at the showroom, where designs are presented to department store buyers, were down about 50 percent on the previous year, a third source familiar with the matter said.Lapidus's collection - a sober array of skimpy mini-dresses, many in black or imprinted with an assortment of letters evoking the Lanvin brand - was put together in 42 days after his appointment in July. ""The buyers are struggling to figure out Lanvin and were thrown by the sudden appearance of the logo on the clothes,"" the third source added.More ostentatious branding has worked well for other labels in recent years, including Christian Dior, although it was traditionally not an approach taken by Lanvin.Lapidus's predecessor, Bouchra Jarrar, had brought in a more tailored style - a shift from Elbaz's more exuberant, frilly designs - that also failed to reignite sales. Lanvin has been closing unprofitable stores and cutting advertising spending to control costs. Named after founding French ""couturiere"" Jeanne Lanvin, the label employed some 300 staff at the end of 2016.Wang, a media magnate based in Taiwan, owns 75 percent of Lanvin, with the remainder held by Swiss businessman Ralph Bartel, who stepped down from the firm's board in July. Bartel has previously offered to inject extra capital into the label in exchange for majority control.Lanvin has shaken up its management in recent months with a series of board changes, including the appointment of Nicolas Druz, who was a close advisor to Wang and has just been appointed deputy managing director.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Hermes is also known for its printed silk scarves and neckties and makes perfume and watches, but its leather division - home to coveted handbags that are often only available through a waiting list - is its biggest revenue driver. Sales in that unit were up 12.2 percent in the first half of the year at constant exchange rates, while revenue across the group grew 9.7 percent.The broader luxury goods industry is enjoying a comeback after several years as Chinese demand improves following a slowdown, and younger shoppers worldwide show a growing taste for high-end goods, boosting online sales.Many firms are wary about 2018, however, as comparatives become less favorable following a buoyant year for growth. A strengthening euro is also making a dent in earnings when converted into the currency, and could put off some buyers.Hermes is due to report third quarter sales on Nov. 8.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

200,"Oct 12, 2017 11:43AM ET","Italy's Gucci bans fur, joining others in seeking alternatives",nan,"By Sarah WhitePARIS (Reuters) - Italy's Gucci will stop using fur in its designs from next year, joining a growing number of fashion houses looking at alternatives after coming under pressure from animal rights activists and changing consumer tastes. Gucci, part of Paris-based luxury group Kering (PA:PRTP), has paraded models down the catwalk in luxurious fur coats in the past and creative director Alessandro Michele brought in loafers and sling-backs lined with kangaroo-fur two years ago. But the brand said it would now join an alliance of fur-free companies, adding it would sell off remaining accessories and clothing made with animal fur in a charity auction.Gucci has sold some of its mink fur coats for over $40,000.Marco Bizzarri, Gucci's chief executive, said the brand would drop fur starting from its spring and summer 2018 collection and that its new approach had been agreed on with Michele. Gucci has enjoyed a revival under Michele, whose flamboyant, colorful designs have fueled sales over the past two years.Animal rights campaigners said they hoped the move by the Italian fashion house could have a knock-on effect, although it is far from the first label to stop using fur. ""Gucci's decision will radically change the future of fashion,"" Simone Pavesi, manager of animal-free fashion at Italian campaign group LAV. ""As fashion becomes more and more ethical, supply chains that revolve around animals will be a thing of the past."" In June, Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, a multi-brand online luxury retailer, adopted a fur-free policy on accessories and clothing sold on the site. Italy's Giorgio Armani last year committed to stop using fur, saying technological progress meant there was no longer any justification for cruelty to animals, while U.S. brand Calvin Klein took the plunge in 1994. Anti-fur protesters have been known to demonstrate outside catwalk shows at fashion weeks around the world to call for an end to practices many see as cruel to animals, and luxury goods buyers - especially younger generations - have become more sensitive to environmental issues, too. Many labels and other luxury groups such as LVMH - owner of Louis Vuitton - are tightening their policies on how leather is sourced from tanneries and how they obtain furs, after a series of scandals over how animals are treated in breeding farms.

207,"Sep 28, 2017 09:24AM ET",A little help from 'Mr Bags'? Prada plays catch-up online in China,nan,"By Pei Li and Giulia SegretiBEIJING/MILAN (Reuters) - At Prada's (HK:1913) Spring/Summer 2018 show in Milan last week in a warehouse papered with giant pop-art comic strips, one name in the coveted front row stood out: Tao Liang, otherwise known as Chinese blogger 'Mr Bags'.His presence alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour and Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni is a sign of Prada's efforts to turn around its business with a focus on the digital sphere - where it has lost ground to rivals including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci.And nowhere is a revival more critical than in China, which accounts for close to a third of all global luxury sales. Crucially, Chinese luxury buyers tend to be younger than elsewhere, and online influencers like 'Mr Bags' carry real clout.Prada, whose profits and sales have been sliding, is playing catch-up with rivals like Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH), Fendi and even the more affordable luxury brands like  Coach  (N:COH). All have raced ahead, forging tie-ups with bloggers and online stars who draw in Asia's smartphone-obsessed youth.While online influencers are a force globally, in China, bloggers like 'Mr Bags', 'Gogoboi' or 'FreshBoy' can have tens of millions of followers, and an outsized say on shopping trends.""The key opinion leaders (KOLs) in China are very powerful. They can promote a product to an extent that no counterparts in Europe can match,"" said Chinese fashion blogger Yang Dong, who has called Prada the ""depressed teenager"" of luxury brands.Yang said Prada's issue in the market was not its design.""When other brands roll out new products, they first come to China weeks in advance and get Internet celebrities and KOLs to lead the trend,"" he said. ""If Prada doesn't put its marketing focus on China, it will lose more ground.""Prada, which appointed a new global digital director, Chiara Tosato, in March, is starting to catch on. Tosato said earlier this month the fashion house would look to drive online sales globally - a change from 2014, when CEO Patrizio Bertelli said it would focus on physical stores.Prada will this year complete the roll-out of its e-commerce platform in key markets including China, South Korea, Japan, Australia and Russia. It's already active in Europe and the United States.Prada declined to comment for this article.RISKS AND REWARDSTo be sure, an online presence won't solve other issues like too many shops, and customers can feel some tie-ups make the brand less aspirational. Online buyers can also be more fickle.Yet Prada's modest online sales target, including sales through e-tailer partners, is for 5 percent of its total by end-2018. For smaller, luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC), it's 6 percent this year - meaning it's already reaping the data dividends that come with online sales.The power of China's online stars means they are impossible to ignore in a country where hundreds of millions of people use microblogs such as Weibo (O:WB).Top fashion blogger 'Gogoboi' has more than 7 million followers there. 'Mr Bags' has a more modest 3 million, but is seen as a leading influencer when it comes to accessories.""When a new bag comes out, probably it doesn't get much attention. But when a fashion blogger or celebrity carries it, it's suddenly out of stock,"" said Yang Lei, a Chinese online shopping agent selling luxury goods back to China.And Prada needs that support.Even as its China sales recovered slightly in the first half of this year, to 302 million euros ($359 million), Prada's global profits fell 18 percent, after a 2016 bottom line that was its lowest since its 2011 initial public offering. Gucci, meanwhile, has seen its sales jump.Of course, slow-to-digital was not Prada's only issue. It also opened more stores than its mega-brand rivals and failed to spot the power of high-margin casualwear.A Reuters analysis of Weibo shows Prada far behind Coach, Gucci and Louis Vuitton in terms of celebrity tie-ups and endorsements online. The brand has 309,000 followers on the popular platform - around a tenth of what Coach can boast.Unlike some rivals, Prada has steered clear of creating limited edition capsule collections in collaboration with influencers. In contrast, a young, fringe Chinese rap group told Reuters they were in talks with Coach over a tie-up - a sign that even potential future stars are being tapped.""The power of digital is a critical part of our global transformation plan ... we are always seeking innovative ways to leverage social platforms,"" a Coach spokesperson told Reuters, adding that partnering with Chinese actress Tiffany Tang and singer Timmy Xu ""is one way we are working with KOLs to build emotional bonds with our consumers.""Prada is finally following, albeit cautiously.""Prada works with influencers in different regions including Asia, but will push into this more and increase collaborations,"" a person familiar with its plans told Reuters, noting Prada is ""not obsessed"" with collaboration and doesn't want to dilute its brand.Alongside 'Mr Bags' in Milan last week, Prada also hosted Filipino fashion blogger 'BryanBoy', Hong Kong actress Tina Leung, South Korean model Irene Kim and Singaporean designer Yoyo Cao.Prada has also done pop-up stores focused on Asia, aiming at millennial shoppers.That push could help reach consumers like Xu Dan, a 28-year-old business development worker in Beijing, who says she reads all 'Mr Bags' posts: ""I trust these bloggers' sensitivity to fashion.""Not everyone will be easy to move.Akane Kishi, a 29-year-old human resources worker shopping in Tokyo, said Prada had just not kept up. ""I often see Fendi on Instagram and think I want to buy that one, in that color,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

208,"Sep 20, 2017 02:20PM ET",LVMH keen to be green as sector embraces ethical fashion,nan,"By Sarah WhitePARIS (Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH), the world's largest luxury group, will invest more to improve its environmental credentials as fashion businesses seek to reassure shoppers who are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly brands, it said on Wednesday. In an industry not known for half-measures and that has drawn flak for cruel or wasteful practices, including some companies embroiled in animal abuse scandals, many luxury houses are trying to improve their ""green"" image. Beyond tightening standards on the way some materials are sourced, including the leather used for handbags, companies are also running the rule over everything from packaging to the type of energy-saving lightbulbs used in their stores. LVMH, which owns fashion house Louis Vuitton and champagne maker Moet & Chandon among its 70 businesses, said its companies would be contributing 30 euros to an in-house carbon fund for every tonne of CO2 emissions they generate from 2018, up from 15 euros previously. Those funds are then earmarked for insulating buildings and other projects. LVMH has rarely publicized its sustainability targets, in contrast with Paris-based rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP). However, it said that it is working on other steps such as raising the share of leather goods sourced from strictly monitored tanneries to 70 percent by 2020. ""Our clients are more and more sensitive to the fact the products they consume should respect the environment,"" its billionaire Chairman Bernard Arnault told journalists. ""Our partners and clients are very attached to this aspect and it seemed logical to make a shift and talk about it a little more.""Consumers have become more sensitive to how clothes and accessories are made, with some fast-fashion companies in particular coming under fire for exploitative working conditions or the use of fabrics that encourage pollution. At the luxury end of the scale, companies have been careful to protect their standards and image, even if they still sometimes parade models in fur coats. France's Hermes was caught in a storm two years ago when a crocodile farm used to supply leather for one of its best-selling handbags was accused of cruel slaughter practices.""What motivates these luxury groups to be more and more vigilant is that they run a reputational risk,"" said Olivier Abtan of Boston Consulting Group. Kering, which owns Gucci and Alexander McQueen, has long promoted its eco-friendly credentials and since 2015 has broken out accounts for the environmental impact of its business. It also works with Stella McCartney, a brand well known for shunning leather or fur in its designs.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

213,"Jul 28, 2017 12:00PM ET",Kors needs to buckle down for Jimmy Choo deal to shine,nan,"By Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale(Reuters) - U.S. retailer Michael Kors (N:KORS) is betting that its acquisition of storied shoemaker Jimmy Choo will give sales a much-needed boost, but lingering problems at Kors' core bag business could delay potential benefits. Kors said earlier this week it would buy Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion and plans to expand the line by opening more stores, especially in Asia.Jimmy Choo, whose towering stilettos were made famous by characters in the popular TV series ""Sex and the City,"" is synonymous with affluence, and somewhat at odds with Kors' image of accessible luxury.It could be argued that Jimmy Choo will give Kors's tumbling sales and stock a leg up, but experts said Kors' expansion plans could dilute the shoemaker's brandname.""Revenue expansion doesn't come from opening stores today, but figuring out how to unlock the e-commerce component and (Kors) haven't proven that they get that either,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.Kors has made this mistake before.Once a seller of popular Mercer and Hamilton handbags, Kors put its wares too quickly on too many shelves, making them ubiquitous.Since then, the company has struggled to come up with designs that have caught the fancy of the well-heeled buyer, who have gravitated toward bags offered by  Coach  Inc (N:COH) and Tory Burch.Kors' has been trying to stem the sales declines by expanding into dresses, menswear and online, but has had little success. ""If (Kors) had fixed their U.S. market, if they'd shown improvements there and then made this acquisition, people would be a lot more comfortable with it,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, analyst at A-Line partners.""For (Jimmy Choo), I could see them opening in another market but I think that is what makes everyone nervous. It is like: ""Look what they did with the Michael Kors brand, are they going to do that to Jimmy Choo?""MULTIBRAND STRATEGYKors' rival Coach Inc (N:COH) faced similar problems not so long ago.But Coach responded quickly, by tightening supplies to department stores to regain its luxury cachet, before diversifying with the buyout of upscale shoemaker Stuart Weitzman in 2015.The company recently bought smaller rival Kate Spade, whose products are a hit with millennials.Both retailers seem to be looking to emulate the successful multibrand strategy employed by European companies LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP), where cash flows from one large brand are reinvested into smaller but faster growing ones.These two companies have grown into luxury powerhouses by buying multiple luxury brands such as Christian Dior, Tag Heuer, Gucci, and Alexander McQueen.Kors' CEO John Idol said the company would look to grow by buying more globally recognized luxury brands like Jimmy Choo.""... we are really looking to build an international luxury company and less so brands that ... have a greater reliance on wholesale than its own retail strategy,"" he said on a conference call on Tuesday.Idol said Jimmy Choo would be run independently with minimal interference from Kors' management and that he doesn't want the two brands to be linked with each other.But analysts said while this could be the right approach for Coach, which has a creative, forward-thinking team, it could overwhelm Kors, at least initially.Kors will need to have a deep understanding of demand, it will have to innovate to drive excitement, maintain the trueness of the brands it acquires, and little or no overlap with other brands in its portfolio, said Jason Green, CEO of customer strategy firm Cambridge Group.For now at least, analysts said, Kors should be looking to walk before it runs.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

214,"Jul 25, 2017 11:20AM ET",Michael Kors to buy luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion,nan,"By Kate Holton and Gayathree GanesanLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Michael Kors (N:KORS) agreed to buy luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo (L:CHOO) for $1.2 billion, snapping up a British company whose towering stilettos have been made famous by celebrity customers from Princess Diana to Kendall Jenner.The move comes two months after rival handbag maker  Coach  (N:COH) struck a deal to buy quirky fashion brand Kate Spade & Co , as so-called affordable luxury companies look at new markets and customer bases to boost flagging sales.Founded by bespoke shoemaker Jimmy Choo in the 1990s, the company makes three quarters of its revenue from selling shoes and has about 150 company-operated retail stores around the world.Its strong performance stands in contrast to Kors, which has lost 65 percent of its market value since 2014 due to fierce competition and a drop in customers at department stores.Michael Kors' shares fell 1.2 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Jimmy Choo shares were up 17 percent at 228.00 pence at 1510 GMT.Jimmy Choo will help Kors expand its footwear portfolio to 17 percent of total sales from 11 percent, Kors said on a conference call.The shoemaker has the potential of raking in $1 billion in sales annually as it opens more stores in Asia, especially China, Kors Chief Executive John Idol said.But the pace of store expansion will be measured, he said.One of the reasons for falling demand for Kors bags was the fact that the company was expanding too fast, which made the brand too ubiquitous.Michael Kors, which has tried to stem a decline in sales by expanding into dresses and menswear and its online business, said in May that sales at stores established for more than a year fell 14 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter. ""We like the target given its solid financial footing, premium luxury positioning, and footwear leadership,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a broker note.Kors will pay a premium of 36.5 percent to Jimmy Choo's closing price before it was put up for sale.MULTI-BRAND STRATEGYBerenberg analyst Zuzanna Pusz said the Kors and Coach deals showed U.S. accessible luxury companies were pursuing the multi-brand strategy found in Europe, where cash flows from one large brand are reinvested into smaller but faster growing ones.Pusz said it was probably a sensible move in the long term, with competition unlikely to wane anytime soon. Companies such as  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP) have implemented the multi-brand strategy to boost revenue. Kering houses brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen.Jimmy Choo put itself up for sale in April after its majority-owner JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family, signaled its intention to focus on consumer goods instead. Jimmy Choo will continue to be led by the same management team, including Creative Director Sandra Choi who joined the company at its inception.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan acted for Michael Kors on the deal, while Merrill Lynch,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Liberum and RBC Europe acted for Jimmy Choo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

215,"Jul 12, 2017 03:40AM ET","Retailers, cyclicals strength give European shares a leg-up; Pearson slumps again",nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - A run higher for energy shares and miners, as well as strong updates from retailers Burberry and B&M helped drive European shares higher in early deals on Wednesday, though renewed pain for publisher  Pearson  (LON:PSON) weighed on the media sector. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4 percent, as were the blue chips.Luxury goods group Burberry was the second-top gainer, rising around 4.3 percent after reporting 3 percent underlying revenue growth in the first quarter, helped by stronger demand in mainland China and continuing good performance in its British market.Peers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH also rose around 1 percent.At the other end of the retail spectrum, discount store operator B&M also rose more 4 percent after issuing a trading update, in which it said that it was on track to achieve profit targets for the full year.With the European second quarter results season just around the corner, expectations see earnings increasing by over 9 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be a rise of over 6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. Strength in oil and metals prices helped lift the heavyweight European energy sector and basic resources, which gained 0.8 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.The cyclical autos sector was helped by a 1.3 percent rise in  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) shares, which gained after the car parts maker said that it was eyeing a sale of a unit to Raicam.Education publisher Pearson continued its slide from the previous day when it announced plan to sell its stake in Penguin Random House, down around 4.6 percent as broker downgrades and cuts to estimates rolled in. Shares in British oil and gas services company Amec Foster Wheeler were hit after confirming that Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was investigating the firm and individuals associated with the business.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

For most brands, this is where the growth is happening,"" Court, a native of France now based in Britain, said in an interview.He declined to comment on reports that Farfetch could be considering a stock market listing later this year or in 2018. The company has said it is not under any pressure to do so.Felix also holds a stake in The Business of Fashion, a blog-turned media company that competes with WWD.com (Women's Wear Daily) for fashion industry insiders, and Mirakl, a Paris-based supplier of software for managing online marketplaces.Felix Capital sold one of its investments, Olapic, to Monotype last year for $130 million.It is also backing Goop to help it expand into online commerce, an expansion move that is helping it close the gap with rivals such as far larger lifestyle site MarthaStewart.com.Felix relies on a board of a dozen advisors made up of entrepreneurs from the retail and media industries, with whom it co-invests.Those advisors include Grita Loebsack, the former chief executive of Gucci's holding company,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, David Marcus, vice president of Facebook's messaging business and Sebastian Picardo, ex-Net-A-Porter chief financial officer.Jon Kamaluddin, an existing advisor, has joined Felix full-time as operating partner.

223,"May 10, 2017 02:45PM ET",Adidas sells golf unit Taylormade to buyout group KPS,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German sportswear maker Adidas (DE:ADSGn) is selling its golf equipment and clothing brands TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners, taking a hit to its earnings. Adidas will get $425 million, around half of which will be paid in cash and the rest in secured notes and contingent considerations, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It added that following the sale, which it expects to conclude later this year, it will book a charge in the high double-digit to low triple-digit millions of euros range.Adidas had put the loss-making business up for sale last year to focus on shoes and clothing. After peaking around 2000, when Tiger Woods was in his prime, the number of people playing golf in the United States, which accounts for half the global golf market, has fallen sharply.Adidas bought TaylorMade in 1997 as part of its $1.4 billion acquisition of French skiing label Salomon, developing it into the world's biggest supplier of golf drivers. It bought smaller Ashworth in 2008 and Adams four years later.But the golf business has been in decline for years. In 2016, it saw sales decrease 1 percent to 892 million euros, accounting for 5 percent of group sales and down by a third from a peak of 1.34 billion euros in 2012. It continued to be loss-making last year. The part of the business Adidas is selling accounts for 60 percent of total golf-related revenue. Separately, it has put its ice hockey brand CCM Hockey on the block.While several other private equity groups showed an interest, rivals such as  Nike  (N:NKE), Puma (PA:PRTP),  Under Armour  (N:UAA) and Callaway Golf (N:ELY) decided not to take on additional brands, sources familiar with the sale process said.Guggenheim advised Adidas on the deal, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) advised KPS.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

228,"Mar 22, 2017 03:38AM ET",Luxury goods group Hermes delivers record 2016 profit margin,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group Hermes (PA:HRMS) said on Wednesday it was starting 2017 on a solid footing after delivering record 2016 profits, providing further evidence of a broader recovery in the luxury goods industry.Chief Executive Axel Dumas nevertheless struck a cautious note for the year given underlying global political and economic uncertainties.""We did better than we expected in 2016 and we are entering 2017 on a solid base but remain cautious in view of an uncertain environment,"" Dumas told a conference call.Hermes, known for its $10,000 Birkin bags and $400 printed silk scarves, said net profits had risen by 13 percent rise to a record 1.1 billion euros ($1.19 billion).Its operating margin hit an historic high of 32.6 percent of sales against 31.8 percent in 2015, while the company also increased its dividend by 12 percent.Hermes added it was keeping an ""ambitious"" medium-term goal for revenue growth at constant exchange rates.The company's sales growth had mainly stemmed from a strong performance at its leather goods arm, which makes 50 percent of group sales, while other divisions also performed well although its watches unit lagged.Hermes joined other luxury companies such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) in reporting an improvement in the sector, which has suffered from slowing demand in China, while Islamist militant attacks in France have also deterred tourists from Europe.Several analysts expect the luxury goods sector to benefit in 2017 from improved consumer sentiment in China, tax cuts under the new U.S. administration and robust Middle Eastern demand due to firmer oil prices.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

232,"Feb 21, 2017 05:57PM ET",Tiffany adds three directors in pact with activist JANA,nan,"By Michael Flaherty(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) on Tuesday struck a surprise deal with JANA Partners, an activist investor and now a shareholder, agreeing to add three directors to its board as the luxury retailer tries to entice younger shoppers and revive struggling sales. The deal with JANA jolted the company's stock and came before the market was even aware the hedge fund was a shareholder. JANA owns around 5 percent of the stock, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jana's precise plan for the company is not yet clear, though some analysts surmised that the $6-billion hedge fund may view Tiffany as a potential takeover candidate.Tiffany, whose jewelry is a status symbol and popular among A-list celebrities and politicians, said on Feb. 5 that CEO Frederic Cumenal was stepping down amid disappointing results. Chairman and previous CEO Michael Kowalski was named interim chief executive while the company searched for someone to fill the role.As part of the deal with JANA, the three new board seats will go to Francesco Trapani, the ex-CEO of luxury retailer Bulgari; Roger Farah, co-chief executive of luxury brand Tory Burch; and James Lillie, a former CEO of consumer products company Jarden Corp. Trapani and Lillie both have a history of dealmaking. Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL) bought Jarden, the maker of Yankee Candle and Crock-Pot cookware, in April 2016 when Lillie was CEO.Trapani, who will be part of Tiffany's CEO search committee, was the CEO of Bulgari when LVMH agreed to buy the company for $5 billion. ""With the company now looking for a new CEO and today’s news in mind, we think (Tiffany’s) strategic prospects have improved,"" said Don Bilson, head of research at event-driven research firm Gordon Haskett. Bilson said Tiffany could be a takeover target for European luxury retailers such as  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP) or LVMH (PA:LVMH). Shares of Tiffany closed up 2.6 percent at $88.41, reaching its highest level since August 2015.JANA is not the first activist in Tiffany's stock. Trian Partners sold out of most of its position in 2012 and fully exited the stock last year. Trian co-founding partner Peter May remains on the company's board. LADY GAGA Tiffany said in January its sales during the November-December holiday period were ""somewhat lower"" than it had expected, hurt by lower consumer spending and a drop in sales at its flagship store in New York. Tiffany's jewelry remains coveted by well-to-do baby boomers who made the brand synonymous with weddings and anniversaries, but it's struggling to attract younger shoppers. The New York-based retailer, with a market value of $11.1 billion, signed on pop star Lady Gaga to appear in an advertisement during the Super Bowl earlier this month - the same event where she was the featured singer at the U.S. football extravaganza's halftime show.Last month, Tiffany said it appointed  Coach  (N:COH) creative director Reed Krakoff as Chief Artistic Officer, a newly created position.Still, the moves to kick-start sales and seek a new chief executive were not enough to keep JANA from pouncing on the stock.JANA's quarterly filing, disclosed last week, had showed no sign of Tiffany shares as of Dec. 31, meaning the market was not even aware that JANA was an investor until Tuesday's announcement, which said JANA and Trapani own 5.1 percent of the company. JANA owns the majority of that position, a person familiar with the matter said.Tiffany's board will increase to 13 seats from ten.The deadline for Tiffany shareholders to nominate directors for its board at the annual meeting is Feb. 25.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

241,"Jan 04, 2017 08:00AM ET",Louis Vuitton senior designer to take lead at French label Chloé: sources,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - French fashion house Chloé is set to name as it new creative director Natacha Ramsay-Levi, second-in-command to Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere, sources told Reuters, as the industry braces for a fresh round of leadership changes.After a year marked by a series of reshuffles at labels such as  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn), Kering's (PA:PRTP) Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga and LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Dior and Celine amid lower luxury spending, 2017 should see another round of musical chairs.The departure of Louis Vuitton's Ramsay-Levi raises questions about the future inner workings of the design studio, headed by Ghesquiere, who made his name at Balenciaga before joining Louis Vuitton in 2013.The appointment would also mean disruption for Richemont-owned Chloé (S:CFR), as Ramsay-Levi is associated with modern looks involving hard fabrics such as leather and synthetics, at odds with the label's traditional flowing romantic silhouettes. Citing the success of Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga, fashion consultants argue that a new artistic direction, if thought out well, can be good for a brand because it gets consumers' attention and can help boost sales. Chloé's current creative director, Clare Waight Keller, a mother of three, decided not to renew her contract, which ends in March. Since her family moved back to London from Paris in June, she had been commuting between the two cities and wished to stop, the sources said. Analysts estimate Chloé, Richemont's (S:CFR) biggest fashion brand, generates sales of around 400 million euros ($417.20 million).  Richemont  and Chloé declined to comment. Industry sources have said Ghesquiere could end his collaboration with Louis Vuitton before his contract was up for renewal, which LVMH said was in 2018.Ghesquiere told French TV channel Canal Plus last year he wished to create his own label but did not provide details. In recent months, several fashion recruitment sources said Louis Vuitton executives were actively scouting for a replacement. LVMH and Louis Vuitton declined to comment on Ramsay-Levi's departure. THE GO-BETWEEN At Louis Vuitton, Ramsay-Levi was a key member of Ghesquiere's team. As design director, she was the only person the studio's designers and assistants regularly spoke to, as Ghesquiere rarely interacted with them directly, former studio employees told Reuters. Ramsay-Levi, who worked more than a decade with Ghesquiere at Balenciaga, on top of being his go-between, understood well his creative directions and translated them into concrete looks and products she asked designers to produce. There has been high staff turnover at Louis Vuitton's design studio the past two years, partly due to the brand's long working hours and stressful environment, former employees have told Reuters. Many studio staff are on three-month or one-month renewable contracts which prevents them from having days off or compensation for over-time.WWD reported last month that Ramsay-Levi was in talks with Chloé but it did not say Waight Keller had decided not to renew her contract.Waight Keller, who had joined Chloé in 2011 from Pringle of Scotland where she was artistic director and worked at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), is parting ways on a high note, the sources said. Cartier owner Richemont said in November the French label ""enjoyed a geographically broad-based double-digit growth rate (in half-year sales), largely driven by leather,"" helped by the popularity of the Drew and Faye leather bags.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

242,"Dec 04, 2016 12:21AM ET",No price like home: Big spenders reappear in China,nan,"By Jackie Cai and Jake SpringSHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's wealthiest shoppers are spending at home again, roused from a three-year slumber by a weaker yuan, lower prices and a crackdown on overseas sales agents - a welcome boost for the world's luxury brands. China's rich make up almost a third of the world's luxury shoppers, up from only 2 percent around the turn of the millennium. They are a driving force for global luxury, even after a slight dip this year when fewer traveled abroad, in part due to militant attacks in Europe. For the past three years, a crackdown on corruption and ostentation by President Xi Jinping dampened sales: big names such as LVMH (PA:LVMH), owner of Louis Vuitton, shuttered stores, particularly in second- and third-tier cities. In 2016, however, fashion houses, jewelers and buyers say that is changing, as China tries to shift away from an economy driven by heavy investment in infrastructure and encourages consumers to shop. Burberry  (L:BRBY), Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), and Tiffany (N:TIF) have all reported an uptick in their most recent China earnings, striking a note of optimism as the industry enters its critical weeks between the Christmas rush and Chinese New Year.""Everyone is benefiting from more traffic at the Chinese (luxury) shops,"" said Bruno Lannes, a Shanghai-based partner with consultancy Bain. It estimates a four-percent increase in mainland China sales after three years of decline.""Some brands in China are expecting 2016 to go back to their peak in 2012, though the mix is different. I expect some brands will beat that record,"" Lannes said.SHOPPERS FOR HIREOn the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, shoppers say they are, indeed, splashing out more often at home.The depreciating yuan means the currency doesn't buy as much abroad, while luxury brands such as Chanel have moved since last year to narrow once huge differences between prices in China and overseas. At the same time, the government has cracked down on daigous, shoppers-for-hire who trade off that price imbalance and buy goods more cheaply overseas for mainland Chinese.""Some brands price their products in China closer to the overseas markets, such as Chanel,"" said Emma Yu, a 32-year-old housewife exiting a Cartier store while shopping for a handbag in Shanghai's financial district. ""If there's only a few thousand yuan difference, I would just buy it at home."" Another shopper outside a Louis Vuitton store in central Shanghai, an accountant at a multinational who gave her surname as Lu, said she was also buying more at home, especially if not traveling. ""I definitely bought more luxury items at home than in the past since last year - a lot more - because it's convenient to buy things here,"" she said, standing with a friend as she compared a $5,700 purse she had bought with one in the shop window.BEARING FRUITMainland China has been seeing positive sales for a while, Johann Rupert, chairman of Compagnie Financiere  Richemont  (S:CFR), told investors last month.""It seems that the Chinese government's intent to promote growth through consumption rather than just investment is bearing fruit,"" Rupert said.Richemont, the owner of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and a dozen other luxury brands, reported ""marked"" October sales growth in mainland China in its presentation to investors.Kering, owner of Gucci and Saint Laurent, reported Asia Pacific sales were up 24 percent in the third quarter as many Chinese buyers stayed home. Burberry reported a double-digit increase in China in the second quarter, excluding the impact of changes to its offerings in Beijing.Local brands have benefited less, analysts say. A spokesman for jeweler Chao Tai Fook (HK:1929) said sales in greater China stabilized in September and October compared to declines in the previous two quarters.The picture is also less rosy in Hong Kong, once the prime destination for Chinese shoppers wanting to avoid the hefty taxes of mainland without requiring extensive travel. Even so, after drops of over 20 percent a year in the last two years, sales have stabilized, analysts and luxury companies said.Mainland shoppers willing to splash out abroad, and wanting a more original high-end experience, prefer to go to Japan, Europe or even Macau, said Mariana Kou, an analyst at investment bank CLSA. Tax incentives are no longer enough.""Hong Kong has become a bit boring,"" Kou said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

244,"Nov 03, 2016 10:10AM ET",Strong Hermes sales confirm China-fueled luxury revival,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - Hermes (PA:HRMS) confirmed stronger-than-expected global demand for luxury goods on Thursday, joining luxury goods industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) in outshining third quarter results forecasts.A sales rebound in mainland China, improvements in Hong Kong, a British surge thanks to a weaker pound and relative U.S. resilience despite the stronger dollar have all lifted luxury stocks including LVMH, Kering, Hermes,  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Burberry  (LA:BRBY) and  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in the past month.Chinese customers, the biggest buyers of luxury goods who make up more than a third of global demand, have been re-opening their wallets, luxury groups said, spurred in part by government policies encouraging local consumption.""The driving trend is that the Chinese customer is slowly coming back,"" Makiko Zuercher, who manages the 22-million euro Dynapartners Luxury Brands Fund, said. These positives now outweigh concerns about lower tourist traffic in Europe, due to the attacks on Paris, and the drop in purchasing power among Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers after the depreciation of their currencies. ""Many of the psychological catalysts which dampened luxury demand - starting with the renminbi deterioration in August 2015 and including attacks in Paris in November 2015 - have now been shrugged off,"" HSBC said in a note. ""Every market, with the possible exception of Japan, is doing better or in line with previous trends.""The broker said luxury stocks had been sold ""short"" by hedge funds, a trade showing they expect the price to fall, and largely ignored by ""long-only"" institutions for many months.The one luxury stock for which there is still shorting interest is Cartier owner Richemont, which makes half of its sales from watches, the luxury sector's most depressed segment. Data from Astec Analytics shows Richemont has the highest ""short"" interest. It is also one of the few luxury stocks still down for the year to date and analysts are not expecting any upbeat comments when it publishes its trading update on Friday. Kering is easily the best performer this year, and short-sellers have very low positions in the stock.Fund managers and buy-side analysts said investors needed to be remain selective as some brands such as Prada (HK:1913) and Tod's (MI:TOD) could continue to suffer in the near term from competition from more innovative rivals. Recent trading updates showed that sales growth in the sector could only be achieved through market share gains as the past levers to boost revenues such as opening new shops and lifting prices were no longer available.Hermes beat market expectations with a 8.8 percent rise in third-quarter sales at constant currencies, above analysts' 7 percent forecast, helped partly by China's rebound.Last month industry leader LVMH, regarded as a proxy for the sector, and later Kering, saw their shares soar after their respective Louis Vuitton and Gucci brands published much stronger than expected sales.""Who would have expected two years ago Gucci's recovery would be so strong,"" said Scilla Huang, manager of the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund, with 200 million euros under management.    ""They made courageous efforts and people were hungry for that kind of newness.""    /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""There is no way we can do business with them for the time being.""Amazon has been growing its fashion, jewelry and watch retailing in recent years but failed to attract heavyweight luxury brands as they are concerned the U.S. retailer's product presentation and discounts could damage their image.LVMH and other luxury goods groups such as Chanel and  Richemont  (S:CFR) fought hard to obtain the right from the European Commission in 2010 to refuse partnering with certain websites, citing worries about pricing and counterfeits.LVMH's shares jumped by as much as 5.7 percent on Tuesday after the group reported much higher than expected third-quarter sales late on Monday, driven by strong trading at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand and revived demand from Chinese customers at home and abroad.LVMH's sales figures boosted investor sentiment toward the luxury sector, which has been relatively bearish in recent months, and lifted shares of peers such as Richemont, which gained more than 3 percent on Tuesday, and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), up 2 percent.There is concern that tourists will stay away from major European luxury markets in the near future following recent attacks, while an uncertain global economic outlook could also keep demand subdued. However, the group behind fashion brands Fendi, Dior and Guerlain perfume, said sales in mainland China had improved to ""mid teens"" in the third quarter from ""mid single digits"" in the first half. ""The Chinese customer (who represents one third of LVMH sales) is doing very well,"" Guiony told investors. Without the negative impact of phasing out the Donna Karan brand, organic growth at the group's all-important fashion and leather unit would have been more than 7 percent, rather than the 5 percent reported, Guiony told investors. LVMH's leading jewelry brand Bulgari had seen growth slow down as 2015 had been a bumper year, he said. LVMH shares, which have now risen more than 14 percent this year, closed 4.5 percent higher valuing the group at 80.2 billion euros.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""To create a healthy shopping environment with a high level of integrity and to protect the legal interests of consumers and brand owners, Taobao is gearing up to regulate sales of luxury brands' products,"" it told sellers in a notice dated May 4. It tells sellers to act promptly to examine and rectify counterfeit goods, under threat of possible shop closures and other penalties. Last week, the official People's Daily newspaper said Chinese authorities would launch a campaign to clean up e-commerce, targeting trademark violations, counterfeit and poor quality products, in a move potentially affecting Alibaba, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).The campaign by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce will run from May to November, and will hand out harsher punishments for violations of regulations.Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands held by Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA filed a suit in New York in May last year accusing Alibaba of being a giant conduit for counterfeiters and alleging that the e-commerce leader had knowingly made it possible to sell fakes.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

This growing threat from the east is likely to add misery to big luxury brands such as Prada (HK:1913), Kering's Bottega Veneta (PA:PRTP) and Tod's (MI:TOD), already suffering from plunging sales, partly due to excessive price increases, over-exposure in certain markets such as China and mega-brand fatigue.Chinese fashion brands, such as Ms Min and Comme moi, are the fastest-growing contemporary design labels sold at department store Lane Crawford, which has outlets throughout China and Hong Kong, its Chairman Andrew Keith told Reuters. Lane Crawford also sells Korean menswear brands such as Woo Young Mi and expects to start selling Korean womenswear soon.""You sense there is a pride about seeing China develop its own creative community and seeing China emerge as a creative force,"" Keith said in an interview on the fringes of the Conde Nast luxury conference in Seoul. Lane Crawford has seen its pool of Chinese labels grow over the past four years to more than 30, from just four. Twenty percent of Chinese-designed clothes bought online are shipped outside of China ""mainly to Chinese nationals living abroad who want access to these brands,"" Keith said. He estimates that his average customer in mainland China is 25 while in Hong Kong the average age is 35-40.Also high on Asians' shopping list are Japanese brands, such as Sacai and Tsumori Chisato, many of them older and better established than South Korean or Chinese labels. Lady Gaga regularly wears Japan's Roggykei, created in 2006 by two graduates from Osaka College of Design. UNIQUE STYLESeoul, Tokyo and Shanghai all have fast-expanding fashion weeks, sponsored by local industrial groups, showing dozens of budding brands. Some labels have also moved West and started showing at Milan and Paris fashion weeks and opened shops there. Beijing-based designer Guo Pei, whose yellow long cape dress was worn by Rihanna at the Met Gala last year, started showing at Paris Couture week in January, while Chinese shoe brand Stella Luna, whose stilettos cost more than 500 euros ($565), has three free-standing shops in Paris. Chinese-born designer Yiqing Yin, whose creations are sold in China, New York and Paris, has won several European fashion awards and has been hailed by the international fashion press as one of the most promising designers of her generation. Popular Korean brand SJYP, run by duo Steve Jung and Yoni Pai, sells in Europe and the United States, including at Selfridges in London and Opening Ceremony in New York and Los Angeles, while Chinese-born Uma Wang, a graduate of London's Central Saint Martins design school, sells in China and in Europe, including at l'Eclaireur in Paris. She also shows at Milan Fashion week.""Before many Asians thought luxury goods had to come from the West,"" said Lee Seo-hyun, president of Samsung C&T's fashion division and daughter of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Chairman Lee Kun-hee. ""But they are becoming more sophisticated and discerning and now more people are interested in local designers who have their own point of view and unique style.""Samsung C&T (KS:028260), affiliated to Samsung Electronics, maker of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rival Galaxy smartphones, is one of the biggest corporate investors in Seoul's up-and-coming fashion scene. Every year, it gives $100,000 to two or three designers to help them develop their collection and since 2005 has invested $2.7 million in 19 design teams through the Samsung Fashion & Design Fund. Samsung's fashion unit has a stable of brands, ranging from Korean brand Bean Pole to Belgian fashion label Ann Demeulemeester.Erwan Rambourg, author of the book ""The Bling Dynasty"" and luxury goods analyst at HSBC, says Asian brands, even if they are still small and not widely distributed yet, are fast becoming serious competitors for Western brands. Korean cosmetics have long been popular with Chinese customers and Rambourg notes that popular South Korean television series such as ""My Love from the Star"" and ""Descendents of the Sun"", and Korean pop music acts such as Big Bang and Girls' Generation, have helped boost South Korea's image as a trend-setter throughout Asia.While Asian consumers have embraced American culture, Korean pop culture is closer to Chinese culture, says Rambourg. ""Koreans' self-esteem and self-confidence has been boosted by the power of 'K culture' and this is also why Korean and other Asian brands have started to become more popular,"" said Sung-Joo Kim, one of Korea's most high-profile female entrepreneurs. She owns and runs German luxury leather goods brand MCM, known for its $700 studded logo-embossed canvas backpacks. Kim, who previously developed Gucci's Korean business, also pointed out that Asian brands cater better to Asian women's more petite shape than Western brands. ""Can we make 'made in Asia, designed in Asia' become cool, I think yes we can because the stigma that Asian brands had is disappearing and we have all the right ingredients and the manufacturing base,"" said Joowon Park, director at Seoul-based Simone Fashion Company. It manufactures for Western brands including Coach, Michael Kors and Kate Spade. Asian brands are also attracting interest from Western buyers. Awaiting a flight back to Paris at Seoul airport, Maximilien, 39, who works in fashion advertising, bought a $400 studded bag for his wife from Korean brand Youk Shim Won, with a girl in funky sunglasses painted on one side. ""This is so original, don't you think?"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The lawsuit sought a halt to counterfeit sales, plus triple and punitive damages.Forbes magazine had on Nov. 4 quoted Ma, worth about $23.4 billion, as saying: ""I would (rather) lose the case, lose the money"" than settle. ""But we would gain our dignity and respect.""That prompted the Kering brands to ask the judge to relieve them from being obliged to mediate, saying Ma's comment made it a ""futile exercise"".But the judge on Monday urged them to reconsider and urged both sides to tone down their rhetoric.

Sephora, part of luxury industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), running around 2,000 outlets worldwide, is keen to build its presence in Iran where there is a huge appetite for cosmetics and especially make-up. With a population of nearly 80 million, Iran is the Middle East's second biggest market for beauty products after Saudi Arabia with annual sales reaching more than 3.5 billion euros($3.86 billion) in 2014, according to market research company Euromonitor. And the beauty and personal care market is expected to nearly treble in the next five years to more than 10 billion euros, Euromonitor forecasts. ""Sephora is currently finalizing talks with its partner in Iran,"" one of the sources close to the matter said. ""Talks are already quite advanced with their distributors,"" another source said, declining to be named. One source said Sephora was hoping to open up to seven boutiques. LVMH and Sephora declined to comment.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed in Vienna in July between Iran and six world powers is to end years economic sanctions on Iran in 2016 in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. While Western beauty products have long been sold in Iran in various perfume shops, the July deal is expected to bring an economic boom to the country which has been suffering from years of under-investment.""We estimate that women, whatever their revenue level, spend as much as a third of their income on beauty,"" Reza Miremadi, who distributes L'Oreal's mass market brands such as Maybelline and Garnier in Iran. Several managers from LVMH have been making trips to Iran in Sept. and Oct. and executives from Dior, Louis Vuitton and Bulgari are preparing to go there next month to examine investment opportunities, the sources said.And the French trade group Comité Colbert, which represents 80 luxury brands, said it was planning to organize a trip in the spring. Iran, once dominated by bazaars and tiny shops, has seen an explosion in shopping malls in recent years.""Many people do not know that Iranians' relationship to luxury and refinement is really quite close to that of the French or the Italians,"" said Sara Yalda, a Franco-Iranian writer who is organizing a series of 14 conferences on Iran at a big theater in Paris next year. ""I think luxury brands are going to be very successful there.""Many luxury brands such as jewelers Cartier, part of  Richemont  (VX:CFR), and Bulgari are sold in Iran through multi-brand shops. Iran, whose economy is largely dependent on oil and gas revenues, has more than 3 million high net worth individuals who are major and regular buyers of luxury goods, analysts estimate. But several luxury groups including Chanel, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH's Dior and Louis Vuitton said they were adopting a ""wait and see"" attitude for now until the evolution of Iran's international relations became clearer. ""We have to see how things evolve from a political standpoint and see if there is a suitable retail infrastructure,"" Dior Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said. ""This is not short term but things can evolve quite quickly.""Key political milestones will be Iran's legislative elections in February and the outcome of the U.S. presidential campaign in November as there is concern president Barack Obama's successor could re-impose sanctions.Also, as part of the July Vienna agreement, there is a ""snap back"" provision which would re-instate the sanctions if Iran failed to fulfill its commitments.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

278,"Oct 18, 2015 12:29AM ET",Alibaba lobbies to stay off U.S. blacklist list for fakes,nan,"By John RuwitchSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) Group Holding Ltd is lobbying hard to stay off the U.S. Trade Representative's blacklist after coming under renewed pressure this year over suspected counterfeits sold on its shopping platforms.Re-inclusion on the USTR's annual list of the world's most ""notorious markets"" for sales of pirated and counterfeit goods, while not carrying direct penalties, would be a blow to the company's efforts to shed perceptions that its sites are riddled with fakes and that its anti-piracy policies are inadequate. It could also hurt Alibaba's beleaguered share price.Two Alibaba sites - the business-to-business platform Alibaba.com and the hugely popular Taobao Marketplace - were on the USTR's ""Notorious Markets"" list from 2008. Alibaba.com was removed in 2011. Taobao was taken off in 2012 for its ""notable efforts"" to work with rightholders to clean up the site.On September 10, the USTR called for public input as it formulates its latest list, expected in the coming months. At least three industry bodies have publicly responded with criticism of Alibaba, alleging counterfeits remain widespread on its sites and that the company is difficult to work with or inefficient when seeking redress.The company's new government affairs chief, Eric Pelletier, who took up the post in June, has sent two formal letters to the USTR this month, including a rebuttal of the industry group criticism.Last week, Pelletier and an Alibaba lawyer met with an inter-agency working group coordinated by the USTR to discuss Alibaba's anti-counterfeit efforts, a source with knowledge of the matter said.In his letters, Pelletier says Alibaba has gone above and beyond in dealing with the problem, but that primary responsibility for policing and deterring infringements rests with brand owners, according to copies seen by Reuters.He said the company had made it easier this year for brands to remove listings of suspected fakes while toughening penalties for merchants who violate company policies.""When you step back and look at our overall efforts to combat illicit activities, our track record is clear. We are certainly not perfect, and we have a lot of hard work ahead of us...we will continue to do everything we can to stop these activities,"" he wrote.INDUSTRY PRESSUREOthers think Alibaba should do more.The American Apparel and Footwear Association pressed the USTR to re-instate Taobao on the blacklist due to Alibaba's ""unwillingness to make serious reforms"" and failure to address the organization's concerns.The AAFA opposed the de-listing of Taobao in 2012, but had not recommended re-listing the site until now, AAFA spokeswoman Catherine Michael said. Four years of talks ""were not productive and did not lead to progress of fixing the problem"", she said.Alibaba says the AAFA has refused recent requests to meet to discuss the concerns.The Trademark Working Group, which includes some Fortune 500 and other major brands, and ANDEMA, a Spanish anti-counterfeiting association, that counts 70 companies including Levi's and Camper among its members, also criticized Alibaba's processes for removing suspected listings of fakes.Several brands contacted by Reuters, including Burberry and Adidas (DE:ADSGN), declined to comment directly on the issue.Privately, some industry sources say Alibaba has made patchy progress in fighting fakes and can be less-than-helpful with smaller brands or those with which it has no special agreements or memoranda of understanding to work together to combat intellectual property rights violations.""It was a mistake to take them off of the 'notorious markets' list,"" said one source at a Western sports brand who declined to be identified because the brand works with Alibaba.In May, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other luxury goods firms owned by Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, launched a lawsuit against Alibaba in New York for the second time in less than a year, contending the online shopping titan knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell the products.Pressure on Alibaba has not only come from industry.In January, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), a Chinese government regulator, criticized Taobao for counterfeit goods listings. It also issued a ""white paper"" blasting Alibaba for failing to crack down on illegal activities on its sites, although later confirmed the document carried no legal weight. Alibaba said the methodology in the reports was flawed.USTR spokesman Andrew Bates said the agency was reviewing submitted comments. The list is expected to be published sometime between December and the end of March.Pelletier, who served as a legislative advisor to President George W. Bush and previously worked in Congress, has met with a range of government agencies since joining Alibaba in June.U.S. officials were most interested in the counterfeit issue, and feedback had so far been ""positive"", the source said.In an interview last week with Chinese news agency Xinhua, Alibaba's found and chief executive Jack Ma said the company's customer complaint rate was a low 0.0116 percent, lower than that of bricks-and-mortar shops.""I don't believe success can built on dishonesty,"" it quoted Ma as saying.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

291,"Sep 01, 2015 01:17PM ET",LVMH hires former Apple executive as digital director,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH has hired as its new head of digital Ian Rogers, from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as part of the luxury group's drive to more fully embrace the Internet. It marks one of the most high profile luxury hires from the digital industry as fashion, jewelry and cosmetics brands race to build up teams able to engage online customers.Previously, transfers went the other way around as Apple poached several luxury executives including Angela Ahrendts, former Burberry Chief Executive, and Paul Deneve, former boss of Saint Laurent, owned by  Kering  (PARIS:PRTP).Last year, L'Oreal created the job of chief digital officer to expand its presence online and hired the Bulgarian-born and French-educated Lubomira Rochet who sits on the cosmetics group's executive committee. Rogers used to run Apple's Beats Music online service before it was bought last year by the U.S. company and then joined its iTunes team as a senior director. Rogers takes up his new job at LVMH in October. While luxury goods sales globally have slowed down in recent years to around 5 percent annually, luxury online sales have been rising by more than 20-30 percent, albeit from a very low base.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

300,"Jun 11, 2015 10:01AM ET","Fashion brand Bally back on growth path, says CEO",nan,"By Astrid WendlandtMONACO (Reuters) - Bally, the long-struggling Swiss leather goods maker, is back in growth mode after years of stagnant sales, buoyed by more contemporary designs and solid demand from Japanese and U.S. buyers, its chief executive said.Frederic de Narp said he aimed to lift Bally's annual sales to 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) within 5-10 years from its current level of 400 million euros. The 164-year-old company, one of Europe's biggest shoe makers before World War I, has lacked a clear strategic direction for many years, industry players say.Between 2008 and 2010 its then-designer Brian Atwood put out perilously high stilettos, which they say took the brand too far away from its Swiss conservative, classical roots. Then, Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler, who left two years ago, put out retro 1930s style collections that jarred somewhat with the brand's minimalist, sober image. Narp, in the job for a year-and-a-half, said Pablo Coppola, the designer he chose, was now creating designs that were elegant and in tune with current fashion trends. Coppola previously worked for Dior, Tom Ford and Celine. ""Bally has a fantastic heritage, the only thing we have to do is to exploit it well,"" said the CEO, who previously worked at jewelers Cartier and Harry Winston.""We do not sell a sex story, we sell effortless chic,"" he told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the FT Business of Luxury Summit in Monaco. The privately-held company mainly sells shoes and bags, with one of its best-selling products the Sommet bag, a flare-edged leather bag that starts at around 1,200 euros. Narp said Bally's sales, which have stagnated for more than four years, were up 3 percent at constant exchange rates since January, in line with rivals such as Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER). The company expects full-year growth to be in the low-to-mid single digits.Bally is profitable at the underlying level, or in terms of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Narp added.JAPANESE GROWTHJapan has been one of its strongest-growing markets this year - with sales up 49 percent at constant exchange rates - and business has been picking up also in the United States where sales rose 7 percent also at constant exchange rates.The company opened its first flagship in 20 years in October, on London's New Bond Street, and plans to open nine more over the next five years, with the next one on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles in November and another in Ginza, Tokyo, in 2016.Narp said he wanted to double Bally's business in the United States and Japan over the next five years.He said it would take time to turn around Bally, particularly in the current tough environment, with subdued demand in Europe and slower economic growth in China.Bally has 60 stores in Greater China and makes more than half of its sales to Chinese customers, Narp said.Now one of his top objectives was to make Bally more appealing to women as they now only made up 30 percent of clientele and he wanted to boost that figure to 50 percent within the next few years. To raise its profile, Bally also hired super-model Freja Beha Erichsen, who has worked for Chanel and Louis Vuitton, for its advertising campaigns. Narp said sales from women's products such as handbags, shoes and other small leather goods were up 15 percent at constant exchange rates since the beginning of the year. He said Bally's top creative and marketing leadership was now based in London because it was easier to attract talent there than in Switzerland. Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings bought Bally from private equity firm TPG in 2008, a deal that marked its first venture into the fashion and luxury world.JAB, an investment company with over $39 billion of assets under management, works for the Reimanns - German billionaires who inherited their fortune from soap and detergent maker Reckitt Benckiser.It controls fashion brand Belstaff, New-York listed cosmetics group Coty (N:COTY), London-quoted shoe maker Jimmy Choo (L:CHOO) as well as coffee maker Jacobs Douwe Egberts.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

307,"May 16, 2015 12:51PM ET",Alibaba sued in U.S. by luxury brands over counterfeit goods,nan,"By Nate RaymondNEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of luxury goods makers sued  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) on Friday, contending the Chinese online shopping giant had knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell their products throughout the world.The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands owned by Paris-based  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP) seeking damages and an injunction for alleged violations of trademark and racketeering laws.The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba had conspired to manufacture, offer for sale and traffic in counterfeit products bearing their trademarks without their permission.A spokesman for Alibaba, Bob Christie, said in a statement:""We continue to work in partnership with numerous brands to help them protect their intellectual property, and we have a strong track record of doing so. Unfortunately, Kering Group has chosen the path of wasteful litigation instead of the path of constructive cooperation. We believe this complaint has no basis and we will fight it vigorously.""Concerns over fake products on Alibaba's platforms, including online marketplace Taobao, have dogged it for years, although the U.S. Trade Representative removed Taobao from its list of ""notorious markets"" in 2012 in light of progress made.Friday's lawsuit marked the second time in less than a year that the Kering brands had sued Alibaba over the alleged sale of counterfeit products.An earlier lawsuit was filed in July only to be withdrawn the same month with the ability to refile it while the Kering units worked toward a resolution with Alibaba, according to court records.The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba and its related entities ""provide the marketplace advertising and other essential services necessary for counterfeiters to sell their counterfeit products to customers in the United States.""The lawsuit cited, for example, an alleged fake Gucci bag offered for $2 to $5 each by a Chinese merchant to buyers seeking at least 2,000 units. The authentic Gucci bag retails for $795, the complaint said.Alibaba has allowed for counterfeit sales to continue even when it had been expressly informed that merchants were selling fake products, the lawsuit said.The lawsuit seeks a court order that, among other things, would block Alibaba from offering or facilitating the sale of counterfeit products and unspecified damages that could include $2 per counterfeit item under a statutory regime.The case is Gucci America Inc v.

308,"May 16, 2015 04:30AM ET",Alibaba Sued In US By Luxury Brands Over Counterfeit Goods,nan,"By Reuters - A group of luxury goods makers sued  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Friday, contending the Chinese online shopping giant had knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell their products throughout the world.The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands owned by Paris-based  Kering  (PARIS:PRTP) SA seeking damages and an injunction for alleged violations of trademark and racketeering laws.The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba had conspired to manufacture, offer for sale and traffic in counterfeit products bearing their trademarks without their permission.A spokesman for Alibaba declined to comment.Concerns over fake products on Alibaba's platforms, including online marketplace Taobao, have dogged it for years, although the U.S. Trade Representative removed Taobao from its list of ""notorious markets"" in 2012 in light of progress made.Friday's lawsuit marked the second time in less than a year that the Kering brands had sued Alibaba over the alleged sale of counterfeit products.An earlier lawsuit was filed in July only to be withdrawn the same month with the ability to refile it while the Kering units worked toward a resolution with Alibaba, according to court records.The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba and its related entities ""provide the marketplace advertising and other essential services necessary for counterfeiters to sell their counterfeit products to customers in the United States.""The lawsuit cited, for example, an alleged fake Gucci bag offered for $2 to $5 each by a Chinese merchant to buyers seeking at least 2,000 units. The authentic Gucci bag retails for $795, the complaint said.Alibaba has allowed for counterfeit sales to continue even when it had been expressly informed that merchants were selling fake products, the lawsuit said.The lawsuit seeks a court order that, among other things, would block Alibaba from offering or facilitating the sale of counterfeit products and unspecified damages that could include $2 per counterfeit item under a statutory regime.The case is Gucci America Inc v. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-03784."

313,"Apr 29, 2015 12:12PM ET",Puma highlights performance with Red Bull F1 deal,nan,"By Emma ThomassonBERLIN (Reuters) - A deal by Puma to outfit the Red Bull Formula One team underlines a bid by the German firm to rebuild its reputation for sports performance gear by ramping up marketing spending in focus areas, its chief executive said in an interview. Puma, which previously sponsored Red Bull in 2007-2010 and already has deals with Mercedes and Ferrari, announced on Tuesday a long-term partnership from 2016 to provide the Formula One team with racewear, footwear and teamwear as well as licensed replica, fanwear and lifestyle products.Puma declined to give financial details. Since taking over as chief executive in July 2013, Bjorn Gulden has turned Puma's focus back onto sports gear after sales were hurt by a shift into fashion and lifestyle products, He launched a marketing drive last year dubbed ""Forever Faster"".""Motor sport is the fastest sport that exists, Formula One being the fastest of the fastest. It fits our DNA,"" Bavaria-based Gulden told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""Red Bull is the most fun in Formula One.""Gulden said the deal would allow Puma to showcase its investment in innovative products, such as shoes for drivers which weigh a third what they did five years ago as they are made with far fewer seams and lighter fabric.""Weight is crucial for us,"" said Red Bull team head Christian Horner. ""The lightweight materials that Puma are now using in the suits, in the footwear, in the gloves, save us grams but they all add up."" Gulden said sales of merchandise suggested the popularity of Formula One is increasing in emerging markets such as China and India: ""It is one of the few sports that is really, really global.""Puma is a distant third in the sportswear market behind  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (XETRA:ADSGN), but Gulden's efforts to revive the firm are starting to pay off. Majority owner French luxury goods group  Kering  (PARIS:PRTP) said last week Puma's first-quarter sales rose 4.5 percent on a comparable basis.Puma reports full quarterly results on May 8.Under Gulden, a former Adidas executive and professional soccer player, Puma has struck several high-profile deals, including with English soccer side Arsenal and pop star Rihanna.""We will continue to over-invest in marketing,"" he said.As Puma seeks to rebuild its business, it has focused on the world's most popular sports such as soccer, running, golf and motorsport, pulling out of sailing and rugby at a global level.""We don't have any short-term plans for adding anything to that portfolio,"" Gulden said, although Puma is analyzing a possible medium-term move into American sports, a drive German rival Adidas has been pushing of late.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

315,"Apr 23, 2015 10:35AM ET",Online store merger prods luxury goods makers toward Internet,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - The merger of the world's two biggest online fashion stores, Net-a-Porter (NAP) and Yoox (MILAN:YOOXm), sends a warning to luxury brands to embrace the Internet with more vim after years of resistance. Top brands such as Prada and LVMH's Christian Dior still baulk at the idea of selling clothing online as well as through their plush boutiques.""Considering the level of sophistication and image of our ready-to-wear, we feel the shopping experience has to remain immaculate and in-store,"" says Stefano Cantino, head of marketing and commercial development at Prada. ""You need the physical environment to try the product on and you need an exclusive service which you can only get in a boutique."" But as more people choose to buy through a website instead of going to Rue St Honore or New Bond Street, that position looks increasingly untenable. Brands whose goods are not available online risk losing customers to rivals. Luxury executives understand the Internet will be vital for future sales, particularly to so-called Millennials -- web-savvy customers born between 1980 and 2000. Yet top brands such as LVMH's Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Prada and Chanel have been slow to invest in e-commerce as other retail sectors have done in the last decade.Some have focused as much on the shopping experience as on the products themselves, spending heavily on worldwide expansion and revamping stores with help from famous designers. ""Many luxury brands have not figured out yet how to be innovative and creative online,"" said Anant Sharma of consultancy Matter of Form. ""It looks like they are scared to try things out.""Sharma said many brands' websites mimicked the appearance of Net-a-Porter's black-and-white portal. ""If they had the same approach to physical retail, we'd all be shopping in whitewashed rooms with clothes lined up against the four walls."" Immediately after the Yoox/NAP deal was unveiled last month, Chanel said it would start retailing online next year. This month, it is selling a new jewelry line exclusively through Net-a-Porter (NAP) for just three weeks. ""The merger between Yoox and NAP sends the message that you need to be online or you may be out of the game,"" Euromonitor luxury goods analyst Fflur Roberts said. Euromonitor expects 40 percent of all luxury goods sales will be made via the Internet in less than five years. Online annual luxury goods sales have been growing at 15-25 percent while the industry's average growth rate has slumped to 5 percent this year from above 10 percent four years ago as brands have completed big global roll-outs. Analysts estimate that 5-6 percent of luxury goods are purchased online, although that jumps to around 8 percent for leather goods such as shoes and handbags.Designer websites vary in usability but few offer customers as much help as sites like NAP, which shows clothes on models, gives details of fit and sizing and carries styling tips.Prada's e-commerce site carries no ready-to-wear, sticking to bags, shoes and other accessories. Kering  (PARIS:PRTP)'s Saint Laurent and Gucci have slicker sites, offering a wide range of clothing and proposing complete looks. Saint Laurent also features designer Hedi Slimane's black and white photographs of musicians such as Marilyn Manson and Marianne Faithful.But Hermes's iconic 8,000 euro Birkin or Kelly bags still cannot be bought online -- and may take more than year to arrive after being ordered from a store. DEPARTMENT STORES PUSHWhile many big luxury brands are still figuring out an Internet strategy, high-end department stores already sell their products online. The Neiman Marcus chain, which includes New York's Bergdorf Goodman, does 24 percent of its business online, up from 15 percent five or six years ago. Last year, it acquired German online fashion retailer My Theresa, aiming to better serve customers outside the United States. London's Harrods, whose website gets 3 million visitors a month and sells brands such as Valentino and LVMH's Givenchy, is also stepping up online investment. ""Our customer demands an omni-channel shopping experience, and to remain at the forefront of luxury retail we need to respond to this,"" Harrods managing director Michael Ward said.Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said at LVMH's annual general meeting last week that ""more and more products would be sold online"" and the group was ""currently adapting to this situation"". LVMH labels such as Fendi, Kenzo and Emilio Pucci already offer many products online -- Fendi sells 750 euro baguette bags and 6,180 euro blue feathered dresses -- but Louis Vuitton sells only accessories, pens, watches and jewelry. Richemont's Cartier brand has sold jewelry online in the United States since 2010 and its online store now ranks third behind its two main flagships in terms of sales. Privately owned Patek Philippe, does not sell any of its 10,000 euro plus timepieces on the Internet, however, and told Reuters last month it has no intention of doing so.

317,"Apr 20, 2015 10:32AM ET",Chinese tourists' luxury spending soars - Global Blue,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Chinese tourists spent a record amount on luxury goods last month, helped by shopping sprees in Europe as the weak euro made items cheaper than at home, VAT refund company Global Blue said.Spending by Chinese tourists, the biggest buyers of luxury goods, soared by 122 percent in March after a 52 percent rise in February, bringing the increase for the first quarter to 67 percent, Global Blue said in a report published on Monday. This compared with a rise of 32 percent in the fourth quarter and 18 percent in 2014.Many Chinese tourists have stayed away from luxury hot spot Hong Kong - where big brands have invested significantly in new shops in recent years - following pro-democracy protests last year.""This continues to reflect the redirection of Chinese spending from Hong Kong towards Europe in particular, given the widening of the price differentials, which is a much-discussed theme during the ongoing reporting season,"" broker  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) said in a note about the Global Blue figures.Exchange rate movements have led to significant regional price differences, with the same luxury item sometimes costing more than 50 percent less in European capitals than in major Chinese cities.The trend has encouraged Asian buyers to snap up goods in Europe and resell them at home, a practice often referred to as parallel trading or the gray market and which brands worry could raise issues about their products' perceived authenticity.Broker JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove estimates 20 to 40 percent of luxury sales in mainland China are now parallel, based on what luxury goods executives and consultants have said.Last week,  Burberry  (L:BRBY) said it would re-align prices to match rivals after brands such as Chanel and Patek Philippe cut prices in Asia by over 20 percent to reduce the discrepancy with Europe. Kering  (PA:PRTP) will be expected to give an update on its pricing policy, particularly for its flagship Gucci brand, when it posts first-quarter results on Tuesday.Global Blue said overall, worldwide global tourism spending reached its highest level in March since May 2011 despite Russian spending falling 39 percent, against a 51 percent drop in January.Watches and jewelry performed best, with sales up 67 percent in March against 32 percent the previous month, it said. Leather goods sales rose 50 percent, versus 24 percent in February.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

319,"Mar 31, 2015 06:30AM ET",Yoox buys Richemont's Net-a-Porter in all-share deal,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Valentina ZaPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Italian online fashion retailer Yoox has bought Net-a-Porter, its upmarket rival, in an all-share deal that creates an industry leader in the booming online luxury market, with combined sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion).Net-a-Porter (NAP) owner  Richemont  (VX:CFR) will receive 50 percent of the combined Yoox Net-a-Porter Group but its voting rights will be capped at 25 percent, putting Yoox (MI:YOOX) effectively in charge of the combined business. ""Today, we open the doors to the world's biggest luxury fashion store. It is a store that never closes, a store without geographical borders,"" said NAP founder Natalie Massenet, who will oversee editorial content and advertising of the new group as executive chairman.Yoox boss, founder and minority shareholder Federico Marchetti will become chief executive and shape strategy.""Between us, we have changed the fashion industry somehow and we will continue to change it,"" Marchetti told journalists in a conference call on Tuesday.STILL SMALL The online luxury goods industry is still in its infancy, making up only around 5 percent of total luxury sales because many brands put off Internet expansion, worrying it would not offer customers the same high-end experience as their stores. But many executives now believe the Internet will be key to driving future sales, particularly among the so-called Millennials, web-savvy customers born between 1980 and 2000.Online luxury is not yet very profitable: Both Yoox's and NAP's operating margin is less than 5 percent compared with more than 25 percent for most big luxury brands such as Gucci or Prada. But the pair hope their bigger size will help cut warehouse, logistical, back-office and distribution costs, lifting margins. Yoox operates the online sales of fashion brands such as Ermenegildo Zegna and  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent and also sells items at a discount. Analysts said the deal could help boost Yoox's chances of retaining luxury brands that might otherwise have wanted to take their online operations in-house once they gained experience. ""I'm positive on the outlook for the online luxury market. I believe it's a structural change that will gain traction as younger generations of more 'digitally minded' managers get to the top,"" said Gian Luca Pacini at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MILAN:ISP) in Milan. NAP, which is regarded as having helped make online shopping an entertainment experience, specializes in current season and off-the-runway items and advises customers on what to wear them with. It also published the fashion magazine Porter. Marchetti said NAP would have the same valuation as Yoox once the deal was completed in September. Analysts valued NAP at around 1.5 billion euros, above Yoox which stood at 1.32 billion euros on Friday before news of the potential deal came out. Yoox shares, which gained already nearly 10 percent on Monday after Yoox and Richemont confirmed Reuters reports they were in talks, were up more than 8 percent by 0501 EDT at 25.14 euros, valuing Yoox at 1.56 billion euros. The combined business will generate adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 108 million euros in 2014 and annual synergies of around 60 million euros by the third full year, the two companies said. If Yoox shareholders approve the deal in June, the new group will launch a rights issue of around 200 million euros ($216 million) in the fall to fund growth, with Richemont expected to fund around half the sum, a spokesman for the Swiss group said.Marchetti said strategic investors keen to participate in the capital increase could include luxury brands but gave no further details.Richemont has agreed to a lock-up period of three years regarding half of its stake, or 25 percent, which analysts said they would expect the Swiss group to eventually sell. The group will appoint two members of 12-member board. Marchetti, who currently owns over 7 percent of Yoox, said he planned to remain a shareholder.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

320,"Mar 20, 2015 06:16PM ET",Luxury brands hedge their bets with smartwatches,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - The flurry of technology deals luxury watchmakers announced this week to tackle the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch threat are more a way to hedge their bets in case the smartwatch market takes off than a strategic U-turn.The costs of development of these hybrid watches, combining elements of traditional watchmaking with digital know-how and wireless connectivity, will be mostly financed by the technology providers, industry specialists predicted.Therefore, the partnerships unveiled at the Baselworld fair actually involve little investment for luxury brands - aside from their marketing efforts - but represent potentially high returns in terms of image and sales.On Thursday, LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Tag Heuer and Bulgari, and  Kering 's (PA:PRTP) Gucci were among the more than dozen or so watch brands that announced partnerships with technology companies.Regarding Tag Heuer's alliance with U.S. chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unveiled on Thursday, independent financial analyst Richard Windsor said: ""I strongly suspect that Intel and Google will be putting up the majority of the development costs of the product, which is expected to be launched before the end of the year.""Few details of the watch were provided such as its functions or price, and Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver acknowledged it was not yet clear whether gaining the ""Intel Inside"" also meant losing the precious ""Swiss Made"" label.""Swiss brands like TAG are hedging their bets – just in case 'wrist computers' become popular and they are totally out of the game,"" said Exane  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca. But while the announcement helped Tag Heuer make headlines and project the image of a brand in tune with its times, the project has many limitations, and could, in fact, fail to ever yield a product, Windsor said.OPPOSITE WORLDSMany luxury watchmakers, including Patek Philippe and Breguet, said this week smartwatches were incompatible with their brands' values and the timelessness of their products. The industry is divided on whether there will be strong demand for smartwatches whether they are made by Apple, Samsung (LONDON:0593xq), Pebble or luxury brands. The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model, making the company's first foray in the personal luxury goods market.But Apple has been taking more leaves out of luxury books than luxury brands have been using consumer electronics recipes. The Californian computer company provided the first glimpse of its watch during Paris fashion week and photos were taken of designer Karl Lagerfeld and U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour admiring it in the trendy Parisian shop Colette. Apple has joined forces with model Christy Turlington, poached top executives from luxury brands such as Burberry, Yves Saint Laurent and Tag Heuer and used architects from Foster & Partners who worked for luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, to design some of its boutiques. Yet, for many people, the Apple watch is the antithesis of a luxury product. A Cartier and a Rolex watch usually retains value or gains value in the second-hand market while Apple devices very quickly depreciate.Bernstein luxury analyst Mario Ortelli said the tech industry ""seems to be endeavoring to shape the world into an egalitarian utopia, with themes such as shared economy (AirBNB, Uber), and democratization of information until it is universally accessible (Google)"".Luxury goods companies, however, ""are inherently exclusive and most of the desirability and value of their products is derived from the fact that not everyone can have it…or even afford it"".Windsor also noted it was not the first time Tag Heuer experimented with electronics as it introduced a mobile phone called Meridiist in 2008 which ""eventually sank without a trace"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors. The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.""We believe wearable technology will take off,"" Michael Bell, vice president of Intel's New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair.Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by  Luxottica  (MI:LUX), watchmaker Fossil (O:FOSL), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony.""Tag Heuer's decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.""With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.""Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) gave no details of pricing or launch timing.Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however.Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group (VX:UHR) watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (PA:HRMS) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.""The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,"" he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

322,"Mar 13, 2015 12:51PM ET","Weak euro to help European companies, force U.S. rivals to adapt",nan,"By Tom Bergin and Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - The euro's slide toward parity with the dollar will provide a much-needed boost for European companies this year and force U.S. rivals to adapt their businesses or risk losing market share.While currency hedging arrangements mean the benefits may not be seen straight away, the currency's weakness has already cheered European chief executives by making their products cheaper overseas and lifting the value of dollar-based sales.""We have been handicapped by the strength of the euro, but now it seems that the wind is turning and we intend to make the most of this very positive currency effect that will help us deliver a nice increase of our sales and our profits in 2015,"" Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) told investors last month.Other companies predicting a tail wind from the around 20 percent drop in the value of the euro over the past six months to $1.06 on Friday include jet manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR), German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and French engineering groups Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and  Alstom  (PARIS:ALSO). Some U.S companies also see positives from the weaker euro, including lower borrowing costs, better performance at European units which export, stronger demand from Euro zone-based customers and, for the leisure sector, increased travel into the continent.However, most U.S. groups that discussed the currency in recent weeks including Apple (O:AAPL), Dupont (N:DD), Priceline (O:PCLN),  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and  General Electric  (N:GE), have warned they may face headwinds in Europe and elsewhere, and some, including Xerox (N:XRX), have cut earnings guidance as a result.These companies have said they are now looking to cut costs, increase the portion of inputs they source from inside the euro zone and adopt new pricing policies, to try and maintain market share and margins.""U.S. companies exporting goods to Europe could face margin pressure from price adjustments or promotions in Europe,"" said James Targett, analyst at Berenberg.With euro weakness likely to persist due to the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program and a likely hike in U.S. interest rates on the back of a stronger U.S. economy, longer term planning is a must.""You have to think about where your revenues are, where your manufacturing is and where you're buying your raw materials from,"" he added.TIME LAGMany companies said hedging contracts would mean the impact of the lower euro would take time to feed through. Paris-based Alstom and Swiss-headquartered engineer ABB, which has manufacturing plants in the euro zone, said it may not be felt until the second half of the year. Airbus said it was fully hedged for 2015, 2016 and ""largely"" for 2017, leading analysts to predict it could be 2018 before the group experienced any meaningful uplift.In the meantime, the weaker euro may actually weigh on some European companies' earnings because companies must report drops in the values of hedging instruments, which move in the opposite direction to companies' revenues. ""In itself, the drop in the euro is some good news. It should have a positive impact on our revenues, and our operating income. But, of course, in the short term it will have -- it will be a drag on our profitability rate,"" Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci and Puma owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), said on an analyst call last month.Kering said it was switching to the use of options, paying a premium to hedge against currency moves, rather than entering swap contracts which must be revalued each quarter with the changes in value put through the user's profit and loss account.U.S .companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and PepsiCo (N:PEP). said hedging would mitigate their losses in the short term. However, businesses are also looking at how they can reconfigure their operations to limit the hit from a weaker euro and capitalize on any opportunities.A number of companies said they would look at cutting costs. Others said they would try and push through euro price rises in Europe to try and compensate for the fact the euro is now worth less, although deflationary pressures across the continent means companies have little pricing power.U.S. conglomerate 3M (N:MMM) said it was looking at pegging some prices to the dollar and even renegotiating the prices at which it purchases goods.REGIONAL SELF-SUFFICIENCYMany companies said they were considering locking the benefits of the euro into their supply chain. ABB (VX:ABBN) CEO Uli Spiesshofer said his company was looking at ""taking further advantage of euro-based suppliers"". Nick Gangestad, CFO of 3M said his company was aim for more ""regional self-sufficiency"".This strategy may reduce costs in the short term but it poses risks.""The downside to this, however, is that local sourcing fails to leverage global scale and could make procurement less efficient. Scale is great for pricing power,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.For some U.S. companies, the lower currency will be a boon for long-struggling European subsidiaries. U.S.-based Caterpillar said it had been forced to downsize its excavator plant in Grenoble in recent years but that the weak euro could help drive its recovery.""A euro at parity (to the dollar) will just be a great tailwind for that… the currency benefit will just be gravy on that,"" CEO Doug Oberhelman said.Philip Morris International (N:PM), which has a significant portion of its debt denominated in euros, said they were also benefiting from lower borrowing costs, since meeting the coupons on euro debt was now cheaper in dollar terms.For a small number of U.S. companies, the euro drop may even be a net positive, operationally. Europe-based hotels' higher reliance on external visitors than those in the United States meant the draw of the weaker European currency may outweigh the costs of a stronger dollar in putting tourists off.""Roughly 30 percent of our European lodging demand comes from outside Europe, with about 20 points from North America and 6 points from Asia,"" said Arne Sorenson, Marriott International, Inc. CEO. ""In the United States, for example, 95 percent of our business is US business; 5 percent is inbound business.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

323,"Mar 03, 2015 08:55AM ET",New Tag Heuer boss replaces top managers in turnaround drive,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - The new head of Tag Heuer, luxury group LVMH's (PA:LVMH) biggest watch brand, has replaced half a dozen top managers as part of a drive to revive sales, he told Reuters. Jean-Claude Biver, who took the helm in December, said the brand needed to focus on best-sellers such as the all-steel mechanic Carrera and Aquaracer models costing around $1,500-$4,000, over more expensive watches that did not sell so well. A drive to sell models over $5,000-$6,000 has backfired for Tag Heuer which, along with a general industry slowdown, led it to cut management and production jobs and make some staff temporarily unemployed in September.Biver said he had chosen to promote internal and younger staff whom he was coaching, as bringing in outsiders could be disruptive at a time when the brand was undergoing change.He said the new appointments concerned key posts such as heads of marketing, sales, production and customer service, with the new team in place since the end of last year.""When you are trying to make changes in the corporate culture, it is not the right time to bring in external people who do not know the history of the company,"" Biver said in an interview.Tag Heuer, which is estimated to make close to 900 million euros ($1 billion) in annual sales, competes with Swatch's (VX:UHR) Longines and Omega as well as privately-owned Breitling. It makes around one third of its sales in the United States, its biggest single market.Tag Heuer's experience resembles that of other luxury brands such as Gucci, whose upmarket strategy has also dented sales. Last month, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) admitted it had not focused enough on ""entry-level"" leather goods, which make up the bulk of business. Biver, 65, a watch industry veteran, became head of LVMH watches just under a year ago after successfully developing watch brand Hublot. He took on the revamp of sister brand Tag Heuer at the end of last year, a mission he described as ""probably the last and one of the most challenging and interesting of my life"".To boost morale, he is aiming to meet all 800 staff by June at a series of two-hour breakfasts, each involving 40 people.""I want to bring pragmatism, humility, and help people understand that the customer is the priority,"" he said.Biver said Tag Heuer had also offered to pay for employees' train tickets and meals to attend the Geneva car show, which starts this week and where the brand has a stand, and later this month to attend Baselworld, the world's biggest watch fair.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

324,"Feb 13, 2015 09:13AM ET",Can Ferrari really cut it in luxury beyond supercars?,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari faces a battle to persuade investors that it should be priced as a high-flying luxury goods stock, given a carmaker's margins and the heavy investment required to make its prancing horse logo a big attraction on other exclusive lines. Few would question the business acumen of Sergio Marchionne, redoubtable chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), but his strategy for squeezing every last drop of value from the listing of the group's illustrious Italian sports car brand has certainly raised a few eyebrows.""Ferrari is capable of being a fully-fledged luxury brand,"" Marchionne declared last month, setting his stall out to target the kind of high-end valuation multiples enjoyed by the likes of LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Richemont (VX:CFR). The 62-year-old said Ferrari is worth up to 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion), eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) slated for the first half of this year and hoping for a chunky windfall to boost FCA's own ambitious five-year investment plan.But for all Ferrari's Formula One racing pedigree, exclusivity exemplified by the LaFerrari supercar's 1 million euro price tag and a production cap that maintains a healthy customer waiting list, the company has its work cut out if it is to join a sector that trades at about 20 times future earnings. That's more than double the average for carmakers. It has to be acknowledged that Ferrari is no laggard in the money-making stakes, with profit nearly tripling over the past decade and its margins of 14 percent unmatched by any carmaker bar Porsche (DE:VOWG_p). But those margins are well below Prada's (HK:1913) 26 percent and have been under pressure from rising costs.Revenue growth has been more gentle than that of most European luxury stocks and its capital expenditure and research and development requirements are more than double, depressing its return on capital. SHORT ON DETAILWhile the multiples investors will pay depend on Ferrari's ability to grow, it is hard to see what the company has beyond its cars that would fit the luxury mold.Ferrari has the capacity to raise annual production to 10,000 vehicles a year from 7,000, but Marchionne has made clear that output will be kept below demand to protect the brand's exclusivity and told analysts in a post-results conference call last month that further detail on his strategy would not be forthcoming until nearer the IPO.Ferrari's merchandising division might seem an obvious starting point, but Marchionne has denied this. In any case, the elevated prices of T-shirts, bags and shoes bearing the prancing horse are well below those commanded by luxury goods.Its theme park in Abu Dhabi is also accessible to anyone willing to fork out 250 dirham ($70) for a one-day pass. ""If you're already available to everyone, then making your way back up to the luxury level is nearly impossible,"" said Manfred Abraham at brand-building consultancy BrandCap. ""They would have to stop doing a lot of things and start again, which is a massive investment ... how attractive is that to shareholders?""Investors have also been left scratching their heads over Marchionne's statement that carmaking, which accounts for the bulk of sales and profit, is ""incidental"" to Ferrari.As shown by Porsche Design, tire maker Pirelli's (MI:PECI) PZero and Bugatti's move into apparel, previous attempts by automotive groups to stretch beyond their core products have not provided a major revenue boost. Then there's the Ferrari logo and colors, which analysts have said make it a difficult sell in the fashion and design world. LUXURY ALLIANCE?There was talk of a luxury alliance with other opulent Italian brands to rival conglomerates such as Kering (PA:PRTP), but the concept has been dismissed by two bankers close to the company.Analysts, meanwhile, have pointed to the potential for exclusive clubs and hotels for the super-rich or Ferrari moving into high-value motorcycles and boats. However, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton remains skeptical, suggesting that the Ferrari brand could be extended at a luxury premium only to watches, perfumes and eyewear. ""A sports car maker has little competitive advantage when it comes to producing and selling personal luxury goods,"" he said.Regardless of its prospects as a true luxury goods business, the spinning off of Ferrari is far from a car crash. The divorce will unlock the value of a business that made 12 percent of FCA's profit last year. It could also pave the way for FCA to attempt a tie-up with another carmaker, perhaps focusing on the Asian market, bankers have said.Yet how investors interpret Marchionne's bold statements remains unclear, with analysts' estimates for Ferrari's worth ranging anywhere between 5 billion euros and 10 billion euros. ""With luxury it's a lot about emotion and allure,"" one U.S. investment banker said. ""People may not fully buy into Marchionne's argument, but they will put money on Ferrari on the promise of what it represents and could be.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

325,"Feb 11, 2015 09:10AM ET",Prada needs to focus less on new shops and more on new handbags,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Valentina ZaPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - If in fashion, being late on a trend can be lethal, playing catch-up in terms of business strategy can be just as damaging.Prada is learning that lesson the hard way. The trend in luxury goods is to drum up same store sales by curbing expansion and wowing customers with new products, yet Prada continues to pay over the odds to open swanky new shops and stock them with handbags little changed from previous bestsellers.Prada, say analysts, now urgently needs to focus less on new stores and more on new handbags.The group, which also owns the Miu Miu and Church's brands, opened 250 stores in the past three years, far more than rivals. It has finally slowed the pace but still plans 30-35 more stores this year, which it says is part of its long-term strategy.""Prada is starting to focus on same-store sales growth three years later than some of their peers as their priorities were elsewhere, but it is clearly better to do it later rather than never,"" Erwan Rambourg, luxury goods analyst at HSBC and author of The Bling Dynasty, a book focusing on Chinese shoppers.Analysts estimate same-store sales, which Prada stopped reporting last year, fell year-on-year by 12 percent in the third quarter to Oct. 31 and may have dropped by as much as 9 percent in the quarter to Jan. 31.Prada's costly retail space, combined with slower growth, has hammered margins and valuation. The group's share price nearly halved in the past two years and most analysts still have sell or hold recommendations on the stock.Its operating margin fell to 15.4 percent in the third quarter from 21.3 percent in the first half. Some analysts expect small margin growth this year, mainly thanks to the strong dollar that will boost reported earnings in euros.Prada is not alone facing difficulty at a tricky time for luxury goods makers, challenged by cheaper ""accessible luxury"" brands like Michael Kors (N:KORS) and Longchamp.Other brands seen as having rested on their laurels in terms of strikingly new products, like Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci and Tod's (MI:TOD), have also struggled to produce growth.But the strategy of concentrating on same store sales has nevertheless produced success for some luxury brands. Arch-rival Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) revealed last week that it had enjoyed a strong rebound by investing heavily in exciting new products under new designer Nicolas Ghesquiere. It also halted the opening of new stores.PLAYING CATCH-UPWhen it floated in 2011, Prada's ambition was to catch up with bigger rivals by expanding. It spared no expense, splurging on ""key money"" - cash up front to secure the best locations.In Milan, Prada outbid Apple and Gucci to build a menswear shop opposite its historic boutique in the prestigious late 19th Century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade, paying more than 20 million euros to get the spot, real estate sources said. Prada declined to comment.In the plush ski resort of Courchevel, it financed the renovation of the entire Place du Rocher to make it a more fitting address for its new boutique.Meanwhile, some customers say the new shops carry handbags that have not evolved much in recent years, as if the company were afraid to change a product that worked well for so long.""Just arrived"" Prada handbags these days include two-toned satchels and new versions of the Twin Bag launched last year, fitted with a top flap and double zips. The product is similar in shape and carries many of the same features as previous best-sellers, such as the Double Bag or Galleria.Some bags start at 1,450 euros. In crocodile, they can reach 18,500 euros.""Unless you have strong feelings about sewn-on handles versus buckles, there's not much in the way of meaningful variety or novelty,"" wrote Amanda Mull on the widely-followed PurseBlog.Customers have become savvier and more demanding. Partly thanks to the Internet, they know more about a brand's new products than in the past, and will readily abandon brands that seem to trail in innovation.""They've lost their touch,"" said Sara, on a visit from Kuwait, pointing at handbags in a Prada shop window in Milan as she left the store empty-handed. ""They are not keeping up with changing trends as well as other brands like Fendi or Dior.""HSBC analysts upgraded their rating to overweight last month on the hope that its ""issues of innovation in handbags and accessories"" will eventually be solved.They forecast new product launches will help like-for-like sales grow by a modest 1 percent this year.Prada says it continues to work on improving its flow of new products and constantly recruits young designers. It has also pledged to improve its customer service and product mix in stores.But at Prada's Paris flagship, no boots were on display in spite of cold weather. Clerks said this was normal as they were selling spring/summer products. But at Gucci and Louis Vuitton, which were also selling summer collections, there were some boots on display too. Gucci even had fur-lined models on the shelves.Manfredi Ricca, an expert at consultancy Interbrand, said the focus now is not on building more stores but on maximising revenue from existing shops.""Having many retail outlets is less important than being able to offer the experience that clients look for in a brick-and-mortar shop,"" Ricca said."

Beijing has been cracking down on corruption and luxury spending among public officials, weighing down sales of premium liquor to handbags.Domestic luxury spending in China dipped for the first time last year, according to consultancy Bain & Co, with increasing numbers of shoppers looking to spend money overseas.""Travel retail continues to change the dynamics of luxury in China, with 7 out of 10 luxury goods bought by Chinese now being bought overseas,"" said Hurun Report Chairman Rupert Hoogewerf.Hermes dropped to seventh from the top spot last year, while Chinese premium liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd re-entered the top 10 after a two year hiatus, a potentially positive sign after sales were hit by the anti-luxury campaign.Apple in first place was followed by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE, Kering SA's Gucci and Chanel.The report, which has been carried out for over a decade, was based upon a survey of close to 400 millionaires with a personal wealth of 10 million yuan ($1.6 million).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

328,"Dec 22, 2014 12:00PM ET",Gucci to check Chinese suppliers after TV exploitation charges ,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian fashion house Gucci said on Monday it would strengthen controls on its suppliers after a television program showed Chinese employees working more than three times their official hours to assemble its handbags. The head of a Gucci subcontractor told an investigative program broadcast by RAI state television on Sunday that Gucci was aware it irregularly employed Chinese workers. Aroldo Guidotti of subcontractor Mondo Libero (Free World)said the employees toiled away for as long as 14 hours a day, while they were supposed to work only for four hours, to assemble handbags that he sold to Gucci for 24 euros. The bags sell in shops for around $1,000. In a statement responding to the ""Report"" TV show, Gucci said it had acted properly but pledged to raise the number of inspections at its suppliers and take more effective action where needed. Working conditions in plants producing garments and accessories have become an increasingly global issue as activists and trade unionists campaign against long hours and low wages in developing countries or among immigrants in industrialized states. The Tuscan fashion house, part of French luxury group Kering (PA:PRTP), said it had carried out numerous inspections at Mondo Libero, which is based near Florence. The supplier had proved that it had addressed and mostly solved irregularities in working conditions. ""Hidden and inappropriately used cameras, shooting carefully selected supplier companies (3 out of a total 576), do not provide for a true or accurate representation of Gucci and its supply chain policies and procedures,"" the statement said. Gucci said ""Report"" wrongly compared the final price of a bag with the cost of assembling it, leaving out the cost of raw materials or the cutting, packaging and shipping expenses involved. By 1436 GMT, shares in Kering rose by 0.8 percent. Kering last month ousted the chief executive and creative director of the Florentine label, which dates back to the 1920s, because of falling sales.

Citi bucked the trend, with a research note predicting a rise of 1.2 percent.There have been annual declines most months this year, including a 6.9 percent tumble in June, blamed largely on a corruption crackdown in China that hurt Hong Kong purchases of luxury goods. But September retail sales grew 4.8 percent.""The impact of the (protest) movement to the retail sales data should be the most serious in the first two weeks of October as things were most intense back then,"" said Lily Lo of DBS Bank, who expects a fall of 0.3 percent.China's ""Golden Week"" holiday, which ended Oct. 7, is usually one of the year's busiest shopping weeks, but scores of retailers said protests hit sales during the period, which began just days after police fired tear gas to disperse activists.SHOPPERS MAKE A SHIFT?Some analysts said it was difficult to gauge the financial impact of the demonstrations because some shoppers may have shifted to other Hong Kong areas unaffected by the protests.Dickson Concepts, operator of the Harvey Nichols department stores in Hong Kong, on Thursday became the latest company to flag an impact from the protests, saying the city's retail market had further deteriorated as a result of the civil unrest.That follows warnings from other Hong Kong-listed retailers such as Chow Tai Fook, the world's largest jewelry maker by market value, and Luk Fook Holdings, a dealer for Audemars Piguet, Tag Heuer and other brands of watches.Chow Tai Fook has said October same-store sales in Hong Kong fell 24 percent.More than 100,000 people took to the streets at the height of the protests to demand greater democracy in Hong Kong, forcing some shops to close. Others, including Prada and domestic rival Tod's, shortened business hours.""When there were protests in Admiralty, we didn't come here to shop. It was dangerous with all the unrest and nobody knew what was happening,"" said a retired man surnamed Lam, referring to the key protest site next to government buildings.CAMP LARGELY INTACTPolice on Wednesday cleared the protest site in the bustling shopping district of Mong Kok, but early Saturday there were clashes between activists and police. The main camp remains mostly intact in Admiralty, while a handful of demonstrators were still camped out in Causeway Bay shopping area.Luxury goods companies have already under been pressure from Beijing's anti-corruption campaign, which has sapped appetites for such goods among mainland Chinese, some of Hong Kong's biggest tourist spenders.Hong Kong accounts for about $9.7 billion of global luxury sales, or 4 percent of the total, according to estimates by Bernstein Research.The Hong Kong government has warned that prolonged unrest could threaten the city's economic stability while economists say there is anecdotal evidence it has dragged on economic activity.On Nov. 14, the government revised its 2014 economic growth estimate to 2.2 percent from 2-3 percent. At the start of the year, it saw 3-4 percent growth.A private survey on business activity in October showed a sharp deterioration in operating conditions, with output shrinking at the quickest rate in nearly three years.(Additional reporting by Kinling Lo and Diana Chan; Editing by Richard Borsuk)"
331,"Nov 28, 2014 10:50AM ET",Fiat Chrysler may consider loyalty share scheme in Ferrari spin-off,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - A loyalty scheme that would increase the voting power of Ferrari shareholders is one option parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) (FCA) will consider when it spins off the luxury marque next year, Chairman John Elkann said on Friday. Fiat introduced such a scheme when it merged into Dutch-registered FCA this year, rewarding its own long-term investors and mainly benefiting controlling shareholder Exor (MI:EXOR), the holding company of the Agnelli family that founded Fiat. ""There are many options today and this is one of them,"" Elkann told journalists on the sidelines of an event in Milan. FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said last month that he would spin off Ferrari, sell a 10 percent stake via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake in the luxury sports car brand to its shareholders As a consequence, the Agnelli family will emerge as the largest shareholder in Ferrari after the spin-off. A loyalty scheme could tighten the Agnellis' grip further and increase their influence on Ferrari's future strategy. The spin-off announcement rekindled speculation that the Agnelli family may want to form a pool of luxury brands around Ferrari, including other opulent Italian names from outside the automotive sector, to rival groups such as France's Kering (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH). Marchionne said last month that carmaking is ""almost incidental"" to Ferrari, which he sees more as a luxury stock. But Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family who also heads Exor, dismissed the idea of a luxury conglomerate, saying that Exor's plan is to give Ferrari the chance to develop its own growth strategy. Elkann added that there are no plans at this stage to replace Ferrari Chief Executive Amedeo Felisa. Ferrari has undergone several management changes in recent weeks, with long-time Chairman Luca Cordero Di Montezemolo pushed out last month and a new Formula One principal appointed this week Milan-listed FCA shares were down 0.2 percent at 10.05 euros by 0824 EST, against a 0.8 percent fall in Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB).

332,"Nov 17, 2014 10:48AM ET","Gucci needs new ideas, talents to combat brand fatigue",nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci holds the luxury spending downturn mainly responsible for its poor performance but the Italian fashion brand may also have itself to blame, suggesting it could be time to change strategy and hire fresh talent. Every major luxury goods maker has been hit by the worst spending slump in five years as concerns about economic growth and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine hampered demand from the Chinese, Russians and Europeans. Big brands have also been suffering from consumers' growing appetite for smaller, less widely distributed labels, particularly in key markets such as China, which was the luxury goods industry's main growth engine until 2012. ""I think for some brands there is a saturation and a brand fatigue issue in certain markets like Asia,"" said Scilla Huang Sun who runs the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund. Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton, part of industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), have all worked hard in the past three to five years to rebuild the aura of exclusivity they lost by going too mass market and milking the label too hard in the mid to late 2000s. The volume-based strategy made shareholders rich but also diluted the brand. Based on sales performance, some big fashion labels, such as Louis Vuitton or Hermes, appear to have done a better job than Gucci at rebuilding or supporting that exclusive image. Gucci's sales have been steadily declining over the past year while Louis Vuitton's revenues are still growing, albeit in low single digits, and Hermes -- which always kept volumes under control -- together with Burberry, are still enjoying sales growth of more than 10 percent. Prada could be the next victim of brand fatigue, having warned that it expected no sales growth this year. Prada was one of the brands that opened the most shops last year, leading analysts to wonder if it was not starting to be over-exposed. Analysts and investors say Gucci got rid of too many accessible items and on average, raised prices too much. They also mention lack of innovation, which affects brand desirability and ultimately investor sentiment and growth prospects. A spokeswoman for Gucci's parent Kering (PA:PRTP), which also owns Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, maintained it was ""satisfied with Gucci's upscale strategy that is underway,"" making reference to its third-quarter sales presentation. PAST ICONS Gucci says it is pleased with how new products have been received. These include a $4,500 python backpack with bamboo handles, a central fixture of Gucci bags for decades. ""You cannot just keep reviving past icons, you also need to have breakthrough innovation,"" Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst Luca Solca said citing designer Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent as a successful example. At Hermes, the most expensive European luxury stock -- trading at 27 times forward earnings while Kering is on 15 times and Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) on 18 times -- there is a ban on re-launching old classics. New designs and the rarity of its Kelly and Birkin bags have helped the brand retain its cachet. At Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld helps the brand preserve its edge by putting out six collections a year, which produce at least one best-selling item. Last season, it was a pair of $1,100 iridescent tweed sneakers that sold out. Nicolas Ghesquiere, the star designer hired by LVMH last year, recently created a new ""V"" logo for Louis Vuitton and an exclusive line of handbags costing more than 20,000 euros. Louis Vuitton also gained momentum last month with the opening of its art museum outside Paris designed by Frank Gehry and a limited bag collection created by celebrities such as shoe maker Christian Louboutin to mark its 160th anniversary. Louis Vuitton has benefited from new ideas and leadership, while Gucci has been run by chief executive Patrizio di Marco since 2009 and for most of the past decade by designer Frida Giannini, who is also now his partner and mother of his child. Some fashion critics say Gucci has been struggling to regain the sparkle and fashion authority it had when chief executive Domenico de Sole and designer Tom Ford ran it until 2004. ""They lost something special when Tom left,"" said Tamara Mellon, the woman who built Jimmy Choo into a global luxury shoe brand and is now developing her own fashion brand. Gucci customers may also have been driven away by sharp price rises - more than 40 percent in the past four to five years - sending them to more accessible luxury brands such as Michael Kors in the United States and Longchamp in France. Louis Vuitton also raised prices but more progressively and conducted a less radical shake-up of its product offering. Gucci has provided extensive details on the results of its upmarket strategy while Louis Vuitton has not. Rivals such as Mulberry and Lancel, part of Cartier owner Richemont, also saw sales plummet after raising prices too much. Gucci has also had to clean up its wholesale distribution network, affecting revenue, after department stores offered too many discounts, devaluing the brand. Louis Vuitton never does sales and has no wholesale account.  (Additional reporting by Pascale Denis in Paris; Editing by Anna Willard) "
333,"Sep 17, 2014 05:20PM ET",Exclusive: Jimmy Choo to pledge industry-beating growth in expected IPO ,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo will seek to woo investors with a share market flotation prospectus promising industry-beating annual sales growth of more than 10 percent on the back of aggressive expansion plans in Asia and elsewhere, a source close to the deal told Reuters.The upmarket shoe maker, known for its stilettos worn by Hollywood and Asian stars alike, will decide in the coming days whether it goes ahead with the initial public offering (IPO), depending on market conditions.If launched at the end of this month and depending on the precise timing, it is aiming for a listing at the end of October or early in November, the source said.The IPO, which could value Jimmy Choo at more than 700 million pounds ($1.14 billion), will be the first in the luxury sector since Moncler's successful flotation in Milan last year and would add a third luxury name to London's market after Burberry (L:BRBY) listed in 2002 and Mulberry (L:MUL) in 1996.But this time around the environment has become more challenging, with flagging demand from the Chinese and the Russians and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Cartier owner Richemont (VX:CFR) on Wednesday posted slowing sales growth, particularly in Asia, its biggest market.The luxury goods industry has been suffering a slowdown since the second half of 2012, with annual sales growth of the industry's main listed stocks dropping to an estimated 5-6 percent this year, from around 10 percent in 2012.Jimmy Choo will argue that its future growth rates will likely remain above those of the industry as its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the past five years has been 10-12 percent, the source said.The company's average annual sales growth has hovered around 15 percent in the past three years alone, the source added.""Jimmy Choo has reached critical mass, so going public will help it retain and attract talent,"" the source said.The brand, which has around 130 directly operated stores, is planning to continue to open about 10-15 stores a year as it has in previous years, mainly in Asia where it has a relatively small presence.The British brand will aim to convince investors that Jimmy Choo offers an opportunity to get exposure to the high-end shoe market, one of the fastest growing sub-categories of the luxury goods industry.Consultancy Bain estimated the CAGR of high end shoes to be around 10 percent between 2008-2013, compared with the overall luxury industry average of 5 percent. Jimmy Choo is expecting to make earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 50 million pounds this year, on sales of 300 million pounds, the source said.Assuming EBITDA next year will reach 60 million pounds, it would imply a valuation of a little over 12 times next year's underlying earnings, which puts Jimmy Choo on a small premium to the industry average of 10-11 times as well as to close peer Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) whose shares trade on a multiple of 11.5 .According to industry sources, Jimmy Choo's operating margins are roughly in line with those of Ferragamo's, or around 17 percent.LOVE FROM THE STARAfter having long been associated with celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, who famously supported the brand in the Sex and the City TV series, Jimmy Choo's sales received a boost earlier this year in Asia from having been mentioned in the Korean TV show ""My love from the star.""The British brand was founded in the 1990s by Jimmy Choo, a Malaysian bespoke shoe maker in London's East End, who developed the business with Tamara Mellon.Jimmy Choo's niece Sandra Choi stayed on as creative director but Mellon left after the company was acquired in 2011 for more than 500 million pounds by the Joh.A.Benckiser (JAB) family office.JAB, with more than $30 billion worth of assets under management from coffee to fashion brand and New-York listed cosmetics group Coty (N:COTY), makes investments for the Reimanns, the German billionaire family still associated with soaps and detergent maker Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB).The Jimmy Choo brand's IPO would involve the sale of a 25 percent stake by the owner, raising just under 200 million pounds, depending on the terms, the source said.The proceeds represent small change for JAB which is not planning to use the proceeds to invest in Jimmy Choo as the business is cash-generative and well funded, the source said.JAB this summer eliminated its Labelux luxury structure and parted ways with its chief executive, putting Peter Harf, one of the holding's three partners, in direct control over fashion operations which include Zagliani as well as Belstaff and Bally which are working to turn themselves round under new leadership.Around 75 percent of Jimmy Choo's business is shoes, of which half is made up of classic pumps for everyday wear, and the remaining 25 percent is from handbags and other small leather goods.The brand is run by seasoned luxury executive Pierre Denis, who worked for more than a decade for industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), managing the group's fashion brand John Galliano and before that acting as regional head for Christian Dior.Both Denis and designer Sandra Choi will retain small stakes in the company and the flotation will enable them to be rewarded in shares if they help improve the company's performance and share price.If the IPO goes ahead Bank of America Merrill Lynch will act as global coordinator and as joint-bookrunner with HSBC, industry and financial sources have said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment and Jimmy Choo and JAB also declined to comment.(Editing by Greg Mahlich)"
334,"Jul 25, 2014 01:20PM ET",LVMH results send chill across luxury goods sector,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - The outlook for the luxury goods industry darkened on Friday as poor results from industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) showed how the strong euro and political protests in Hong Kong were major factors curbing spending by Chinese and Russian customers.Shares in LVMH, seen as setting the tone for the luxury goods industry, fell as much as 7.2 percent on Friday - the biggest one-day drop since 2009, dragging down companies in the sector such as Cartier-owner Richemont, down 3 percent and Gucci-owner Kering (PA:PRTP), which fell 3.7 percent.LVMH's trading update late on Thursday revealed a marked drop in business in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have deterred Chinese visitors, as well as a drop in demand from elsewhere in China, and a much-worse-than-expected slump in Japan, boding ill for the sector.""We believe this sends a cold chill to investors who bought back into luxury in the spring in expectation of an upturn in demand from Chinese buyers,"" said JP Morgan Cazenove luxury goods analyst Melanie Flouquet.Sales growth in the luxury goods industry, which bounced back between 2010 and 2012 after the financial crisis, has been slowing in the past two years, hit by China's crackdown on corruption and conspicuous spending.Many luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and some watchmakers, had invested heavily in new shops in China since the mid-2000s to entice middle and upper class buyers.China had been seen as the industry's main growth engine, helping make up for lackluster demand in Europe and Japan.But on Friday, LVMH's results cemented the view that buoyant demand from China would never return and the global luxury goods industry was entering a long period of modest growth.""Sentiment towards the industry may not change direction until trends in Asia stabilize,"" said Omar Saad, consumer goods analyst at New York broker ISI Group.On Thursday, LVMH published first-half sales and profits below expectations and said fewer tourists, particularly from China, were shopping in Hong Kong. The former British colony is where many leading luxury brands earn more than 10 percent of their global revenue.For Richemont, it represents about 16 percent of its sales and for Swatch Group (VX:UHR), which on Tuesday expressed concern about future trading there, it is about 12 percent.GIFT FOR FAVORSTogether, Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China represent more than a third of sales for most leading luxury brands. The industry downturn has hit watchmakers hardest as timepieces are a classic gift-for-favors item.""It will take a few months, if not a few quarters, for the situation to normalize,"" LVMH Chief Financial Office Jean-Jacques Guiony said on Thursday of the group's watch business in China. LVMH's watch business, which includes the Hublot, Zenith, Louis Vuitton and Tag Heuer brands, is much smaller than that of Swatch and Richemont.Adding to its woes, the world's No.1 luxury group said growth in sales from Louis Vuitton, its main cash cow, had dropped in China in the second quarter from the first, while revenues from Chinese tourists declined in major European markets such as France.The strong euro has made goods and services more expensive for tourists, and LVMH was the latest luxury group to complain that numbers of Chinese tourists in shopping hotspots such as Paris had dropped due to their fears of being mugged.Chinese tourism associations say their citizens are targeted in Paris because they are thought more likely to carry cash than other tourists.Russian tourists, the world's No.2 luxury goods buyers after the Chinese, have been traveling and spending less on luxury goods in Europe due to the Ukraine crisis and the fall in the rouble, according to several luxury brands including Gucci and leather goods maker Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER).But analysts said some of LVMH's grim news was specific to the group. Louis Vuitton, the source of more than half of LVMH's operating profit, has been struggling to counter a feeling among emerging market customers that it has become too ubiquitous.The brand's sales growth in the second quarter collapsed to zero from 9 percent the previous three months. Next week, all eyes will be on Gucci, which has seen revenue growth collapse in the past three years from over 10 percent to close to zero.Like Gucci, Louis Vuitton has been trying to win back customers and regain exclusivity by strengthening its higher-end offering with leather goods and smart designs. But analysts said its latest results showed such efforts could take longer than expected to pay off.(Additional reporting by Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris; Editing by Andrew Callus and Giles Elgood)"

on Tuesday, continuing a rebound from last week's sharp falls,
as gains from mining stocks more than offset declines from
retailers after weak sales data on the high street. The FTSE 100  was up 9.73 points, or 0.2 percent, at
5,872.89 by 1118 GMT, having added 0.1 percent on Monday. The
index fell 1.4 percent last week, pressured by gloomy U.S. data. Miners  added the most points to the blue-chip

recently been trading below its 200-day moving average. ""We seem to be in something of a straitjacket at the moment.
On the one hand you have got the ongoing European sovereign debt

going on about whether the economy is in a soft patch or whether
it is something a bit more structural ... Until either one or
both of those issues can be resolved, it is difficult to see the
market moving on in any meaningful way."" Greece has made progress in tackling its debt crisis but
cannot afford to relax the pace of reforms, the International
Monetary Fund's senior representative in Greece told a banking
conference. [ID:nLDE7560D3] Bank stocks  were mixed, recovering some of
their poise after a sell-off in the previous session. Lloyds Banking Group  was the best performer, up 1.6
percent after being the biggest blue-chip faller on Monday after

 advanced 0.6 percent as the Kuwait Investment Authority
said it would consider buying a stake in RBS although no offer

unexpectedly in May as low wage growth and high inflation forced
consumers to rein in spending after a strong Easter, a survey
from the British Retail Consortium found. Marks & Spencer  shed 0.8 percent, Tesco 
dropped 1 percent, and Next  fell 0.2 percent. ""Any time that there is not consistent buying out there by

to investors. [ID:nLDE7560FR] Burberry  firmed 1.5 percent, as traders pointed to
a French press report pointing to bid talk within the sector. French retailer and luxury goods company PPR  is in
talks to make a large acquisition in the luxury sector, La

the luxury brand Gucci, said on Tuesday it would continue to cut
costs and boost competitiveness after posting lower
third-quarter sales, slightly below forecasts. Third-quarter revenue reached 4.56 billion euros ($6.8
billion), a drop of 7.6 percent year-on-year. Analysts had been
expecting sales of 4.64 billion euros. PPR Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault blamed the
""lacklustre"" macroeconomic environment, weak tourism flows and 
high year-on-year comparisons for the decline. PPR would pursue previously announced plans to reinforce its
competitive edge and market positioning, the statement said. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Francois Palus told a
conference call that PPR would focus on protecting its gross
margin and cost base. He said previous cost-cutting measures had
already borne fruit in the first half of this year, with more to
come in the second half and in 2010. ""We are confident that the transformation we have carried
out during these tougher periods will fully benefit us in better
times and as soon as a durable recovery starts occurring,
presumably in 2010,"" he said. Palus reiterated PPR's intention to spin off auto and
pharmaceutical retailer CFAO into a separately listed company,
which he said would bolster PPR's financial position. Gucci brand like-for-like sales fell 6 percent in the third
quarter, excluding timepieces, with wholesale orders suffering
more than directly operated stores. Watches and other so-called 'hard' luxury goods performed
worse than 'soft' goods like leather and accessories. The Gucci Group, which also includes Bottega Veneta and Yves
Saint-Laurent, reported a 10 percent drop in like-for-like
sales, to 819 million euros. Emerging-market sales for Gucci Group rose 10 percent,
especially in China, but failed to offset double-digit declines
in America and Europe. Palus said that Gucci Group was cutting down on capital
expenditure as well as other costs, adding that opening a new
store now costs 30 percent less per square metre than before. PPR's sportswear brand, Puma, had like-for-like sales down
9.8 percent. Nearly all of PPR's non-luxury divisions, including
home-improvement chain Conforama and mail-order company Redcats,
reported like-for-like sales declines of around 10 percent. Retail chain Fnac, which sells books, DVDs and records, was
an exception with a like-for-like increase of 0.5 percent. Fnac bucked the sluggish trend thanks to new e-commerce site
Fnac Marketplace and the introduction of product lines such as
stationery and second-hand videogames. Rival LVMH beat consensus expectations with its
third-quarter sales of 4.14 billion euros on Monday. Analysts
had forecast 4.13 billion euros. Louis Vuitton is less exposed
to wholesale than Gucci. PPR, which is controlled by the Pinault family, last year
began a restructuring and cost-cutting plan to defend its
operating margin in the face of falling sales. It has not given any profit guidance for the year. Shares of PPR closed up 0.1 percent at 85.17 euros before

Gucci, is expected to report a 6 percent drop in third-quarter sales on Tuesday
due to a weak trading environment and tough comparable figures from last year. Analysts expect PPR to post sales of 4.6 billion euros ($6.87 billion) in
the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll of nine analysts. Analysts cited a slowdown in wholesale orders for Gucci as well as weak
demand for less recognisable brands such as Bottega Veneta. Other challenges
include weak tourist flows and sluggishness in mature markets like the United
States and Japan. French consumers are cutting back on non-essential purchases in the wake of
economic recession and rising unemployment. PPR brands such as home improvement store Conforoma, books and records store
Fnac and the Redcats mail order company are also expected to post declining
sales as a result of the tough environment. PPR's sales performance is expected to improve in the fourth quarter of this
year, however, thanks to easier comparable figures from 2008. PPR, which is controlled by the Pinault family, has launched a vast
restructuring and cost-cutting plan to defend its operating margin in the face
of falling sales. It has not given any profit guidance for the year. The company said at the start of October that it would spin off CFAO, its
pharmaceuticals and auto retail subsidiary, to further concentrate on apparel
and luxury goods. PPR's rival, LVMH, will report its third-quarter sales on Monday after the
market close.

348,"Oct 16, 2009 09:03AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Risks to global equity rally,nan," (Clarifies penultimate paragraph) By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Four major risks threaten a solid
year-end rally to cap this year's stunning bounce back by global
equities -- earnings, bonds, currencies and cash. Investor optimism has been so unrestrained recently that
good earnings are beginning to be dismissed because they do not
meet exaggerated expectations. Take Goldman Sachs this week, for example. It beat earnings
expectations by 23 percent on a per share basis but the
announcement was met with disappointment. Stocks fell and the dollar rose initially when the results
came out because the market was so ebullient it was willing to
believe a so-called ""whisper number"" for the earnings at the
wildest edge of speculation. In the event, stocks recovered to close higher on the day.
But disappointments were the order of the day on Friday. Nonetheless, world stocks begin next week at 12-month highs,
up well over 70 percent from their March lows. High-yielding
currencies are in huge demand and emerging market debt spreads
have narrowed about half a percentage point in October alone. Underlining it all, measures of the volatility of Wall
Street stocks are falling. The VIX volatililty index, the ""fear
gauge"", has broken below its recent range and is now at
 ""normal"", pre-crisis levels. That in itself automatically creates buy signals in many
trading models. ---------------------------------------------------------- For a graphic showing the VIX and its ""normal"" levels, click
on http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/109/GLB_VIXRG1009.gif ---------------------------------------------------------- This all points to risk-hungry investors entering a new week
with the bit between their teeth again, despite the odd
disappointment such as Friday's Bank of America loss. ""Earnings turned in the second quarter of this year. We are
on track for a good 18 months of corporate earnings growth,""
said Bob Parker, vice chairman of Credit Suisse's asset
management arm. The market is enjoying high levels of liquidity, a store of
investor cash and generally positive economic numbers, he said.  Underlying economic numbers such as Chinese trade and
lending, UK unemployment, U.S. retail sales and euro zone
manufacturing have come in better than expected. Reuters polls this week found expectations among economists
that the U.S. and euro zone economies came out of recession in
the third quarter.  RISK APPETITE There are, nonetheless, the four risks. Much of the latest
tranche of the stock rally is based on optimism over earnings. Notwithstanding Goldman's failure to meet excessive
expectations and the Bank of America results, many reports have
been positive, among them JPMorgan Chase, Google and IBM. Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows that as of
Thursday, with 10 percent of S&P 500 index companies having
reported, 82 percent had beaten expectations. Should many others come in below forecast or expectations
rise too high Goldman-like, the market would be vulnerable to a
quick reversal. Retailers will be in focus next week and Europe will have
its first full week of reporting. Results are due from Apple,
Nestle, Danone, Coca-Cola, Cadbury, Hershey, LVMH, PPR, Ahold
and Home Retail. Government bond yields, in the meantime, have been rising
modestly this month as equities have gained and risk appetite
built up. The risk is that this becomes more rapid, creating a
sell-off that would send borrowing rates through the roof. The factors mitigating against this are continued low rates
and quantitative easing from central banks along with muted
inflationary pressures. This leaves markets highly sensitive to any hint that
authorities are seeking to exit from the programmes the set in
place to combat the financial crisis. Australia, for example,
has already begun raising rates.
 PARITY All eyes next week will also be on the currency markets
where the dollar's overall decline has begun to concern those
countries whose currencies are rising as a result. ""If we have dollar/euro going to $1.60 very quickly that
would put a big constraint on euro zone economic recovery,
likewise the yen at 85,"" Credit Suisse's Parker said. The dollar was a fair way from these levels on Friday, at
around $1.49 to the euro and 91 yen -- but the fact that these
levels are being mentioned shows the sentiment towards the
dollar. It has fallen 6.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies this year. Parity, meanwhile, is drawing nearer for the U.S.
dollar/Canadian dollar, dollar/Swiss franc and euro/sterling. 
The psychological impact of hitting such rates would magnify the
official reaction, exporters' scramble to hedge, and the
complaints about loss of competitive advantage. Finally, there are signs that the tidal wave of cash that
was put into money market funds at the height of the financial
crisis has now mostly been thrown back into other assets this
year. ""The latest outflows from money market funds took the YTD
total to $396 billion, equal to nearly 94 percent of the total
weekly inflows recorded by this fund group during 2008,"" Fund
trackers EPFR Global said this week. (Additional reporting by Swaha Pattanaik; graphic by Scott

 (Adds comment by CFO, analysts; shares, background) By Mark Potter LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Luxury goods group Burberry beat
second-quarter revenue forecasts, helped by demand for handbags,
leather goods and snoods, adding to signs of a consumer recovery
and lifting its shares to a 21-month high.  The 153-year-old British maker of raincoats said the trading
outlook remained uncertain, but also signalled an improvement in
revenue trends for the second half, helped by market share gains
in orders from U.S. department stores.  Finance director Stacey Cartwright said on Wednesday she
expected analysts' full-year consensus profit forecast to edge
up, and Burberry shares were up 4.1 percent to 559 pence by 0845
GMT, their highest level since January 2008.  ""They were better pretty much across the board,"" Evolution
analyst Dennis Weber said of the second-quarter numbers. He said while Burberry shares have rallied strongly, they
still had room to rise as they are trading at 17.3 times
earnings forecasts for next year, below rivals Richemont and
Swatch on 18.3 and LVMH on 19. Luxury goods firms have been hit hard in the recession, but
Burberry, known for its camel, red and black check, reacted
quickly by slashing costs, jobs, stock and range assortments. Its 2010 spring/summer collection also received rave reviews
last month at London fashion week, and there have been signs of
a recovery in consumer spending. Euro zone retail sales fell a
shallower than expected 0.2 percent in August. LVMH and PPR publish trading updates next week.  IMPROVING TRENDS Burberry said it had revenue of 343 million pounds ($548
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, down 5 percent at
constant currencies but beating forecasts of 320-335 million in
a Reuters poll. Retail revenue rose an underlying 16 percent to 163 million
pounds, including like-for-like growth of 5 percent, as
double-digit percentage rises in Europe and Asia offset
similar-sized declines in the United States and Spain. Growth was strongest in Britain and South Korea as tourists
were attracted by weaker currencies and refurbished shops. Cartwright said the group was also pleased with the
proportion of goods sold at full price in the second quarter,
which she said would boost gross profit margin. Citi analysts said the full-year consensus profit forecast
was likely to rise about 5 percent to 185 million pounds. Burberry, which runs 122 retail outlets, 255 concessions, 90
franchise stores and an e-commerce business in over 25
countries, said it expected to open about 15 mainline stores
over the full year, at the top end of its previous guidance.  Wholesale revenue fell an underlying 21 percent in the
second quarter, while licensing revenue was down 9 percent.  Burberry said it expected second-half wholesale revenue
would fall an underlying 15 percent and raised its full-year
guidance for licensing revenue to a decline of 5-10 percent from
a fall of 10-15 percent previously.  Cartwright said second-half wholesale revenues would be down
around 7 percent excluding the impact of a previously announced
decision to close some accounts.  Wholesales revenues were down less than 7 percent in the
United States, but were higher in Spain, she said.  Burberry shares re-entered Britain's benchmark FTSE-100
index last month.

 plans to launch an initial public offering of its CFAO
distribution unit on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris by the
end of the year, provided market conditions are favourable. PPR, which owns brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent,
said it expected to sell a majority stake in CFAO, a leader in

351,"Jul 28, 2009 08:40AM ET","European luxury sector gets lift from LVMH, PPR",nan," * LVMH shares up as much as 2.7 percent on leather, fashion * LVMH's poor jewellery performance hits Bulgari, Richemont * PPR shares rise 3 percent ahead of Friday's results  By Astrid Wendlandt, European Luxury Goods Correspondent PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Europe's luxury stocks rose on
Tuesday after a solid set of results from LVMH and Morgan
Stanley upgraded Gucci parent PPR. LVMH shares gained as much as 2.8 percent after the world's
biggest luxury goods group posted stronger-than-expected
earnings from its leather goods and fashion division. By 1200
GMT, they were up 0.6 percent at 61.65 euros in a flat European
personal and household goods sector. PPR shares, meanwhile, rose as much as 5 percent and by 1200
GMT stood 3 percent higher at 67.38 euros. Improved sentiment towards the luxury sector also benefited
Hermes, the world's second-largest luxury goods group by market
value, which gained 1.1 percent to 104.60 euros. During times of economic uncertainty, results show consumers
prefer strong well-established brands such as Louis Vuitton,
Hermes and Gucci which they see offering more value for money
than younger, more fickle fashion and leather brands. Chic handbag maker Louis Vuitton, which generates more than
half of LVMH's operating profit, continued to enjoy double-digit
sales growth during the first half. ""This (sales) trend (of proprietary retail distribution and
Louis Vuitton), coupled with an operating profit (from fashion
and leather goods) ahead of our estimates strengthened the
defensive profile of the stock and explains today's positive
share price reaction,"" S&P Equity Research said in a note.  ALL EYES ON GUCCI The news bodes well for PPR's Gucci Group, which owns brands
Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, Balenciaga and Stella McCartney.  PPR is due to publish first-half results on Friday. Morgan Stanley said it believed the Gucci brand, which
generates about 40 of the Gucci Group's operating profit, had
been overlooked by the market as investors were spooked by the
conglomerate structure and gearing of parent PPR. The broker upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""equal
weight"" and raised its price target to 76 euros from 58 euros,
estimating that the price-to-earnings ratio of the Gucci brand
at around 12 times presented a 25 percent discount to its peers. But if leather goods and fashion stocks enjoyed a small
rally, investor's sentiment towards companies more closely
associated with ""hard luxury,"" such as watches and jewellery,
was affected by LVMH's poor first-half performance. Operating profit from LVMH's watch and jewellery unit fell
73 percent in the first half on sales down 34 percent on a
like-for-like basis. The result had a knock-on effect on Italian jewellery group
Bulgari, whose shares were down about 1 percent, while shares in
Cartier parent Richemont fell in early morning trade and were
flat around 1200 GMT. (Editing by Marie Maitre)

the designer Christian Lacroix himself, is deemed serious."" Earlier on Monday, BKC said it had bid a ""symbolic sum"" for
Christian Lacroix, a fashion house it considers part of France's
cultural heritage. Christian Lacroix and Borletti were not available for
comment on Monday. KBC was contacted by Patrick Devedjian, France's minister in
charge of the national fiscal recovery plan, to save the
lossmaking couture business, which has been in administration
for nearly two months.  The company behind the designer, known for his baroque and
embroidered dresses, has never made a profit in its 22 years of
trading. Earlier this month, Christian Lacroix stitched together a
small couture show with the help of friends and dressmakers who
worked for free, and many observers feared it could be his last.
 In 2008, the company made a loss of 10 million euros ($14.26
million) on revenues of 30 million euros, while orders for its
2009 women's ready-to-wear summer collection have been down 35
percent. The Borletti group bought the Printemps department stores
from PPR in 2006 and La Rinascente shops with Deutsche Bank,
Pirelli and Investitori Associati in 2005. DEBT-FREE BKC said it had made an offer to acquire Christian Lacroix
debt-free and proposed to buy its commercial operations, haute
couture activities and take on at least half of its 120
employees.  It said it hoped to raise its offer later to at least 100
staff as negotiations with court-appointed administrators were
likely to last at least one month. The commercial court is
expected to make a ruling in September. ""We have made an offer this morning before (the deadline of)
10am ... It is only symbolic really,"" Louis Petiet, head of
Bernard Krief Consulting told Reuters. Asked if the offer
consisted of a few million euros, he said: ""not even."" ""Our offer will be improved later,"" Petiet added. BKC has said it aimed to increase Christian Lacroix's
revenues fivefold within five years. The investment firm acquired some 30 businesses in the past
five years, including the car parts company Heuliez recently. ""During economic crises, there are many who hide under the
carpet while the President of the French Republic talks of
reindustrialising France. I listen to him,"" Petiet said, adding
he saw himself as ""an entrepreneur and a patriot.""

 (Adds details, CEO comments, share price) By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, May 18 (Reuters) - Lancel, the upmarket handbag maker
owned by luxury group Richemont , has seen a slight rise
in comparable retail sales since January as a new bag by French
actress Isabelle Adjani sold out, its head told Reuters. The 133-year-old French leather goods house is shifting
towards the high end of the market and stepping up worldwide
expansion with 40 store openings this year despite the consumer
downturn, Chief Executive Marc Lelandais said in an interview. ""Lancel has seen a slight increase in like-for-like sales
since the beginning of the year,"" Lelandais said on Monday. ""Of
course, it is no euphoria but we have seen a sustained small
growth, I would say between zero and 5 percent."" In comparison, Hermes  leather goods sales, which
include shoes and saddles, rose 10.2 percent on a like-for-like
basis during the first quarter. Leather goods made by the Gucci
brand, owned by PPR , rose 8.3 percent. Fashion and leather goods sales at LVMH , a good
part of which come from Louis Vuitton, rose 4 percent on a
comparable basis during the first quarter. Retail sales, or revenue generated by the company's
boutiques, make up the bulk of Lancel's total revenue. Wholesale
turnover is down about 20 percent since the start of the year,
compared with the same period last year, Lelandais said. Trading overall since the beginning of the year has been
buoyed by sales of the new Adjani bag, designed and promoted by
the French actress and which ran out in April, four months after
its launch, Lelandais said. He compared the bag's popularity to Hermes' best-selling
Kelly and Birkin bags, named after actresses Grace Kelly and
Jane Birkin. Lancel's trapezium-shaped multi-pocketed Adjani bag, which
starts at 800 euros ($1,078) and can reach 8,000 euros in
genuine crocodile leather, is one of its most expensive. ""Our strategy in the crisis is to be different and to launch
a 1,000-euro handbag,"" Lelandais said. ""And it works."" He expected to sell more than 10,000 Adjani bags in France
by the end of the year, having sold about half of that already,
or the ""equivalent of two years' stock in three months"". ""We are changing the positioning of the brand, we are moving
more towards the high end,"" Lelandais said. He said Lancel would open shops in Tokyo in June and in
Moscow and Dubai in July. Lancel, which owns 120 shops worldwide but is not present in
the United States, plans to refurbish some 20 stores this year. Most of its handbags are made in Spain and Italy. Richemont shares were up 1.24 percent at 22.88 swiss francs
by 1219 GMT, roughly in line with the DJ Stoxx retail index
, which was up 1.60 percent.

355,"Apr 28, 2009 07:08AM ET",RPT-Luxury stocks hit by fear swine flu stopping travel,nan," (Repeating to send to additional Reuters subscribers) By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, April 28 (Reuters) - Luxury goods stocks continued to
slide on Tuesday as the swine flu outbreak raised fears it could
hold back travellers, traditional buyers of upmarket handbags,
watches and other pricey items. The decline has put an end to a month-and-half long rally in
the shares as the world's top luxury brands outperformed the
market. Shares in world luxury goods leader LVMH fell as much as 4
percent, having gained 18 percent so far in 2009 and its parent
Dior 26 percent. The French CAC 40 index of blue chips has lost
6 percent since the beginning of the year. Shares in No. 2 Hermes were down as much as 3.8  percent and
those in No.3 Richemont 6.3 percent. Analysts said they expected the World Health Organisation
(WHO) and national health authorities to recommend travel
restrictions on worries of a possible epidemic of swine flu. Already, EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou has
advised people to avoid travel to the United States and Mexico.
 Bernstein estimated that about 20 percent of luxury products
are purchased by people when they travel for business or
leisure. ""A serious epidemic can be the 'perfect storm' for
international travel,"" Bernstein said in a note. ""Assuming swine flu was like SARS -- i.e. far from
devastating but serious enough -- the more probable risk for
luxury goods stocks is short-term weakness."" Concerns about the possible repeat of an outbreak like the
spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the end of
2002 and in early 2003 also hit watchmakers. Shares in the world leader Swatch fell as much as 6 percent
to 157.50 Swiss francs. ""If it spreads to the U.S. and people stop travelling there,
the impact will be big,"" said Vontobel analyst Rene Weber. ""The U.S. accounts for 14 percent of Swiss watch exports and
there are no taxes there. A lot of people from Latin American
countries go there to buy watches."" Shares in PPR, whose business is split between retail and
luxury, have also fallen. They were down 6 percent at 57.72
euros at 1049 GMT, after having gained 25 percent so far this
year. Burberry also suffered, down 6.4 percent to 368.25 pence. Credit Suisse said in a note that if concerns rose to
SARS-like levels -- which it believed was very unlikely -- the
global equity markets could fall between 10 and 15 percent.

prices) By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, April 22 (Reuters) - LVMH, the world's biggest luxury
group, suffered a 7 percent drop in comparable first-quarter
sales, hit by sharp declines at its wines, spirits, watches and
jewellery divisions.
 Earlier on Wednesday, LVMH denied it was in talks to sell
its wine and spirits unit, attempting to quash speculation
Diageo, the world's biggest alcoholic drinks group, was in the
early stages of a 12-billion-euro ($15.51 billion) bid.  LVMH, which owns Dom Perignon champagne and fashion houses
Louis Vuitton and Celine, moved away from its traditionally
upbeat tone in spite of the consumer downturn, saying on
Wednesday it faced an ""exceptionally challenging environment."" Demand for cognac and champagne dropped in recent months
while its top watch brand Tag Heuer and jewellery unit De Beers
were hit by their high exposure to the U.S. market. ""There is not much to celebrate these days so the end-
demand (for champagne) is not that great,"" LVMH Finance Director
Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts in a conference call. LVMH made revenues of 4.018 billion euros ($5.19 billion) in
the three months to March 31, slightly below average forecasts
of 4.125 billion euros from a Reuters poll of nine analysts. Like-for-like wine and spirit revenues dropped 22 percent to
540 million euros while comparable sales from watches and
jewellery fell 41 percent to 154 million euros during the first
quarter. ""I don't believe LVMH would sell that unit (wines and
spirits) partly because it is a good cash generator and one of
the two main pillars of the group,"" said Luca Solca, luxury
analyst at Bernstein in London. He added that LVMH's first-quarter figures were broadly in
line with expectations, but jewellery, watches, perfumes and
cosmetics were slightly below forecasts. Perfume and cosmetics revenues fell 11 percent on a
like-for-like basis to 663 million euros. The group's last bastion of growth remained its biggest
division, specialised in fashion and leather goods, which
enjoyed a 4 percent rise in comparable first-quarter sales to
1.6 billion euros. LVMH's trading update came after Gucci Group, part of PPR
and owner of fashion brands Yves Saint Laurent and Stella
McCartney, on Tuesday posted a 3.4 percent drop in like-for-like
first-quarter sales. ""The efforts to adapt to the current context will continue
throughout the year through the strict management of costs and
selective investments,"" LVMH said in a statement. Guiony added that the group was not looking to make any
acquisitions ""in the hard luxury market,"" which includes
jewellery and watches. LVMH shares closed down 3.64 percent at 53 euros while PPR

believe it is acceptable for workers facing layoffs to lock up
their bosses, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday. Staff at French plants run by Sony, 3M and Caterpillar have
held managers inside the factories overnight, in three separate
incidents, to demand better layoff terms -- a new form of labour
action dubbed ""bossnapping"" by the media. A poll by the CSA institute for Le Parisien newspaper found
50 percent of French people surveyed disapproved of such acts,
but 45 percent thought they were acceptable. ""They are not in the majority ... but 45 percent is an
enormous percentage and it demonstrates the extent of
exasperation among the public at this time of economic crisis,""
Le Parisien said. On March 31, billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault was trapped
in a taxi in Paris for an hour by staff from his PPR luxury and
retail group who were angry about layoffs. Riot police
intervened to free him. Le Parisien found that 56 percent of blue-collar workers
polled approved of bossnappings while 41 percent disapproved.
Among white-collar workers, 59 percent were against the practice
while 40 percent thought it was acceptable. ""These hostage takings, we know how it starts but no one
knows how far it can go,"" said Xavier Bertrand, a former labour

At a Vivienne Westwood show, buyer Amanda Ware lists new trends
she has spotted in London: quirky hats, trendy scarves -- and
British-made designer accessories featuring the Union Jack. Several fashion buyers visiting this month's Paris shows
reported a jump in nationalist purchases, especially in London,
which before the economic crisis prided itself on being the
capital of multicultural style. ""I think it's this whole Britishness thing,"" said Ware, who
buys accessories for luxury store Fortnum & Mason in London. In
the boom years, the French and Italian brands she stocks were
more popular than British ones, she said. That has changed. Ware has adjusted her purchases accordingly, buying visibly
British accessories such as a Paul Smith scarf with a London
city print, which she expects to do well despite the general
retail slump. ""There's been a lot of support for both Vivienne Westwood
and Paul Smith, it's been the strongest this season,"" she said. ""Vivienne Westwood is more tartan, Paul Smith is strong with
the Union Jack. It's really flown over the past 8-12 weeks."" From workers protesting against foreigners taking jobs to
governments bailing out failing local industries, fashion
executives point to a global wave of nationalist protests and
policies since the world economy turned sharply down. The World Bank said in a report this month that since last
November, 17 of the G20 nations had implemented measures whose
effect is to restrict trade at the expense of other countries. ""The trend in protection is up and the full effects (of)
recession have not yet been felt,"" said the report by Elisa
Gamberoni and Richard Newfarmer. The patriotic shopping spree suggests such nationalism is
seeping into the middle classes, steering those who can afford
designer accessories costing several hundred pounds.  BUYING YOUR OWN ""I think there is a general trend of people buying from
their own country. Globally, protectionism is growing, and you
see that in fashion,"" Geoffrey de La Bourdonnaye, chief
executive of Liberty of London, told Reuters at the Christian
Lacroix show in Paris. In a curious backlash, the trend appears to be strongest in
Britain, whose former Prime Minister Tony Blair was one of the
most vocal defenders of globalisation. The French have supported protectionist policies such as aid
for the car sector but designers and retailers say they are not
particularly looking to buy French fashion brands. In the United States, which came under fire last month for a
""Buy American"" campaign, clothes and accessories featuring
President Barack Obama are popular. But fashionable New Yorkers
see wearing national symbols such as the flag as an expression
of right-wing politics. Nostalgia could be a factor for older Britons remembering
campaigns since the 1960s that encouraged citizens to support
the British economy with T-shirts, Union Jack badges, songs and
ubiquitous slogans like ""Backing Britain"". ""There has always been in Britain a tendency to buy local,
for a couple of reasons. There's the green reason, and also
national pride -- the British are very proud of their craft --
and now it's also cheaper to buy British,"" said de La
Bourdonnaye, referring to the weak pound. A few weeks ago, the left-wing Guardian newspaper ran a
fashion spread in its weekend magazine under the tongue-in-cheek
headline: ""Women of Britain - your designers need you!"" Featuring pictures of World War Two propaganda posters and a
model in typically British labels such as Burberry and Stella
McCartney, it urged shoppers to ""buy British this season"".  CUSTOMISED NATIONALISM Historically, the use of fashion for nationalist purposes
stretches across the political spectrum. Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini created a government institution to promote fascist
fashion, while Mahatma Gandhi called upon fellow Indians to wear
homespun cotton in the struggle against British colonial rule. Proponents of free markets argue that in economic terms,
campaigns to buy local are ultimately detrimental. While such campaigns may shore up companies and jobs in the
short run, they argue, they have the opposite effect in the long
term by stifling international trade and stunting growth. If protectionist sentiment in fashion spread, it could close
off lucrative foreign markets for Italian, French and British
designers, whose businesses have been been buoyed by demand from
the new middle classes in fast-growing emerging economies. Retail and wholesale revenues at Burberry, for example, were
up 53 percent in Asia in the last three months of 2008 compared
with the previous year -- making the region the luxury brand's
strongest performer, along with the Middle East. But in times of turmoil such arguments risk losing out.
Jason Broderick, head of menswear purchases at Harrod's, has
also seen a greater focus on British-made products. ""I think people are concerned with keeping the fellow
countryman in work and supporting British-made will ensure this
to a level,"" he wrote in an e-mail to Reuters. Of course, just how British such products are is
questionable: top fashion houses use Chinese-made soles for
their shoes, Indian-embroidered silk for evening gowns and
designers from, well, anywhere for their creative direction. For a sector that thrives on meshing different cultures, a
trend towards buying one's own seems a mismatch. And the Stella McCartney brand featured in the Guardian's
""Buy British"" spread is, of course, owned by the Italian-rooted
Gucci group, which in turn is part of French retail giant PPR.

359,"Mar 10, 2009 10:16AM ET",Yves Saint Laurent banks on classic style in crisis,nan," By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - Fashion house Yves Saint Laurent
will not be cutting prices or corners in the face the economic
crisis, its head said after unveiling a conservative collection
of black leather dresses and high-waistline flannel grey skirts. Hands-on fashion veteran Valerie Hermann, who brought back
YSL to profitability in 2008 after running it for just over
three years, said she did not plan to sacrifice margins even if
buyers were adopting a more cautious attitude. ""Lowering prices and quality, never!"" Hermann told Reuters
backstage of the autumn/winter 2009-2010 collection presented
late on Monday at the Palais de Tokyo modern art exhibition
centre in Paris. ""If we lowered prices by 30 percent, we would disappear."" She said the company's strategy was to make ""wearable
clothes,"" both in terms of price and quality. Hermann added YSL would try to design less complex and
costly clothes than in some previous seasons. Last year, YSL made an operating profit of 300,000 euros
($380,600) on revenues of 263 million euros after decades of
losses. By the end of 2008, it ran a worldwide network of 64
shops and employed 1,046 staff. YSL, which prides itself on making women's ready-to-wear
clothes in France, generates nearly 58 percent of its sales in
Europe, 22 percent in North America and 7.5 percent in Japan. Created in 1961, YSL is one of several French iconic houses
such as Dior and Chanel that try to strike a balance between
preserving their heritage and producing innovative clothes to
compete against young, trendy and fast-growing brands. YSL was acquired in 1999 by Gucci Group, which is part of
the French group retail and luxury group PPR for $1 billion.
Last year, PPR sold its YSL perfume and cosmetics line to beauty
products giant L'Oreal for an enterprise value of 1.15 billion
euros. Front row guests at the YSL show included actress and model
Milla Jovovich.
 ""That show was amazing, very wearable pieces, there are at
least 10 things I would like to buy,"" Jovovich told Reuters. Last year, Jovovich stopped her fashion line co-founded with
Carmen Hawk in 2003 called Jovovich-Hawk. She said there were no
plans to resurrect it for the moment.  POLARISED MARKET Hermann said buyers had become more polarised. Either they
wanted top-of-the-line clothes or mass-market, cheaply priced
items. There was little room for the middle ground. She said YSL was faring well in the downturn partly thanks
to its 24 hours edition launched in recent years which was
priced more accessibly than the catwalk collection. ""People who come into our shops now think twice and even
three times before buying something and they ask themselves
whether their investment will last,"" Hermann said. The YSL ready-to-wear collection designed by Milanese
designer Stefano Pilati, featured classic grey and black
utilitarian suits, jackets and coats. It included puffed out white blouses on pin-striped skirts,
leather overalls on bare skin and pencil-thin stilettos on
platform soles. As a tribute to its founder Yves Saint Laurent, credited
with having revolutionised French fashion and introducing tuxedo
jackets and pants for women, the new collection included a
tuxedo-themed black dress with a floating hemline.

360,"Mar 02, 2009 05:16AM ET",ANALYSIS-Fallen angels set to throng Europe's credit markets,nan," * Investors now focus on potential fallen angels * Automakers, retail, building materials seen as candidates * Big jump in spreads follow rating downgrades  By Jane Merriman LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The economic downturn will drive
more European corporate bonds into the ranks of ""fallen angels"",
an opportunity for investors as they try to guess whose will be
downgraded next after Renault and Fiat. Companies become fallen angels when they lose their
investment grade rating to become speculative grade or junk.
Although spreads often widen in anticipation of a rating
downgrade, the fall to junk status itself usually triggers a
further sharp move. ""We have numerous credits now on the verge of fallen angel
status that have not yet fallen,"" said Peter Aspbury, head of
high yield research at European Credit Management. ""Give it another quarter or so, and you will have even more
of the (European) auto sector below investment grade, plus
further downgrades in basic materials and retail for example,""
he said. ""There will be better pickings for fallen angel
investors at that point."" A move to junk drives down the price of a company's bonds
and raises its borrowing costs, because it is seen as more risky
in terms of a potential default. Investors can bet that a potential fallen angel avoids the
drop, by simply buying its low-priced bonds. They can also make
money on those that do, by using credit default swaps (CDS) to
buy protection against the company's default -- a contract that
rises in value as spreads widen. The economic downturn has turned 75 companies globally into
potential fallen angels, the highest number in 18 years,
according to Standard & Poor's. S&P defines potential fallen
angels as companies rated BBB- with a negative outlook. This compares with a monthly average of 47 potential fallen
angels in 2008, S&P said. Barclays Capital estimates that European companies with
about 55 billion euros of bonds outstanding could be potential
fallen-angel candidates because of the global economic downturn. ""We expect that 41 billion euros ($52.1 billion) worth of
bonds are likely to go junk, while 14.7 billion are possible but
not likely,"" Barclays said in a note. Europe's high-yield market, where junk bonds are traded, is
small compared to that of the United States and has had only one
new issue -- by German healthcare group Fresenius -- since the
start of the credit crisis in July 2007. ""The big source of growth in the high-yield market will be
the new supply through fallen angels,"" said Mahesh Bhimalingam,
a Barclays high-yield credit strategist.  DOWNGRADE SIGNALS Some European retailers, including Kingfisher, Marks and
Spencer and PPR are already trading in the credit derivatives
markets at levels that signal a downgrade. Five-year credit default swaps on French retailer PPR were
at about 557 basis points on Monday, a level analysts see as
already pricing in a downgrade. PPR is rated BBB- by Standard &
Poor's. ""The UK retail sector is expected to face particularly
challenging trading conditions in the months ahead,""
CreditSights said in a research note. ""Cross-over concerns
center on Kingfisher and Marks and Spencer."" When downgrades occur, spreads can widen more sharply, even
though the market had anticipated it. This is partly because many investors are restricted by
investment mandates to hold only investment-grade assets, and so
are forced to sell after a downgrade. ""Even if they (the markets) are pricing in a downgrade, the
chances are it's not enough,"" said Ben Bennett, credit
strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. Five-year CDS for Renault, for example, were trading at
around 440 basis points on Feb. 20 before it was downgraded by
Moody's Investors Service to Ba1, one level below investment
grade. They have since jumped wider to around 568 basis points. The spread on Renault's bond maturing in 2010 almost doubled
to 472 basis points from 250 basis points. ""This underlines the need for state aid to provide
junk-rated companies with access to capital,"" said Frank
Hussing, credit analyst at Commerzbank in a note. An investor can profit from the widening spread by buying
protection in the credit default swaps market. Or investors can
try to pick companies that come close to a downgrade but then
take steps to avoid it. ""From an active fund manager point of view, the aim is to
try to pick those who perhaps will avoid the drop to fallen
angel -- by doing a rights issue,"" said Bennett. Last month, French building materials company Lafarge tapped
shareholders for an additional 1.5 billion euros to bolster its
finances and strengthen its credit ratings. Standard & Poor's
revised its outlook on Lafarge's BBB- rating to stable from
negative following the issue. Investors are more likely to shun the debt of high-risk
fallen angels in the current uncertain economic environment,
while record volumes of new issues in the euro bond market so
far this year give them plenty to choose from. ""Yields on primary investment grade bond issuance are so
attractive and tend to be more liquid that it makes secondary
fallen angel paper less appealing,"" said Aspbury.

 (Adds details from FD interview, updates shares) By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Europe's luxury industry drew some
comfort on Friday from Hermes' relatively encouraging 2009
outlook, and a positive trading update from LVMH. The news from the world's two biggest luxury groups by
market value lifted the whole sector, battered in recent weeks
by disappointing sales and growing evidence of restrained
spending even among the ultra-rich. Fresh figures from the pair showed upmarket handbags, shoes
and other leather goods resisted consumer thriftiness better
than jewellery, watches and certain spirits. Hermes said it aimed to keep 2009 sales relatively constant
against 2008. Many analysts expect the global luxury market to
fall about 10 percent this year. LVMH said January ""was not a bad month"" but declined to give
any guidance for 2009. Shares in Hermes rose as much as 8 percent, and were up 6.1
percent at 79.56 euros by 1308 GMT, valuing it at 8.4 billion
euros ($10.8 billion), making it the world No. 2 behind LVMH. The French CAC 40 index of blue-chip companies was up 0.4
percent, while the DJ Stoxx Personal and Household Goods index
was up 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones Retail index was 0.7 percent
higher. LMVH shares were 7.4 percent higher at 47.67 euros, giving
it a market capitalisation of 23.4 billion euros, while PPR,
owner of luxury group Gucci, also saw its shares rise more than
6 percent. The positive ripples reached Luxottica, whose
shares were up more than 5 percent, even though the Italian
eyewear group cut its 2008 earnings forecast. Hermes and Louis Vuitton have been shining partly thanks to
their trademark leather goods, but LVMH has been more exposed to
the poor state of the jewellery and watch markets than Hermes. Leather goods sales at Louis Vuitton likely rose between 6
percent and 7 percent during the fourth quarter, based on
analyst estimates, while at Hermes they rose 8.7 percent. Hermes said leather handbag sales jumped 14 percent during
the period. ""We have seen a slowdown since October but we are still
growing,"" Hermes Finance Director Mireille Maury told Reuters in
an interview on Friday. Most luxury groups, except for Tod's and Burberry, have
published disappointing sales figures for the fourth quarter. In January, Italian jeweller Bulgari and Switzerland's
Richemont warned of a difficult 2009 and U.S. jeweller Tiffany
issued its second profit warning in three months. Hermes beat expectations with a 1.7 percent rise in sales at
constant currencies in the fourth quarter, while LVMH said its
quarterly sales were ""about flat"", without giving details. ""Fourth-quarter figures demonstrate that the resilience of
the Louis Vuitton brand cannot be ignored when assessing LVMH
investment risk versus other luxury companies, notably the watch
players,"" HSBC said in a note. The wines and spirits unit at LVMH, which also owns Krug
champagne, Chopin vodka and Hennessy cognac, suffered
particularly in the United States and Japan. After reaching a peak in the first half of 2007 of more than
20-times current year earnings, average valuations in the
European luxury sector have fallen to 2003 levels at about
9-times to 10-times this year's expected earnings. LVMH is trading on about 11-times this year's earnings while
Hermes is still on about 30-times due to its resilient profile
and recurring takeover speculation. Since Jan. 1, LVMH stock has fallen by 2 percent, Richemont
by 11 percent, PPR by 8 percent and Hermes by 20 percent, all

  (Adds detail) LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Europe's third-largest electrical
goods retailer Kesa Electricals Plc posted a 71 percent fall in
first-half retail profit, halved its dividend and said trading
was set to remain tough, sending its shares 11 percent lower. Chief Executive Jean-Noel Labroue forecast ""a very difficult
peak trading period."" ""We do not expect consumer confidence to improve for the
rest of the financial year,"" he said. The group, which owns French market leader Darty and
Britain's second-biggest electricals retailer Comet, said it
would maintain a strict focus on cash management, stock and
capital expenditure, along with margin management and cost
control. Kesa said retail profit for the six months to Oct. 31 was
13.0 million pounds. This compares with analyst forecasts of about 13 million
pounds to 15 million pounds and 45.1 million pounds in the same
period last year. Group revenue increased 0.4 percent to 2.18 billion pounds
but was down 5.5 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips
out the impact of new space. Labroue told reporters there had been no change in sales
patterns in the third quarter compared to the second. Comet, hit by particularly weak demand for white goods such
as washing machines and refrigerators, made a first-half loss of
8.1 million pounds, while Spanish business Menaje del Hogar made
a loss of 8.7 million pounds. Many European retailers are struggling as shoppers cut back
on spending, particularly on expensive items like laptops and
TVs, amid rising unemployment and falling property values. Prior to Tuesday's update, shares in Kesa had lost 57
percent of their value over the last year, underperforming the
DJ Stoxx European retail index by 39 percent. At 0813 GMT the stock was down 11 pence at 91.5 pence,
valuing the business at 481 million pounds. Bigger rival DSG International, which trades as Currys and
PC World in Britain, UniEuro in Italy and Elkjop in Nordic
countries, last month reported a first-half loss and axed its
dividend. Kesa's interim payout was cut to 1.75 pence from 3.50 pence. Labroue said it was too early to say if the final dividend
would be cut by a similar magnitude. Labroue retires as Kesa chief executive on Jan. 5. He will
be succeeded by Thierry Falque-Pierrotin, the former CEO of PPR
Group's Redcats home shopping business.

363,"Dec 01, 2008 06:48AM ET",Stella McCartney poaches Lanvin director as CEO,nan," PARIS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Stella McCartney, one of the only
luxury fashion houses that does not use animal furs and leather,
has poached the business development director of Lanvin to lead
the British fashion brand, part of the Gucci Group. Frederick Lukoff will become president and chief executive
of Stella McCartney on Feb. 23, Gucci Group said in a statement
on Monday. Founded in 2001 by the daughter of Beatles icon Paul
McCartney, Stella McCartney has been profitable since 2007 and
is growing rapidly, opening stores in Moscow, Beijing and Hong
Kong this year. It will open a shop in Paris and Tokyo this month. Lukoff will leave Lanvin, one of France's oldest fashion
houses, where he helped sales grow to more than 140 million
euros ($181.1 million) in 2008 from 67 million euros in 2005 as
head of international operations. Lanvin, which has been in talks in recent months with
potential investors to raise funds to expand, on Monday declined
to comment on Lukoff's departure. Prior to joining Lanvin, Lukoff was managing director of
Paco Rabanne, another French fashion brand. ""Normally, we promote from inside the group but we always
look externally to assess the talent pool available,"" Gucci
Group's spokeswoman said. Led by vegetarian and animal rights advocate Stella
McCartney, the brand does not use animal skins or products.
Shoes and handbags are made from alternative materials. It also
launched an organic skin range in 2007 called CARE, developed in
collaboration with YSL Beaute. Lukoff's appointment follows a period of musical chairs at
the Gucci Group. In September, Mark Lee decided to leave as head
of the Gucci brand. At the time, the group said Lee's resignation had nothing to
do with Gucci's stagnating operating margins. The Gucci brand
accounts for 95 percent of the Gucci Group's recurring operating
profits. Bottega Veneta's head Patrizio di Marco would replace Lee at
the helm of the Gucci brand at the end of the year. Marco
Bizzarri, head of Stella McCartney, would take his place at
Bottega Veneta, leaving the British brand without a chief
executive. Shares in PPR, Gucci Group's parent have lost two thirds of
their value since Jan. 1. By 1050 GMT, they were down 2.57 percent at 36.39 euros,
pulled down by the French market whose CAC 40 blue chip index
which was 2.72 percent lower.
