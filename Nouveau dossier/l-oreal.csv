Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), the Indian parent of Jaguar Land Rover, fell by 30% after a historic multibillion-dollar write-off of investments in the U.K. – a combination of the collapse of diesel sales, weaker Chinese demand and uncertainties over Brexit.Luxury goods continue to stand out from an otherwise uninspiring earnings season: Hermes (PA:HRMS) rose 0.6% after saying sales rose over 10% in the fourth quarter amid no signs of a slowdown in China, while L’Oreal (PA:OREP) said its strong fourth-quarter was also due to higher-end products, notably skin creams.Elsewhere, German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) is recovering from another report alleging irregularities in its accounting in Asia.

Private equity companies Blackstone (N:BX), KKR (N:KKR), Carlyle, CVC, EQT and Partners Group are also expected to bid and might look for partners, according to the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private.Nestle launched a review of the unit in September, as the maker of Nescafe coffee and Perrier water ditches underperforming businesses and fends off criticism from an activist investor who wants an overhaul.The fragmented consumer health sector is attractive for deals because of aging populations in many industrialized nations, increased interest in health and rising incomes, analysts say.Information memorandums on the skin health business sale, being run by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Evercore, are expected to be sent by the end of January and first-round bids are likely to be submitted in early March, the sources said.Nestle and all the funds declined to comment.Merz Pharma, a private German company that sells wrinkle fillers and other skin treatments, has reached out to several private equity bidders to find a partner, the sources said.The move by Merz shows the strength of private equity in the auction, given they want the whole Nestle unit. Industry rivals are only expected to bid for parts of the business.Nestle Skin Health, which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs last year, accounting for about 3 percent of Nestle's total.The sources said industry players which might take part in the auction included  Beiersdorf  (DE:BEIG), Allergan (N:AGN), Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (N:JNJ), L'Oreal (PA:OREP),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR).They all declined to comment as well. Sources previously estimated the unit could fetch 6 billion to 8 billion francs.On Monday, one source put the range at 7.5 billion to 8.5 billion francs, based on 2018 operating earnings of 500 million to 550 million francs. Another source said the price tag could reach more than 9 billion francs if the unit was broken up. Nestle, the world's largest packaged food maker, created the Skin Health unit in 2014 when it bought out L'Oreal's stake in their Galderma joint venture.Under CEO Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle's push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business. But the unit has performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.($1 = 0.9972 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"Nov 07, 2018 06:10PM ET",Garnier goes organic in L'Oreal bid to lift mass market sales,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is rolling out organic skincare treatments at its Garnier brand as it looks to lift sales in its sluggish mass market unit, tapping a growing demand for more naturally-sourced products that is upending industries from cosmetics to food. The French beauty firm has been investing like peers in bio-friendly ointments to make headway in a fast-growing niche still dominated by small, specialized companies that got a headstart on larger rivals. But the launch is also part of efforts to revitalize the group's consumer products division, where growth is slow compared to its thriving luxury brands such as Lancome. Momentum has faltered in the division even as its Maybelline make-up and L'Oreal Paris labels do well in markets like China. Its third pillar, Garnier, however, is struggling from a lack of new ranges and its exposure to a tough Brazilian market. The organic range, which includes anti-ageing creams made from a lavender derivative and lemongrass face cleaners, are due to hit shelves in France and Western Europe as of early 2019, L'Oreal said. It did not comment on whether they would be exported further. L'Oreal, which also launched an entirely new organic cosmetics range, La Provencale, for the French mass market in October, said it aimed to bring the products to a wide audience, with prices for the Garnier ranges capped at 10 euros ($11.47). ""We saw that there was a gap between what was on offer and very strong demand among consumers for natural, organic products,"" said Celine Brucker, head of L'Oreal's consumer products division for France. Though still small - organic products made up under two percent of the French cosmetics market in the year to end-September, according to consultancy IRI - it's one of the fastest growing segments. Global sales rose 35.4 percent over that period, compared to a 1.4 percent fall in the broader beauty and hygiene market that also comprises products like sanitary towels, IRI said. Consumers growing increasingly wary of chemicals in their beauty treatments also have more tools at their disposals to research brands, including mobile phone apps that scan products and list toxic ingredients. L'Oreal bought vegan beauty manufacturer Logocos Naturkosmetik in August as part of its push, and this year launched its first entirely-plant based hair dye for use by salon professionals.At one point L'Oreal owned Britain's The Body Shop, one of the pioneers of ethical and natural cosmetics, but the business struggled as competition in the segment rose and it was sold off last year to Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos.The company's mass market division posted 2.3 percent sales growth in the third quarter, unchanged from three months earlier. CEO Jean-Paul Agon said the performance was ""still under what we wanted to achieve"", but added he saw signs of improvement in the months ahead. ($1 = 0.8719 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 1.5 percent by 0945 GMT, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) 1.3 percent higher.Despite gains, the STOXX 600 was on track for its worst month since January 2016 after global equity markets reeled from sudden sell-offs and a pick-up in volatility this month. The euro zone stocks index (STOXXE) remained on course for its worst month since August 2015.Analysts and investors said month-end repositioning was part of the reason for the strong bounce on Wednesday. ""Ultimately I'm still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. ""I still think there is an element of complacency, or at least a lack of sense of any real panic - particularly in retail investor sentiment,"" he added.L’Oreal (PA:OREP) shares jumped 5.9 percent after sales growth at the company, whose brands include Maybelline, picked up pace in the third quarter, driven by booming demand in Asia.This bucked the trend of results so far warning of slower Chinese growth.""Management hosted a confident conference call reiterating confidence in the goal of achieving organic sales growth ahead of global market growth in 2018,"" wrote Liberum analysts.Shares in French pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 5.2 percent after it confirmed its return to growth with higher-than-expected third-quarter profits and raised its 2018 profit target for the second time this year.Banks Santander (MC:SAN) and Standard Chartered (L:STAN) rose 3.8 and 5.7 percent respectively after both lenders reported better results, helping boost sentiment in the battered banks sector.

Finnish tire maker Nokian (HE:NRE1V) sank 13.3 percent after it cut its profit outlook, blaming unfavorable currency moves, high inventory levels in Russia, and lower new car sales in the Nordics for a surprise fall in quarterly earnings.Nokian was the latest in the autos sector to report weaker profits due to slowing car sales.Eutelsat (PA:ETL) shares dived 10.6 percent after the satellite firm cut its revenue guidance.Drugmaker  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  (ST:SOBIV) dropped 13.6 percent after it cut its full-year outlook due to development costs, even though it lifted its sales forecast after a strong performance by haemophilia drug Elocta.M&A also drove some big moves. Shares in British gambling firm  William Hill  (L:WMH) jumped 8.3 percent after it offered to buy Swedish gaming company Mr Green (ST:MRG) for 2.82 billion crowns ($307 million).Shares in the acquisition target surged 47 percent in early deals after the offer, a near 49 percent premium to Mr Green's last closing price.Investors were licking their wounds after a testing October for global stock markets which saw U.S. stocks sell off sharply, joining in the already bearish trend of other developed markets.

Dow Set for Triple-Digit Gains in Final Day of Grim OctoberU.S. stock index futures pointed to a positive conclusion to what has been a brutal October for shares, with the Dow set for triple-digit gains, ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data.At 5:35AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 125 points, or about 0.5%, the S&P 500 futures rose 16 points, or around 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 71 points, or roughly 1%.U.S. stocks closed higher in the previous session, as markets pared some of the month's losses before the end of a brutal October for equity markets.After Tuesday's comeback, the Dow is down 5.9% this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&P 500 is off by 7.9% in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. The Nasdaq has shed 11% and is on pace for its worst monthly performance since September 2008.Elsewhere, in Europe, the region's major bourses staged a strong rally, as strong results from L’Oreal (PA:OREP), Sanofi (PA:SASY), and banks  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and Santander (MC:SAN) eased investors' nerves.Earlier, Asian stocks clawed up from 20-month lows, as a tumultuous October drew to a close.The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.3% as weaker-than-expected factory activity data reinforced views that Beijing will roll out more support measures for the economy.In Japan, the Nikkei advanced 2%, reassured by the Bank of Japan's signal that it will keep its ultra-easy policy for some time to come.2. GM Highlights Another Busy Day of EarningsIn earnings, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Sprint (NYSE:S), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC), and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) are among the major companies due to publish their latest quarterly figures before the opening bell.AIG (NYSE:AIG), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) and  Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure  (NYSE:SOI) are among the major companies set to report earnings results after Wednesday's market close.3. Facebook Results Calm NervesFacebook relieved investors by forecasting that margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease up, sending shares higher in pre-market trade despite a second-straight quarter with record-low user growth.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg repeated the company's warning that growing user interest in private messaging, video and safer content would cause costs to rise faster than revenue for “some time.”Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) traded up about 4% ahead of the opening bell. They reversed course several times in volatile after-hours trade on Tuesday after the social media giant released a mixed third-quarter earnings report.The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share, beating estimates for $1.47 per share. Facebook missed expectations on revenue, however, reporting $13.73 billion compared to the $13.78 billion estimated by analysts.4. ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Payrolls DataOn the data front, the market’s attention will shift to the U.S. labor market with the ADP’s report on private payroll growth, which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government nonfarm payrolls report.Economists expect the ADP report, due at 8:15AM ET, to show that private payroll growth totaled 189,000 during October.Elsewhere on the economic calendar on Wednesday, investors are likely to keep an eye out for third-quarter employment cost index data at 8:30AM ET, as well as Chicago PMI data for October at 9:45AM ET.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was at 96.75, having hit an overnight peak of 96.85, the most since August 15.5. EIA's Weekly Oil Supply ReportIn commodity markets, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended October 26 at 10:30AM ET.Analysts expect the EIA to report a climb of around 4.1 million barrels in crude supplies. If confirmed, it would be the sixth straight weekly climb in domestic oil inventories.After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude supplies rose by 5.7 million barrels last week.Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days, drawing support from upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are due to come into force from next week.U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures were up 52 cents, or 0.8%, at $66.70 a barrel. They dropped 1.3% the day before, after hitting their lowest since Aug. 17 at $65.33 a barrel.International Brent crude oil futures tacked on 74 cents, or 0.9%, to $76.69 per barrel.

In July, it opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Berlin, selling beauty products.From Tuesday, it is adding 1,500 men's skin, body, beard and hair grooming products from 25 brands including House 99 from former soccer star David Beckham and Clarisonic from L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Zalando said it would also extend the full beauty range to Austria and Poland before Christmas.Last month, Zalando cut its 2018 outlook for a second time in as many months, saying a long, hot summer had taken its toll, wiping as much as 20 percent off the value of its shares.The retailer is facing increased competition in the online fashion market from the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN), ASOS (L:ASOS) and traditional retailers like H&M (ST:HMb), which have also been expanding in cosmetics. Zalando sees big potential for cosmetics as only 5 percent of beauty sales are currently online compared to about 15 percent for fashion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Sep 20, 2018 05:20AM ET","Nestle puts skin health unit up for sale to focus on food, nutrition",nan,"By John Revill and Martinne GellerZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) put its skin health unit up for sale on Thursday, as the maker of Nescafe and Perrier water ditches underperforming businesses and seeks to fend off criticism from an activist investor demanding an overhaul.The Switzerland-based company is under pressure from Third Point, a hedge fund run by investor Daniel Loeb, who has demanded bolder moves to lift performance.Nestle said it was exploring strategic options for the unit, saying ""the future growth opportunities of Nestle Skin Health lie increasingly outside the group's strategic scope"" and its focus on food, drinks and nutritional health.This week, Nestle agreed to sell its Gerber Life Insurance business for $1.55 billion, while sources told Reuters it was also bidding for GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) Horlicks drink.The skin health unit, which makes Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care brands, as well as Restylane wrinkle fillers, had sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($2.8 billion) last year, accounting for about 3 percent of the Nestle's total.Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said he estimated the business was worth 6 billion to 6.5 billion Swiss francs, excluding financial debt, provisions and deferred taxes. He said it could fetch between 6 billion and 8 billion francs in a sale. Another analyst put the sale value at about 7 billion francs.Jefferies analysts said Nestle's announcement was ""a significant and positive development, both in its own right and as a symbol of willingness to slay sacred cows in pursuit of shareholder value.""They said a sale to L'Oreal or a leveraged buyout were the main exit options.Nestle's skin health business sells dozens of different products via prescription, over the counter and as corrective and aesthetic products which are used by doctors.""Sharpening our strategic focus on Nestle's core food, beverage and nutritional health products offers the best opportunity for long-term profitable growth and is fully in line with the pursuit of our company's purpose,"" Nestle Chairman Paul Bulcke said.Nestle created the business in 2014 when it acquired L'Oreal's (PA:OREP) stake in their Galderma joint venture.Skin treatments had been a major part of a push into higher growth and more profitable health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food businesses. But the division has struggled against generic competition and seen lean sales.Nestle cut 450 jobs at a research and development centre in southern France last year and shut a Swiss factory in August.Nestle has been conducting a review of its skin business that is due for completion by mid-2019. It has said it remains committed to its health science unit, which sells medical nutritional products. It bought a vitamin business this year. Nestle shares were roughly flat at 0730 GMT.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

28,"Aug 19, 2018 07:10PM ET","Global luxury brands again chase China's young, rich and spendthrift",nan,"By Farah Master and Donny KwokHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada (HK:1913) to LVMH (PA:LVMH) are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows.Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster.The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said.""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said on a call with analysts.""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands.""Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewelry and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say.Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialization and urbanization. ""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. TRADE WAR JITTERSChinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. Brands including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy.The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said.Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC) has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. ""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here.""SMALLER CITY PUSHTo capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth.Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's.LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewelry brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September.Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates.""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus,  Kering  group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs.""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said.Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers.Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year.Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country.Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Cosmetics firms including L'Oreal rival  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) and retailers like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Sephora are investing heavily in technology, in an age of selfies and beauty bloggers that has helped shift the industry onto the web. France's L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics group, bought Canadian augmented reality and artificial intelligence specialist ModiFace in March. It said on Thursday that the Toronto-based company had now teamed up with Facebook to develop augmented reality experiences on the platform for L'Oreal brands, starting with NYX and including Urban Decay, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent. Customers will eventually be able to try on anything from foundation shades to eyebrow shapes and hues, said L'Oreal's chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet, adding that the virtual tests helped the company clinch sales.""What we've seen on our sites is that when there is a virtual test facility, conversion rates increase significantly,"" said Rochet. Social media networks had become the biggest growth driver of web sales for L'Oreal in terms of attracting shopping traffic, though purchases are redirected to take place on brands' own sites or third party online retailers, Rochet added.The French company said e-commerce revenues reached 9.5 percent of all its sales in the first half of 2018, up from close to 5 percent three years ago. The virtual testing technology should eventually be rolled out on Facebook's photo-sharing networking site Instagram, Rochet said. In China, where Facebook is blocked, Rochet said L'Oreal was also talking to other partners about similar deals, without naming them. Luxury goods groups in China do a lot of business through Tencent (HK:0700)'s messaging and networking site WeChat. Facebook said it had begun testing augmented reality in advertising as of July, with Sephora and brands like fashion group Michael Kors (N:KORS).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

33,"Jul 09, 2018 02:20AM ET",The Foxconns of fast beauty propel South Korean cosmetics' success in China,nan,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo JinSEOUL (Reuters) - At a factory two hours south of Seoul, women clad in plastic caps and masks put peach-colored eye-shadow into cases, right next to a machine churning out a skin-color face powder.The difference between the two lines: the first is supplying one of France’s best-known premium cosmetic brands, while the second is serving a South Korean budget firm.The plant is operated by Cosmecca Korea (KQ:241710), the country's third-biggest contract cosmetics maker, which produces a range of products for more than 300 customers, all the way from high-end brands like  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) to nimble domestic firms such as Clio and Dr.Jart.It is factories like this that have made South Korea the epicenter of fast beauty, a world in which the time it takes to get a product idea onto store shelves has dropped dramatically, often by years. This is vital as fickle millennial consumers can easily leave last year's hits as this year's busts.Their dominance of the world of contract manufacturing for cosmetics may have become as important to the industry as Apple (O:AAPL) iPhone manufacturer Foxconn (TW:2354) has been for electronics.Some of the major Korean brands they work for have been acquired by global cosmetics companies such as L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), and according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, the manufacturers themselves have received investment offers, some from foreign cosmetics firms.South Korea's three largest contract manufacturers - Cosmax (KS:192820),  Korea Kolmar  (KS:161890) and Cosmecca - have all been approached by foreign investors about buying a minority stake in recent years, three people with direct knowledge of the situations told Reuters. The sources asked for anonymity and declined to elaborate further citing confidentiality of the approaches. One of the sources said one of the manufacturers had rejected a 2016 offer from an overseas cosmetics company for a minority stake, partly due to concerns that such an alliance could upset its broader customer base.Representatives for the companies declined to comment. DEMAND FROM CHINESE BRANDSThough largely staying in the background with little public recognition themselves, contract manufacturers stand to benefit as Korean brands they work for rapidly grow in China's $53.5billion cosmetics market. That's thanks to their value for money image, fast turnaround times for new products, and smart online marketing. China's own fast-growing cosmetics brands, albeit still small, are also driving the revenue growth of South Korean manufacturers, although margins on these contracts can be low, company officials say.The stock market performance of the three has been mixed, though they have all outperformed the main benchmark in South Korea. Shares of global No.1 Cosmax (KS:192820), has gained 34percent year to date, far outpacing a 8 percent drop in the wider South Korean market (KS11). Cosmecca shares rose 8 percent and second-ranked Korea Kolmar (KS:161890) fell 3 percent in the same period. All three have, though, outperformed the 21 percent decline in shares of Amorepacific Group (KS:002790), South Korea's largest cosmetics powerhouse. Amorepacific, which uses both in-house and contract manufacturing, reported revenue fell 10 percent and operating profit slumped by nearly 30 percent in the first three months of2018. Its brands include the top-end Sulwhasoo, mass market Innisfree, and young makeup offering Etude House.Even as all the top three contract firms, which are also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), posted revenue growth in the same period.""The surge of smaller players gives tough times to beauty giants like Amorepacific. By contrast, this is a favorable environment for OEMs,"" said Park Jong-dae, an analyst at HanaInvestment & Securities. ""While brand companies have up and downs, OEMs garner stable earnings. They are most suited to the industry's structural changes - Asian growth and diversified distribution channels."" STRUGGLING TO CATCH-UP In particular, they are central to the success in the high-growth China market of small Korean brands with new ideas but no production or research capabilities, industry executives and experts say. When French luxury giant LVMH's (PA:LVMH) private equity arm was conducting due diligence on Clio before buying a stake in2016, among its key questions was: ""How do you come up with new products at such a fast speed?,"" said Lim Mira, a manager atClio's strategic planning team. Contract manufacturers such as Cosmax deliver on orders much more quickly, in as fast as three months compared to about a year overseas contract manufacturers require, Lim said. The firm used to source products from an Italian contract manufacturer in the past, but has now shifted to Korean manufacturers, she said. ""Many global players are struggling to catch up as the life cycle of any success has shortened, pushing them to come up with new innovations at a much faster speed,"" said Laura Chu, a China-based account director at researcher Kantar International. In China, Unilever's share declined from 3.2 percent in 2014to 2.8 percent in 2017, while L'Oreal's share fell from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent during the same period, according to research firm Euromonitor. Seeking to turn the tables, both Unilever and L'Oreal, as well as other European and American majors, have paid big premiums in the last two years to scoop up South Korean brands thriving in China. Unilever announced a 2.27 billion euro ($2.67 billion) deal for Carver Korea in September - maker of the A.H.C. cosmetics brand, whose China sales rose more than 30 percent in 2017,according to Kantar International. ""Geographically it will enable us to strength our position in two of the top five largest skin care markets - China and Korea,"" Lizzy Chen, a U.K.-based executive at Unilever, told Reuters. South Korea-based Nanda, which was acquired by L'Oreal for an undisclosed sum in May, saw sales of its flagship cosmetics brand 3CE double in China last year. The strong performance was particularly notable given that last year a major spat between Seoul and Beijing over South Korea’s installation of a new U.S. missile defense system led to an unofficial boycott of South Korean brands in China. South Korean contract manufacturers have been expanding China production to meet surging demand.Cosmecca's chairman Cho Im-rae said that in recent years it has been running its factories in China at full throttle. It is planning to open a third factory there. ""China's cosmetics demand is growing enormously,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

34,"Jul 06, 2018 04:42AM ET",Cultural mix a hidden weapon in Nestle CEO's activist defense,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Growing up in Germany, Mark Schneider was pushed to become fluent in English by his father, who believed it would give him an edge.Now as Nestle's (S:NESN) relatively new chief executive, the 52-year-old's abilities are being put to the test by an activist U.S. investor pressing him to act faster and more forcefully to raise the Swiss company's profit.Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's Third Point is urging steps it says can boost margins and double earnings per share at the world's biggest food company by 2022. Years spent in the United States landed Schneider dual German-U.S. citizenship and a Harvard MBA. Combined with a PhD from the Swiss university of St. Gallen and 13 years as CEO of a German firm, he has the experience to balance the measured European shareholder approach and American-style activism, analysts say.""Schneider can hopefully bring both of those things to his role,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said, adding that if he fails to deliver on his strategy, the maker of Gerber baby food and Nescafe could face calls for a break-up.Third Point sent a letter to the board and published a 34-page presentation on recommendations for Nestle this week but has not given a deadline for the changes, which include selling its L'Oreal (PA:OREP) stake and reorganizing into three business units.Sources familiar with the matter say the fund had several interactions with Nestle in the past year since becoming a top 10 shareholder. The next meeting, set for autumn, had already been scheduled prior to this week's action, one source said.As the first outsider to become Nestle CEO in almost a century, Schneider has impressed investors with his candid assessment of the company's problems and lightened the mood at its Lake Geneva headquarters, often seen wearing open-necked shirts and eating in the staff cafeteria.MARGIN IN FOCUS Schneider's track record is strong. At the helm of German healthcare company Fresenius (DE:FREG), he oversaw merger and acquisition (M&A) deals that brought a twelvefold increase in net income.But industry-wide troubles like changing consumer habits, economic uncertainty and upstart rivals have taken their toll on Nestle, and analysts say its spotty M&A record, sprawling structure and occasional arrogance have not helped. Some people think the external pressure from Third Point, which owns about 1 percent of Nestle's shares, may actually help Schneider as he tries to shake up the Swiss company's corporate culture, as well as improve sales and earnings growth.""Every investor in Nestle wants them to get the margins up a bit faster,"" said Ali Miremadi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management, which owns nearly $73 million of Nestle shares, Reuters data shows.""That's also what the chief executive and the board want."" Schneider has begun with frequent, incremental changes, while avoiding a big bang such as selling Nestle's 23 percent stake in L'Oreal, which Third Point and others advocate.In 18 months, he has made nine acquisitions and 11 divestitures, mostly very small, and has restructured parts of the business in a bid to boost profits. However, he is wary of inflicting the harsh cost cuts seen among some U.S. food groups in a trend that spread to Europe alongside Kraft-Heinz's (O:KHC) failed bid for  Unilever  (L:ULVR) last year. Kraft did not succeed partly because the preoccupation with profit it inherited from shareholder 3G Capital was seen as clashing with the Anglo-Dutch firm's stakeholder approach.Jefferies analysts described a similar kind of ""culture war"" between Nestle and Third Point and predicted that Nestle would change, but at its own pace.CHANGING THE GUARD Although hiring Schneider was a break with tradition for Nestle, which historically promoted CEOs from within, Third Point has identified the continuing influence of its Chairman Paul Bulcke as a potential problem.Former CEO Bulcke ""presided over a long period of underperformance, seems too comfortable with the status quo and may be holding up the pace and magnitude of change,"" Third Point said in its presentation. Nestle, which declined to comment, this week issued a statement defending its performance.And longtime shareholder Thomas Russo, of Gardner Russo & Gardner thinks the old guard understands exactly how much things have changed and wants a strategy to match. ""That's why they brought in Mark ... they didn't bring him in because they thought it would be fun to break with the culture of internal appointments,"" Russo told Reuters.Schneider is one of a few relatively new executives at Nestle, whose CFO Francois-Xavier Roger, a Frenchman, joined from Takeda Pharmaceutical in 2015, replacing Wan Ling Martello, an American, now head of Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, who joined in 2011.New independent directors, including Kasper Rorsted, who joined Adidas (DE:ADSGn) as CEO from German packaged goods maker Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), are also likely to bring a fresh eye. Rorsted, also with feet on both sides of the Atlantic as a Danish national and Harvard Business alumnus, had success turning around Adidas and Henkel in the United States.""The new blood has started to overpower the old guard,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said.For investor Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co, Schneider would not have moved to Nestle if he feared being hamstrung by tradition. ""(He) will not be hindered in his implementation of his strategic vision,"" Rossbach said. ""The reality is that a lot of these initiatives are long-term by nature ... The question is if Third Point can wait that long.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

36,"Jul 02, 2018 09:36AM ET",New salvo from activist investor turns up heat on Nestle,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) faces greater pressure to speed up change after activist investor Third Point stepped up its criticism of the world's largest food company.The New York-based hedge fund sent a letter to Nestle's board and published a presentation online on Sunday calling for more urgent action and recommending steps it says could result in Nestle doubling its earnings per share by 2022.The letter and presentation, published on a new Third Point website, come a year after the firm, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, took a roughly $3 billion stake in the maker of KitKat bars and Perrier water.Nestle responded on Monday afternoon, saying it was implementing an ""accelerated long-term value creation strategy"" and was delivering results.The Swiss company also declined to comment on a newspaper report that it was in talks to buy control of pet food maker Champion Petfoods for $2 billion.The back-and-forth had little immediate impact on Nestle shares, which were up 0.2 percent at 1250 GMT, outperforming the broader European stock market, which was down 0.7 percent. Analysts said they shared many of Loeb's concerns about Nestle and agreed with some of his prescriptions.His ideas include Nestle selling its 23 percent stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and using the proceeds for M&A or share buybacks; reorganizing into three internal units; and divesting businesses that make up to 15 percent of sales. They questioned, however, whether the New York investor's confrontational style would win points with one of Europe's biggest companies, with a reputation for conservatism.""While we think that in aggregate Third Point's proposals make sense, and are probably helpful from a share price perspective, we're not convinced that much is going to change as a result,"" said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, citing what they called ""practical obstacles"". They cited the fact Nestle has a relatively new CEO, Mark Schneider, and his need to keep its workforce motivated; Third Point's modest stake of only 1.3 percent; and Nestle's long-term approach to business.VALUE INVESTORSThomson Reuters data show that just over 11 percent of Nestle shares are owned by ""value"" investors, who typically target companies they perceive to be unfairly undervalued by the broader market. They often work behind closed doors with a readiness to hold their positions for a long time.Third Point said Nestle should be able to reach a 20 percent profit margin by 2022, up from 16.5 percent in 2017.Nestle announced a margin target last year of 17.5 to 18.5 percent by 2020 after Loeb's first letter.Loeb said Nestle should be able to double its earnings to 7 Swiss francs per share by 2022, up from 3.55 francs in 2017. ""We share much of the analysis but question whether the confrontational style is likely to secure the change that Third Point is seeking,"" wrote Jefferies analysts in a note. They pointed out that since Schneider took the corner office 18 months ago, after joining from German healthcare company Fresenius (DE:FMEG), Nestle has taken steps which are radical for the company.Besides recruiting its first external CEO in nearly a century, Nestle set its first margin target; set a goal to buy and divest brands accounting for as much as 10 percent of sales; signaled possible flexibility on the L'Oreal stake by not renewing a shareholders agreement; and brought on new board members with relevant external expertise.Loeb argues Nestle should divest as much as 15 percent of sales either through sales, spin-offs or other methods to help align its business with higher-growth categories.Nestle has recently sold its struggling U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero and agreed to take control of selling Starbucks (O:SBUX) packaged coffees around the world.It has also invested in small, faster-growing brands including Freshly, Sweet Earth, Blue Bottle Coffee and Chameleon Cold-Brew. Still, the company's shares are down 6 percent from the day before Loeb revealed his stake in June 2017, as food companies continue to struggle against increased competition from start-up brands seen as healthier or more authentic.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Jun 22, 2018 06:00AM ET",Casino and L'Oreal team up to launch new beauty stores,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket chain  Casino  (PA:CASP) and cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) are launching new beauty stores in Paris this weekend, the latest effort by brick and mortar retailers to retain customers in the face of online competition.The two companies said on Friday that the new stores -- dubbed ""le drugstore parisien"" -- will offer beauty products and healthcare goods, as well as over-the-counter medicines.For Casino, the tie-up with L'Oreal marks its latest move away from grocery stores, as France's traditional retailers seek new ways to appeal to shoppers.The first two outlets will open this weekend in the chic 9th and 6th districts of Paris, attracting shoppers with hairdresser and drycleaning services, shoe-shining machines and mobile phone charging points.For L'Oreal, the stores will give its products greater exposure. Unlike large pharmacy chains such as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Duane Reade in the United States or Boots in Britain, French pharmacies stock only medicines and a limited range of personal products and often have restricted opening hours.The ""drugstore"" outlets' longer opening hours are aimed at reflecting changing, modern lifestyles. A spokeswoman for Casino said a third ""drugstore"" could open in Paris if the first two did well, and that Casino and L'Oreal might expand the concept abroad.

L'Oreal, which at one point in mid-2015 was in takeover discussions with Olaplex, later launched a competing product, Smartbond, which the U.S. start-up claims dented its sales. The French beauty group denies accusations it had access to confidential information during the acquisition talks, and says no formal due diligence that would have given it greater access ever took place.The UK High Court dismissed 10 out of 11 claims in the case filed by Olaplex, according to its ruling on Monday, but upheld one claim related to the ingredients in Olaplex's formula, marking a setback for L'Oreal.Judges will later decide whether to grant an injunction against further sales of L'Oreal's Smartbond products, Olaplex said.L'Oreal said it strongly disagreed with the court decision, adding: ""We will be applying for permission to appeal.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"Jun 06, 2018 12:40PM ET",European stocks close flat after a choppy session,nan,"By Kit Rees and Julien PonthusLONDON (Reuters) - European stocks closed flat on Wednesday at the end of a choppy session during which hawkish comments by the European Central Bank lifted the euro and bond yields. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index ended the day unchanged with bourses closing in different directions across the continent. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.3 percent, Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) was down 0.1 percent and London's FTSE (FTSE) up 0.3 percent. The ECB's chief economist said robust growth was making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying program.That prospect pushed bond yields across the euro zone higher, making stocks chosen for their generous dividends less attractive in comparison. The rise of the euro to a 10-day high also weighed on European companies which have large revenues in dollars.Consumer groups L'Oreal (PA:OREP), Unilever (AS:UNc) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) were the worst performers among blue chips, losing between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. Banking stocks (SX7P), which typically benefit from higher interest rates, rose 0.7 percent with Italian lenders recovering further from political instability in the country. Commodities stocks (SXPP) rose close to 2 percent due to strong copper prices while the recent rally in tech stocks (SX8P) continued its course, adding 0.2 percent. Among individual stocks, RPC (L:RPC) was the biggest faller, tumbling about 12 percent after the plastic packaging leader said it was looking to sell assets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Apr 27, 2018 08:04AM ET","From Disney to Dior, Norway wealth fund challenges CEO pay",nan,"By Gwladys FoucheOSLO (Reuters) - Executive pay is firmly in the crosshairs of Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund as it puts its votes to work at some of the more than 9,000 companies it is invested in.The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, built on Norway's oil revenues, has become a more active shareholder in recent years and since 2017 has called for changes including the scrapping of long-term incentive plans and simpler and more transparent packages.So far in this year's annual general meeting season, data shows the fund voted against a stock option plan for Tesla (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder.. It has also voted against the pay of  Disney  (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) CEO Sydney Toledano,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) CEO Carlos Tavares,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.The fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.""It is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,"" Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.""If you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.""The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The  Weir Group  (L:WEIR), which the fund praised this month for being willing to ""challenge conventional thinking on remuneration"" by being simple and transparent.""The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,"" said Slyngstad. ""We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching."" The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's  Alfa Laval  (ST:ALFA) and Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa).NEGATIVE RETURNThe fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund's equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.""Any changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,"" Slyngstad told reporters. Some 66.2 percent of the fund's assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate. The fund's return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.The most negative contributions were Nestle (S:NESN), Facebook (O:FB) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed. Investments in Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Netflix (O:NFLX) made the most positive contribution.The Norwegian government withdrew 11 billion crowns during the first quarter to pay for public expenses, compared with 61 billion crowns for the whole of 2017.

47,"Mar 23, 2018 07:47AM ET",GSK pulls out of $20 billion race for Pfizer consumer assets,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Ludwig BurgerLONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) has quit the race to buy Pfizer's (N:PFE) consumer healthcare business, endangering an auction the U.S. drugmaker hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion.It was not immediately clear whether there were other offers for the business, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, following this week's deadline for binding bids.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which announced its withdrawal on Friday, was seen as the frontrunner to buy the assets after  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) left the race late on Wednesday. Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) stepped away from the auction in January.A source familiar with the matter said GSK declined to make a final bid for the assets in the end. ""While we will continue to review opportunities that may accelerate our strategy, they must meet our criteria for returns and not compromise our priorities for capital allocation,"" GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in a statement.GSK shares rose nearly 4 percent, as investors' concerns about a potential dividend cut eased.  Pfizer  said on Friday it continued to evaluate potential alternatives for the business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, as well as retaining it.""We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,"" a spokesman said. Sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday it was possible there were other bids. On Friday, a source said that if not, Pfizer could try to tap private equity funds. Pfizer is the world's fifth-largest player in consumer health with 2.5 percent of a market bolstered by aging populations and growing interest in health and wellness. The business, which also includes Chapstick lip balm and Caltrate supplements, is seen as attractive but has come to market at a bad time. GSK and Reckitt are under shareholder pressure to exercise financial discipline, while other potential suitors, such as Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) are busy with other projects.What is more, the global consumer health market has slowed, from 4-6 percent like-for-like sales growth to 0-3 percent growth,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in December. Major players in the over-the-counter market have been grappling with pricing pressure stoked by online players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and private label competitors. Pfizer's hope of fetching around $20 billion translated to a multiple of about 20 times the unit's core earnings, according to Bernstein analysts, in line with past deals in the sector during faster growing times. Differences in price expectations also hobbled German drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) attempts to sell its consumer products unit, where a price tag of up to 4 billion euros ($5 billion) deterred initial suitors such as Nestle (S:NESN), Perrigo (N:PRGO) and a private-equity consortium. Reckitt's early interest in the Merck assets also waned as the Pfizer auction gained momentum.SPLIT OPINION Buying the Pfizer business would have been the boldest move to date for Walmsley, who took over at GSK last April. But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.Acquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.That is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal (PA:OREP) - since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.Last month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelt out that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.The overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields. GSK runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with  Novartis  (S:NOVN), which complicates any acquisitions.

49,"Mar 04, 2018 01:15PM ET","As its wealth fund goes green, Norway's firms struggle to keep up",nan,"By Alister Doyle Environment CorrespondentOSLO (Reuters) - Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation's $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018.The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project.In Norway, just two firms - DNB (OL:DNB) bank and property firm Entra (OL:ENTRA) - were on a CDP list of 160 ""A"" rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show.Norway's state-controlled oil group  Statoil  (OL:STL) got an ""F"" grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey. On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong ""A-"".""It's not our responsibility"" to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank.CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L'Oreal (PA:OREP), Walmart (N:WMT) and Toyota (T:6201) rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains.""If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,"" said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP.Norway's fund, built from the nation's oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonized data to compare risks.Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide. Yngve Slyngstad, the fund's CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to ""strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP"". Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said.SEA WATERStatoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm's operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States.""Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,"" he said. Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway's deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry ""welcomes efforts to standardize climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles.""The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund.Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said ""obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally"".He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the center-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting.Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group  Telenor  (OL:TEL) got an ""A-"" for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminum producer Hydro (OL:NHY) and fertilizer-maker Yara International (OL:YAR), in which the state owns just over a third, got ""C""s.Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities.""When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,"" it said in an e-mail.Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013.""We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,"" she said.Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Nestle (S:NESN) - both got ""A"" grades from CDP for climate change reporting.On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Neste Oy (HE:NESTE).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The French government adopted a decree in 2014 under which any foreign takeover of French groups operating in sectors considered as strategic can be blocked. These currently include energy, water, transport, telecoms and health.""We must strengthen the tools to protect French interests, that's what China and the United States have been doing for a long time,"" Philippe said at an event in a plant belonging to cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) in northern France. New measures will be added to draft legislation to be presented on April 18, the prime minister said. Stake acquisitions by foreign entities in strategic firms generally receive a green light from authorities in exchange for binding commitments, he said. The government also plans to create a legal framework to pave the way for a so-called ""golden share"" rule that would preserve state control over companies in which it has a minority stake. Philippe confirmed state investment bank Bpifrance and the country's State Shareholding Agency APE were working on a financial envelope to fend off foreign takeovers of French groups.Bpifrance's head said last week this envelope should amount to 3 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

53,"Feb 10, 2018 09:20AM ET","Mayhoola, Fosun vie for control of French fashion label Lanvin: sources",nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Qatari investment fund Mayhoola, which owns Italian fashion house Valentino, and Chinese conglomerate Fosun, the company behind French tourism group Club Med, are vying to acquire a majority stake in struggling French fashion house Lanvin, two sources familiar with the talks said. The storied Parisian label, France's oldest surviving couture house, is controlled by Taiwan-based businesswoman Shaw-Lan Wang, and had enjoyed a revival in recent years under star designer Alber Elbaz. But his surprise sacking in 2015 was followed by a slump in sales, which left Lanvin facing a cash crunch at the end of 2017.  Mayhoola, which also bought French luxury fashion firm Balmain in 2016, is one of two serious suitors now looking to take over Lanvin and in talks with the firm, the sources said. The other is Fosun (HK:0656), and a team from the Chinese group was due to visit Lanvin's couture ateliers in Paris on Saturday, one of the sources said.Lanvin, Mayhoola and Fosun could not be reached for comment.  Lanvin said in early November that Wang would put more money into the business by the end of 2017, but the cash injection never materialized. Managing Director Nicolas Druz said in December that ""sustained financial and industrial solutions that do not involve a capital increase will be found by end of March"". It was not immediately clear how much the sale of a controlling stake could fetch. In 2014, Wang rejected a Mayhoola bid for Lanvin of around 400 million euros.The privately owned firm does not publish earnings. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. Losses had been forecast to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017 as sales continued to fall, they said. Lanvin has twice changed artistic director since Elbaz's departure. Founded in 1889 and named after French ""couturiere"" Jeanne Lanvin, the luxury label has long been synonymous with Parisian chic. Chinese-born Wang, a media magnate based in Taiwan, acquired a holding in Lanvin from L'Oreal (PA:OREP) in 2001 and bought out other investors in 2003, reaching 75 percent control of the firm. The rest is owned by Swiss businessman Ralph Bartel.    /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was still hovering near a recent four-year peak on Friday.Markets were also hit after a midnight deadline to pass a U.S. budget deal was missed on Thursday due to a prolonged speech by Senator Rand Paul, who objected to $300 billion in deficit spending in the bill saying that it would “loot the Treasury.”U.S. congressional leaders had reached a two-year budget deal on Wednesday to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) declined 0.40% and 1.07%, while Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) retreated 0.59% and 1.51%.Among peripheral lenders,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) slid 0.75% and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) advanced 0.48% in Italy, while Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) tumbled 1.05% and 1.29% respectively.Elsewhere, L’Oreal SA (PA:OREP) saw shares rally 1.75% after the cosmetics giant reported a 5.5% increase in fourth-quarter sales, beating market estimates.

57,"Feb 08, 2018 08:47AM ET","Reckitt, GSK balance risk-reward in high-stakes Pfizer fight",nan,"By Martinne Geller and Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - The leaders of GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) -- two of Britain's best-known but underperforming companies -- are in a high-stakes battle for a dose of Advil to ease their pain.The drugmaker and consumer goods group, both under investor pressure to improve operations, face a tricky risk-reward balance in a potential $20 billion auction for Pfizer’s (N:PFE) consumer healthcare unit. Pfizer 's cabinet of strong brands such as painkiller Advil, Centrum vitamins and Chapstick lip balm present a great opportunity for both Reckitt and GSK to build all-important scale in the still fragmented over-the-counter (OTC) market.OTC remedies are durable brands with loyal customers, and buying the Pfizer business would cement either Reckitt and GSK in a market-leading position.The acquisition would be a financial stretch for both, however, and the growing threat from Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in the OTC space is a further uncertainty.Both CEOs have expressed interest in the Pfizer auction, though neither company has confirmed its participation. But people familiar with the matter say they are in the running.""Neither of them have to do this deal,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) portfolio manager Steve Clayton, who owns shares in both companies across funds worth 500 million pounds ($695 million).""The value of our investment is dependent most on the stuff that they already own. That has to be management's No. 1 priority.""With Reckitt and GSK shares having underperformed their respective European sectors by 13 and 14 percent in the past year, both bosses already have their work cut out.Reckitt has grappled with a slowing market and ongoing fallout from a South Korean safety scandal, a failed product launch and a cyberattack.GSK has struggled with a scarcity of promising new drugs in its pipeline at a time of mounting competition in its core respiratory and HIV divisions.CONVINCING INVESTORSRakesh Kapoor, Reckitt's CEO since 2011, has a reputation for savvy deal-making and financial rigour in his quest to turn Reckitt from a stodgy British maker of cleaning products into a consumer healthcare powerhouse.Yet he came under pressure last year for his high pay, which was slashed, and the $16.6 billion acquisition of struggling baby formula maker Mead Johnson, its biggest ever.GSK's Emma Walmsley, who took over in April, has yet to convince some investors that her background selling shampoo at L'Oreal (PA:OREP) has prepared her for running one of the world's biggest drug operations. Doubling down in consumer products risks increasing that scepticism.She must also ensure buying Pfizer does not endanger the dividend or derail existing priorities to invest in pharmaceutical research and have resources to buy out  Novartis 's (S:NOVN) minority stake in their consumer health joint venture, if the Swiss company decides to sell from next month.Both companies must also evaluate how far they are prepared to let credit ratings slip for a big acquisition, at a time when global interest rates look to be on the rise.Reckitt has said it would be willing to temporarily let its rating slide to BBB for a ""spectacular"" deal.""A short-term downgrade in debt rating for what is a once-in-a-generation opportunity makes sense,"" said Reckitt shareholder Harold Thompson, a partner at consumer goods-focused investment firm Ash Park Capital.GSK is currently rated A2 and Moody's Investors Service analyst Knut Slatten said its credit quality in 2018 would hinge on the company's appetite for deals.Yet  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said downgrades may not be necessary, given a range of available financing options aside from just taking on debt or issuing equity, which would dilute shareholder returns. Examples include bridge loans secured by asset sales or partnering with a financial investor.GSK could do the deal through its joint venture, and in Reckitt's case, the home and hygiene business could be a fertile ground for disposals, especially since it now operates as a separate business from health, as of this year. ""They've been presented with an opportunity in Pfizer that really pushes them to decide the next decade of their destiny,"" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said of Reckitt.Reckitt will report full-year results on Feb. 19, and another improvement in Mead Johnson could warm more investors to a Pfizer bid if it signals that deal's integration is on track.($1 = 0.7193 pounds)"
58,"Dec 01, 2017 05:11AM ET",Beauty contest: China make-up brands rein in South Korea rivals,nan,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Adam JourdanSEOUL/SHANGHAI(Reuters) - As a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Seoul raged this year, many South Koreans felt decidedly unwelcome in China. South Korean businesses were shunned, K-pop concerts were canceled and tourist trade dried up.But one group of South Koreans have been very much in demand: the executives and employees of South Korea’s cosmetics companies, who are being lured by Chinese rivals as a battle for China’s huge beauty market heats up. Chinese make-up brands including Jala, Proya <603605.SS> and Suhu - which have long trailed Korean rivals in terms of quality - are hiring South Korean executives as well as spending up on research and buying overseas firms, industry executives and headhunters say. The moves seem to be helping. Chinese brands, which compete with Korea names from top-rated Amorepacific (KS:002790) to nimble budget makers such as Clio (KQ:237880), are gaining market share in the mid-range and premium cosmetics sector where South Korea has traditionally had strength in China.While Chinese companies have been gaining ground for some time, the trend appears to have accelerated this year after Seoul's decision to install a U.S. anti-missile system against Beijing's wishes sparked a backlash against Korean companies. At stake is a bigger chunk of China's $50.2 billion beauty and personal care market, which research firm Euromonitor projects will grow to $61.9 billion by 2020.Jason Yu, Shanghai-based General Manager of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel, said mid-tier or ""masstige"" Korean brands were most exposed to Chinese brands improving their offering. High-end brands from France's L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and Japan's Shiseido (T:4911) tended to attract wealthier buyers.""In terms of the price position, they will be more in direct competition with the emerging Chinese brands who are moving up the price ladder,"" said Yu, adding Chinese firms were ""catching up very fast"".HIRING SPREEThere are signs that recent diplomatic tensions have played into the hands of local Chinese brands in their battle with Korean rivals.Amorepacific's sales fell 8 percent in the January to September period from a year earlier, while operating profit skidded 30 percent. Smaller, budget makers were hit harder, with Clio's operating profit falling nearly 70 percent.While some Chinese make-up brands use South Korean stars or highlight Korean links, others are playing up Chinese elements such as using traditional medicine ingredients or use slogans about suiting Chinese skin.Zoe Zhuang, 24, an engineer in Nanjing, said she used to use cushion foundations and eye pencils from South Korea's Etude brand. She now uses more Chinese to ""support local brands"", she said, without referring to the dispute over the THAAD missile system. ""I actually don't think Chinese makeup is that good yet, there is plenty of room for improvement,"" she said.Chinese cosmetics firms have been trying to close the quality gap by aggressively targeting South Korean executives. ""(Chinese cosmetics brands) are recruiting Koreans in almost all areas, including brand managers, packaging design, store interiors, purchasing and marketing,"" Choi Sun-hee, head of South Korean recruiting firm HR Biz Korea, told Reuters.Some Chinese brands are willing to offer 50 percent higher wages, help with rents and flights home to woo Korean workers, Choi added.Guangzhou-based Suhu plans to double the number of its South Korean employees to 40, Choi said. It recently hired an executive from Korea's Nature Republic to oversee the recent launch of its Rojank brand, he added. Suhu declined to comment. Chinese brand Proya, which owns the Uzero and Cats & Roses brands, hired South Korean Kim Hoi-joon from Clio in 2014 to launch its Hapsode brand, Kim told Reuters.Another former Amorepacific official said Kim had lured him to Proya last year with a salary hike of about 50 percent. He said he was one of over 10 Korean employees hired by Proya.Proya declined to comment.Meanwhile, Jala, one of China's leading cosmetics firms, hired a Korean executive earlier this year to revamp its mainstay Chando brand, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Jala also hired the former head of Amorepacific's Etude brand, Kim Dong-young, they added. Kim, reached by phone, confirmed he had been working at Jala for about a year, but declined to comment further.Jala's press office was not available for comment. The approach is not limited to cosmetics. Chinese firms from carmakers to flatscreen producers to smartphone vendors have recently opened up more to hiring foreign talent to help them gain a competitive edge, often taking market share from South Korean rivals as they move up the value chain and their industries mature.But Korean brands aren't going down without a fight.Amorepacific said it was working with experts in seven Chinese cities to study local skin characteristics and develop products for the local market. ""It is not that we are not worried about Chinese competition,"" Rho Jee-hye, an Amorepacific senior vice president told Reuters. ""As there is  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) in the United States, L'Oreal in France and Amorepacific in Korea, an innovative Chinese company could emerge.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Oct 20, 2017 03:40PM ET",Nestle CEO praised by Third Point but hedge fund still wants more,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Svea Herbst-BaylissLONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Nine months into leading the world's biggest packaged food company, Nestle SA (S:NESN) Chief Executive Mark Schneider got a tentative thumbs-up from a prominent investor, who praised his early steps on Friday but said there was more work to be done.Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, whose firm Third Point made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle in June, told his clients that he was pleased but not satisfied in a letter viewed by Reuters.Loeb commended how the new CEO had shifted the tone, saying Schneider ""has set a new course for Nestle"" but ""there is much more opportunity to unlock value.""Nestle declined to comment.The positive review suggested Schneider, a German who moved to Switzerland to become Nestle's first external leader in nearly a century, was for now safe from an activist-inspired challenge. Such showdowns at large U.S. corporations have cost eight CEOs their jobs this year.Third Point was especially complimentary about Schneider's presentation at an investor seminar in London last month, saying it showed ""a new approach of greater investor responsiveness.""Loeb was at the meeting but kept a low profile, without asking questions of the CEO or answering journalists' questions on the sidelines. However, there have been plenty of private conversations, with frequent phone calls between New York and Vevey, a person familiar with them said.By staying in the background, for now, Loeb is giving Schneider time to steer Europe's most valuable company through its weakest growth in more than two decades, as consumers ditch processed foods for fresher, healthier options.That may not last forever. Loeb's sharply worded letters to CEOs are legendary and he has agitated for ousters of leaders at companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and Sotheby's (N:BID). This year alone, CEOs at  General Electric  Co (N:GE), Pandora, Tiffany & Co (N:TIF),  Buffalo Wild Wings Inc  (O:BWLD) and CSX Corp (O:CSX) lost their jobs amid pressure from other activist investors.Third Point spelled out its demands for Nestle months ago and reiterated them in Friday's letter: specific margin targets, a faster pace of share buybacks, a reshaped portfolio and the sale of Nestle's stake in cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Schneider has delivered on some of those goals.Nestle - home to Gerber baby food, Kit Kat bars and Nespresso coffee - set a margin target for the first time last month, following similar moves from rivals  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and  Danone  SA (PA:DANO).Nestle has also been buying back stock nearly every day since the September meeting as part of a $21 billion repurchase plan, and is selling its U.S. confectionery business and buying niche brand Blue Bottle.On Third Point's wish list is a sale of the 23 percent stake Nestle owns in French cosmetics company L'Oreal. When L'Oreal's heiress Liliane Bettencourt died last month, speculation mounted about the companies' future relationship, which dates back 40 years. Separately on Friday, L'Oreal Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said he foresaw no changes in the company's shareholding in the near future.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Sep 26, 2017 09:55AM ET",Nestle targets profit margin to satisfy investor hunger,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Silke KoltrowitzLONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) set a profit margin target for the first time on Tuesday, responding to an industry slowdown and pressure from activist investor Third Point for near-term returns from the world's largest packaged food company.Shares in Nestle were up 1.8 percent to 82.55 Swiss francs by 1317 GMT, reflecting subdued support for the target, which is less ambitious than some shareholders had hoped for.Investors want Nestle's new chief executive Mark Schneider to demonstrate it has a strong strategy to improve performance as the food sector cools due to changing consumer tastes and habits and upstart rivals.While many multinationals turned to cost-cutting, inspired by industry-leading margins at Kraft-Heinz (O:KHC), Nestle and rival  Unilever  (L:ULVR) had argued that cutting too deep to deliver margin growth is a short-term solution.But Unilever altered its stance after February's unexpected takeover bid from Kraft-Heinz, adopting a margin target of 20 percent by 2020 and Nestle moved in that direction on Tuesday, setting a margin target of 17.5 to 18.5 percent by 2020, up from 16 percent in 2016.U.S. activist hedge fund Third Point, which in June revealed it had a $3.5 billion Nestle stake, had urged the Swiss company to target 18-20 percent. It declined to comment on the new goal. ""The pace of change has picked up. We need to execute faster than before,"" Schneider said at his first investor seminar since becoming CEO in January. ""Things will change but the way we approach business will not change."" ""This company got, for a reason, to the leadership position it has today, and it is hell-bent on not losing it,"" said the German and American dual citizen, who was brought in as Nestle was ending its fourth year of disappointing sales growth. Schneider repeated Nestle's goal to reach mid-single digit organic sales growth by 2020, adding that pursuing sales and margin growth at the same time was hard work, likening it to ""going for a run and a diet at the same time"".It was unlikely this new margin target, which is in line with what some analysts already had in their models, would be followed by another higher one at a later stage, he said.RBC Capital Markets analysts, who said they were already factoring in a margin of 17.6 percent by 2020, said the new targets ""do not mark any great evolution in expectations"" and stuck to their Outperform rating and 83 Swiss francs target. Thomas Russo, a Nestle shareholder for more than 30 years whose firm has a stake worth more than $1 billion, said the target was enough to quieten calls for change.""It gives them the ability to stay at work without having the distraction of whether they'll concede a margin guidance, but at the same time not burden themselves from making the kind of bold investments that are required to deliver long-term value,"" Russo, of Gardner Russo & Gardner, said. CABINET RESHUFFLE Strong cash generation would let Nestle spread its share buyback program of up to 20 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion) evenly over three years, it said. It had earlier said it would be backloaded to 2019 and 2020 to preserve cash for M&A.In recent months Nestle has bought into U.S. food delivery business Freshly, Sweet Earth meatless food and Blue Bottle Coffee and Schneider said it would continue to identify opportunities as well making divestments.""We will need to trade out of some product areas and into others,"" Schneider said. He noted that 10 percent of Nestle's group sales could be ripe for portfolio adjustment, while confirming Nestle remains committed to frozen food.Schneider said Nestle's view on its 23 percent stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP), worth more than 23 billion euros, had not changed. Third Point called for the company to sell its stake and last week's death of the L'Oreal heiress, French billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, rekindled speculation of changes.Nestle has identified four areas which already account for 53 percent of sales - coffee, pet care, infant nutrition and bottled water - as key areas for investment.It will also pursue consumer healthcare, in an effort to expand in pharmacies and drug stores and boost margins.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Both Sanofi and Nestle rose around 1 percent.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.1 percent by 0805 GMT. Miners (SXPP) were the biggest sectoral faller, down 1.4 percent, as escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and China's rating downgrade hit metal prices. North Korea said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to destroy the reclusive country.Among top fallers on the STOXX were London-listed miners BHP Billiton (L:BHP),  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), which dragged UK's FTSE (FTSE) down 0.2 percent. Germany's blue chip DAX index (GDAXI) was little changed, close to a two-month high on the last trading day before the general election in Europe's biggest economy.The DAX has outperformed euro zone peers over the past four years to hit a record high in June and there are expectations that a victory of Merkel could further support the country's equities, regardless of the makeup of her coalition.Yet some investors believe that German stocks, especially industrials like carmakers, are too highly priced and could be severely hit by a possible correction in key export market China on the back of a growing pile of debt.""The risks in a lot of the German companies are being under appreciated,"" Luiz Sauerbronn, who helps manage $30 billion at global investment advisory firm Brandes Investment Partners.Sauerbronn however said he was more optimistic about prospects for European equities as a whole given their attractive relative valuations versus the U.S. and sees opportunities in British grocers or European oil companies. Among German blue chips, utilities RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn), which are seen sensitive to possible policy changes in their country following the vote, rose 0.7 and 0.6 percent.Among other top movers on Friday was British engineer  Smiths Group  Plc (L:SMIN). Its shares fell 3.9 percent after full-year revenue growth fell short of analyst expectations even though its pretax profit rose 17 percent helped by growth in its security scanners business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

69,"Jul 10, 2017 01:38PM ET",Activist Loeb keeps up performance pressure on Nestle: source,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Maiya KeidanLONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb is keeping up pressure on Nestle (S:NESN) by sharing views with the company as part of a regular dialogue, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food.The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder.But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016.  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent.Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans.""Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,"" Liberum analysts said. Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts.Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group.Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important. Loeb, dubbed a ""constructivist"" for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend.Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency.Aside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business. MAYBELLINE FOR MAGGI Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company. It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up.Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters.Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed.After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside.The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent. That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year.For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source. That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research.Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc  and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (T:6758) and Seven & I Holdings (T:3382).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"Jun 28, 2017 03:45PM ET",Nestle plan hailed as only the start of Schneider's shake-up,nan,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Maiya KeidanZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle's (S:NESN) plan to shore up its capital structure, announced only days after being thrust into the spotlight by activist shareholder Third Point, was received by investors as a precursor to bigger changes under the company's new leadership.Shares in the world's largest foodmaker rose as much as 2 percent on Wednesday, close to the record high touched on Monday after the New York-based hedge fund disclosed a $3.5 billion stake and urged Nestle to buy back shares, set a target for margin growth and shed non-core assets including its stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Investors did not have to wait long for a response, with Nestle announcing late on Tuesday that it would launch a 20 billion Swiss franc ($20.8 billion) share buyback program while leaving room for near-term acquisitions.Nestle also said it would continue adjusting its portfolio and assess opportunities to boost profit margins, stopping short of setting a firm target. It added that the measures were the result of a review instigated at the start of the year after Mark Schneider took over as chief executive. The moves were welcomed by stakeholders large and small.""This is a new era for Nestle and I'm extremely positive on the prospects for internal and external growth,"" said Carine Menache, who runs a Monaco investment firm that owns Nestle shares. She and UBS analysts said the buyback should lift earnings by 6 percent, while increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity could provide a further boost. ""Nestle may have a poor track record for M&A, but the new CEO, Schneider, is now in charge and he has a great track record,"" she added. Reaching a 19 percent operating margin, the midpoint of Third Point's recommendation, would lift earnings by another 8 percent, according to UBS, which said Nestle shares now offered the greatest opportunity for growth of all the European packaged goods companies it covers, bolstering its ""buy"" rating.Of Nestle's plan, which they described as ""responsive but not reactionary"" to Third Point, UBS said: ""We think this sends a strong message to the markets - expect more to come."" SECTOR CONVULSIONSThe global packaged food sector is convulsing as its main players struggle with slowing growth, changing consumer habits and the growing influence of global investment firm 3G Capital. 3G's Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) launched a surprise $143 billion takeover bid for  Unilever  (L:ULVR) in February, sparking a deep review and new agenda at the target company.Many of the demands laid out in Third Point's letter echo the steps Unilever took in the wake of the Kraft bid. Investors said the biggest omission from Nestle's response was any reference to its 25 billion euro ($28.4 billion) stake in L'Oreal, which dates back to 1974, when the French heiress Liliane Bettencourt sold a large part of her holding to Nestle.That omission and lack of a margin target means the announcement may not completely satisfy Third Point, which is controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb. Third Point has declined to comment on the announcement at this stage and Nestle is expected to say more at its investor day in September.""It's only a start,"" said Mirabaud Asset Management's Nicolas Burki. ""It will not be enough.""Nestle has long touted the L'Oreal stake as value-creating, and a source familiar with the company's thinking said there was no change to that view. The big question, however is what Nestle would do with the cash, besides buybacks, if it sold down the L'Oreal stake.The company did say its capital spending would be focused on higher-growth categories of coffee, pet food, baby food and water. It added consumer health to the list of priorities, potentially making it a competitor to the likes of Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK).However, EFG Asset Management's Urs Beck cashed out of his Nestle position on Monday's price spike and is skeptical that it can find acquisitions big enough to move the needle for a company with $93 billion in sales.""The ship is just too big to be steered into different waters through portfolio management,"" he said.VICTORY ON BOTH SIDES Nestle is Europe's most valuable company, with a market value of $263 billion last week, before Loeb's position was made public, adding $10 billion in one day.The positive reaction most likely reflects the bullishness of long-term investors rather than event-driven hedge funds looking for quick turnarounds, says Michael Wegener at Case Equity Partners in Hong Kong. Wegener said he doubts that many arbitrageurs have moved into Nestle's stock yet, since the Loeb stake remains too soft a catalyst at this stage. But one London-based manager of an event-driven hedge fund with no involvement with Nestle described the situation as a victory for both sides. ""I suspect (Third Point's) presence actually helps Schneider with his change agenda,"" said the manager, who asked not to be named. ""I suspect the buyback is not enough, but Third Point is unlikely to feel the need to get shouty."" Swiss activist shareholder Rudolf Bohli said that Loeb, known for campaigns against Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), Sony Corp (T:6758) and the Dow-DuPont merger, is on the right track. ""Loeb has set the right tone and his agenda is correct,"" said Bohli, who recently exited GAM Holding with a profit after failing to replace the financial company's chief executive.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

72,"Jun 27, 2017 07:32PM ET",Nestle plans $20.8 billion share buyback amid Third Point pressure,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Silke KoltrowitzLONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.8 billion) worth of shares over three years, it said on Tuesday, days after U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC began a campaign to boost performance at the company.The New York-based hedge fund, controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the company on Sunday when it started pushing for Nestle to more aggressively boost performance and buy back shares.Nestle, maker of Gerber baby food and Perrier water, said its announcement was the result of a review of its priorities that had begun in early 2017. It did not mention Third Point in its statement, and Third Point declined to comment on the announcement.However, Nestle's Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who took over at the start of the year, said at the company's first-quarter results presentation in April that he understood from meetings with shareholders they wanted to see ""meaningful steps towards improved combinations of growth rates and margins"".These comments and the fact that buyback plans take time to get regulatory approval before being announced mean that Nestle would have submitted the plan before Third Point made its position public late on Sunday. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said there was no big surprise in the company's statement, but it had initially planned to release this at its investor day in September.It was not clear, however, whether feedback that Loeb might have given in a meeting earlier this month was taken into consideration when Nestle crafted the final buyback plan, which will start on July 4. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy did not see the announcement as a direct result of Third Point.""We rather see today's announcement as a thorough strategic review triggered by CEO Mark Schneider, approved by the board,"" he said, noting that this was Nestle's second-biggest buyback following 25 billion Swiss francs in 2007. The company has bought back 47 billion francs worth of shares since 2005.""In the context of low interest rates and strong cash flow generation, share buybacks offer a viable option to create shareholder value,"" the company said.The volume of monthly share buybacks will depend on market conditions but will probably occur mostly in 2019 and 2020, so Nestle can consider acquisitions before then, it said. The company now expects to increase its level of debt to about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 2020. That would be up from about 0.8 times last year. HOPES OF CHANGE Nestle shares had jumped 4 percent on Monday, adding some $10 billion in market value before falling 1.6 percent on Tuesday, on hopes the push by Third Point would speed up changes under Schneider, who joined the company last year and took over as CEO in January.On Tuesday, Nestle said it will focus any capital spending on high-growth food and beverage categories including coffee, petcare, infant nutrition and bottled water, as well as growth opportunities in consumer healthcare.It said this month's announcement that it may sell its U.S. confectionery business was consistent with that approach. It also recently formed a joint venture with R&R Ice Cream to manage its ice cream business. ""The company will continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives,"" Nestle said. There are other parts of Nestle's business that analysts have speculated could be sold, including its U.S. frozen food business.Billions of dollars worth of assets are up for grabs as the global packaged food industry adapts to change. For example,  Unilever  (L:ULVR) is selling its margarine and spreads business and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) is selling its mustard business.Kepler's Cox said the fact that the company said it was targeting spending in consumer healthcare meant ""it could be seen on the prowl for assets like Johnson and Johnson's consumer health as well as Bayer's consumer health business"".TOO BIG TO SHAKE? The pressure placed on the world's largest food group, Europe's most valuable company, shatters perceptions that the Swiss giant with over 2,000 brands is too big to shake up.CEO Schneider, who had met Loeb this month, seemed to hint at that last week when he told a conference in Berlin: ""Size alone does not protect you from the winds of change.""Coupled with a shock $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February, it shows the impatience of some investors about how multinationals are adapting to change.Loeb, who has taken on giants such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and Sony (T:6758), has argued that even though Nestle has exposure to promising categories such as coffee and pet food, its shares have underperformed rivals in recent years as it has ""remained stuck in its old ways"".""It is rare to find a business of Nestle's quality with so many avenues for improvement,"" Loeb said in the letter to the fund's investors. Nestle should set a target for margin growth to improve productivity, double its leverage to fund share buybacks, shed non-core assets and sell the 23 percent stake it owns in French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP), he said.Whereas Unilever and Danone have recently set margin targets for 2020, Nestle has not. It has announced a productivity program to save 1.8 billion Swiss francs by 2020, but has not yet said how much of that would fall to the bottom line.Analysts have said that Schneider, who will lay out his strategy at an investor event in September, had already seemed more open to listening to the concerns of longtime shareholders, many of which were echoed by Third Point. Daniel Hauselmann, head of Swiss equities at GAM Investment Management, said much of what Third Point suggested was already being done. ""Nestle is no sleeping giant that does not look after its shareholders,"" he told Reuters. ""I think Nestle should stick to its strategy.""($1 = 0.9618 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Jun 26, 2017 01:11PM ET",U.S. activist presses for 'bold action' at Nestle,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Michael FlahertyLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC has targeted Nestle (S:NESN) by taking a $3.5 billion stake in the food maker and urging Europe's most valuable company to boost returns as demand for its products weakens.Nestle shares jumped as much as 4.8 percent on Monday, touching a record high after Third Point disclosed its position late on Sunday in a letter to the hedge fund's investors.In the letter, Third Point said it was urging the Swiss group to improve margins, buy back shares and get rid of non-core businesses, including its $27 billion stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Third Point's 40 million shares -- or 1.3 percent of the total -- make it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $10 billion added to Nestle's market value on Monday showed that shareholders hoped the investment would spark change at a company which has a reputation for being slow-moving and insular.""Nestle has arguably been lackadaisical and complacent and underperformed its potential,"" Bernstein analysts said. ""It might now be stirred into action by an external force."" New York-based Third Point is an $18 billion hedge fund run by American billionaire Daniel Loeb. Loeb runs a multi-strategy portfolio though he is known as an aggressive, bare-knuckled shareholder activist who has taken on major companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc.  and Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758). Loeb and Nestle CEO Mark Schneider met in Switzerland earlier this month to discuss Third Point's ideas, according to a person familiar with the matter.Senior managers at Third Point, which started buying Nestle shares at the end of the first quarter, plan to meet again with Nestle leaders in the next few weeks, said the person, who wished to remain anonymous.Third Point's investment comes as Nestle and its packaged goods rivals grapple with slowing emerging markets, pressure on prices and consumers shifting from traditional brands toward healthier, fresher fare. Nestle has missed its long-term sales target for four straight years, but so far has eschewed radical moves like Danone's (PA:DANO) $12.5 billion purchase of WhiteWave or Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB) $16.6 billion Mead Johnson deal. The company has instead pushed slowly into healthcare, with a series of small investments and acquisitions that blur the boundaries of food and medicine.Nestle, which is based on the shores of Lake Geneva and makes Nescafe coffee, Maggi noodles and Gerber baby food, said it was committed to its strategy under new Chief Executive Schneider, who joined from German healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG).""As always, we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value,"" a Nestle spokesman said. ""Beyond that, we have no specific comment.""One top-40 investor said Nestle has done a good job adapting over the years to a changing industry, selling its stake in eyecare company Alcon and buying pet food business Ralston Purina and Wyeth Nutrition.""The new CEO has been brought in with a mandate for change,"" the investor said, pointing out that Schneider is Nestle's first external CEO hire in nearly a century. ""We would prefer to let Schneider make his own decisions and judge him on the outcome than try to dictate what should happen."" RECURRING PRESSURES The move by Third Point cranks up pressure on Schneider, who arrived in January just before the sector was rocked by Kraft Heinz's (O:KHC) abortive $143 billion approach for  Unilever  (L:ULVR). He has already been looking at ways to reignite growth. He has already scrapped the company's long-standing sales target and said it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Baby Ruth and Butterfinger.Nestle had a market value of $263 billion on Friday, making it the biggest traded company in Europe. The consumer goods sector, home to usually reliable sales and dividends, has seen its share of investor activism in the past with mixed results. Before Nestle, the latest big bet was the $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble (N:PG) disclosed by Trian Partners in February.U.S. activist hedge funds have slowly cast their nets wider as corporate America becomes saturated with dissident shareholders seeking rapid changes to boost share prices. ""We feel strongly that in order to succeed, Dr. Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency toward incrementalism that has typified the company's prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance,"" Third Point said in the letter.It argued that Nestle should sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal. L'Oreal shares rose 4.1 percent on Monday. The letter also said Nestle should set a formal profit margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020 to help improve productivity. Nestle's current margin is 15.3 percent, below Unilever's 16.4 percent but higher than Danone's 13.8 percent.Third Point also recommended Nestle more than double its debt load, as well as sell the L'Oreal stake, in order to generate the capital to buy back stock.Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Third Point's suggestions echoed proposals long made by other shareholders.""Previous management was not too open to listen to critics,"" he said. ""Now with Mr. Schneider, one of his top priorities was to improve shareholder communication and investor relations. I think he's listening carefully to what investors are saying.""Nestle's previous CEO, Paul Bulcke, is now its chairman.Nestle will report half-year results on July 27 and host an investor meeting on Sept. 26. Its next annual meeting is April 12, 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Intesa, as acquiror of the 'good' assets, also looks to be getting a good deal,"" he added.Shares in Intesa, Italy's largest retail bank, rose 3.2 percent while the euro zone bank index (SX7E) rose 1.3 percent. Gains in bank stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and the euro zone blue chip (STOXX50E) indexes rise 0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively, while UK's FTSE (FTSE) added 0.6 percent.Further supporting sentiment was a survey showing that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in June to a record high, a fresh sign that company executives are more upbeat about the growth outlook of Europe's largest economy.The German blue chip index (GDAXI) added 0.6 percent. Nestle (S:NESN) led STOXX gainers, up 4.3 percent. Activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point unveiled a stake of more than 1 percent, urging the group to improve its margins, buy back stock and sell its stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP). UBS said despite its scale, Nestle lagged its rivals in profitability and that the move could put pressure on its CEO to take tangible steps to accelerate value creation. L'Oreal rose 4.1 percent.Gains in Nestle also gave a lift to sector peers such as  Danone  (PA:DANO),  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and  Diageo  (L:DGE), sending the European food and beverage index (SX3P) up 1.9 percent and on track for its strongest day this year.Higher oil prices propped up the energy sector, the worst performing this year, with majors such as  BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) leading the charge. [O/R] Underscoring the broadly upbeat mood across markets, safe-haven utilities (SX6P) were the only sector in the red by mid morning, falling 0.1 percent.Among top STOXX fallers were  William Hill  (L:WMH) and Zalando (DE:ZALG), both down more than 2 percent following downbeat broker notes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A spokesperson for Natura said, ""The company is constantly looking for business opportunities and it is indeed participating in several of the phases of the process for The Body Shop transaction.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

88,"Feb 06, 2017 08:00AM ET","New GlaxoSmithKline CEO prepares for R&D choices, potential deals",nan,"By Ben HirschlerLONDON (Reuters) - Emma Walmsley, GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) incoming CEO, will take over Britain's biggest drugmaker at a challenging time but the 47-year-old also inherits the flexibility to do deals and make key choices on new drugs.Just four days before Walmsley moves into the top job on April 1, U.S. regulators could approve the first substitutable generic version of GSK's inhaled lung drug Advair, which has raked in more than a $1 billion in sales every year since 2001.Walmsley is expected to formally present her strategic vision for the company in the summer.Investors, however, will get an indication of how she views the Advair threat on Wednesday, when GSK gives its 2017 outlook alongside full-year earnings. While Walmsley will not be on the results call, she has been closely involved in the forecasts.Navigating GSK through the loss of Advair, assuming U.S. generics are approved, is the biggest near-term challenge and will demand a sharp focus on maintaining sales momentum for GSK's newer respiratory drugs Breo, Anoro, Incruse and Nucala.Other hurdles to come include trying to improve GSK's relatively weak pharma growth at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump criticizes high drug prices in its largest market.It is arguably better placed than some to weather such pressure, given its high-volume, lower-margin strategy set in place by outgoing CEO Andrew Witty at a time when much of the industry was focused on expensive drugs for rare diseases.A solid consumer health business, led by Walmsley since 2010, selling everything from painkillers to toothpaste, has added stability, while a weak pound has provided a windfall.That has helped blow away fears about dividend payouts and has increased the scope for acquisitions, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts citing ""pro-growth capital allocation"" as a key strategic option for Walmsley.One big deal could come next year if  Novartis  (S:NOVN) opts to sell its minority stake in GSK's consumer business.R&D DECISIONSAt the same time, there are important choices to be made in the key pharmaceuticals division, which still accounts for nearly 70 percent of operating profits, despite the recent expansion of vaccines and consumer health.GSK expects to get important clinical trial results on around 25 products in development over the next 18 to 24 months.""The big value generator for the company is going to be getting a decent yield from that dataset and then making exquisitely good decisions about prioritization,"" Witty told Reuters in a recent interview.With a background in shampoo and cosmetics, after 17 years at L'Oreal (PA:OREP), Walmsley's expertise is far from the lab bench, although she has taken a crash course in pharma R&D since September, according to company insiders.She needs to get up to speed as GSK heads into a period of intensified R&D activity, which could see the drug pipeline become a more important part of its investment case.Significantly, Walmsley's first senior appointment decision as CEO-designate was to hire Luke Miels from AstraZeneca (L:AZN) as head of pharmaceuticals, making him her key pharma lieutenant alongside GSK's research boss Patrick Vallance.""She and Luke and Patrick are going to be opening the envelopes together, making the choices and then living with them. You'll have a team that is accountable right from the get-go,"" Witty said.In the meantime, GSK's top priority is to continue the momentum of the core drugs business, which has enjoyed strong sales of HIV medicines but could soon face competition from a new Gilead (O:GILD) drug.Despite the imminent threat to Advair from cheap generics, Thomson Reuters data shows analysts expect GSK's earnings to rise steadily over the next three years, leaving little room for missteps."

It did not give a precise figure.Partech Ventures, which is based in Paris and has offices in Berlin and San Francisco, invested in websites such as furniture retailer made.com and restaurant booking specialist lafourchette.com. ""These investments in new technology will ... enrich our brands and their communication, as well as other aspects such as supply chain, research and innovation,"" L'Oreal Chief Digital Officer Lubomira Rochet told Reuters in a telephone interview.In 2012, L'Oreal set up an internal start-up unit in Silicon Valley and in May this year, it invested in Founders Factory, a digital incubator, co-founded by Brent Hoberman, former CEO and co-founder of lastminute.com. Some of the new technologies the group developed internally include My UV Patch, a skin sensor designed to monitor UV exposure and help consumers educate themselves about sun protection. L'Oreal made more than 5 percent of its sales online in 2015. Its digital team, which counted some 150 people five years ago, now totals more than 1,000, with hundreds hired this year. Last year L'Oreal spent 25.5 percent of its advertising budget on digital communications and the proportion is expected to grow as more consumers, particularly in regions such as the Middle East, use the Internet for beauty tips and purchases. ""Digital has become the heart of the group's marketing strategy,"" said Rochet. Leading markets for e-commerce were the United States, China, Germany and the United Kingdom while e-commerce sales were also rising fast in countries such as Russia and Indonesia, Rochet said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It did not say from where the information was sourced.""We deeply regret this personal argument. The content of this argument does not represent at all the views of the company,"" Daimler Greater China said in a statement. The incident was being investigated by authorities and Daimler was fully co-operating with them, it said. The Daimler statement did not provide any details of the incident. It also did not identify the executive or comment on the use of pepper spray.Gaertner could not be immediately reached for comment by phone or email.People's Daily said the German executive's row was with a Chinese driver at a residential community in Beijing's northeastern Shunyi District. Passersby were drawn to the quarrel and tried to defend the Chinese driver, it said.The media reports prompted a spike in online chatter, with the outburst in the top 10 discussed topics on popular microblog Sina Weibo on Monday morning. Many users posted comments saying they would avoid buying Daimler cars.Critical reports in official Chinese media have in the past hit the reputations of foreign brands and dragged down sales.In June, the official Global Times criticized cosmetics firm Lancome, part of France's L'Oreal SA (PA:OREP), for working with Hong Kong pro-democracy singer Denise Ho, sparking calls online in China to shun the firm's business. Lancome canceled a planned concert with the singer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

102,"Sep 02, 2016 10:04AM ET",Louis Vuitton targets middle-income shoppers with perfume launch,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton has launched its first perfume range since the founding merger of its parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) in 1987, targeting middle-income shoppers amid a downturn in luxury spending.This week's launch is an important step for the French brand as it tries to strike the delicate balance between increasing its number of more affordable goods while retaining its cachet.Until now, shoppers on more modest incomes have only been catered for by Louis Vuitton's key chains and very small leather goods, costing around 200-300 euros apiece.But the brand needs to boost sales growth after a sharp slowdown in the past three years, and with little sign of an industry recovery as security fears and geo-political uncertainty hit the tourism flows vital for luxury brands. Louis Vuitton's collection of seven perfumes, with names including ""turbulences"" and ""matiere noire"" or ""dark matter,"" are on sale for around 200 euros ($224) for a 100 ml bottle. That is close to the price of niche perfume brands such as By Kilian, which have been enjoying sales growth four to five times higher than big, traditional fragrance providers whose prices cost under 100 euros. Perfume has been more resilient to the industry downturn than some parts of the luxury market, with global sales estimated to have risen 2.9 percent to about 15 billion euros last year. Within that, sales by niche brands jumped about 15 percent to around 1 billion euros. At first, Louis Vuitton will sell the perfumes in only about 180 of its 460 stores. Analysts estimate they could generate 60-80 million euros of sales in the first year. By comparison, luxury giants such as Chanel and LVMH's Dior, whose products are much more widely distributed, make about 2.5 billion euros a year from perfumes and cosmetics. Louis Vuitton, which declined to say how much it has invested in the project, gave star industry ""nose"" Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud four years to prepare the launch. The perfumer, who worked for decades with fragrance producer Firmenich, created many commercially successful perfumes including L'Eau d'Issey for Issey Miyake and L'Oreal's (PA:OREP) Poeme for Lancome and Acqua di Gio for Armani. Some industry analysts said Louis Vuitton took its time with the launch partly out of concern the move could exacerbate its ubiquity problem - the result of having opened too many shops, which dented its perceived exclusivity.Since 2012, the brand has worked to remedy this by putting the brakes on expansion and elevating its market positioning by producing more expensive handbags, with many available only in limited numbers.

Elizabeth Arden's shares rose nearly 50 percent to $13.96 in extended trading on Thursday, close to the cash offer price of $14 per share. Shares of Revlon, controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman, rose slightly to $31.30.The deal, which comes less than six months after Perelman said he would seek strategic alternatives for Revlon, will help the companies better compete with deep-pocketed rivals such  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc (N:EL) and L'Oreal SA (PA:OREP).The equity value of the deal is $419 million, based on Elizabeth Arden's outstanding shares as of May 3.Elizabeth Arden has a strong presence in the luxury skincare market, mainly in the anti-aging category, with brands such as Prevage, Ceramide and SuperStart. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities such as Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Revlon is stronger in hair color and color cosmetics, which are mainly distributed through mass retail channels and beauty salons across 130 countries. ""The combination will leverage Revlon's scale across major vendors and manufacturing partners, improving distribution and procurement,"" the companies said, adding that they expected cost synergies of about $140 million from the deal. Elizabeth Arden has reported lower-than-expected revenue in six of the past eight quarters as it loses customers to rivals with more exclusive offerings. BofA Merrill Lynch and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc have committed about $2.6 billion to fund the deal and refinance the debt of the two cosmetic makers. Revlon also said it expected 2016 net sales of $2.0 billion-$2.1 billion on a constant-currency basis, excluding the impact of the acquisition. This implies a ""high single-digit growth rate"" in net sales, the company said. Revlon also forecast adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $400 million-$420 million for the year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares of Salesforce, considered a barometer for the cloud-computing industry, edged down 0.3 percent.Demandware, whose customers include Lands' End Inc (O:LE), L'Oreal SA (PA:OREP) and Marks and Spencer Group Plc (L:MKS), has reported sales growth of more than 30 percent for the last 10 quarters.""I think Salesforce has effectively already won the CRM war - they need to stay out front in terms of innovation and they do need to have the broadest, deepest portfolio ... this was a blind spot for them,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said.Global spending on digital commerce platforms is expected to grow over 14 percent annually to about $8.5 billion by 2020, Salesforce said, citing research firm Gartner. The deal, slated to close in Salesforce's second quarter ending July, is expected to increase the company's 2017 revenue by about $100 million-$120 million.Salesforce had forecast fiscal 2017 revenue of $8.16 billion-$8.20 billion in May.However, Salesforce said it now expected an adjusted profit of 93 cents-95 cents per share for the full year, down from its previous forecast of $1-$1.02.BofA Merrill Lynch is Salesforce's financial adviser for the deal, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is advising Demandware.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Market watchers pin the blame on a campaign against demonstrations of wealth among public officials, as well as a slowdown in economic growth.As things stand, the Chinese buy close to 80 percent of their luxury goods abroad in cities such as Paris, London and Tokyo, Bain Consultancy estimated.""Whether it is  Burberry  or  Richemont  recently, many brands in the space have noted that the future of luxury demand will be about the Chinese and incrementally at home,"" said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in Hong Kong, who recommends buying CITS shares.LESS CHOICEIn Hainan, which is closer to Hanoi than Beijing, duty-free shops offering products priced as much as 30 percent less than the mainland have been operating since 2011, under a trial program aimed at developing the island as a tourist destination.Customers could initially only buy up to 8,000 yuan ($1,220) worth of duty-free goods, twice a year. From Feb. 1, they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16,000 yuan. At the same time, stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports.In Hainan's provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island, HNA's duty-free sales have since rocketed.In the island's city of Sanya, state-controlled CITS opened the country's first duty-free shopping center in 2014. The skylit, flower-shaped edifice is about nine soccer pitches in size and filled with shops stocking over 300 brands including from Burberry Group PLC (L:BRBY) and Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA (S:CFR), as well as goods such as baby formula.""It's definitely much cheaper,"" said 20-something handbag shopper Zhang Pei Pei, ""But the choice of products is less.""CITS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.HOTEL RUSHHainan's balmy climate and over 60 beaches is a draw for developers, with Sanya on the island's southern tip dotted with luxurious resorts completed or under construction. That city - three times the size of Singapore - has over 1,000 hotels with 30 more due to open in its Haitang Bay area in the coming years.One of those is the $1.7 billion Alantis project of Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656) and the owner of South Africa's Sun City casino resort, Sol Kerzner.""Fosun is optimistic in the future development of Sanya,"" the company said in an email to Reuters.Near the capital Haikou, property and aviation conglomerate HNA plans to develop a deep-water port, international sports stadium and motor racing circuit, as well as an artificial isle similar to Dubai's Palm Islands.Its aim is to become the country's first duty-free retail brand, HNA said in emailed comments.COSMETICBut for all the glamor, there are plenty of Chinese ready to spend holiday money on products that are more or less in reach on a daily basis.On one weekday afternoon in CITS' mall, queues snaked out of beauty stores from Chanel SA,  Estee Lauder  Companies Inc (N:EL) and L'Oreal SA (PA:OREP), while the outlets of upmarket watchmakers appeared near-empty.""I just want to buy cosmetics,"" said He, a 30-something from southwestern mainland city of Chongqing, who did not provide her surname. ""For other things like bags, I will just take a look.""In agreement was Huang Cheng, a 26-year-old engineering student from Shanxi province in northern China.""We don't really want to buy the big brands,"" he said, gesturing to the empty watch shops. ""The main reason is just to buy daily necessities.""Hong Kong-based CLSA analyst Aaron Fischer said the limited number of duty-free zones is unlikely to materially boost domestic spending on luxury goods.He also said price was not the only reason for shopping outside of China. Buying luxury goods in the country of origin gives ""a greater feeling of satisfaction,"" he said."

119,"Oct 30, 2015 03:00PM ET",Exclusive: France's Sephora to open shops in Iran next year,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - France's Sephora plans to open several shops in Iran starting next year, becoming one of the first major European specialist cosmetics retailers to directly invest in the country as it emerges from years of economic sanctions. Sephora, part of luxury industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), running around 2,000 outlets worldwide, is keen to build its presence in Iran where there is a huge appetite for cosmetics and especially make-up. With a population of nearly 80 million, Iran is the Middle East's second biggest market for beauty products after Saudi Arabia with annual sales reaching more than 3.5 billion euros($3.86 billion) in 2014, according to market research company Euromonitor. And the beauty and personal care market is expected to nearly treble in the next five years to more than 10 billion euros, Euromonitor forecasts. ""Sephora is currently finalizing talks with its partner in Iran,"" one of the sources close to the matter said. ""Talks are already quite advanced with their distributors,"" another source said, declining to be named. One source said Sephora was hoping to open up to seven boutiques. LVMH and Sephora declined to comment.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed in Vienna in July between Iran and six world powers is to end years economic sanctions on Iran in 2016 in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. While Western beauty products have long been sold in Iran in various perfume shops, the July deal is expected to bring an economic boom to the country which has been suffering from years of under-investment.""We estimate that women, whatever their revenue level, spend as much as a third of their income on beauty,"" Reza Miremadi, who distributes L'Oreal's mass market brands such as Maybelline and Garnier in Iran. Several managers from LVMH have been making trips to Iran in Sept. and Oct. and executives from Dior, Louis Vuitton and Bulgari are preparing to go there next month to examine investment opportunities, the sources said.And the French trade group Comité Colbert, which represents 80 luxury brands, said it was planning to organize a trip in the spring. Iran, once dominated by bazaars and tiny shops, has seen an explosion in shopping malls in recent years.""Many people do not know that Iranians' relationship to luxury and refinement is really quite close to that of the French or the Italians,"" said Sara Yalda, a Franco-Iranian writer who is organizing a series of 14 conferences on Iran at a big theater in Paris next year. ""I think luxury brands are going to be very successful there.""Many luxury brands such as jewelers Cartier, part of  Richemont  (VX:CFR), and Bulgari are sold in Iran through multi-brand shops. Iran, whose economy is largely dependent on oil and gas revenues, has more than 3 million high net worth individuals who are major and regular buyers of luxury goods, analysts estimate. But several luxury groups including Chanel, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH's Dior and Louis Vuitton said they were adopting a ""wait and see"" attitude for now until the evolution of Iran's international relations became clearer. ""We have to see how things evolve from a political standpoint and see if there is a suitable retail infrastructure,"" Dior Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said. ""This is not short term but things can evolve quite quickly.""Key political milestones will be Iran's legislative elections in February and the outcome of the U.S. presidential campaign in November as there is concern president Barack Obama's successor could re-impose sanctions.Also, as part of the July Vienna agreement, there is a ""snap back"" provision which would re-instate the sanctions if Iran failed to fulfill its commitments.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This has been an unprecedented incident.She said she would meet Sisi to discuss the next steps.""We are looking for (the investigation) to establish responsibility and clarify what happened,"" said Massieu.The group of 22 had parked their four 4x4 vehicles off-road on Sunday for a barbecue near the Bahariya oasis, a tourist site in the western desert, when army aircraft suddenly began shelling them from above, security sources and survivors said.As the tourists tried to flee, forces on the ground fired on them, Egyptian security sources said.OPEN LETTEREgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri penned an open letter to the Mexican people on Tuesday that ran in Mexican newspapers on Wednesday expressing his condolences and sympathies, but offered no apology.""I am deeply troubled that some people have chosen to exploit this tragic event to allege that Egyptian law enforcement officials have no strict rules of engagement, (or)act indiscriminately,"" the letter read.The Egyptian army has released no statement acknowledging the incident, though an earlier statement by the interior ministry said it resulted from a joint police-military operation pursuing nearby militants.""The Egyptian authorities are unequivocally committed to uncovering the precise details of this tragedy.

The world's biggest cosmetics group said on Thursday positive exchange rate movements helped to produce its strongest revenue growth in twenty years in reported terms, or a year-on-year increase of 15.3 percent, in the second quarter. The group said Armani, thanks to its ""Si"" and ""Acqua di Gio"" perfumes, and Yves Saint Laurent, boosted by the success of ""Black Opium"" perfume and make-up, recorded double-digit first-half growth while its professional hair products unit saw a rebound, helped by its L'Oreal Professionel and Redken brands.""We believe that the market will be comforted by the improvement in the two developed regions,"" UBS said in a note, referring to the United States and Western Europe.L'Oreal's like-for-like 3.6 percent sales growth year-on-year in the second quarter undershot market expectations of 4 percent. But Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon told Le Figaro newspaper the miss was mainly due to business deteriorating in Brazil and without that country, sales growth would have been 4 percent. ""The bad news this year comes from Brazil and it is there to stay because the crisis is structural,"" Agon told the French daily. Agon predicted sales growth of the global cosmetics market would be 3.5-4 percent in 2015, of the same order as last year and with which L'Oreal's underlying sales growth was in line.""But it (the group's sales growth) will be higher in the second half thanks to the expected pick-up at our mass market division and which will continue in 2016,"" Agon told Le Figaro. Agon told the paper that online sales, up 40 percent in the first half, now represented around 4-5 percent of L'Oreal's total revenue.""E-commerce is a an activity with good profitability, with low costs,"" Agon said. Agon declined to say if L'Oreal would try to lure Gucci's perfume license from Coty, which just acquired it from Procter & Gamble as part of a $12.5 billion deal.""This is great news,"" Agon told the paper about the transaction. ""It means that P&G abandoned its ambition, set 15 years ago, of becoming a world leader in the beauty market."" L'Oreal, which makes Lancome cream and Garnier shampoo, achieved operating profit of 2.32 billion euros ($2.53 billion) in the first half, broadly in line with the average estimate in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 2.31 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

130,"Jun 26, 2015 02:54PM ET","Ad executives cautious about growth, gear up for contract battle",nan,"By Leila AbboudCANNES (Reuters) - (This version of the story corrects figures on Publicis contract wins, paragraph 13)The reluctance of big companies to spend at a time of lacklustre global growth and fewer major sporting events this year are dampening demand for advertising, said the chief executives of two leading ad agencies. In separate interviews on Friday, Martin Sorrell of WPP (L:WPP) and Maurice Levy of Publicis (PA:PUBP) sounded cautious about the prospects for the advertising market, citing a lack of vibrancy in the U.S economy, weakness in Brazil, Russia and China, and Europe's continued fragility.""There is a lot of uncertainty,"" Levy told Reuters. ""Companies have cash to spend but are not in the mood to do so, and consumers are not feeling confident either.""Research firm Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, recently cut its growth forecast for the global advertising market to 4.2 percent down from 4.9 percent earlier this year. For his part, Sorrell said that the major companies served by WPP agencies such as Ogilvy and Mather and Group M were very focused on cost controls, sometimes to the detriment of long-term investment in their brands and products. ""Business is tough. Clients are very demanding in an environment where top-line growth is lower than it was before the financial crisis began,"" he said.UP FOR GRABSAgainst that backdrop, the world's top six ad agencies face upheaval because an unprecedented $27 billion in media buying and planning contracts are up for review in the coming months at companies including Coca-Cola (N:KO), Procter and Gamble (N:PG) and L'Oreal (PA:OREP).That is requiring them to defend some major contracts, while trying to steal others from rivals. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated that Publicis was the most exposed, with 1.7 percent of sales at risk and 2.5 percent of earnings per share. It is defending seven contracts including P&G,  General Mills  (N:GIS), Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and Coca-Cola.For WPP, about 1.1 percent of revenue and 1.6 percent of earnings per share are risk as it seeks to keep nine contracts including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR).Both Sorrell and Levy claimed the reviews were an opportunity to win business, while acknowledging that the fees would be lower on the new deals than the old ones.""The reviews are worrying for the agencies but their effects will also be felt on media owners because the price of ads will fall further,"" Levy predicted, referring to TV broadcasters, print outlets, and radio.Levy said Publicis had already won one contract with beauty products maker Coty (L:ULVR) with billings of $100 million and another with coffee specialist Keurig worth $150 million.""If we lose all our current contracts and win none of the new ones we're going for then our sales could drop 2 percent,"" said Levy. ""But if we defend everything and win all the new ones, then they could go up as much as 3 percent.""Sorrell said that WPP's plan was to stress its technology and data expertise in pitches to clients. WPP has made a big bet on data with its Kantar unit, which Sorrell argues offers a competitive advantage although a lower margin business. ""We are differentiated from our competitors and that will help in the reviews,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

134,"Mar 13, 2015 12:51PM ET","Weak euro to help European companies, force U.S. rivals to adapt",nan,"By Tom Bergin and Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - The euro's slide toward parity with the dollar will provide a much-needed boost for European companies this year and force U.S. rivals to adapt their businesses or risk losing market share.While currency hedging arrangements mean the benefits may not be seen straight away, the currency's weakness has already cheered European chief executives by making their products cheaper overseas and lifting the value of dollar-based sales.""We have been handicapped by the strength of the euro, but now it seems that the wind is turning and we intend to make the most of this very positive currency effect that will help us deliver a nice increase of our sales and our profits in 2015,"" Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) told investors last month.Other companies predicting a tail wind from the around 20 percent drop in the value of the euro over the past six months to $1.06 on Friday include jet manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR), German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and French engineering groups Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and  Alstom  (PARIS:ALSO). Some U.S companies also see positives from the weaker euro, including lower borrowing costs, better performance at European units which export, stronger demand from Euro zone-based customers and, for the leisure sector, increased travel into the continent.However, most U.S. groups that discussed the currency in recent weeks including Apple (O:AAPL), Dupont (N:DD), Priceline (O:PCLN),  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and  General Electric  (N:GE), have warned they may face headwinds in Europe and elsewhere, and some, including Xerox (N:XRX), have cut earnings guidance as a result.These companies have said they are now looking to cut costs, increase the portion of inputs they source from inside the euro zone and adopt new pricing policies, to try and maintain market share and margins.""U.S. companies exporting goods to Europe could face margin pressure from price adjustments or promotions in Europe,"" said James Targett, analyst at Berenberg.With euro weakness likely to persist due to the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program and a likely hike in U.S. interest rates on the back of a stronger U.S. economy, longer term planning is a must.""You have to think about where your revenues are, where your manufacturing is and where you're buying your raw materials from,"" he added.TIME LAGMany companies said hedging contracts would mean the impact of the lower euro would take time to feed through. Paris-based Alstom and Swiss-headquartered engineer ABB, which has manufacturing plants in the euro zone, said it may not be felt until the second half of the year. Airbus said it was fully hedged for 2015, 2016 and ""largely"" for 2017, leading analysts to predict it could be 2018 before the group experienced any meaningful uplift.In the meantime, the weaker euro may actually weigh on some European companies' earnings because companies must report drops in the values of hedging instruments, which move in the opposite direction to companies' revenues. ""In itself, the drop in the euro is some good news. It should have a positive impact on our revenues, and our operating income. But, of course, in the short term it will have -- it will be a drag on our profitability rate,"" Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci and Puma owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), said on an analyst call last month.Kering said it was switching to the use of options, paying a premium to hedge against currency moves, rather than entering swap contracts which must be revalued each quarter with the changes in value put through the user's profit and loss account.U.S .companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and PepsiCo (N:PEP). said hedging would mitigate their losses in the short term. However, businesses are also looking at how they can reconfigure their operations to limit the hit from a weaker euro and capitalize on any opportunities.A number of companies said they would look at cutting costs. Others said they would try and push through euro price rises in Europe to try and compensate for the fact the euro is now worth less, although deflationary pressures across the continent means companies have little pricing power.U.S. conglomerate 3M (N:MMM) said it was looking at pegging some prices to the dollar and even renegotiating the prices at which it purchases goods.REGIONAL SELF-SUFFICIENCYMany companies said they were considering locking the benefits of the euro into their supply chain. ABB (VX:ABBN) CEO Uli Spiesshofer said his company was looking at ""taking further advantage of euro-based suppliers"". Nick Gangestad, CFO of 3M said his company was aim for more ""regional self-sufficiency"".This strategy may reduce costs in the short term but it poses risks.""The downside to this, however, is that local sourcing fails to leverage global scale and could make procurement less efficient. Scale is great for pricing power,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.For some U.S. companies, the lower currency will be a boon for long-struggling European subsidiaries. U.S.-based Caterpillar said it had been forced to downsize its excavator plant in Grenoble in recent years but that the weak euro could help drive its recovery.""A euro at parity (to the dollar) will just be a great tailwind for that… the currency benefit will just be gravy on that,"" CEO Doug Oberhelman said.Philip Morris International (N:PM), which has a significant portion of its debt denominated in euros, said they were also benefiting from lower borrowing costs, since meeting the coupons on euro debt was now cheaper in dollar terms.For a small number of U.S. companies, the euro drop may even be a net positive, operationally. Europe-based hotels' higher reliance on external visitors than those in the United States meant the draw of the weaker European currency may outweigh the costs of a stronger dollar in putting tourists off.""Roughly 30 percent of our European lodging demand comes from outside Europe, with about 20 points from North America and 6 points from Asia,"" said Arne Sorenson, Marriott International, Inc. CEO. ""In the United States, for example, 95 percent of our business is US business; 5 percent is inbound business.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

139,"Oct 29, 2014 08:10AM ET",French drugmaker Sanofi sacks CEO Viehbacher,nan,"By Natalie Huet and Noëlle Mennella PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi's (PA:SASY) board ousted its chief executive of six years at a special meeting on Wednesday, two days after it emerged he had fallen out with the French drugmaker's chairman, wiping more billions off its market value.The management turmoil comes at a particularly awkward time for France's second-biggest listed company, after it warned on Tuesday that growth in its key diabetes business would likely stall next year.The board said on Wednesday Sanofi would continue the strategy of international expansion pursued under Chris Viehbacher, blaming his dismissal on his management style and poor relations with the board.But some analysts fear the company may become more insular.""Viehbacher tried hard to change the DNA of the company but the board won in the end. Sanofi will become more parochial now,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities in London.Shares in Sanofi were down more than 4 percent in morning trade. That takes their decline over the past three days to more than 15 percent, wiping almost 17 billion euros ($22 billion) from the company's market value -- or more than the entire market capitalization of French carmaker Renault (PA:RENA).Sanofi said Chairman Serge Weinberg would take on the CEO role until a replacement for the ousted German-Canadian Viehbacher was found. Weinberg said on a conference call there had already been contacts with potential candidates in the pharmaceutical industry and nationality would not be a factor.""We want to choose the best possible boss for Sanofi, so we'll take the time that's needed,"" Weinberg said, adding the board would strive to go ""as fast as possible"".UNANIMOUS DECISIONSanofi's first non-French boss, Viehbacher transformed a national champion into a global business, largely due to the $20 billion acquisition of U.S. biotech and rare diseases company Genzyme in 2011, which tipped the enlarged group's center of gravity away from Paris and towards Boston.But his straight-talking and sometimes brusque management style raised the hackles of trade unions, and a source close to the board told Reuters this week that it was unhappy at the lack of communication from an ""authoritarian, solitary, secret"" CEO.Viehbacher did not inform the board when he recently oversaw a review of what to do with an $8 billion portfolio of off-patent drugs in Europe, most of which are produced in France. The options studied leaked to the press and fired up tensions.Weinberg said the unanimous decision from the board's 15 members to remove Viehbacher stemmed mainly from his management style and poor cooperation. He also cited problems with Viehbacher's execution of group strategy, pointing to inventory problems in Brazil last year, a slowdown in sales in China and Tuesday's warning on its diabetes business.The fact Viehbacher moved to Boston in June did not help relations improve, but his change of residence was not the root of the dispute, one source close to the board said.Uncertainty over Viehbacher's role first surfaced on Monday with the publication of a Sept. 4 letter he sent to the board asking for clarity about his position.A source close to the matter said Wednesday's board meeting lasted only 30 minutes and was relaxed. ""Chris Viehbacher thanked everybody and said he respected the board's decision. He seemed prepared,"" the source said.French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is Sanofi's largest shareholder, with a stake of 9 percent. Officials at the company were not immediately available to comment.M&A?Some investors were disappointed Sanofi did not set out a plan on Tuesday to offset problems at its diabetes unit with cost cuts. However, Citi analyst Peter Verdult said scope for significant cuts were limited by the need to invest in the new drug pipeline. It is also difficult for Sanofi to cut its domestic cost base in France, due to strict French labor laws.One lever Sanofi could pull would be to make further acquisitions, according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.""Generally speaking, in the pharmaceutical sector, larger M&A deals tend to happen when companies are in difficult straits and this is where Sanofi seems to be at the moment,"" he said.Sanofi has stayed somewhat on the sidelines of a global tide of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over the past year.Weinberg ruled out mega-deals, saying these rarely created value, but said the group would keep looking at targeted acquisitions to strengthen its existing businesses.""It's not because we haven't acted lately on this front that we won't do so tomorrow, but we are not interested in big operations, in what we call mega-mergers,"" he said.(1 US dollar = 0.7853 euro)(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris; Editing by James Regan, Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)"
140,"Jul 07, 2014 02:10AM ET",What's in a scent? Perfume makers adapt to EU rules,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Seaweed may not be the first ingredient that springs to mind for perfume. But algae are among obscure ingredients to which perfume makers are turning to preserve the scent of their fragrances in the face of new EU anti-allergy restrictions. The global high end perfume industry, generating $25 billion in annual sales, is readying itself for EU regulations that will come into force in early 2015.  These will ban widely-used ingredients such as oak moss, a natural substance, that was found in the original versions of best-sellers including Chanel's No.5 and Miss Dior.  Perfume creators say they love oak moss for its woody, earthy notes which give it depth and help make scent last longer. But on the grounds that between one and three percent of the EU population could suffer an allergic reaction - such as dermatitis - Brussels is banning two of its core molecules, atranol and chloroatranol. Perfume makers will only be allowed to use oak moss from which these two molecules have been removed. The makers say this results in a much lighter and less vigorous scent. ""I am crazy about oak moss, it is one of my favorite ingredients,"" says Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, perfume creator or ""nose"" at his niche Parfum d'Empire brand. A 100 ml bottle of scent costs 120 euros.  Corticchiato, like many other ""noses,"" is anxious about the new wave of potentially costly rules emanating from Brussels. The fragrance industry that supplies perfume makers like Corticchiato already has its own self regulation body - the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) - financed by providers such as Givaudan, New York-listed International Flavors & Fragrances, and Germany's Symrise. It has imposed restrictions on a growing list of ingredients over the years for various health reasons.  In addition, perfume makers do a lot of their own in-house and post-market surveillance and do their own testing, which can cost several hundred thousands euros a year, depending on the number of products and ingredients involved. Leading brands such as Chanel, Dior and Hermes have 'noses' and their own research laboratories. They do not publish figures for the costs associated with them but industry experts estimate them to be in the order of several million euros a year.  A TOUCH OF ALGAE One solution for oak moss, Corticchiato says, is to add a touch of algae as its wet, iodized smell coupled with other ingredients, can help recreate oak moss' moldy character.  The European Commission is also banning a synthetic molecule called HICC, or lyral, which replicates the smell of lily of the valley. It too can cause dermatitis in allergy sufferers. L'Oreal, which makes Lancome and Armani perfumes, said it was looking for alternatives. It declined to say which of its perfumes contained lyral.   Perfume makers say they understand that their products need to be safe and recognize how damaging to their reputation any serious allergic reaction would be. But some say the industry is being unfairly targeted. Up until now, they say, there have only been minor cases of allergies manifested by skin irritations or eczema. ""I think Brussels' focus is a little exaggerated specially compared to alcohol and cigarettes which are sold freely and do more harm than perfume,"" says Patricia de Nicolaï who created the French Nicolaï perfume brand with her husband 25 years ago.  She says she has never received a complaint about allergy but has reformulated some of her best sellers such as New York and Eau d'Ete because they used oak moss and lyral respectively. The European Union denies targeting perfume any more than any other industry and says its new regulation seeks to address scientists' and doctors' concerns about the health hazards related to the use of perfume.   NORTH-SOUTH PERFUME LINES Some inside the perfume industry say lobby groups representing the interests of tobacco firms are better financed and better organized than those representing perfume makers. One reason is the sheer size of the global cigarette industry. In sales terms, it is more than three times the size of the perfume industry. Cigarette lobby groups include the tobacco manufacturers' association and the tobacco retailer's alliance. By comparison, perfume makers rely on Cosmetics Europe, a bulky organization that represents 4,000 companies including deodorant, toothpaste and perfume providers which have very disparate interests. Even within the perfume industry, there is no united front as some brands are more affected than others by IFRA and new EU regulation. One of the industry's biggest players, L'Oreal, says it uses mainly synthetic ingredients in its perfumes. These ingredients raise fewer allergy concerns than natural products found in niche perfumes and brands such as Chanel and LVMH's Dior and Guerlain. Another issue is that perfumes are not protected by intellectual property rights. The composition of a perfume is not legally recognized as a ""creation of the mind"" but rather an industrial formula that can be replicated and altered. ""Many perfumes have had to be reformulated even though they were considered masterpieces due to changing legislation,"" said Olivier Maure, head of Accords et Parfums, a supplier of major brands including Dior based in Grasse, likening it to ""changing the colors of the Mona Lisa"". Some industry executives say Brussels' recent focus on the perfume industry stems from its main advisory body, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). Many of the committee's members come from northern countries such as Sweden and Denmark where there is opposition to perfume on health grounds.  ""Clearly, there are more experts at the SCCS who are based in northern Europe than in the south but it is not a deliberate choice,"" said David Hudson, spokesman for consumer policy at the European Commission. ""We strive for geographic and gender balance but the primary selection criteria is expertise."" Perfume is not as important to the economies of northern Europe as it is to southern countries. Perfumes and cosmetics are among France's top five exports and the southern city of Grasse is the historic capital of the perfume industry where many leading brands such as Chanel, Hermes and Dior source their essences.  Added to that, research shows people from northern regions tend to be more vulnerable to allergies than those living around the Mediterranean. One theory is that people in northern countries are more susceptible because of their lifestyle and generally cleaner environment.  MORE RESTRICTIONS TO FOLLOW? The SCCS published a report in July 2012 which recommended banning oak moss's core molecules and severely restricting the use of many core ingredients such as linalool, found in lavender, a move that threatened the high end of the perfume industry which relied heavily on these ingredients. Brussels included a few of the SCCS's recommendations, such as its ban on oak moss, and pledged to investigate what levels of concentrations could be considered safe for natural ingredients so that consumers did not develop allergies to them over time.  Perfume makers are worried that this will lead to more restrictions. There have been suggestions that they should offer two types of perfumes - some with allergens in them and consumer advice about the content, and others with no allergen. ""I expected big groups to take the initiative on this matter but it turns out that they are the most risk averse,"" said Corticchiato. One problem for big perfume brands is that their label sells a dream which is incompatible with the message ""this product may cause allergies."" Dior, Guerlain and parent LVMH declined to comment for this article as did Hermes. Chanel said it stopped using lyral in 2010 and has been evolving its formulas in anticipation of new rules. ""At Chanel, we follow very closely talks about regulation and scientific findings concerning raw materials,"" Jacques Polge, Chanel's chief perfume creator for 36 years, said in an emailed response to questions. Polge said Chanel controls its formulas and supply chains to ensure its natural oak moss is bereft of the allergens targeted by Brussels. That way, ""we can respect the original scent"". But ""once you change an ingredient or two it can be very difficult to keep the scent absolutely intact, especially if those ingredients played an important role in defining the scent,"" says Maurice Roucel, creator of many perfumes including L'Instant for Guerlain and Hermes's 24 Faubourg.  A few years ago, Roucel reformulated Dior's Fahrenheit perfume to remove lyral along with a few other ingredients and he is now working on the reformulation of about eight perfumes to make them meet new regulation.  ""Big brands tell me: replace this and that and make sure it smells the same and costs the same to produce,"" Roucel said.    (Editing by Janet McBride) "
141,"Jul 01, 2014 01:30AM ET",Food makers feel their way towards online future,nan,"By Martinne Geller PARIS (Reuters) - Grocery manufacturers are struggling to adapt to the online world and need to invest in smarter packaging, presentation and supply chains to reap the long term benefits. E-commerce accounts for just 3.7 percent of sales for fast-moving items like food, drinks and personal care products, market researcher Kantar Worldpanel says, forecasting a rise to 5 percent by 2016 as supermarkets develop their web sites and online only retailers like Amazon and Ocado take them on. Greater e-commerce could save money with more targeted marketing, including via social media, and lower product development costs, but industry insiders say manufacturers are put off innovation by the so-far small volumes of goods sold over the internet. At a recent meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) in Paris, Amazon Vice President of Consumables Doug Herrington berated them over the presentation of their goods, saying his firm had to photograph items to show their scale. ""This is a space you should have been a leader in and instead I find we have to innovate on your behalf,"" he said, noting items often arrived leaking or in unattractive bubble wrap. ""The first moment of truth for the customer is not what's on the site, it's what arrives at their home.""   UNPREPARED Most food makers remain ""seriously unprepared for online retailing,"" said Rabobank analyst John David Roeg saying they would have to expand their product assortments, since online shoppers are more likely to use search terms like ""organic yogurt"" or ""gluten-free bread"". Iglo Group, which hopes its Birds Eye frozen foods will generate 25 percent of sales online by 2017 from 10 percent now, said it was streamlining product names and information alongside testing promotions encouraging bulk purchases. ""If you have the wrong words at the beginning, someone who is accessing through a mobile (phone) might just see 'frozen pea' and have no idea what size pack it is, if it's peas and sweet corn, peas and carrots or just peas,"" general marketing manager Cheryl Calverley said. ""It's a really new market though, so everyone's trying new things,"" she told Reuters. Some manufacturers are toying with their own ecommerce sites but only in niche areas, with firms like L'Oreal, Nestle and Procter & Gamble selling small amounts of cosmetics, coffee, chocolate and shampoo directly. Nestle's Nespresso coffee brand is unusual in that it gets 60 percent of its sales from its own websites, but the company said the plan was not to bypass retailers. The world's largest food maker, which gets about 3 to 4 percent of its sales online, says it has created ad hoc online product name and descriptions, advanced images and how-to videos that link to retailers' websites but was proceeding cautiously. ""We know that we have to engage with players that are going to set these platforms up,"" Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said in an interview. ""Because of our success and history, that could be a liability - because you hold on to what you know."" Asked about bespoke products or packaging, Nestle cited its Gerber brand as an example of how ""the online space requires ad hoc packaging"" with an infant formula package available just on Amazon.  WINNERS AND LOSERS An online migration would ultimately lead to better consumer data and therefore less product inventory throughout the supply chain, Roeg said, reducing working capital and new product development costs by allowing for small, targeted trials.  Fabio Vacirca, global managing director of Accenture's consumer goods & services practice, also said margins would improve, despite a wider offering. ""A digital shelf is virtually infinite, so we will probably see more (product) complexity."" But cheaper digital marketing, unlimited shelf space and the elimination of slotting fees paid to retailers could narrow the gap between them and start-ups that appeal to younger consumers. Analysts from Bernstein Research warn this could ultimately eat into the earnings power of companies like Campbell Soup and ConAgra Foods. And while makers of frozen foods like Iglo, Nestle and Unilever could gain from the convenience of home delivery, candy makers such as Mars and Mondelez International could suffer as online shoppers resist impulse buys.   HIGH END VS MASS MARKET L'Oreal, which has an e-shop, recently named a chief digital officer to help it grow online, especially in China where online could soon reach 10 percent of sales of its mass-market products. Overall, online is still less than 2 percent, CEO Jean-Paul Agon told Reuters.  Heineken last year launched ""the Sub,"" an at-home beer dispenser for which refill ""torps"" can be ordered from a Heineken website, and in January spirits company Pernod Ricard unveiled a concept called ""Project Gutenberg"" that would let consumers replenish their spirits online. While such sites provide valuable data, the high cost of shipping is a deterrent for most packaged goods unless an air of exclusivity or community affords them higher prices.  ""Nespresso is an aspirational product. Whey protein is an aspirational product. Bananas are not,"" said Berenberg Bank analyst Fintan Ryan.  That does not mean inexpensive products cannot thrive online. According to CheckoutSmart, a provider of digital grocery rewards, Coca-Cola is the top online grocery brand in the UK, accounting for 97 pence of every 100 pounds spent in UK online groceries over the last year.  The world's top soft-drink maker has made a big digital push, including on Facebook, where its French unit last year ran a campaign to lift sales that Facebook said earned it 2.74 euros for every 1 euro it spent. By targeting ads to big spenders, Facebook says an identical household reach would drive 2.3 times more sales than television. Its global head of consumer packaged goods strategy, Erin Hunter, says online marketing driving both online and offline sales helps traditional companies make the transition to a new era. ""That change doesn't have to be as complex and scary,"" she said. ($1 = 0.7331 Euros)    (Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Philippa Fletcher) "
