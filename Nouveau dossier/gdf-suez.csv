6,"May 22, 2019 05:03AM ET","StockBeat: Engie, EDP Play Catch-Up in Energy's Big Growth Sector",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Europe’s electricity giants have had a hard time moving beyond fossil and nuclear fuels into renewables, but the continent’s climate policy agenda leaves them no choice.That explains, in part, the announcement by France’s Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Portugal’s EDP (LS:EDP), two of Europe’s old-style legacy incumbents, to team up in the fast-growing sector of offshore wind.The two said on Monday they intend to have up to 7 gigawatts of installed capacity – the equivalent of eight or nine old-style gas or coal-fired generation plants - operating by 2025, with another 5 to 10 gigawatts at an advanced stage of development. They have cooperated at a project level already since 2013, and already have 5.5 GW in construction or under development, but that is still a hefty expansion plan.The logic of the deal seems clear enough, although it may be a slow burner in terms of value creation. EDP’s stock rose 1% on Tuesday and is up another 0.2% today. Engie’s would have been up a similar amount had it not gone ex-dividend.Europe’s bourses are in mixed spirits Wednesday, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax is flat and the U.K. FTSE 100 up 0.4% largely due to sterling weakness.Their aim is to become the second-largest wind farm developers in the world behind Denmark’s Oersted (CO:ORSTED), and leap-frogging Spain’s  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE). Orsted has been one of the biggest stock market successes in Europe of recent years, up more than 125% since its IPO in June 2016, skilfully exploiting a sector where government subsidies and market dynamics are in constant flux.Iberdrola has needed longer to take off but its stock has risen 35% since October. Conspicuously, both of those stocks have been immune to the general increase in market volatility in the last eight months.Both EDP and Engie could do with a little bit of Orsted/Iberdrola magic.EDP is looking to move beyond the collapse of a takeover attempt by China Three Gorges, a state-controlled generator. Its stock lost some 15% from the start of April as that episode unravelled.Engie investors, meanwhile, have yet to buy into CEO Isabelle Kocher’s plans to streamline the sprawling business, although she made a promising start in February by promising to get out of 20 of its 70 markets. It has a headache with its investment in the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has landed it in the U.S. administration’s crosshairs. The U.S. confirmed on Monday that it is preparing new sanctions against the Russian-controlled pipeline, in which Engie has a 10% stake."

11,"May 06, 2019 04:17AM ET",StockBeat: Markets Tumble on Trump's China Threats,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Stocks are in retreat all across Europe on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump reignited fears of an all-out trade war between the U.S. and China.At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 5.34 points, or 1.4% at 385.02The French CAC 40 was the worst affected, losing 2.0%, while the German DAX was down 1.7%. The U.K. FTSE was closed due a public holiday.They’re all following the Chinese market, which had its worst one-day loss in three years after Trump revived threats of raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, as well as threatening to levy 25% tariffs on $325 billion more in Chinese goods previously unaffected by the dispute.Trump’s threats represent a serious and surprising blow to market morale, after weeks of guidance from both U.S. and Chinese officials that an agreement on trade between the two countries was likely. They came only 48 hours after the monthly U.S. employment report showed the U.S. economy still performing well, adding more jobs than expected without any noticeable pick-up in inflation.The U.S.-China angle is overshadowing domestic news. There was little reaction to the release of IHS Markit's Eurozone composite purchasing managers index, which showed that activity picked up marginally in April.Stocks sensitive to global trade are among the worst losers, with German chemicals company BASF (DE:BASFN) down over 7% (that's also due in part to its going ex-dividend) and French auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) down 4%. The big French and German automakers are all down, as is steelmaker ArcelorMittal, which announced sharp but notionally temporary cutbacks in European steel production earlier, citing the weak economic outlook, along with high electricity and carbon costs.And the resilient ones? Utilities are performing well, with Spain’s  Endesa  (MC:ELE) and  Red Electrica  (MC:REE), France’s Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Germany’s  E.On  (DE:EONGn) all outperforming local indices."

25,"Jan 17, 2019 01:45PM ET",Germany should stick to Nord Stream 2 project: MSC chairman,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should finish the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline despite U.S. opposition and growing domestic concerns, but future energy projects should be coordinated by the European Union, a veteran German diplomat said on Thursday.Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, said the initial ""birth defect"" of the $11 billion project was the fact that European treaties had allowed the German government to deem the project as purely commercial.In fact, he told reporters, it was clear that such a large project clearly had a political nature, particularly given Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and other actions in recent years.The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, has been criticized in some quarters because it would deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees, potentially making Kiev more vulnerable in the future.Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea, but both countries have a common interest in the pipeline, which will double capacity of the current route.Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) is building the project jointly with Western partners Uniper (DE:UN01), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Engie (PA:ENGIE), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Shell (AS:RDSa). Ischinger cautioned against abandoning the project as it neared its completion date of late 2019, citing German foreign policy's focus on consistency and sustainability. ""Saying 'forget it' now would not be good German foreign policy.""The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, drew fire this week for telling German companies involved in the project that they could face sanctions if they continued with the plan that is already far advanced.Germany says U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A German diplomat said the ambassador's approach did not correspond to common diplomatic practice and that Berlin would address the issue in direct talks with officials in Washington.An Uniper spokesman declined to comment while no immediate reaction was available from Wintershall.Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route.German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which was first to report on the letter, said that Grenell was trying to blackmail German companies with the letter. The U.S. Embassy denied this.""The only thing that could be considered blackmail in this situation would be the Kremlin having leverage over future gas supplies,"" the embassy spokesman said.The letter was coordinated in Washington by several U.S. government agencies and ""is not meant to be a threat but a clear message of U.S. policy"", the spokesman added.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday that any U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute and that questions of European energy policy had to be decided in Europe, not in the United States.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route from next year.""I was never a great supporter of Nord Stream 2,"" Oettinger, the EU's budget commissioner, told German magazine Der Spiegel. ""But the truth is the pipeline has long been under construction and can no longer so easily be stopped.""He added: ""Trump's threats are no reason for that.""Germany refuses to join opposition to the project from many EU states and - thus far - from the EU executive, describing it as a private enterprise.Washington is concerned that the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenue and says Moscow is using the project to divide Europe.Ukraine derives up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) from transit charges.Construction of the project is progressing.Oettinger, a German, pressed Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP), which is leading the project, to agree ""a fair deal on the further use of the existing pipelines through Ukraine"".Gazprom is the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering half of the 9.5 billion euro ($10.89 billion) construction cost. Gazprom's European partners are Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Anglo-Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV).($1 = 0.8720 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Dec 16, 2018 01:55PM ET",France asks Engie to take hedging positions over gas price freeze,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government said on Sunday it had asked utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) to take hedging positions to ensure gas prices do not rise until June next year.Unlike power prices, which typically move once a year, gas prices move every month in France and are set using a formula that takes into account production costs. Many French governments have postponed tariff increases to protect consumers and their own approval ratings in the past, but legally the government has no authority to set prices.Earlier this month, the government suspended increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent public protests against President Emmanuel Macron's policies and said it would keep gas and power prices unchanged this winter.The environment ministry said on Sunday it wanted to ensure Engie's gas prices do not change until June 2019 but gave no explanation on the new timeframe of the requested price freeze.Officials at the environment ministry were not immediately available to comment.""Engie has taken notice of the government's request and will realize the necessary operations in order to guarantee the stability of the regulated tariffs of natural gas until the end of June,"" Engie said in an emailed statement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""And while I view this development as positively significant in the broader context, a trade war is far from over, and these are little more than a preliminary step in what should be a long and winding road fraught with peril,"" he added.France's CAC 40 was up 0.8 percent after French president Emmanuel Macron pledged late on Monday to raise the minimum wage and cut taxes in a bid to prevent more violent protests that have rocked the euro zone's second largest economy. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was up 0.4 percent with the pound stabilizing after Monday's Brexit-related slide to 20-month lows and Prime Minister Theresa May's postponement of a key vote on how Britain will leave the European Union. ""The fact that markets are actually moving forward shows that investors are perhaps scouting around for bargains amid this year’s turmoil rather than sitting on their hands in fear"", commented Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Smaller companies in the UK-focused FTSE 250 (FTMC) were flat. Among top performers was British advertising giant WPP (L:WPP), which rose 4.9 percent after announcing plans to spend 300 million pounds and cut 2,500 jobs - part of new boss Mark Read's plans to return the world's biggest advertising group to growth.Shares in Ashtead (L:AHT) jumped 6.4 percent as the equipment rental firm said it expected full-year results ahead of expectations.In Germany,  Linde  (DE:LING) rose 2.7 percent after news that shareholders would be offered an extra 1.22 euros to help complete a merger with U.S. rival Praxair (NYSE:PX). France's Suez (PA:SEVI) fell 3.2 percent as a source said the board of French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) decided to stick with its 32 percent stake in the utilities group. In Italy, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) was the best performer in Milan (FTMIB), up 3.1 percent after announcing it had agreed to sell up to 7.8 billion euros in bad loans along with a stake in its debt recovery business to Credito Fondiario and U.S. fund Elliott.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The law aims to make it faster and cheaper to register and wind down companies while also simplifying a complex system that imposes new regulations in multiple stages as firms increase their workforce.It includes incentives to make profit-sharing more common among small firms and encourage employees' voluntary contributions to all types of savings products.The bill also sets the stage for several large privatizations already flagged by the government, with the proceeds due to finance a new 10 billion euros ($11.49 billion)innovation fund.It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down stakes in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) while allowing the national lottery FDJ to be privatized.Some 361 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted in favor of the law while 84 were against and 103 abstained from voting. The bill now goes before the Senate for consideration in January before returning to the lower house for a final vote. ($1 = 0.8706 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Sep 19, 2018 11:55AM ET","EU says McDonald's, Luxembourg tax deal not illegal",nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - McDonald's (N:MCD) avoided having to repay millions of euros in back taxes after EU antitrust regulators said that its tax deal with Luxembourg was not illegal, citing quirks in the Grand Duchy's bilateral tax treaty with the United States.The decision by the European Commission came after a three-year long investigation, part of its crackdown on illegal sweetheart deals between EU governments and multinationals that has resulted in Apple (O:AAPL), Starbucks (O:SBUX) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) paying billions of euros in back taxes.The Commission said McDonald's tax deal was in line with national tax laws and the Luxembourg-U.S. double taxation treaty.""Our in-depth investigation has shown that the reason for double non-taxation in this case is a mismatch between Luxembourg and U.S. tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg. Therefore, Luxembourg did not break EU state aid rules,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.""Of course, the fact remains that McDonald's did not pay any taxes on these profits – and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view,"" she said.The investigation had focused on McDonald's Luxembourg-based subsidiary Europe Franchising which receives royalties from franchisees in Europe, Ukraine and Russia.Luxembourg in a 2009 tax ruling said the company did not have to pay corporate taxes as its profits would be taxed in the United States. In a second tax ruling, the Grand Duchy said that the company was no longer required to prove that its royalty income was subject to U.S. taxation.""HAPPY MEAL""The Commission said 70 companies benefited from the bilateral tax treaty but were not being investigated. In June this year, Luxembourg presented draft legislation to avoid double non-taxation. Luxembourg said in a statement that it welcomed the Commission's recognition of the steps it had taken to avoid similar cases in future. It had been ordered to claw back millions from Engie (PA:ENGIE), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Fiat (MI:FCHA) in the last three years.""We pay the taxes that are owed and, from 2013-2017, McDonald’s companies paid more than $3 billion just in corporate income taxes in the European Union with an average tax rate approaching 29 percent,"" McDonald's said. ""We will continue to invest in Europe and expect to create 50,000 new jobs over the next four years.""Sven Giegold, a Greens lawmaker at the European Parliament who has been pushing for more action to tackle tax loopholes, criticized the EU decision. ""Luxembourg and other EU countries are serving McDonald´s a happy meal with tax loopholes, and taxpayers must pay the bill,"" said Giegold.The ruling is a recognition by enforcers that they cannot make unlimited use of their state aid powers on taxation issues, said Natura Garcia, a partner at law firm Linklaters.""This is a welcome development given the wider context of other state aid investigations into tax rulings and will give some comfort to companies which have obtained similar tax rulings in Luxembourg or elsewhere in the EU,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

85,"Aug 02, 2018 09:31AM ET",Run your dishwasher when the sun shines: dynamic power pricing grows,nan,"By Geert De ClercqPARIS (Reuters) - One day, the weather could drive your domestic schedule. Your dishwasher springs to life at the windiest time of day. The washing machine starts spinning when the sun beats down.In such scenarios, algorithms in smart appliances automatically respond to price drops on wholesale spot markets caused by higher supplies of wind and solar power, saving households money and balancing the electricity market.This may be many years away, but it is the future envisioned by the European Union, which wants to make the electricity system more efficient as the continent switches from predictable fossil-fuel power generation to intermittent renewables.Most utilities have long offered cheaper night-time tariffs, but new EU rules expected in 2020 will require them to provide more flexible options that encourage customers to use power during sunny or windy periods, at varied times of day or when businesses are shut at weekends.These kind of flexible ""dynamic pricing"" contracts are already widely offered in Spain and Scandinavia. But utilities in some of the biggest European markets like Britain and France are now beginning to follow suit in a shift that analysts say could disrupt the continent's electricity retailing industry.The nascent drive is enabled by the mass rollout of smart meters, which can precisely record energy usage patterns.""From now on, consumers in Europe will be able to seize more spot market opportunities as the rise of renewable power and the availability of smart meters and internet-connected appliances boost dynamic pricing,"" said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group CEO of consultancy Accenture Resources.Newer, smaller players are offering the most experimental tariffs, selling power in hourly or even half-hourly slots tied to wholesale spot prices. The big, traditional utilities like EDF (PA:EDF) and  Centrica  (L:CNA) are responding more gradually by offering variable time-pricing options.Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, director Internal Energy Market at the European Commission, the EU's executive, says variable pricing could cut power bills for a household by up to 400 euros ($470) a year.It is early days in Europe, and in other developed power markets such as the United States and Australia. Utilities largely sell at fixed prices, regardless of wholesale swings or time of usage, and dynamic pricing accounts for a fraction of the market - but it is growing.The number of customers on dynamic pricing rates globally is expected to rise from 4.5 million in 2018 to 75 million by 2025, of which 15 million will be in Europe, according to Navigant Research analyst Brett Feldman.Experts say automation will be crucial for take-up.The proportion of households with smart appliances is expected to rise to about 10.6 percent globally by 2022 from 3.5 percent now, according to market data provider Statista.""Convenience is key,"" Ollagnier said. ""Users want to be able to 'set and forget' smart rules for their appliances.""The Commission agrees. ""To enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities, they must have access to fit-for-purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices,"" it said in a policy document.An anticipated surge in electric vehicle usage will also bolster uptake of flexible pricing tariffs, analysts say.STARTUPS LEAD WAYBritish startup Octopus Energy in March launched an ""Agile"" tariff which sells power in 30-minute slots tied to wholesale spot prices. It also sends SMS alerts when prices turn negative and customers get paid for taking excess power off the grid, which happens a few times a year on sunny and windy days.The two-year-old company, whose UK market share is about 1 percent, has limited the experimental tariff to 500 of its more than 200,000 residential customers. ""We hit that limit quickly and are now assessing the impact before expanding further, which we expect to do next year,"" CEO Greg Jackson said.Octopus told Reuters it was working with electronics companies including Samsung (KS:005930) to allow its software to communicate with smart household appliances so that they can switch on automatically at the cheapest time.The company said a family on its Agile tariff could have saved 210 pounds ($275) over the last 12 months compared with average British fixed-rate prices.Green Energy UK, another small player, is offering contracts with varying ""time-of-day"" rates for residential customers, ranging on weekdays from 5 pence per kilowatt hour to 20 pence.In France, Engie (PA:ENGIE), which has 4 million customers, has also started offering flexible pricing deals including 30 percent weekend discounts and, for electric vehicle owners, a 50 percent discount for nighttime charging.Engie's retail chief Augustin Honorat declined to detail how many customers have flexible tariffs. ""It is a success, as the offers are among our best-sellers,"" he said.The flexible contracts offered by new players are prompting traditional utilities to offer their own options, analysts say.French market leader EDF, for example, has launched offers with 30 to 40 percent tariff discounts for weekend use and a tariff that offers varying rates for each eight-hour period of the day. EDF marketing director Gregory Trannoy said the new offers were ""growing quickly"" but declined to give numbers.Oliver Wyman consultant Keric Morris said dynamic pricing was a big operational challenge for traditional utilities.""It is much more difficult for an incumbent with all its legacy systems, than for a nimble start-up,"" he said.SPANISH CASE STUDYThe European Commission's Nov. 2016 Clean Energy Package aims to force all utilities to offer customers smart meters and a dynamic price contract linked to spot market prices. The rules are being negotiated with the EU Parliament and member states this year, with a target for implementation from 2020.That may be overly ambitious; several EU states do not yet have the smart meters required for flexible pricing, notably major power market Germany.The case of Spain gives an idea of the potential of dynamic pricing - as well as the possible obstacles.Spain decreed in 2014 that utilities had to offer dynamic pricing contracts as the default regulated offer. All Spanish utilities now offer contracts linked to hourly spot prices on the OMIE exchange and with utilities' margins set by regulation.The European Commission estimates that in Spain - where 28 million smart meters were installed end 2017 - about 40 percent of power users have some form dynamic pricing.However, Pedro Gonzalez, head of regulation at Spanish utilities association Unesa, told Reuters that this is down from about 60 percent four year ago.Despite the fact that power is slightly cheaper on dynamic contracts, their number has fallen as customers switch to fixed-price contracts because they want the peace of mind of not being exposed to fluctuating wholesale prices.""Surprisingly, despite the fact that average dynamic prices should be lower, many people want to avoid risk and prefer to pay a fixed amount per month,"" Gonzalez said.He said the number of people on dynamic pricing contracts has been stable over the past year, and that in recent months utilities have started offering intermediate options such as varying rates for different blocks of the day.In the Nordics, many utilities offer dynamic pricing, though uptake ranges from about 30 percent in the tiny but highly digital Baltic country Estonia to 10 percent in Finland and a few percent in Sweden and Norway, according to EU data.Industry specialists say much will depend on to what extent the European Commission's proposal on dynamic pricing is accepted, but all agree the higher the share of renewables in total generation, the bigger the pressure will become to make demand more flexible.Octopus Energy's Jackson said mass rollout of smart meters could ultimately lead to a sophisticated form of congestion pricing, with supply and demand increasingly driving prices.""On trains and airlines, the first seats are very cheap, the last ones very expensive,"" he said. ""The electricity market will end up like that too."""

Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices.""Toshiba has pursued a sale of NuGen to KEPCO and the prolonged time it has taken reach a conclusion has required NuGen to undertake a review,"" a spokesman for NuGen said.""As such additional options are being pursued for NuGen's future direction to deliver the next generation of nuclear new build in the UK,"" he said.NuGen has around 60 direct employees, mostly based in Manchester, while the roles of around 40 contractors would also be placed under a 30 day consultation period later this week, the spokesman added.Britain's government has yet to announce any kind of deal for the NuGen project.""We continue to engage with new build developers, though the detail of these discussions is commercially confidential,"" a spokeswoman for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said.Another plant, to be built by a unit of Japan's Hitachi Ltd (T:6501), has also struggled to find funding, leading the British government to consider direct investment. However, EDF's (PA:EDF) Hinkley Point C will be the first new nuclear plant built in the country in more than twenty years after securing additional backing from the French government, investment from China General Nuclear Power Corp, and a long-term power price guarantee from Britain.The government has been criticised for being too generous in the terms it has set for this deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

96,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."

Fiat and Luxembourg are challenging the ruling at the General Court, Europe's second-highest.Fiat complied with all the rules and was transparent in its dealings with the Luxembourg tax authority and yet it was punished, its lawyer Juan Rodriguez told a panel of five judges.""Fiat feels like it's been penalized by the Commission. Let there be no doubt, the Commission is trying to make new law in this case,"" Rodriguez said.""The Commission acted as a supranational tax authority even as a supernatural tax authority,"" he said, adding the EU executive did not have the remit to do so. Luxembourg, which on Wednesday was ordered to recover 120 million euros in back taxes from French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE), marking the third case against the Grand Duchy, said the Commission was over-reaching its regulatory power.""This strikes at the heart of member states' sovereignty,"" its lawyer Denis Waelbroeck told the court.""We are here to put a stop to the arbitrary nature of this. We need to avoid the Commission merely imposing its ideas on the case that comes along without having the legal basis,"" he said.Ireland, told to claw back a record 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL), also took to the stand to criticize the EU regulator.""The Commission has made the same erroneous arguments in the Apple case,"" its lawyer Paul Gallagher told the court. He said the EU executive was trying to use state aid laws to harmonize the patchwork of national tax regimes across the bloc and extend its competence in an impermissible way.Commission lawyer Bruno Stromsky said it was clear that Fiat enjoyed an unfair tax advantage.""There is a flagrant discrimination of equality in taxation, to the detriment of other companies that pay taxes in Luxembourg,"" he said. ""The Commission has not meddled, has not intruded on the tax system in place determined by national sovereigns,"" Stromsky said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

103,"Jun 18, 2018 01:10PM ET",France's Macron sets out corporate law shake-up in reform bill,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's finance minister promised to cut red tape on companies, open up more financing for them and create incentives for employee profit-sharing under a new bill presented on Monday.The proposed law is part of President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business reform drive that has already eased labor laws and cut companies' and entrepreneurs' taxes.""The law's ultimate objective is more growth and the creation of a new French economic growth model,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters.Le Maire said that by 2025 the overhaul of French corporate law was expected to boost overall gross domestic product by one percent over the long term.The new law aims to address one long-standing complaint from business owners about a complex system that imposes new charges in multiple stages as companies increase their workforce.The bill would simplify the system, Le Maire said, by halving the number of those stages to three - bringing in new charges and obligations when a company has 11, 50 and then 250 employees.It would also make it easier, cheaper and faster to register a company, giving entrepreneurs a single online platform to replace the current round of seven administrative bodies.Liquidation of insolvent companies will be sped up so business owners can move on and bankruptcy law will give more power to creditors who have a stake in seeing the firm survive, the minister added.The government aims to boost the more than 220 billion euros French people currently hold in long-term retirement savings, which it hopes will make more funds available to be invested in companies' capital.To do that, employees' voluntary contributions will largely be made tax-deductible for all types of savings products and they will be able to transfer savings from one money manager to another at no cost, potentially boosting competition, according to a statement on the bill.The government aims to make profit-sharing much more common in small companies by scrapping charges employers currently have to make on payouts to employees.Largely because of that measure, the new law is expected to cost the government 1.2 billion euros annually, which Le Maire said would be paid for by planned cuts in subsidies to companies.The law also sets the stage for several large privatizations with the proceeds already earmarked for a new 10 billion euro innovation fund.It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down stakes in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) while allowing the national lottery FDA to be privatized.While some left-wing and far-right politicians have said the sales amounted to selling the family jewels, Macron's party has a sufficiently large parliamentary majority to pass the bill with little trouble early next year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Investors continue to react to Friday's ramping of unwelcome US-China trade tensions,"" said Accendo Markets analysts Mike van Dulken and Artjom Hatsaturjants.The pan-European benchmark was on track to erase all the gains it made on Thursday when the ECB said interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019.Germany's DAX (GDAXI) declined 0.8 percent, underperforming the broader European market and weighed down by worries that a crisis over migration policy could destabilize Angela Merkel's three-month-old coalition government.Weighing the most on the German index were software maker SAP (DE:SAPG), industrial group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and sportswear maker Adidas (DE:ADSGn) , all down between 1 and 1.9 percent.France's Nexans fell 18.2 percent after the company warned that an ""abrupt deterioration"" of its high-voltage activities was likely to translate into lower profits for the full year.The warning also weighed on Italian rival  Prysmian  (MI:PRY), which fell 2.2 percent.French gas and power group Engie (PA:ENGIE) fell 2.2 percent after saying unscheduled outages at its Belgian nuclear reactors will have an impact of 250 million euros on its 2018 core and net profit.Elsewhere, deal-making activity drove stock moves.Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) rose 8.5 percent after Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said it was in contact with the Norwegian carrier over a possible combination. Norwegian is also the subject of bid interest from British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG). IAG gained 1.1 percent and Lufthansa shares declined 0.1 percent. Mid-sized bank Virgin Money (L:VM) rose as much as 2.5 percent after CYBG (L:CYBGC) agreed a 1.7 billion-pound, all-share deal to acquire its rival and create Britain's sixth-largest bank. While CYBG rose 0.1 percent, shares in Virgin Money pared gains to trade little changed.Aerospace supplier  Cobham  (L:COB) soared 5.5 percent after an upgrade to overweight from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

The Financial Times later quoted its sources as saying CTG was set to launch an all-cash offer for EDP.Expresso said the Portuguese government was unlikely to create obstacles to the potential takeover, but EDP would probably consider the offer hostile. EDP had no immediate comment. The company has a stock market capitalization of around 11.4 billion euros ($13.6 billion).China Three Gorges holds a 23 percent stake and Chinese state company CNIC holds nearly 5 percent, meaning that the Chinese state owns just over 28 percent in EDP. A compulsory takeover offer is required if the stake exceeds 33 percent.The suspension of EDP shares, which also encompassed EDP's wind power unit EDPR (LS:EDPR), was announced after the market close on Friday.EDP shares had closed 0.7 percent higher at 3.11 euros.Reports and rumors about EDP being an acquisition target of foreign companies have been circulating for months. Last month, following a news report that French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) was examining a possible bid, EDP denied the existence of any contact with Engie. There were reports last year that Spain's Gas Natural (MC:GAS) was seeking a merger with EDP, but the company denied there were any talks at the time.China Three Gorges has continued to raise its stake in EDP since reports of Gas Natural's interest.($1 = 0.8368 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

122,"Apr 19, 2018 12:20PM ET",European utilities retrench as cross-border deals lose appeal,nan,"By Geert De Clercq and Christoph SteitzPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European utility companies are retrenching in their home markets and looking to unwind debt-financed cross-border mergers deals as increasingly nationalist governments balk at foreign ownership of strategic power supplies.Hungary was one of the first European countries to turn against foreign ownership of utilities back in 2013 but there are growing signs that borders are springing up again in an industry that has struggled to make international deals pay off.Several European utilities were lining up to buy German utility RWE's (DE:RWEG) subsidiary Innogy (DE:IGY) but in March RWE and domestic rival E.ON (DE:EONGn) agreed to carve up the renewable energy firm themselves in an all-German deal.Then this week, French electricity retailer  Direct Energie  (PA:DIREN), the biggest independent challenger to market leader EDF (PA:EDF), went to French energy giant  Total  (PA:TOTF) in another all-domestic deal.""In a business as sovereign and strategic as utilities, it is hard to see major deals materializing in today's Europe,"" said a banker in Paris who has worked on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the utilities sector.Bankers say the German deal, hammered out within two months, was partly aimed at keeping Innogy's prized assets out of foreign hands and the backlash against foreign owners is now fuelling speculation some big cross-border deals may be unwound.EDF's Italian energy subsidiary Edison (MI:EDNn), the third-biggest power producer in Italy, is seen as a prime example of a legacy cross-border investment ripe for unwinding.Edison's oil and gas activities no longer fit EDF's low-carbon strategy and its prospects of winning retail market share from  Enel  (MI:ENEI), in which the Italian state has a 24 percent stake, look limited.""The Italians have never accepted that Edison is no longer Italian,"" said the Paris banker, adding that the firm's growth outlook in Italy would always be constrained by its French ownership.Sources told Reuters this month that Edison had selected banks to sell its oil and gas exploration and production division - joining other utility firms that have sold off hydrocarbon assets as they grapple with sluggish energy demand, low wholesale prices and a surge in cleaner, renewable energy.TAKEOVER WAVESpain's  Endesa  (MC:ELE) is another asset owned by a foreign utility seen as a potential candidate for resale. Italy's Enel, Europe's biggest utility, outbid E.ON for Endesa in 2007 during a spate of cross-border European utility mergers.While Enel, which owns 70.1 percent of Endesa, has denied it has plans to sell, its control has drawn criticism from Spanish politicians who say Endesa is not investing enough locally and pays too much in dividends to its owners.Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace acknowledged nationalism was having an impact on utilities M&A in Europe.""There is some but I don't think Europe's big countries can afford to be nationalistic because they would need really deep pockets to keep these companies off their markets,"" he told Reuters.Edison and EDF declined to comment.The spate of cross-border utility takeovers before and just after the 2008 financial crisis came as 10 countries joined the European Union in its biggest enlargement and European power companies saw a chance to become regional power giants.E.ON spent 11.5 billion euros ($14.2 billion) on foreign assets after losing the battle for Endesa, RWE bought Britain's npower, EDF bought Edison and British Energy [EDFBR.UL], France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) bought Britain's International Power , Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) bought Scottish Power and Sweden's Vattenfall (VATN.UL) bought Dutch Nuon Energy.But the collapse in wholesale power prices since has undermined many of these debt-fueled deals. Engie, E.ON and Vattenfall alone have written a combined 34 billion euros at least off the value of their international acquisitions.'A VERY NATIONAL BUSINESS'Now, not much of the cross-border deal euphoria is left.With nationalists in power in Hungary, Poland and Austria, and right-wing parties on the rise in other large European countries, utilities are feeling a backlash against the internationalization they embraced a decade earlier.""This is still a very national business,"" said a senior banker who worked on the Innogy deal. ""The most difficult situations in a big transaction are those that involve players from different countries.""While potential foreign ownership had not become a political issue ahead of the Innogy deal, German politicians publicly opposed attempts by China State Grid Corp [STGRD.UL] to buy a stake in German grid operator 50Hertz from Australian fund IFM.A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that German officials had encouraged Belgium's Elia (BR:ELI) - the leading shareholding in 50Hertz - to increase its stake rather than let State Grid buy it.The first moves against international ownership of utilities came in Hungary, where right-wing populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in 2013 the state would seek to buy back Hungarian assets of E.ON, RWE, EDF, Engie and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI).Since then, Orban has imposed sharp cuts in energy prices, making mostly foreign-owned firms foot the bill, and several foreign utilities have sold their operations to the state.In Poland, EDF and Engie felt the sting of nationalist energy policies in 2016 when the ruling Law and Justice party put assets owned by French utilities on a list of firms deemed important for energy security, to block their potential sale.EDF, which had been in talks with Czech firm EPH and IFM about selling its assets in Poland, was ultimately forced to sell to Polish state-run firms.""Has there ever been a big value-creating cross-border M&A deal in the utility world? I would have to think very hard to find an answer,"" said an M&A banker based in Frankfurt, who has worked on German and European sector deals.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The chatter over the weekend appeared to suggest some optimism that some form of deal would likely be the probable outcome, though how long that could take to pan out remains a significant unknown, and as such further volatility seems likely"", said CMC Markets' Michael Hewson.The situation in Syria, after President Donald Trump warned of a ""big price to pay"" for dozens of people killed by poison gas in a rebel-held town, was not impacting confidence.The fact that U.S. futures were pointing to Wall Street opening in positive territory was supporting European bourses, analysts said. Financial stocks contributed the most to the rise with  Deutsche Bank  (DBKGn.DE) up 3.2 percent after it named a new CEO who said tough decisions would have to be made and the structure of its investment bank reviewed.Another top mover was Portuguese energy and utility group EDP (LS:EDP), up 5.3 percent after a report French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) was examining a possible bid.

136,"Mar 11, 2018 02:33PM ET","RWE, E.ON reshape German power sector in Innogy asset swap deal",nan,"By Christoph Steitz and Tom KäckenhoffESSEN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany's top utilities on Sunday announced plans to break up Innogy (DE:IGY), whose assets will be divided among parent RWE (DE:RWED) and rival E.ON (DE:EONGN) in the sector's biggest overhaul since a landmark move to exit nuclear power.The deal, which includes E.ON making a 5.2 billion euro ($6.4 billion) takeover offer to Innogy's minority shareholders, spells the end of the network, renewables and retail energy group, carved out from RWE two years ago, as a standalone unit.Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to abandon nuclear power after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 has forced the sector to radically restructure in order to survive and already caused major plant shutdowns and billions of euros of losses.Peter Altmaier, the next economy minister and a close ally of Merkel, said the deal was a consequence of that shift, known as the ""Energiewende"" in German. The companies had to adapt, he told the Rheinische Post newspaper.Through the deal, which includes a share issue and asset swaps, E.ON will acquire Innogy's prized regulated energy networks and customer operations, while RWE will take on the renewables businesses of both E.ON and Innogy.That would position RWE, which relies heavily on coal and gas-fired power plants, as a champion of the shift away from fossil fuels towards a more sustainable mix of energy sources. RWE kept 76.8 percent of Innogy after the 2016 carve-out.ADVANTAGEOUS STEPA source involved in the deal said it would be slightly more beneficial to E.ON, which would become a bigger regulated business by adding more networks, while RWE would end up owning interests in the riskier and more competitive renewables sector.The source said that E.ON had been in a better bargaining position after RWE shopped Innogy to other European rivals, including France's Engie (PA:ENGIE), Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE), without striking a deal.""This looks like an advantageous step for E.ON at first glance,"" said Thomas Deser, fund manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in E.ON, RWE and Innogy.""Through the renewable pipeline, RWE, too, should be able to offset its dwindling nuclear and lignite business as well as attract partners for the expansion of its wind business.""The all-German transaction comes less than two years after E.ON and RWE both split up their businesses to separate legacy fossil fuel power plants from more promising networks and renewable assets.E.ON in January agreed to sell a remaining 46.65 percent stake in its power plant and trading unit Uniper (DE:UN01), which it spun off in 2016, to Finland's  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM), a deal expected to close later this year.The RWE-E.ON swap will also hand RWE - Germany's biggest electricity producer - a 16.67 percent stake in E.ON by way of a 20 percent capital increase. RWE will pay another 1.5 billion euros to E.ON to close a valuation gap that results from the complex structure of the asset swaps.The transactions, which still require approval from the company's boards, face scrutiny by European Union regulators as well as from Germany's Federal Cartel Office, which did not respond to an emailed request for comment.The European Commission declined to comment.Innogy has been in turmoil since Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December in the wake of a profit warning and Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther fell victim to a recent acid attack.M&A TARGETInnogy has been the target of persistent takeover talk, with sources saying recently that RWE had talked to Engie and Italy's Enel about a possible asset-swap deal. Other firms linked to Innogy included Iberdrola and Australian bank Macquarie (AX:MQG), an acquisitive infrastructure investor.Innogy reports its annual results on Monday, while RWE does so on Tuesday and E.ON on Wednesday. The supervisory boards of both RWE and E.ON were due to meet on Sunday to review the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.RWE's municipal shareholders, VkA, which jointly hold about 23 percent in the group, were caught off-guard by the announcement and said the plans would have to be thoroughly examined.If approved, the deal could result in synergies of about 500 million euros, analysts at Bernstein estimate, pointing to double-staffing on the customer support side.Labour sources welcomed the plans, saying that each company individually was unable to fund the networks, renewables and customer business in an adequate ways, but added talks about job protection would be a key demand.Under the proposed transaction, E.ON would make a voluntary cash offer to buy RWE's Innogy stake valued at 40.00 euros per share, E.ON said in a filing issued early on Sunday. Innogy shares closed at 34.53 euros on Friday.This price includes an offer of 36.76 euros per share plus assumed dividends of Innogy for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 in the total aggregate amount of 3.24 euros per share, E.ON said. RWE will not participate in the offer.E.ON also agreed to transfer most of its renewables business to RWE, including minority interests currently held by E.ON's subsidiary PreussenElektra in the RWE-operated nuclear power plants Emsland and Gundremmingen.RWE in turn, will receive Innogy's renewables and gas storage business as well as Innogy's stake in Austrian energy supplier Kelag [KELAG.UL], E.ON said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I want France to become the reference partner of the 21st century.""The 40-year-old president, who is traveling with a delegation of French companies that includes EDF (PA:EDF), Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and Suez (PA:SEVI), will also inaugurate a solar plant built by Engie (PA:ENGIE) in Uttar Pradesh.""I think India has to operate much more with Europe and the European Union as a whole. I want France to be its entry point,"" Macron said.""I want your creativity, your entrepreneurship, your young people to be much more present in France. Much more known and recognized. And I want to see the same from the French side.""India was the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into Britain in 2015, contributing to its position as Europe's top destination for foreign direct investment, according to official British figures. By comparison, India was only the 30th largest investor in France, according to 2013 Bank of France figures. Among recent wins for France is India's purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in 2016. It beat out the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is built by a European consortium that includes Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES).But talks to sell six new-generation EPR nuclear reactors built by state utility EDF and Areva have dragged on.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The question is not taboo.""He declined to indicate the timetable for asset sales and did not mention any companies.Last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government would detail its asset sale program in early 2018, while the head of APE, which manages the state's corporate holdings, said the government had yet to make any decision over whether to privatize ADP.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Member states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.The Commission said the first tax ruling, which covered 2006 to 2011, resulted in a significant part of Inter Ikea Systems' franchise profits shifting to a Luxembourg unit where it was not taxed.A 2011 ruling, brought in after the Commission declared the first deal illegal, allowed a substantial part of the company's franchise profits after 2011 to be transferred to its Liechtenstein parent.Inter Ikea said it and Inter Ikea Systems were committed to paying tax in line with the laws of the countries in which they operate and it believed that the way it had been taxed was in accordance with EU rules.Fast food chain McDonald’s (N:MCD) and French energy company Engie (PA:ENGIE) are also in the EU crosshairs over their Luxembourg tax deals.The Commission has to date ordered Apple (O:AAPL) to pay a record amount of back taxes up to 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) to Ireland, Starbucks (O:SBUX) up to 30 million euros to the Netherlands and Amazon (O:AMZN) 250 million euros to Luxembourg.Belgium has been told to recover a total of 700 million euros from 35 firms, among them  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI),  BP  (L:BP) and BASF (DE:BASFn) because of an illegal tax scheme.Last month the Commission launched an investigation into a British tax exemption for multinational companies set up in 2013 by the then-Conservative-led government to attract companies to set up headquarters in Britain.

157,"Dec 14, 2017 06:54PM ET",Airbus planemaking chief Bregier to leave in February: sources,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier plans to leave the aerospace group after the board intervened to resolve tensions over the future succession to Chief Executive Tom Enders, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Bregier will be replaced in February at the helm of the main planemaking division by Guillaume Faury, the 49-year-old head of Airbus Helicopters, who is not, however, expected to inherit Bregier's broader title as chief operating officer, they added.Airbus declined to comment.The shake-up, to be announced before markets open on Friday, was agreed at a board meeting on Thursday following weeks of tensions inside Europe's largest aerospace group.It comes a day after a source told Reuters a change of governance could not be excluded before end-year.On Wednesday, Bregier said he was ""surprised"" by reports that his position was under threat and said his sole priority was to ensure Airbus met targets. Bregier, 56, is credited with stabilizing industrial problems at the world's second largest planemaker and is in charge of delivering on a record order backlog that underpins near-record share prices. He also oversaw a key sale to Japan and negotiated a recent deal to rescue an order from Qatar.Despite a long-running personal rivalry, Bregier was long assumed to be the heir apparent to Enders, whose own future in Airbus is uncertain amid indications that he has changed his mind about seeking a third mandate beyond 2019.But following a board-commissioned review of potential candidates and a spike in management tensions, Bregier's long-awaited promotion appeared to be in question and the usually cautious engineer appeared frustrated, two insiders said.Others saw a more deliberate move by Enders to oust BregierCHANGING OF GUARDTensions between the two men came to a head this year in a row over who should control the powerful jet sales department, first reported by Reuters. But the fate of the two executives, long seen as the power duo in European aviation, is said by many to be intertwined.""This is the first step in the changing of the guard at Airbus: Bregier leaving must also signal the beginning of the end for Enders,"" an industry source said.In the shorter term, it may be seen as a respite for Enders, whose position had been weakened by media coverage and the departure of unpopular former technology chief Paul Eremenko.Bregier could not be reached for comment. He has been linked with energy firm Engie, where he is on the board (PA:ENGIE). His departure comes as Airbus braces for the retirement of sales boss John Leahy, who bookended his career on Thursday with the sale of 100 jets to Delta, 31 years after his first deal to sell 100 to what is now part of the same airline.The management row has played out in a febrile climate caused by international fraud investigations over commercial and military sales and fears of a slew of further departures.Two sources said Frenchman Bregier had sought support from the French government, mirroring recent backing from Berlin for German-born Enders, or appealed to Airbus' French chairman, Denis Ranque.The Airbus board has been under pressure to demonstrate its independence following a backlash in France over the handling of a compliance crackdown. Recent turmoil has tested a 2013 deal to tame the influence of European governments, one of whose authors, Emmanuel Macron, is now France's president.A spokesman for the French government, which like the German government owns 11 percent of Airbus, declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

159,"Dec 13, 2017 08:53AM ET","Exclusive: After Grenfell fire, same builders rehired to replace dangerous cladding, Reuters finds",nan,"By Tom BerginLONDON (Reuters) - Some building companies that installed dangerous cladding on social housing blocks across Britain are now winning new contracts following the Grenfell Tower blaze to remove their original work and install panels that can pass safety tests, a Reuters review shows.The safety of high-rise buildings has come under scrutiny since the Grenfell disaster in June which killed 71 people. The British government, which ordered a series of tests to establish which types of cladding panels met fire safety rules, said those on the London tower block did not comply.A Reuters review identified 65 other towers with cladding of a type that was approved by local building inspectors, but which government tests found did not comply with the statutory regulations. The towers were clad by major builders including French groups Engie (PA:ENGIE) and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), and Britain's  Galliford Try  (L:GFRD), Forrest, Wates Group, Rydon Group and Willmott Dixon. The Reuters review was based on publicly available building planning permission documents, which detail the work carried out and the materials used, as well as visits to the towers and statements from housing providers and builders. For 29 of the buildings, the same builders that installed the cladding have won new contracts to remove or replace the panels, according to the owners of the buildings, who said they were paying millions of pounds for the work. The rehired companies are Willmott Dixon, Wates and Engie. Willmott Dixon and Rydon said their cladding work complied with safety regulations, but did not say how. Wates, Bouygues, Galliford Try and Engie declined to answer questions on whether their work complied with regulations.""Following the Grenfell tragedy, we have been supporting the relevant councils, and removed the cladding where requested. Our primary concern is to ensure all residents in these buildings are secure and safe,"" said an Engie spokesman.In the wake of Grenfell, the government ordered an independent review into building regulations and fire safety, and the way the rules are complied with and enforced. The review is due to report its findings early next year. The 65 towers in question are owned by local governments - known as councils - or housing associations, which are publicly funded, non-profit bodies that provide housing intended for low-income people. At the time all the panels were installed, building inspectors - usually council workers but sometimes staff of inspection firms licensed by councils - signed off the work as being compliant with safety regulations, according to the owners of the blocks and the building firms involved. Chris Blythe, CEO of trade body the Chartered Institute of Building, said builders hired to carry out high-rise cladding projects used many subcontractors and advisers, and that this could lead to misunderstandings, with one party thinking another had ensured work was compliant. ""The business model we have is almost geared up for potential failure,"" said Blythe, adding that if fewer parties were involved, there would be less room for confusion over responsibilities.For all 65 blocks identified by Reuters, the councils or council-licensed firms whose inspectors approved the work as compliant either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment while the independent review was ongoing.The government has already acknowledged problems with the inspection process, with Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd saying in July there was a ""system failure, built up over many years"" in the area of regulation enforcement. However a spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which ordered the cladding tests and regulations review, said sign-off by inspectors did not absolve contractors of responsibility to meet safety standards. FIRE TESTSCladding systems are panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency. Since 2006, building regulations have required materials used in cladding on high-rise buildings to be able to pass the ""BS 8414 test"" which measures combustibility.After Grenfell, the DCLG ordered a series BS 8414 tests to establish which types of cladding met fire safety rules. It said that, of around 600 social housing towers in England that had cladding, 161 had systems of a type that failed the tests. But it did not name the towers.Reuters identified 60 blocks which, since 2006, had been cladded with aluminum panels with polyethylene cores - a form of cladding that failed the DCLG's test, and which the prime minister and three other ministers have said breaches safety regulations when used in tall buildings. Five other blocks, also cladded since 2006, had combinations of panel and insulation board that failed the test. The three companies that were rehired to replace the cladding on 29 of the towers had all originally fitted aluminum panels with polyethylene cores. Wates secured contracts with Westminster council in central London and One Manchester housing association to reclad 14 towers it covered in 2007 and 2010. Willmott Dixon has received contracts from Oxford council and west London's Octavia housing association to replace panels it installed on three blocks early this year and in 2013.Engie has been hired by Barnet Homes in north London to replace cladding on three blocks it clad in 2012. It also has a contract to remove cladding from nine blocks in Salford, north England, owned by the local council that it clad around 2016. Engie has been hired to remove panels from 12 blocks it clad in 2012 and 2016, and install new cladding on three of them. The contracts are with housing associations Barnet Homes in north London, and Pendleton Together in Salford, north England. The three building companies declined to comment on how much the contracts were worth.However five of the six owners of the buildings told Reuters how much money they were paying for the work.Oxford council said about 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) for its two blocks; Octavia said about 2 million pounds for one block, Westminster council said about 6 million pounds for six blocks; and Barnet Homes said 8.2 million pounds for three blocks. Salford council said it expects to spend up to 25 million pounds in total for the removal and recladding work on nine blocks. Engie has been hired to remove its original panels, but the recladding contractor has not yet been named.One Manchester declined to comment on how much its recladding work would cost. The building companies declined to comment on the figures.LEGAL ACTIONJonathan Raynes a partner with law firm Steptoe & Johnson said councils or housing associations who paid contractors for cladding that turned out to be non-compliant could sue the contractor for the cost of replacing the cladding. ""The contract will almost certainly have a provision that says the contractor must build in accordance with statutory requirements,"" he said, adding that if the contract didn't say this, a requirement to act legally could be deemed implicit.Raynes and Adam Creasey, a solicitor with Lewis Nedas, said the fact building inspectors signed off on work did not remove the builder's responsibility to adhere to building regulations. Creasey added a builder could conceivably try and reclaim any money awarded against it from the body which provided the inspection sign-off. Reuters contacted the owners of all 65 blocks with cladding of a type that failed the government tests - seven local councils and 10 housing associations - and asked if they were considering legal action against contractors to recover the money spent on cladding, or to cover the cost of replacement.Only Camden council in north London said it was considering legal action. It declined to elaborate on its plans.Barnet said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Engie, over the original cladding but declined to say why. Westminster council said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Wates, because it believed the original work was compliant with the rules in place at the time. Oxford council said it had not sought money from Willmott Dixon over the original cladding and would only consider taking legal advice after the independent review was completed. One Manchester said it would not talk about seeking recompense while the review was on-going.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It can take several hours to charge a regular electric car today.""Customers want to go on long journeys in their electric vehicles and feel confident that there are reliable, comfortable and convenient places to charge them quickly,"" said Shell's head of retail Istvan Kapitany.The 80 charging stations will be deployed in Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. With an additional 20 stations expected to be added in Germany, about a quarter of Shell's stations along highways in Europe will offer high-power electric charging within two years, Kapitany told Reuters.Shell will invest in changing power supplies to its stations to meet growing demand, he said, declining to disclose the size of the investment or terms of the IONITY deal.The IONITY partners joined forces with a plan to build a pan-European network of 400 charging stations by 2020.

166,"Nov 15, 2017 07:00AM ET",Exclusive: Carlyle seeks to raise $1 billion for new energy fund - sources,nan,"By Ron BoussoLONDON (Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), the world's largest private equity firm, is raising $1 billion for a new fund to invest in oil and gas outside the United States as a stronger outlook for oil prices rekindles investor appetite, banking sources told Reuters.The new vehicle comes after Carlyle International Energy Partners (CIEP), the group's overseas energy investment fund set up in 2013, nearly exhausted its $2.5 billion warchest following a number of high-profile deals.CIEP managing directors Bob Maguire and Marcel van Poecke met investors during a roadshow in the United States in recent weeks to raise interest in the new fund, several banking sources said.The new fund will be used to create a New York-listed special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that focuses on investment in oil and gas exploration and production outside the United States.The fund is expected to be launched next year, they said.A Carlyle spokeswoman declined to comment.CIEP has been one of the most active private equity funds in recent years amid a downturn in the energy sector, backing companies in Europe, Africa and Asia. Those include Neptune, a joint venture with CVC Partners that in May acquired Engie's (PA:ENGIE) international exploration and production portfolio for $3.9 billion; and Assala Energy, which in March acquired Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) Gabon operations for $587 million.A recovery in oil prices - up around 40 percent since June - has bolstered confidence in the energy industry. ""There is definitely an upswing in appetite for oil and gas acquisitions as evidenced by our recent capital confidence barometer survey,"" Andy Brogan, global oil and gas transaction leader at consultancy EY, told Reuters.""Much of this is down to the (oil) pricing outlook and the confidence that comes with it.""According to the EY survey published on Wednesday, 69 percent of oil and gas executives indicated they intend to pursue acquisitions, a record high for the poll.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The theme of the 48th conference is to ""explore the root causes of, and pragmatic solutions for, the manifold political, economic and social fractures facing global society,"" WEF said.WEF, in an annual report this month, found it will take another 217 years before women earn as much as men and have equal representation in the workplace, revealing an economic gap of 58 percent.It is the second straight year the Swiss non-profit has recorded worsening economic inequality.A typical representative of the more than 2,500 titans of industry and influence that each January descend upon the Alps has received the unofficial moniker of ""Davos Man"" -- a sign of the further shift in representation and thinking still necessary to balance uneven gender dynamics. [http://reut.rs/1nfXJAq]Other co-chairs are Isabelle Kocher, head of French energy conglomerate Engie (PA:ENGIE); Italian physicist and director general of the CERN particle physics research centre Fabiola Gianotti; founder of the rural cooperative Mann Deshi Bank for women, Chetna Sinha; and International Trade Union Confederation General Secretary Sharan Burrow.Next year's event will take place January 23-26, 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

183,"Oct 11, 2017 10:50AM ET","Up against Germany, EU bid for gas talks with Moscow falters",nan,"By Alissa de Carbonnel and Peter MaushagenBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission's attempts to intervene in Russia's plans for a new gas pipeline to Germany have been dealt a blow by legal advice, according to EU diplomats and a document seen by Reuters.Brussels, backed by some EU member states, is concerned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will increase the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas and cut gas transit revenues for Ukraine, damaging its fragile economy. So the Commission is seeking a mandate from EU members to hold talks with Russia. But Germany, the EU's biggest economy and the end-point for the pipeline planned to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year, believes Brussels should not get involved.According to an opinion by the legal service of the European Council, a body where EU nations meet, the Commission's proposed mandate for talks with Russia failed to establish ""any legal need to negotiate"" and contained ""mere political arguments.""The opinion also took aim at the Commission's concern that the pipeline would increase dependence on Russia's state-owned gas firm Gazprom (MM:GAZP). This ""is at the very least counter intuitive,"" the document, dated Sept. 27, said.""It pretty much kills the mandate,"" one EU official said.With the opinion suggesting the Commission may need unanimous backing from EU members for its plan, another EU official said: ""I see very little room for moving forward, and in the meantime, the pipeline will be built.""Eastern European and Baltic Sea states fear the project strengthens Russia's hand, while Germany and other beneficiaries in northern Europe see a commercial payoff.Both sides, however, fear the potential loss for Ukraine of some $2 billion per year of Russian gas transit fees will undermine its war-torn economy, complicating the bloc's investment in reforms there.Many see the project at odds with sanctions Western countries have imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine.""Our main concern is how to stabilize Ukraine,"" said an EU diplomat. But he added: ""Apart from Russia, there aren't many gas-rich countries left close to Germany ... Nord Stream 2 is unsavory, but the right thing to do.""The opinion, the latest legal tussle over the pipeline, will make it harder for the EU's 28 members to find common ground when they debate the issue on Thursday, EU sources said.Germany has seized on it as proof EU regulators should not meddle, while others accuse Berlin of strong-arming EU institutions.""Our German colleagues are crowing right now,"" said an EU diplomat, whose country backs the Commission bid.Another was defiant: ""We are not rolling over yet,"" the diplomat said. ""This is not a legal issue but about taking care of geopolitics.""Poland, one of the pipeline's fiercest opponents, plans to put forward its own legal opinion this week, one of its diplomats said, dismissing the Council document as ""just an opinion."" Within a bloc still reeling from Brexit, EU officials say there is little appetite for divisive initiatives and the Commission will not move ahead without a strong mandate. It is also wary of any future court challenge, they added.'UP TO MERKEL'German energy groups Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn) are not alone in having a stake in the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which will pump Russian gas via the Baltic Sea.Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV), Anglo-Dutch group Shell (L:RDSa), and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) are also invested.Several EU diplomats said German counterparts were under pressure to sweep away an issue that could interfere with Chancellor Angela Merkel's efforts to build a new coalition, including with the Green party, after Sept. 24 elections.Merkel says she sees no need for the EU to get involved, and her government has sought assurances from Moscow that it will keep pumping gas through Ukraine after its gas transit contract expires in 2019.Those in Brussels who do not want to see the EU bid fail worry the bloc will loose leverage to seek such assurances.""Then it will be up to Merkel to negotiate Ukraine transits with Russia,"" one EU official said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,"" Vestager said.Amazon said it was considering an appeal.""We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law,"" Amazon said in a statement after the announcement.Amazon shares were little changed in early Wednesday trading.Though the EU has taken on several U.S. tech companies, both in antitrust and in tax avoidance cases, Vestager said that her approach was not biased against foreign companies""This is about competition in Europe, no matter your flag, no matter you ownership,"" Vestager said.She also welcomed the debate kicked off by French President Emmanuel Macron who called for more integrated corporate tax regimes in Europe, aiming to close the loopholes used to reduce tax bills.RAZOR THIN MARGINSWhile the exact amount Amazon needs to repay is yet to be calculated, the 250 million euros is significantly less than the 400 million euros which sources close to the matter told Reuters a year ago was under consideration by Vestager.The bill suggests the Commission believes Amazon shielded around 900 million euros in EU profits from tax, calculations by Reuters show. For most of its existence, Amazon has worked on razor thin profit margins to fuel its global expansion, making only $2.4 billion profit on global revenues of $136 billion in 2016.The Commission said Luxembourg allowed Amazon to channel a significant portion of its profits to a holding company without paying tax. The holding company was allowed to do this because it held certain intellectual property rights. Tax advisers say an important way for companies to shift profits out of the United States is to sell intellectual property, like brands or patents, to a subsidiary in a country where such profits are not taxed and have that unit license the intellectual property to other overseas affiliates.Amazon's corporate set up with subsidies in Luxembourg was also subject of a $1.5 billion court case with U.S. tax authorities, which Amazon won in March.Amazon, which employs 1,500 in the grand duchy, is one of the biggest employers in the country of half a million people. It has a Europe-wide staff of some 50,000.Luxembourg, whose tiny economy has benefited from providing a European base for multinational companies, rejected the finding and said it was looking at its legal options.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister of Luxembourg for almost two decades until 2013 and has been criticized for his role in enabling the many tax deals that are now being unraveled. He denies doing anything wrong and says the Commission is committed to ensuring fair taxation.In 2014, Luxembourg made international headlines in the wake of the publication of ""LuxLeaks"", documents that showed how large accounting firms helped multinational companies channel proceeds through the country while paying little or no tax.Luxembourg is also under EU scrutiny over tax deals with fast food chain McDonald's (N:MCD) and French energy company Engie (PA:ENGIE). Luxembourg has appealed against a ruling in 2015 that carmaker  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) should pay it back taxes. As well as Ireland, tax for multinationals in Belgium and the Netherlands have also come under Commission scrutiny.""Luxembourg has been fully cooperating with the Commission in its investigation and is strongly committed to tax transparency and the fight against harmful tax avoidance,"" the country's finance ministry said on Wednesday.Amazon revamped its European tax practices in 2015 so that it can book sales and pay taxes in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy instead of channeling all sales through Luxembourg where it is headquartered, a move that may raise its tax bill.($1 = 0.8493 euros)(Addtional reporting by Tom Bergin, Editing by Alastair Macdonald, Jane Merriman and Mark Potter)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

189,"Oct 03, 2017 01:20PM ET",EU to tell Amazon to pay Luxembourg back taxes: source,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are expected to order Amazon (O:AMZN) on Wednesday to pay Luxebourg millions of euros in back taxes, a person familiar with the matter said, the latest global company to be hit by an EU crackdown on unfair tax deals.The European Commission ruling wraps up a three-year long investigation into whether Amazon received an unfair advantage based on a 2003 Luxembourg tax ruling which allows an Amazon subsidiary to pay less tax there than other companies.The EU competition enforcer estimated a tax bill of about 400 million euros a year ago, two people familiar with the matter had told Reuters at the time. A revised figure is likely to be issued following discussions with other departments in the Commission.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Amazon declined to comment.The Amazon ruling will come on the same day as the Commission unveils changes to the way sales taxes are levied in the European Union with the aim of tackling fraud and curbing companies' excessive tax-planning.The EU competition authority said in 2014 the Amazon subsidiary paid a tax deductible royalty to a Luxembourg-based limited liability partnership which was not subject to the country's tax regime. It said the royalty was not in line with market rates.Amazon revamped its European tax practices in 2015 so that it can book sales and pay taxes in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy instead of channeling all sales through Luxembourg where it is headquartered, a move which may raise its tax bill.Fastfood chain McDonald's (N:MCD) and French energy company Engie (PA:ENGIE) are next in the EU crosshairs over their Luxembourg tax deals.IPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL) has already been ordered to pay back arrears of up to 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) to Ireland, coffee chain Starbucks (O:SBUX) up to 30 million euros to the Dutch authorities and a similar amount for  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) to Luxembourg.At least 35 companies, among them Anheuser-Busch InBev (B:ABI),  BP  (L:BP) and BASF (DE:ASFn) have been told to pay back taxes of about 700 million euros to Belgium because of their participation in an illegal tax scheme.

198,"Sep 15, 2017 02:31AM ET",Energy firms battle startups to wire Europe's highways for electric cars,nan,"By Geert De Clercq and Christoph SteitzPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent's cities to its motorways.Power utilities, tech start-ups and oil majors are fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in the fast-growing business of charging stations – but advances in electric vehicles means where they build them is changing.Refuelling conventional petrol and diesel cars on motorways has long been the domain of the oil companies, which typically have their own networks of filling stations. Several are now talking about setting up high-power charging networks, creating major competition for limited space at motorway service areas.""It is a bit of a landgrab now to win this sector,"" said Tim Payne, chief executive of British charging start-up InstaVolt, which has raised 12 million pounds to install 3,000 charge points across Britain by 2020.While the range of electric vehicles (EVs) was less than 100 km (60 miles), Europe's utilities were happy to help cities and companies install slow and inexpensive charging points at homes, offices and shops, often supported by state subsidies.But Tesla (O:TSLA), Porsche (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) are now making battery-powered cars with enough range to drive across countries.  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen also announced plans on the eve of this week's Frankfurt motor show to accelerate their shift to electric cars.Charging infrastructure remains nowhere near it needs to be. ""Where is the network of charging points that will be required? Indeed where is the power and the grid?"" Ralf Speth, boss of Britain's Jaguar Land Rover, asked last week.Experts including ChargePoint and Engie (PA:ENGIE) are, however, making plans to build pan-European networks of high-voltage fast-charging stations which can refill a battery in less than half an hour instead of overnight.In Britain, InstaVolt is renting land from filling station operators, bringing them additional revenue from the lease as well as the increased traffic to their shops at the sites. It earns a margin by selling power through the chargers.InstaVolt struck a deal in May with ChargePoint, which itself is on a $125 million expansion spree in Europe, to install about 200 of the U.S. group's ultra-fast chargers close to popular roads across Britain.UP FOR GRABSMorgan Stanley estimates that 1-3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030, adding that while utilities have natural skills in the new industry, it was too early to determine who will come put on top. ""The winning business model is up for grabs,"" it said.Today, there are fewer than 100,000 public charging points available in Europe, with only about six percent of them fast, according to the International Energy Agency.Almost none of these is super-fast, a term usually used for charging stations with an output of at least 150 kilowatts. More than three times faster than current-generation chargers, they are now being targeted by those trying to become market leaders. Contenders include Dutch EV-Box, one of Europe's biggest makers of charging stations, which was snapped up by French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) in March.""We expect hundreds of millions of annual revenue from EV-Box in a few years,"" Thierry Lepercq, head of innovation at Engie, told Reuters. He sees Engie's EV charging revenue growing by a factor of 20 in three to five years. Last year, EV-Box had sales of 16 million euros ($19.1 million).EV-Box Chief Executive Kristof Vereenooghe said that unlike most of its competitors EV-Box has been profitable from the start, a claim that makes it stand out in an industry where gaining scale is considered more important for now.That's why German utility E.ON (DE:EONGn), too, announced a strategic partnership with Danish startup CLEVER and said it had the ambition to roll out several hundred ultra-fast charging stations along European motorways.CLEVER, which is owned by a group of Danish utilities and runs charging networks in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, wants to extend its network to France, Britain and Italy with E.ON.The firm, which unlike EV-Box and ChargePoint does not make its own hardware, is also still looking for other partners. ""We want to connect cities so that you can easily drive across Europe in an electric vehicle,"" CLEVER Chief Executive Casper Kirketerp-Moeller said.TALK LESS, INSTALL MOREAmong the oil majors,  BP  (L:BP), Shell (L:RDSa) and (PA:TOTF) have all either announced plans or launched pilot projects for EV charging.

The latest set of U.S. punitive measures was imposed on Moscow this month. The legislation includes sanctions on foreign companies investing in or helping Russian energy exploration, and cut the period for which U.S.-based entities can provide finance to Russian energy firms from 90 to 60 days.Alexander Ivannikov, a Gazprom official, said on the conference call that the legislation was vague and could be broadly interpreted.""According to preliminary estimates, this does not diminish a possibility for Gazprom to borrow abroad,"" he said, adding that Gazprom and its partners were trying to obtain clarification about the sanctions.""Even if there are risks ... the Nord Stream 2 project will be implemented regardless of lawyers and (U.S. Treasury) explanations,"" he said.Earlier this year Uniper (DE:UN01), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Shell (L:RDSa), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE) agreed to each loan 10 percent of the cost of the pipeline.Gazprom will remain the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering 50 percent of the cost of the pipeline which will have a capacity to carry 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year into a terminal in Germany and is due to start operating in 2019.Vsevolod Cherepanov, a Gazprom board member, said during the conference call the company hoped to produce over 460 bcm of gas this year, up from the previous forecast of more than 450 bcm.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

227,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

228,"Aug 03, 2017 12:29PM ET",Russian gas pipelines to go ahead despite U.S. sanctions,nan,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Alissa de CarbonnelMOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions will make it harder for Russia to build two gas export pipelines to Europe but the projects are unlikely to be stopped. U.S. President Donald Trump has reluctantly signed into law further sanctions on Russia but some of the measures are discretionary and most White House watchers believe he will not take action against Russia's energy infrastructure. This would allow Gazprom's two big pipeline projects to go ahead, although at a higher price and with some delays.The Kremlin, dependent on oil and gas revenues, sees the pipelines to Germany and Turkey - Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream - as crucial to increasing its market share in Europe. It also fears that Western partners - needed to develop the deepwater, shale and Arctic gas deposits that will fill the pipelines - will be scared off by sanctions. Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) warned investors last month that the sanctions ""may result in delays, or otherwise impair or prevent the completion of the projects by the group.""With all that in mind, the Russian gas giant is taking steps to reduce the impact of sanctions.It has accelerated pipe-laying by Swiss contractor Allseas Group under the Black Sea for TurkStream - even though there is no final agreement on where the pipeline will make landfall in Turkey. It is also hurriedly building a second TurkStream line to export gas to Europe.""The construction of the second line is underway just in case the sanctions hit,"" a senior Gazprom source told Reuters.A spokesman for Allseas said 100 km of the 900-km first line have been built since June 23 and preparatory work is underway for the second line.THE UKRAINIAN CONNECTIONThe biggest cost of any delays to the new lines could come from increased transit fees paid to Ukraine, the route by which Russian gas has traditionally reached Europe.Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream bypass Ukraine, but if they are brought into use late, Gazprom will have to continue using the Ukrainian route and may have to pay more for the privilege.The European Union, fearing sanctions will hurt oil and gas projects on which it depends, said it was ready to retaliate unless it obtained U.S. guarantees that European firms would not be targeted. Five Western firms that have invested in Nord Stream 2 - Wintershall (DE:BASFn) and Uniper (DE:UN01) of Germany, Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV), Anglo-Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) - say it is too early to judge the impact of sanctions.For now, they are standing by their pledge of up to 950 million euros ($1.13 billion) each to finance the 1,225 km (760 mile) Nord Stream 2.Despite Trump's desire to promote U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe that would compete with the Russian gas, he said he did not want the sanctions to get in the way of efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.EU officials, industry sources and experts therefore doubt that Trump will use what he regards as ""significantly flawed"" sanctions to punish Moscow.""Their approach is going to be strictly by the letter of the law: what do they have to do,"" Richard Nephew, a former U.S. deputy chief of sanctions now with Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.RISK PREMIUMThe sanctions law is however expected to hamper Gazprom's efforts to raise money.""The price of any project automatically increases,"" said Tatiana Mitrova, director of the Skolkovo Energy Center.""Gazprom's relationships with partners, subcontractors, and equipment and service providers are severely complicated,"" she said. ""They will all ask for a risk premium."" Gazprom will have to take on the additional cost itself, depend on Russian state banks, or seek money at higher rates from Asian lenders, financial analysts said.""This, however, does not mean that Nord Stream 2 won't be built,"" said Katja Yafimava of the Oxford Energy Institute.Industry sources say the loans from Western partners for Nord Stream 2 are already at above market rates to reflect the political risk of partnering with Russia in a project that has also faced opposition in Europe. The added uncertainty ups the stakes further. ""It's like reading tea leaves,"" one source with knowledge of the European side of the Nord Stream 2 financing structure told Reuters.While big players may be able to stomach the risk, analysts say the smaller contractors on which Gazprom depends to build the pipelines may get spooked. ""Not all partners can afford to see things through with Gazprom,"" said Valery Nesterov, an analyst at Moscow-based Sberbank CIB.A spokesman for Nord Stream 2 said more than 200 non-Russian companies from 17 countries, most of them European, are building the pipeline. Most of the big contracts for steel, port logistics and construction have already been concluded.By forcing the pace of construction, Gazprom may have gained enough time to build the new pipelines but longer-term projects will take a hit.""Unless Trump takes a really sharp turn, it is highly unlikely that companies that are supplying pipeline goods are going to be punished in the next year or so,"" Nephew said. ""A lot of companies are now thinking: 'I've got maybe 12, maybe 18 months in which I can do some stuff but after that maybe I won't'.""For graphic on EU imports of Russian gas click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nz1ySg(This story corrects spelling of name in paragraph 23)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

237,"Jul 12, 2017 07:52AM ET",Trump and Macron may not be an odd couple after all,nan,"By John Irish and Ayesha RascoePARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's relationship with Emmanuel Macron got off to an awkward start, with a jaw-clenching handshake at a summit in Brussels before the French president rebuked the U.S. leader for his stance on climate change. The two men would appear to have little in common. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to ""make America great again"" who is unpredictable on foreign policy. Macron, 39, is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations.Trump's visit to Paris this week, to celebrate 100 years since U.S. troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain, follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world's major economies at a G20 summit last weekend.In Paris, Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors. Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport, and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship.Trump could use a friend overseas. His preference for a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U.S. president appearing isolated among world leaders. ""Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don't like, such as on climate, but we can deal with it in two ways: we can say, 'We are not going to talk to you,' or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,"" government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI. ""Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand.""POLITICAL OUTSIDERSTrump and Macron are political outsiders, the American a real estate mogul, his French counterpart a former investment banker. Both love a good deal, demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions, and have a penchant for showmanship.Like Macron, Trump will be looking for common ground.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Trump and Macron enjoyed a ""great"" relationship.""You know, Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same,"" Cohn said.Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy. Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy. He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as ""a long bilateral meeting between the two men"".Having reshaped their countries' political landscapes, both now have certain shared objectives, making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority.It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran, possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress that might derail a 9.5 billion euro ($10.9 billion) gas pipe project in which France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) has a stake.The United States and France hold differing views on Iran.On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. During the U.S. presidential race, he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, branding it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"".So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and automobile manufacturers  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to sign initial deals.'A WIN-WIN FOR BOTH'Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France's former monarchy, Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees.For Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction.""The visit is a win-win for both,"" said one French diplomat. ""Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys. Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no-fuss picture with the leader of the 'free world'"".Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner, French diplomats said. Moreover, he senses an opportunity to sway U.S. thinking and elevate the role of France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East, they added.France is the second-biggest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State.It is one reason, the diplomats say, that in his first two months as president, Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin, just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him.""The Russians are pleased to have a grown-up to talk to in Europe,"" a second French diplomat said.Daniel Fried, an expert on U.S.-European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself. ""By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

238,"Jul 09, 2017 07:57PM ET","At France's Davos, French bosses laud impact of new president",nan,"By Michel Rose and Mathieu RosemainAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - Top French company bosses who have for years lamented their country's slow pace of reforms offered glowing praise this year at an annual summer gathering in Provence for the first steps taken by newly elected President Emmanuel Macron.Sixty days after Macron became France's youngest-ever president, the chief executives gathered in the southern town of Aix-en-Provence said they had sensed a radical change in the country's image abroad.""The whole world admires France today. There is renewed confidence, optimism about the country,"" Patrick Pouyanne, the head of oil major  Total , (PA:TOTF), France's largest company, told reporters.""What I expect from this government is that it maintains this confidence, this optimism, so the French start spending more and companies start investing.""Although Macron's government has yet to pass any concrete measures, it outlined its action plan in policy speeches last week, and has begun talks with unions to pass an extensive reform of French labor regulations.""I think this new president and his government are making an extremely positive start,"" Isabelle Kocher of gas utility ENGIE (PA:ENGIE) told Reuters at the summit often referred to as a ""mini-Davos"".""They are changing France's image abroad, I see it everywhere I go, it's really striking and has happened very quickly,"" she said. ""France went from being labeled the sick man of Europe to being seen as the savior of Europe,"" a politician who sits on the board of several French companies said at one of the cafes lining the town's sunny streets.TAX CUT DEBATESIf the government's announcement last Tuesday that some tax cuts would be delayed - including exemptions to a wealth tax and the introduction of a flat tax on capital income of 30 percent - did not draw much criticism in public, it had some bosses bristling in private.One participant in the conference's exclusive late-evening cocktails told Reuters he heard a CEO tell a Finance Ministry official that Macron should do away with his 50 billion euro investment plan and cut taxes instead. ""We don't want to pay more taxes later,"" the French CEO said, according to the witness of the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was private.""There are some debates about the government's tax measures, if they'll be done now or if it'll wait because it has no money,"" UBS' (S:UBSG) head of French operations, Jean-Frederic de Leusse, told Reuters. On Sunday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire seemed to suggest the delays were still the subject of discussions in government.But when pressed, French CEOs who in previous gatherings complained loudly about a tax burden, which was the EU's heaviest last year, refused to blame the government.""Let's not start criticizing,"" Total's Pouyanne said. ""Let's give them a bit of time. If there were a magic potion, it would have been used a long time ago.""The chief executive of the country's flagship airline, Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), concurred.""Like all decision-makers, the government has to deal with contradicting demands. Respecting a certain number of European rules, so that our partners can take us more seriously, is important,"" Jean-Marc Janaillac told Reuters.""If the price we have to pay is a slightly delayed time frame, that doesn't seem to be a major inconvenience for me compared to its advantages,"" he added.France's top central bankers agreed the government was right to prioritize deficit reduction over tax cuts so that France can, for the first time in a decade, bring its deficit below the European Union's 3 percent of GDP ceiling.ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said France's respect for the rules would help discussions the government hopes to launch about common budget measures in the euro zone.""We're all for tax cuts, but let's not equate reform with immediate, unfunded tax cuts,"" Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told the conference on Sunday.""We've already paid a heavy price for this kind of liability on the future.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

288,"Mar 30, 2017 08:46AM ET",Westinghouse wins UK reactor approval from nuclear regulator,nan,"By Susanna Twidale and Nina ChestneyLONDON (Reuters) - Toshiba's  (T:6502) Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, has won approval for its AP1000 reactor design, Britain's nuclear regulator said on Thursday.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) approval is needed before the design can be used at NuGeneration Ltd's (NuGen) Moorside new nuclear project in north west England, which consists of three AP1000 units.""The closure of our assessment of the generic design of the AP1000 reactor is a significant step in the process, ensuring the design meets the very high standards of safety we expect,"" Richard Savage, ONR's chief nuclear inspector, said.""We will now focus our regulatory attention on site specific assessments, and NuGen's application for a nuclear site license,"" he added in a statement.Westinghouse's bankruptcy filing has raised questions over whether it will be able to complete capital intensive projects, although the move does not affect Westinghouse's operations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to a company statement.All new nuclear plants in Britain need ONR approval through its GDA process, which typically takes around four years and the Westinghouse reactor was expected to be approved by the end of this month.The approval has taken much longer since assessment first began in 2007. It was paused by the ONR at the end of December 2011 while it asked for design modifications, but was resumed in 2014.""(The regulator review) represents a major milestone toward bringing a new generation of safe, clean energy to the United Kingdom through the Moorside Project,” José Emeterio Gutiérrez, Westinghouse interim president and chief executive, said in a statement.""In addition, it expands the global regulatory pedigree of the AP1000 plant design and further confirms Westinghouse’s innovative safety technology,"" he added.Britain needs to invest in new infrastructure to replace aging coal and nuclear plants set to close in the next decade, but has struggled to get large projects built, especially nuclear, due to the costs involved.EDF's (PA:EDF) 18 billion pound ($22.5 billion) Hinkley Point C nuclear project in southwest England got the final go-ahead in 2016 after several years of delay, but only after securing backing from the French government.NuGen, a joint venture between Toshiba and French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) has also come under doubt since Japan's Toshiba said last month it planned to pull out of the construction work at the British plant after posting a $6.3 billion writedown on Westinghouse, which has been hit by billions of dollars in cost overruns at new nuclear plants.A spokesman for NuGen said it could not comment on specific financial issues relating directly to Toshiba or Westinghouse and that it will continue ""business as usual"" to gain the necessary permits and licenses to build the project.(additional reporting by Karolin Schaps; editing by Alexander Smith)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

291,"Mar 24, 2017 11:44AM ET","EU stalls Russian gas pipeline, but probably won't stop it",nan,"By Alissa de Carbonnel and Vera EckertBRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Russia has the European Union in a bind.The bloc is divided between eastern European and Baltic Sea countries that see a new pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic making the EU a hostage to Moscow - and those in northern Europe, most especially the main beneficiary Germany, for whom the economic benefits take priority.The result, EU sources say, is that the EU executive, the Commission, sensing that there may ultimately be no legal basis to block approval of Nord Stream 2, is delaying it as long as possible, hoping to get past 2019 - the date when Russia must renegotiate a gas transit deal with Ukraine.""There's a difference between not supporting the project and having a legal basis to stop it,"" said one EU diplomat, adding that the aim for now was ""a break to avoid the project going anywhere in 2019"".And for now, that means doing nothing, to the intense frustration of members such as Denmark, whose prime minister challenged the Commission at a summit of EU leaders this month to make good on strong words criticizing the pipeline.Last summer, seven eastern member states, all formerly dominated by Moscow and at the center of an EU antitrust case accusing Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) of abusing its market dominance, sent a letter of protest to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They too are still waiting for a clear response.EU sources say the Commission is in fact cultivating uncertainty by hinting that the pipeline may fall foul of EU rules, in the hope of scaring off Western investors, for a time at least.And in fact, last July, Gazprom's Western partners - Uniper (DE:EONGn), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Shell (L:RDSa), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE) - did withdraw from pledges to provide 1.2 billion euros of equity for the pipeline, a twin to Nord Stream 1, which began pumping in 2011.DEEP DIVISIONSGermany is also not actively promoting the pipeline for now, with a parliamentary election looming this autumn. ""The feeling is: 'Why use up political capital to defend it?"" said one EU diplomat.Broadly, the plan to bring more Russian gas to Europe plays into deep divisions between EU nations over whether to do more business with Moscow while countering its military power plays in Ukraine and Syria.Germany itself has taken a firm stance on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.But it also argues that EU market rules guarantee that the pipeline remains a purely commercial project, while eastern and Baltic states accuse President Vladimir Putin of exploiting energy exports as a geopolitical tool.Meanwhile, littoral states that feel increasingly threatened by Moscow's military posturing in and around the Baltic Sea want clarity from Brussels before going ahead with routine environmental assessments of Nord Stream 2.    ""This has lots of geopolitical questions and it is not fair that one country should answer alone whether this is an good idea,"" Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said last month.""This is not a question only for Denmark but for the European Union.""Russia already accounts for one-third of EU gas imports, and that could rise with the help of Nord Stream 2, as Gazprom fights for market share with the EU's domestic supplies decreasing.It would also sharply reduce the need for Russia to export gas through Ukraine, where the EU is trying to support stumbling economic reforms. This would deprive Kiev of lucrative transit fees, and of a lever in its tortured relations with Moscow.Hence the Commission's desire to at least stall approval until 2019.STALLING, NOT STOPPINGBut sooner or later, EU sources grudgingly admit that Russia's determined push for Nord Stream 2 looks set to carry it over the numerous legal and financial hurdles in its path.Gazprom's Western partner firms say they are looking for new ways to share the financial burden, notwithstanding the uncertainty.""If it isn't stopped politically, its commercial logic will prevail,"" one industry source said.Gazprom is busily ordering steel pipes, renting facilities in Sweden, Finland and Germany and applying for permits to lay the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipe.And Germany, by hosting the end-point of the 55 billion cubic meter a year pipeline, stands to grow into a gas hub for central, eastern and southern Europe, alongside the Dutch and British markets.""What Germany wants, Germany gets,"" said one official in Brussels.In an opinion seen by Reuters, it the Commission argued last January for EU gas market liberalization rules to be applied to Nord Stream 2, citing ""serious diversification and security of supply concerns"".But that was rejected by the EU's own lawyers as well as the German energy regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur.Responding this month to a missive from Brussels, the Bundesnetzagentur said Nord Stream 2 should simply be treated as an import pipeline like Nord Stream 1, Algeria's Medgaz and Libya's Greenstream.To subject it to internal EU energy market rules would be ""just as inappropriate as it would be improper"", the agency's president, Jochen Homann, wrote in the March 3 letter, seen by Reuters.""MONEY TALKS""Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that talks with the agency were far from over, insisting that EU rules to promote competition passed since Nord Stream 1 was built should apply to the new pipeline.""Key EU legal principles must also be respected in the offshore part of the pipeline,"" he told Reuters. ""We'll negotiate with the German regulator how to secure that.""He said the legal tussle should be dealt with via an intergovernmental agreement between Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - which both sides have eschewed.That would give the EU a chance to vet the deal under new rules, adopted on Tuesday, that give Brussels the power to vet oil and gas deals with outside countries to guard against anti-competitive practices and supply disruptions.There are also legal questions over Eugal, a smaller pipeline intended to feed gas from the offshore Nord Stream 2 to Germany and beyond.German regulatory sources say they will not approve Eugal until Europe's highest court decides whether to uphold a deal between EU regulators and Germany to remove limits on Gazprom's access to a similar pipeline running from Nord Stream 1. That ruling could take up to two years, although an interim ruling is expected to give a signal within weeks.Ultimately, the pipeline means big business.Building up a case to comply with German regulation, five pipeline operators ran an auction this month that indicated demand from shippers for almost the full capacity of the Eugal pipeline over 20 years from 2019.When Sweden's government voiced national security concerns over Gazprom using the island of Gotland as a base for construction, several other ports stepped forward hoping to win the business. The chosen site, Karlshamn, stands to benefit from 100 million SEK ($11.3 million) worth of business.""Money talks,"" said one EU diplomat. ""If it's not illegal, then politically there's little we can do.""One senior German industry source put it bluntly: ""I don't care where the gas comes from as long as they are pumping more.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

294,"Mar 14, 2017 03:13AM ET","South Australia taps new gas plant, batteries to fix power crisis",nan,"By Sonali PaulSYDNEY (Reuters) - South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, outlined plans on Tuesday to spend A$510 million ($385 million) to keep the lights on, just four days after Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) boss Elon Musk offered to save the state from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage.The plan includes A$150 million to encourage the development of a 100 megawatts of battery storage, possibly from Musk or from local providers. The state will also build and operate a new A$360 million 250-megawatt gas power plant to stabilize its electricity system.The South Australia government came up with the emergency plan after a state-wide blackout last September during a storm left homes and businesses in the dark for up to eight hours and paralyzed some industries for up to two weeks.""Today, South Australia takes hold of its energy future. We have a national electricity market which is failing not only South Australia but failing the nation,"" state Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement.The state, which relies on wind for about a third of its power capacity, has become vulnerable to outages and soaring prices as it does not have enough back-up power when the wind is not blowing.South Australia's last coal-fired power station shut down last May, as it was making losses, and France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) mothballed one of two units at a gas-fired power plant for the same reason.On the batteries front, Weatherill said he was speaking to a range of providers.""We want as much local content as possible,"" he told a news conference. ""We also need to put in the balance the reputational effect of attracting an international player of the size of Elon Musk to South Australia. ""Weatherill spoke to Musk on Saturday after Australian tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes said he would help raise funding and political support for the Tesla chief's offer to supply 100 megawatt-hours of batteries for $25 million within 100 days of signing a contract, or provide it free.""Over the coming days Tesla are assessing with stakeholders how best to deliver on this exciting opportunity for the benefit of the Australian energy market,"" a Tesla spokesman said.South Australia released its plan a day ahead of a crisis meeting called by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull with the heads of Australia's gas producers to find ways to boost gas supply, crucial for power plants and manufacturers.Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg slammed South Australia's plan saying it could drive up power prices and undermine national electricity market rules.Top global miner BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT), which lost $105 million at its Olympic Dam copper mine after the blackout last September, welcomed the state's effort to boost energy security, but warned it could have ""pricing implications"" and affect expansion plans.""South Australian business and residents cannot afford a repeat of the energy issues experienced over the past eight months, and we look forward to immediate steps being taken which will provide greater energy security for the State before the end of the year,"" a BHP Billiton spokesman said."

304,"Feb 06, 2017 02:01PM ET",London or Paris? Choice proves a taxing question for bankers,nan,"By Anjuli DaviesLONDON (Reuters) - Forget fine wine, haute cuisine and art ... the big question from London's bankers for a French delegation trying to lure them to Paris was, how much tax will I pay?""Most were interested in income tax and executive tax on pay,"" Gerard Mestrallet, president of France's finance industry lobby Europlace who led Monday's roadshow, said.More than 80 representatives from banks and business met with authorities from Paris who are highlighting the attractions of the French capital if Britain's exit from the European Union forces the relocation of some activities to continental Europe.Global banks and insurers have begun signaling how they cope with a ""hard"" exit from the EU, after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would leave the single market.And Brexit has opened up ""fierce competition"" among the main financial cities of Europe -- which include Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg -- Valerie Pecresse, the head of the wider Paris region, said.HSBC (L:HSBA), Europe's biggest bank, has said it could move some of its operations to Paris, where it has a subsidiary that holds most of the licenses needed by an investment bank thanks to its purchase of CCF in 2000.LABOR LAW CONCERNSPecresse estimated that the French capital could attract about 10,000 jobs, although bankers at the event raised concerns about French tax rules and labor laws as a possible deterrent.""The expatriate regime has dramatically improved but there are also some concerns about labor flexibility,"" Mestrallet, who is chairman of French utilities Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Suez (PA:SEVI), said.The French government introduced extra tax concessions for expatriates last year in the hope Paris could profit from Brexit, but experts say other centers with more flexible labor and tax rules are likely to be bigger beneficiaries.With the exception of HSBC, most financial firms have yet to make a decision on relocation plans to Paris, according to Mestrallet. ""Many will wait three months to have more clarity on the outcome of the French elections.""Germany is also seeking to attract finance jobs from Britain. The country's senior regulators met about 50 envoys from foreign banks last week to explain how they could move business to Europe's biggest economy after Britain leaves the EU, German financial watchdog Bafin said.But the Parisian delegation thinks it has the upper hand.""When was the last time you took your partner for a weekend to Frankfurt,"" quipped Pecresse."

311,"Jan 25, 2017 01:19PM ET",Gazprom says Poland transit deal delay endangers gas exports to EU,nan,"By Shadia Nasralla and Vladimir SoldatkinVIENNA (Reuters) - Kremlin-controlled Gazprom (MM:GAZP), Europe's largest gas supplier, has warned of risks to its deliveries to Europe via Poland as Warsaw has yet to accept new terms for gas transit.""We've heard that Poland does not intend to prolong the transit deal. This puts at risk supplies to European countries, including Germany,"" Gazprom's deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev said in an interview cleared for Wednesday publication.Poland, which imports most of the gas it consumes from Russia, has said it does not plan to renew a long-term supply contract with Moscow when the deal with Gazprom expires in 2022.However, Medvedev added: “We don’t have plans for and haven't even thought about cuts or stoppages to transit via Poland.""Russia supplies gas to Poland and Germany via the Yamal-Europe pipeline, with an annual capacity of around 33 billion cubic meters.Formerly communist Poland has been one of the staunchest critics of increased Russian gas exports to Europe. It also voiced protests over Moscow's plans to double the capacity of the undersea Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany.Medvedev told Reuters that Gazprom is on track with plans for Nord Stream 2 and expected to receive financing this year from its European partners for the pipeline project.Nord Stream 2, initially due for launch in 2019, has faced opposition from some European politicians amid a standoff with Russia over Ukraine.Last year, Gazprom said it would consider annulling the shareholder agreement meant to implement the project after Poland's anti-monopoly watchdog objected to the consortium that was to finance, build and operate the pipeline.However, Gazprom has said the 9.9 billion euro ($10.7 billion) Nord Stream 2 will go ahead. The company is partnered in the project by Uniper (DE:UN01), Wintershall (DE:BASFn) (WINT.UL), Shell (L:RDSa), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE).""We have been searching and have already found ways of this project's implementation with the participation of our foreign partners ... These would be the same partners,"" Medvedev told Reuters. ""I'm rather sure that a solution that will not be in contradiction with European or member states' regulation will be found ... Spending should be done this year,"" he said.Medvedev also said Nord Stream 2 could feed Britain with natural gas.""Subject to the signing of the contracts, it could go. Interconnectors are available. BBL could bring us to the United Kingdom even without any additional investments or substantial investments,"" he said. BBL is a natural gas interconnector between the Netherlands and Britain. Nord Stream 2 is intended to bypass Ukraine, a key route for Russian gas flows to Europe, as rows between Moscow and Kiev have previously led to stoppages in supplies from Russia.Due to political tensions between the two neighbors, Ukraine has not bought Russian gas since 2015. Kiev has proposed to raise tariffs for Russian gas transportation, irking Gazprom.Medvedev said the company was ready for talks with Kiev.He also said the company would continue auctioning its gas in northwest Europe, with the next sale planned for early summer.OMV DEALAnother big Gazprom project, an asset swap with Austrian energy group OMV (VI:OMVV), has also yet to clear the final hurdle.Gazprom agreed in December on a long-awaited deal with OMV to swap a 24.9 percent holding in the Achimov IV and V formations of its huge Siberian Urengoy field for a 38.5 percent stake in OMV's Norway holding company.OMV has said it expected the deal to close in mid-2017.But Norwegian authorities have not yet approved the deal and Gazprom had previously said the Scandinavian country, traditionally an energy competitor of Russia, did not want Gazprom to get more than 25 percent in OMV's Norway unit.""Our partner OMV was in contact with Norwegian authorities ... At this stage it's informal consultations,"" Medvedev said, adding more talks with OMV could follow once Norway's new oil minister, appointed last month, was ready.Asked whether he was optimistic that Norway would clear the deal, Medvedev said: ""Don't think about bad things and the bad things will not come. I'm positive. I'm optimistic.""On another possible asset deal, the proposed acquisition from Gazprom of four of the Arctic's Tambey gas fields by Russian No. 2 gas producer Novatek (MM:NVTK), Medvedev said the company was reluctant to sell the deposits.He also said Gazprom had no plan to sell its 10 percent stake in Novatek. ""This is a core asset,"" he said. ($1 = 0.9292 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

324,"Dec 14, 2016 07:32AM ET","Exclusive: Maersk, DONG oil and gas merger talks stall over price - sources",nan,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Ron BoussoCOPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) and DONG Energy (CO:DENERG) to merge their oil and gas business have stalled after the two Danish firms could not agree on a price, industry and banking sources said on Wednesday.The breakdown in talks aimed at creating a joint company worth more than $10 billion may open the door for other bids for DONG's operations, which it is spinning off as it moves away from fossil fuels to focus on offshore wind, the sources said.Maersk entered talks with DONG in November after announcing plans to merge or spin off its energy assets as part of a major restructuring to shift the company's focus to its transport and logistics businesses.The development will be a blow for Maersk, which said on Tuesday it may consider selling assets or cutting dividends as it seeks to retain its credit rating, which is at risk. In June, Maersk announced it had lost a major oil production contract in Qatar, adding to capital pressures. Several private equity funds, including EIG Global Energy Partners, have shown interest in DONG, according to banking sources.Maersk, DONG and EIG were not immediately available to comment.This was the second merger attempt of the two businesses in recent years, the sources said. Bringing together the two Danish companies' oil and gas divisions was seen by many in the industry as a natural fit, creating a company focused on the UK and Norwegian North Sea. But they were unable to agree on the valuation of their assets and the terms of the merger, several sources close to the talks said.The negotiations were unlikely to resume ""any time soon"", according to one source.Maersk's Baa1 credit rating was put under review for a downgrade by Moody's in September. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered the company's credit rating to BBB from BBB+ with a negative outlook.Maersk said separately this week its planned acquisition of German shipping company Hamburg Süd will replace some 60 percent of revenue lost when the group spins off its energy division.Nevertheless,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note this week that all of Maersk's energy units remained under pressure due to sluggish markets and finding ways to cut costs.Deal making in the North Sea has slowed in the past few years partly as a result of a global oil price slump and a sharp rise in the number of assets offered for sale in the aging basin. Companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) are seeking to sell their North Sea operations.DONG produced 89,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in 2016, down from 115,000 barrels daily last year. Its main producing assets include the Ormen Lange, Syd Arne and Laggan-Tormore fields.Maersk Oil produced an average of 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first nine months of 2016. It suffered a major setback when Qatar chose not to extend its 25-year license to operate the giant Al Shaheen field and award it from 2017 to  Total  (PA:TOTF).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

357,"Sep 19, 2016 09:30AM ET",EU opens probe into tax deals between Luxembourg and Engie,nan,"By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators opened a probe on Monday into tax deals granted by Luxembourg to French power utility Engie, stepping up the EU's campaign against tax avoidance by multinationals.The European Commission said it had concerns the tax rulings granted by Luxembourg since 2008 appeared to treat the same financial transaction as both debt and equity, leading to double non-taxation of companies in the GDF Suez (PA:ENGIE) group, as Engie was formerly known.That may have given GDF Suez an unfair advantage over other companies in breach of EU state aid rules, the Commission said.""Financial transactions can be taxed differently depending on the type of transaction, equity or debt - but a single company cannot have the best of two worlds for one and the same transaction,"" Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner, said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Engie said the company took note of the decision and would cooperate fully with the Commission to answer its questions.Engie has been present in Luxembourg since 1933 and employs about 300 people, she said.Luxembourg also said it would provide the Commission with all the necessary information. The government said it believed no particular fiscal treatment or selective advantage had been granted to the Engie companies.Only last month Vestager made headlines by ordering Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, angering both Washington and Dublin.Vestager will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a trip to the United States this week, where she has been criticized for allegedly targeted U.S. companies, something the EU denies.A Commission spokesman said it was a coincidence the investigation into Engie, a French company, was opened the same week.The financial transactions are loans granted in 2009 and 2011 between four companies in the GDF Suez group that can be converted into equity and bear zero interest for the lender.""The final result seems to be that a significant proportion of the profits recorded by GDF Suez in Luxembourg through the two arrangements are not taxed at all,"" the Commission said.The borrower companies - GDF Suez Treasury Management and GDF Suez LNG Supply - were able to significantly reduce their taxable profits in Luxembourg by deducting the provisioned interest payments, which are tax deductible expenses, it said.The lender companies - LNG Luxembourg and Electrabel Invest Luxembourg - avoided paying any tax on the profits from the transaction because Luxembourg tax rules exempt income from equity investments from taxation, the Commission said.A Commission spokesman said it was too early to say how much tax Engie may have to pay if it is found to have breached state aid rules.The EU has already launched investigations into tax deals granted by Luxembourg to other multinationals such as McDonald's and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In December last year the Commission ordered carmaker Fiat to pay back up to 30 million euros to Luxembourg.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

395,"May 05, 2016 12:20PM ET",Oil rivals cooperate to slash equipment costs: Shell,nan,"By Ron BoussoLONDON (Reuters) - Ten oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Chevron  (N:CVX) and  BP  (L:BP) are working together to develop standard production equipment, a rare cooperation among rivals to save money as low oil prices put pressure on budgets.Bespoke valves, paints and underwater equipment are among the items that could be mass-produced at a cheaper cost, Harry Brekelmans, Shell's Projects and Technology Director told Reuters.The companies also want to set up institutions to find future savings after the past two years' industry downturn led to a near standstill in new project approvals.""We're coming together with a number of other operators and suppliers to focus on standardization and common requirements and pushing it all the way into how we can create common inventory,"" Brekelmans said in a phone interview on Wednesday. The other companies involved in the project are France's  Total  (PA:TOTF), Sonangol, Eni (MI:ENI) , Woodside (AX:WPL), Engie (PA:ENGIE), Saudi Aramco, and  Statoil  (OL:STL). Industry executives have long complained about inefficiencies that stem from companies' desire to protect patents for parts as simple as bolts, ladders and paints to complex high-pressure pipe systems.A number of services companies have already teamed up over the past two years in an effort to reduce costs of field development and technology, including FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI) and  Technip  (PA:TECF).Four years of oil prices over $100 prior to the mid-2014 crash led to spiraling costs in the sector as producers raced to develop frontier oil fields in ever deeper waters with more complex technology.But a 60 percent drop in oil prices over the past two years sent companies into a desperate drive to cut budgets and save costs, pushing standardization high up the agenda and Brekelmans believes there is commitment from senior executives.""We have to be far more thoughtful about how we create sustainability,"" Brekelmans said.He said the companies should benefit from the developments even if the oil price recovers. He said the initiative, which is known as the project for Standardization of Equipment Specifications for Procurement and is backed by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, could save Shell and other companies billions of dollars. However, some analysts were skeptical about how easy it would be for the rivals to collaborate.""It is still too early to say whether the push for standardization is working,"" said Jon Clark, oil and gas advisor at EY.""While this is an industry that prides itself for its technology it has not always been unable to work together to lower costs even as companies try to adjust to the lower price environment.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

397,"May 03, 2016 08:23AM ET","GE wants become big player in offshore wind, eyes Adwen takeover",nan,"By Geert De ClercqPARIS (Reuters) -  General Electric  (N:GE) wants to become a major player in the offshore wind industry and is interested in buying the Areva-Gamesa (PA:AREVA) (MC:GAM) offshore joint venture Adwen, GE's new head of renewables said on Tuesday.Following its takeover of the energy assets of French  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), GE in November 2015 created a global renewable energy business unit with sales of 9 billion euros ($10.42 billion), staff of 13,000, and its headquarters in France. The resulting enlarged unit has built about 25 percent of the world's installed base of hydropower and more than 20 percent of global onshore wind capacity, but has virtually no presence in the capital-intensive offshore business, which GE had always steered clear of.""We have the ambition to become one of the three major players in the offshore wind market,"" GE renewables head Jerome Pecresse told reporters in Paris on Tuesday. He added it was too soon to discuss a market share target. Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) is European market leader for offshore wind with 63.5 percent of installed capacity end 2015, followed by MHI Vestas (CO:VWS) (T:7011) with 18.5 pct. With the acquisition of Alstom, GE also acquired contracts to build 1,500 megawatts of offshore wind on the French coast for utility EDF (PA:EDF), which are set to be built by 2019. Areva-Gamesa joint venture Adwen also has contracts to build 1,500 MW of offshore wind on the French coast for utilities Engie (PA:ENGIE) and  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE).But Germany's Siemens is negotiating a takeover of  Gamesa  and has no interest in acquiring Adwen, which is blocking the Siemens-Gamesa talks, sources have told Reuters.Pecresse said that GE may be interested in buying Adwen, but that no talks had been held with the companies involved.""We are in favour of a strong French offshore industry and a consolidation of the French players would contribute to that. We look at the evolution of Adwen's capital with interest,"" he said, adding that one big French offshore wind player would make more sense than two smaller ones.Adwen accounted for 5.7 pct of the installed offshore wind base in Europe at the end of 2015, but came second in terms of installations with an 18.2 percent share of newbuild. Industry specialists say that from a competition perspective, it would be difficult for Siemens to buy Adwen and that a third big player in offshore wind would boost competition and help lower prices in the industry.($1 = 0.8639 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

412,"Feb 25, 2016 07:40AM ET","Dynegy, Energy Capital to buy Engie's U.S. power plants ",nan,"(Reuters) - U.S. electric power company Dynegy Inc (N:DYN) said it had partnered with private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to buy French utility Engie SA's (PA:ENGIE) U.S. power plants worth $3.3 billion to expand in regulated power markets. Falling demand for electricity in the United States due to increased energy efficiency has led to a spate of mergers as utilities look to cut their exposure to unregulated markets, where prices are volatile.The deal will give Dynegy presence in the Texas market, which is currently controlled by grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).Houston-based Dynegy said the acquisition would also boost its presence in New England, managed by grid operator ISO New England, and in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, run by PJM Interconnection.Dynegy, which will own 65 percent of the joint venture, said the acquisition would add about 8,731 megawatts (MW) to its generation capacity, taking the total to 35,000 MW across PJM, ISO New England, ERCOT and other regulated power markets.Dynegy will invest about $770 million and Energy Capital will invest about $415 million in the joint venture, expected to generate about $90 million in annual synergies.The partnership has secured financing with $2.25 billion in committed debt facilities and $1.19 billion in equity commitments, Dynegy said on Thursday.Energy Capital will also buy $150 million of Dynegy stock at $10.94 per share, which will raise its holding in the company to about 15 percent.Dynegy's shares closed at $8.32 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.Energy Capital, which focuses on North America's energy infrastructure, will receive one board seat in Dynegy as long as it holds more than 10 percent common stock of the company.Energy Capital will have the right to exit the joint venture four years after the deal closes, either through a sale of its interest to Dynegy or a sale of the entire joint venture.Up to Wednesday's close, Dynegy's shares had fallen nearly 72 percent in the past 12 months.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The company must present its operational and strategic choices before the state will rush into any financial operations,"" Macron said.Asked whether the state was considering a capital increase, Macron said ""the priority for the company is to clearly present its real financial and operational situation and to put in place a turnaround plan before any operation whatsoever can be considered"".The French state owns 87 percent of the capital of Areva, which said last week it would book a 4.9 billion euro ($5.48 billion) 2014 loss due to depreciations and writedowns. Last week, Macron shot down the possibility of selling shares in state-owned EDF (PA:EDF) or GDF Suez (PA:GSZ) to raise funds for a capital injection.He declined to comment on whether the state could use part of the billion euros raised by the sale of a 4 percent stake in defense group  Safran  (PA:SAF) on Monday.Union sources told Reuters on Friday that Areva's new management team of Chief Executive Philippe Knoche and Chairman Philippe Varin was unlikely to make major announcements about possible alliances or asset sales on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

481,"Feb 27, 2015 08:59AM ET",Exclusive: Areva to cut wage bill 15 percent as prospects worsen - union sources,nan,"By Emmanuel Jarry and Benjamin MalletPARIS (Reuters) - French nuclear group Areva (PA:AREVA) plans to cut 15 percent of its wage bill to save 300 million euros ($337 million) a year within three years amid worsening sales prospects for its reactors, union sources briefed by the new management team said.However, a complete financial turnaround plan for the group, which employs some 45,000 people, will not be ready for months, the sources said ahead of the company's results and strategic update on March 4.The sources said Chief Executive Philippe Knoche told staff this week that the state-controlled company was likely to sell only about a dozen EPR reactors in total in the years up to 2030, down from 25 predicted previously.Areva is weighed down by heavy debt and suffering from an industry slowdown, a lack of orders, and legal troubles over a nuclear installation in Finland.Knoche and Chairman Philippe Varin were appointed in January to fix the company.A takeover of the 87 percent state-owned Areva by much larger power utility EDF (PA:EDF) - its main customer and another state-backed group - is not part of any plan, the sources said, although closer ties are a possibility.""We won't be merging with EDF but there will some government decisions made around the fact that our two businesses should become official partners,"" said one union official.The sources said the March 4 results would likely offer the ""broad principles"" of the plan but not the details, which could be forthcoming by June.Earlier this week French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said a capital increase for Areva was not a priority and ruled out selling state-held shares in EDF and another utility, GDF Suez (PA:GSZ), to finance support for the group.His intervention followed Areva's fifth profit warning in seven months in which it said it expected to suffer a 4.9 billion euros ($5.6 billion) loss for 2015, hit by writedowns on the value of its assets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

482,"Feb 10, 2015 10:09PM ET","Exclusive: France's Sigfox taps Telefonica, GDF Suez to raise $113 million - sources",nan,"By Sophie SassardLONDON (Reuters) - French start-up Sigfox has raised 100 million euros ($112.80 million) from seven heavy-weight investors to help it build new networks globally to connect everything from washing machines to smart meters to the Internet, sources said.The deal, to be announced on Wednesday, is poised to beat French ride-sharing company BlaBlaCar's $100 million fund raising last summer, the sources familiar with the matter said.It is the third time since it was founded by French entrepreneur Ludovic Le Moan five years ago that Sigfox has turned to investors to finance its growth, as the firm aims to roll out its network in 60 countries within the next five years. Investors include Spain's Telefonica and France's GDF Suez, the sources said. Telecoms operators NTT Docomo of Japan, SK Telecom of South Korea, France's Air Liquide and U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have also invested in Sigfox, the sources said. Sigfox's network covers France, Spain, the Netherlands and 10 of the UK's larger cities. The money raised on Wednesday will finance a roll out in the United States, Latin America, Japan and South Korea with the help of its new corporate investors, which have also signed commercial agreements with Sigfox. The company currently has several millions of objects connected. In Spain, it has equipped five million flats with anti-intrusion alarms with its partner Securitas Direct. Sigfox builds low-energy, low-cost wireless networks to connect objects such as electricity meters, smart watches or washing machines, providing the infrastructure that makes the so-called Internet of Things possible (IOT). Such objects emit small amounts of data at a time and need to be constantly on, so Sigfox is betting that its technology is better suited to this than existing mobile networks owned by telecom operators. That Telefonica is backing Sigfox signals confidence in its technology, and also turns a potential rival into an ally. For industrial gases supplier Air Liquide, teaming up with Sigfox will allow it to track gas bottles all over the world. Having a financial partner like Elliott will also help the French startup build its credibility in order to win new markets, especially in the U.S., the sources said.""They're like the Vodafone of the Internet of Things. They're not running the applications themselves, they're providing the network,"" said William Webb, chief executive of non-profit firm The Weightless SIG which lobbies for open standards in machine-to-machine-communication. ""They're the furthest along at the moment,"" he said, referring to others in the field such as Nwave and Senaptic. Most investors are also looking to recoup their investment through a possible public listing of Sigfox in the coming few years, the sources said. Sigfox currently charges one euro per object connected and is aiming to have at least 100 million of them by 2020, which would translate to 100 million euros in revenue from 3 million euros in 2014, one of the sources said. In ""The Internet of Things: Sizing up the opportunity"", McKinsey consultants forecast that by 2020, the market for connected devices would be between 20 billion or 30 billion units.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

 By Simon Jessop	 LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - European shares snapped a
three-day winning streak on Wednesday as hopes for imminent
political action to contain the region's debt crisis were capped
by a lack of detail, leaving equities on course to rack up a
fifth straight month of losses.	 Given the scale of recent gains, however -- more than 7
percent -- the pullback was relatively muted and in low volume
that showed a lack of willingness among some investors to take
aggressive positions ahead of quarter-end, traders said.	 Financial services led fallers across the region after hedge
fund Man Group , down 25 percent in heavy volume more
than four and a half times its 90-day average, reported large
outflows over the summer. 	 Adding to the sector's woes were proposals for a financial
transaction tax from the European Commission, whose plan for a
0.1 percent tax on stock and bond trades hit exchanges such as
Deutsche Boerse . 	 Elsewhere, the downwards move was led by a fresh slide in
commodities and commodity stocks such as Antofagasta ,
down 5.9 percent, and BHP Billiton , down 4.1 percent, on
persistent concern about the growth outlook. 	 For the broader market the focus remains firmly on the twin
macroeconomic headwinds of slowing economic growth and the euro
zone debt crisis.	 International auditors returned to Greece as Athens looks to
secure the funds needed to avoid a near-term default, which
Germany said is needed before any fresh talks over Greece's
second bailout package. 	 ""The uncertainty is huge in the complex political process
we're seeing played out,"" said Peter Sullivan, head of equity
strategy for the United States and Europe at HSBC, who
recommends a focus on high-yield stocks to counter that
uncertainty.	 Key to the recent gains has been a belief politicians will
boost the region's bailout fund past the 440 billion euros level
agreed in July -- even though this has yet to be signed off by
national parliaments, including in Germany. 	 While there was no simple, smooth path out of the crisis,
""the debate has now moved to 'how big does a rescue fund have to
be?', where the week before it wasn't even being discussed. So
although we have no concrete news, I think the debate has moved
to a more optimistic outlook,"" Sullivan said.	 A London-based portfolio trader at a U.S. investment bank
said the market had started to ""discount away the potential for
a downwards 10 to 15 percent move because of (any) default of
Greece.	  LESS LIKELY	 ""The (political) rhetoric coming out seems to have appeased
concerns about that potential outcome. People are less nervous.
Not to say it can't happen, but people believe it as a less
likely outcome,"" the trader added.	 By the close, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
European shares was down 1.2 percent at 927.28 points, after
adding 4.5 percent in the previous session. It remains down 4.1
percent in September and 17.3 percent in 2011.	 Volumes were low, however, at 84 percent of their 90-day
daily average.	 In yet another choppy session, defensive sectors and
""quality"" stocks were the main winners, along with some
periphery-exposed banking stocks that have been heavily sold off
recently.	 Best off in the broad market retreat from risk were
defensive sectors including healthcare , telecoms 
and utilities , all of which outperformed.	 ""The interesting thing is the continuous purchase of
quality. Throughout this move up and move down, quality stocks
continue to outperform, and a lot of defensive stocks actually
screen well for quality, whether it's earnings quality, dividend
yield etc,"" the portfolio trader said.	 Alternatively, a short-term tactical trade based on earnings
revisions was another good option, said HSBC's Sullivan, as
""earnings downgrades are like the cockroach theory, in that
there's never just one"".   	 Didier Duret, global chief investment officer of ABN AMRO
Private Banking, which manages 170 billion euros, was more
optimistic. 	 ""We are one of the rare birds to have equities on an slight
'overweight' since mid-August. The rationale is grounded on the
fact that the risk of global recession is overstated by the
financial markets,"" he said. One key bet is the materials sector, which has been heavily
sold off on the recession fears, but which could bounce sharply,
while Duret also liked consumer staples for their cashflow
qualities, along with high-dividend stocks such as GDF Suez
 , Vodafone and Sanofi .

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Aug 10(Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday,
boosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve promising to keep interest
rates near zero for at least two more years, though some
strategists cautioned that this move indicated a lack of
optimism on economic growth.	 Shares extended a rally into a second day following a steep
drop that had taken equities into a ""bear market"". 	 The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday took the unprecedented
step of promising to keep interest rates near zero until 2013,
at the earliest, and said it would consider further steps to
help growth, sparking a rebound in stocks. 	 ""On the one hand it's a good thing as it provides liquidity
and may be a precursor to QE3. The other side is that they are
anticipating the long-term underperformance of the economy,""
said Ian King head of international equities at Legal & General,
which has 356 billion pounds under management.	 At 1106 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 0.8 percent at 955.88 points, adding
to a 1.2 percent gain on Tuesday. A losing streak in the
previous seven sessions had taken more than 14 percent off the
index. 	  Investors have cut their exposure to risky assets such as
stocks following an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis, the
United States losing its triple-A credit rating and weak
economic data from major economies that have sparked concern
they may go back into recession. 	 The index is still down more than 19 percent from its 2011
peak of mid-February. Earlier this week, it was down more than
20 percent from this high, which qualifies as a bear market.	 The fall has made some stocks look cheap, even though
earnings forecasts are being cut. Equity valuations on Thomson
Reuters Datastream showed the STOXX Europe 600 carrying
a one-year forward price-to-earnings of 9.6 against a 10-year
average of more than 13. 	 ""Yes, markets do look cheap. However, we could have years
and years of low growth to pay back our debts,"" Louise Cooper,
markets analyst at BGC Partners, said. 	 Positive earnings news also boosted the market on Wednesday.
  British insurer Standard Life surged 12.8 percent after
reporting a bigger-than-expected 44 percent jump in first-half
profit, and said an investment programme that has been
criticised by some analysts and investors was paying off. 
 	 Other insurers to gain included Aviva , and Legal &
General , up 3.5 and 3.4 percent respectively. 	 GDF Suez rose 2.8 percent after the French utility
unveiled first-half earnings that beat forecasts.
 	 Across Europe, Germany's DAX rose 2.2 percent; and
Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC40 rose 1.1
and 0.6 percent respectively.	
	 GROWTH OUTLOOK	 The Bank of England added to investors' concerns about
growth, cutting its forecasts. By the fourth quarter of 2011,
the BoE now sees an annual rate of growth of 2.0 percent, down
from 2.5 percent in May. 	 L&G's Ian King said he expected growth to be ""anaemic"" but
did not believe there would be a return to recession, though he
said more investors were now pricing in a recession. 	 ""We were much more optimistic earlier in the year on the
basis that we would see concerted action from policymakers, but
we just haven't seen it.""	 But he pointed to ""a successful bond auction in Italy, with
quite a low yield, that's given people some heart.""	 Italy sold 6.5 billion euros of one-year T-bills on
Wednesday in a sale which analysts said went well after the
European Central Bank's buying of the country's debt earlier
this week brought borrowing costs significantly lower.
 	 However, Italian banks fell as traders said investors could
be swapping their bank shares into Italian bonds.	 UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo fell 4
percent and 4.4 percent respectively.	  Also on the downside, world No. 1 staffing company Adecco
 fell 7.3 percent after suffering a margin squeeze in
the first half of 2011 as firms postponed new IT projects,
particularly in the United States.

509,"Apr 13, 2011 11:08AM ET",UPDATE 1-Veolia affiliate to quit Moroccan transport deal,nan," * Rabat mayor: financial loss forces Veolia affiliate out * 15-year contract was won in 2009 * Anti-Veolia protests planned on Thursday  (Adds protest organizer, background) By Souhail Karam RABAT, April 13 (Reuters) - Financial losses are forcing
Stareo, an affiliate of French Veolia Environnement, to quit a
contract to operate the bus system in Morocco's capital Rabat,
the city's mayor told Reuters on Wednesday. Formed by Veolia Transport and Moroccan groups Bouzid and
Hakam, the Stareo consortium won the contract in 2009. It is
among Veolia affiliates that have been coming under greater
public scrutiny amid a wave of protests in the former French
protectorate. ""Stareo have considered that they are making financial
losses from the operation and they are preparing to leave and we
for our part are getting ready to find a replacement,"" Fathallah
Oualalou said. He was commenting on a report that was first published by
Moroccan news portal Lakome.com citing unnamed sources. Oualalou noted, however, that Stareo's decision to abandon
the 15-year contract had nothing to do with a planned protest
called by a youth-led movement demanding the cancellation of
contracts awarded to Veolia's affiliates in Rabat and the
northern cities of Tangier and Tetouan. ""As far as Stareo is concerned, the firm had to deal with a
legacy of 20 to 30 years of problems that affected public
transportation and those problems could not be brought under
control ... They have not been able to respond to the needs of
the sector,"" said Oualalou. Veolia Environnement also has affiliates that have won three
concession contracts to provide water, wastewater and
electricity services managed by Redal for the cities of Rabat
and its twin city Sale and by Amendis for the cities of Tangiers
and Tetouan.
 In a rare occurence, protesters attacked premises linked to
French firms in the Moroccan city of Tangier in February in a
dispute over Amendis management.  Lydec, affiliated to GDF Suez, provides water and
electricity services in Casablanca, Morocco's biggest city.
Moroccan newspapers have recently been extensively reporting on
a political storm involving the city's council's perceived
silence over poor services provided by the company. February 20 Movement, a youth protest movement spearheading
calls for deep political and economic reform in the country, on
Monday announced plans for protests to demand that Stareo, Redal
and Amendis contracts be cancelled for allegedly short-changing
the final users. ""Redal and Amendis' tarriffs are the highest in Morocco yet
whenever it rains we end up with floods. They also don't clean
the poor districts of Rabat and Sale. Children there play in the
middle of garbage,"" said Najib Chawki, a member of the February
20 movement. ""We are protesting against all Veolia's affiliates in
Morocco. When we look at those firms and Lydec, we can't help
but wonder if there is some form of economic corruption going
on,"" Chawki said. The February 20 Movement is ""not against the presence of
French firms in the country. ""We want any relations to be based on transparency and not
on the basis of privileges and the extorsion of our country in
exchange for political support. The French tutorship over
Morocco must end,"" he added.

510,"Apr 13, 2011 07:48AM ET",UPDATE 1-Snam RG interested in GDF Italy gas network,nan," * GDF Suez grid seen worth 750 million euros * SRG has access to data room - CEO * No plans for Terna merger, no Libya impact - CEO * SRG shares up 0.5 percent, in line with sector 
 (Adds details, background, byline, shares) By Giancarlo Navach MILAN, April 13 (Reuters) - Italy's natural gas grid Snam
Rete Gas is interested in the Italian gas network owned by
France's GDF Suez, as it moves to expand its distribution
business.Snam Rete Gas (SRG) will look at data for the network, CEO
Carlo Malacarne told reporters on the sidelines of a shareholder
assembly on Wednesday. The assets, known as G6 Rete Gas, have a regulated asset
base of about 750 million euros ($1.09 billion). ""The point we need to understand is how the network is
distributed. For us, it's important to consolidate our
activity,"" Malacarne said. G6 had about 1.2 million customers last year, with 4 billion
cubic metres of gas sold. GDF Suez had no immediate comment. Financial sources said in February that GDF Suez was
exploring the sale of its Italian gas distribution assets after
completing its takeover of Britain's International Power Plc. A source close to the issue said last month that GDF Suez
would start due diligence for the network in early April with
five or six potential buyers. GDF Suez Chief Executive Gerard
Mestrallet has said no decision has been taken on a possible
sale. Asked about a possible merger between SRG and Italian power
grid operator Terna, Malacarne said there were no plans for such
a deal. He told the shareholder assembly that the halt to Libyan gas
imports because of fighting in the North African country had had
no impact on accounts or operations. Shares in SRG were up 0.5 percent at 4.058 euros at 1108
GMT, in line with the STOXX Europe 600 oil and gas index.

their highest close in nearly four weeks on Tuesday, with energy
firms gaining after further unrest in the Middle East pushed
crude prices to a two-and-a-half year high.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.2
percent to 1,143.94 points, the highest close since March 9.
Volumes were 94 percent of the index's 90-day average. Brent crude topped $122, and hit its highest in two and a
half years, as the prospect of a stalemate prolonging the loss
of 1.3 million barrels a day of exports from Libya loomed, amid
unsuccessful efforts to end the war and as clashes over the oil
town of Brega intensified. Energy firms to gain included Total, BP and BG, up between
0.4 percent and 1.2 percent. The pan-European index is up 7.2 percent from a mid-March
low, as investors focus more on the strength of the economic
recovery, confident it will not be significantly affected by
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, or Japan's nuclear
crisis.  Analysts said shares could gain further, even as monetary
policy tightens, including an expected rise in European Central
Bank interest rates this week. China's central bank raised
interest rates for the second time this year on Tuesday,
redoubling efforts to cool stubborn price pressures. ""Equities will be the preferred choice - the price bubble in
bonds is about to burst - yields are not going to stay as low as
they are,"" said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in
Frankfurt. He added that he expected construction-related stocks to be
among those outperforming, as they look to help with rebuilding
projects in Japan. Growth in the vast U.S. services sector slowed last month
and price pressures eased slightly, according to an industry
report released on Tuesday, but overall activity expanded for a
16th straight month. But Ruland noted the continued growth in the employment
component, albeit at a slightly lower rate than in the previous
month.  Tech shares firmed, after Texas Instruments late on
Monday offered to buy National Semiconductor in a deal worth
$6.5 billion, a premium of 78 percent. Infineon Technologies rose 3.9 percent, while
STMicroelectronics added 2.9 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent;
Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 were flat.
 Portugal's benchmark fell 1 percent and Spain's IBEX fell
0.7 percent.  Euro zone peripheral issues persisted, pushing bond yields
in certain countries higher.  Portuguese bond yields hit fresh euro lifetime highs on
Tuesday and were expected to top 10 percent in the next few days
as a new credit rating downgrade added to pressure on the
country to seek aid.  FRENCH UTILITIES FALL        French utilities EDF and GDF Suez fell 3.7 and 1.9 percent
respectively after France cancelled a planned increase in gas
prices and cut the size of electricity price hikes to appease
public discontent with rising energy costs. Among other individual shares, German conglomerate Siemens
 fell 1.3 percent after it said it expected business to slow in
the coming months. Bayer fell 3.6 percent after a late-stage trial showed its
anti-blood-clotting Xarelto pill failed to benefit patients bed
ridden due to acute illness.   The Euro STOXX 50, the euro zone's blue-chip index, fell
0.2 percent to 2,950.96.  Analysts said while the short-term technical picture for the
STOXX 50 index had improved following gains in the previous
sessions, the index was looking relatively overbought. ""The latest price action shows that it could be encountering
resistance in the form of its 50-day moving average. It is
possible that selling pressures could develop at these levels,""
said Bill McNamara, technical analyst at Charles Stanley. Some caution prevailed ahead of the release of the Federal
Open Market Committee's minutes from its March 15 meeting, due
at 1800 GMT, for insight on the outlook for U.S. interest rates.

519,"Oct 22, 2009 10:15AM ET","EDF, rivals have not agreed nuclear price -producers",nan," PARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The French electricity producers'
Association (UFE) denied a press report that state-owned 
utility EDF had agreed with its rivals on prices at which it
would supply them with nuclear electricity to bolster
competition.
The economic daily Les Echos newspaper said on Thursday that
the parties had agreed that, as of 2010, EDF's rivals could buy
electricity from the former monopoly's nuclear power plants at
about 34 euros ($50.90) per megawatt hour, a price that would
gradually increase to 55-60 euros until 2020. ""The UFE denies the information of Les Echos newspaper which
says that an agreement had taken place in the sector on a price
level,"" the Union Francaise de l'Electricite said in a
statement. The government last month announced it wanted to reform the
French market to foster more competition, in line with European
Union demands.. The market has been fully liberalised since July 2007 but
EDF still owns all of France's 58 nuclear reactor, which provide
an 80 percent share in overall electricity consumption. Competitors such as Poweo or GDF Suez are struggling to
attract clients because they do not have access to baseload
electricity output. The government reform plan includes ending state-set
electricity tariffs for industries by 2015 and allowing rival

one-year highs to end lower on Tuesday, pressured by weaker than
expected U.S. housing data, with a sharp decline in Barclays on
a stake sale by Qatar dragging down financials. Corporate results were mixed and investors awaited more
earnings for companies such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo,
Amazon, American Express and Cadbury this week for clearer
market direction. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.5
percent lower at 1,021.29 points after hitting 1,031 -- a
12-month high for a fourth straight session. Financial stocks took the most points off the index, with
Barclays falling 4.8 percent after Qatar sold a 1.3 billion
pound ($2.1 billion) stake in the British bank, stoking talk it
will use a big profit to make a fresh move on UK food retailer
J. Sainsbury. Sainsbury shares jumped 5.4 percent. Other banks also fell, with HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland,
Credit Agricole, Natixis and Credit Suisse falling 0.7 to 2.2
percent. The DJ STOXX banking index, which has spiked 174
percent since its March lows, fell 0.8 percent. ""Everything that derails the view that the worst is behind
us and that the economy will grow strongly in 2010 can hurt the
market,"" said Philippe Gijsels, senior strategist at Fortis BNP
in Brussels. ""Today we saw that the U.S. housing data was not that
fantastic,"" he added. Positive sentiment following forecast-beating results from
Texas Instruments and Apple on Monday was dampened by data
showing new construction of U.S. homes rose by less than
expected in September, held back by a plunge in ground-breaking
activity for multi-family homes. The U.S. Commerce Department said housing starts rose 0.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000 units,
below market expectations for 610,000.  FOCUS ON EARNINGS  ""Deals are being done and the market is being propped up by
a little bit of buying here and a little bit of selling there. 
However the overriding focus is on the earnings season, which
has been mixed to say the least,"" said Angus Campbell, head of
sales at Capital Spreads. Bank of New York Mellon Corp reported a third-quarter net
loss on Tuesday, Coca-Cola posted lower-than-expected revenue,
Pfizer registered higher third-quarter profit and Caterpillar
beat earnings forecasts. Dutch grocer Ahold fell 3.7 percent after reporting that
sales grew more slowly in the third quarter as food prices fell
and recession-hit shoppers switched to cheaper goods. Drugmakers also came under pressure. AstraZeneca,
GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Roche Holding and Sanofi-Aventis fell
0.1 to 1.9 percent. Adecco, the world's top staffing company, said it was buying
rival MPS Group but its shares fell 5.3 percent. Deutsche Bank AG was down 1.2 percent. It has agreed in
principle to buy some ABN AMRO assets from the Dutch state in a
deal which should clear the way for a merger of nationalised
banks ABN and Fortis Bank Nederland. On the positive side, utilities shares were among the top
gainers. E.ON, National Grid, RWE, GDF Suez and Centrica rose 1
to 1.5 percent. The FTSEurofirst index, which slumped 45 percent last year,
is still up 23 percent in 2009 and has surged 58 percent since
hitting a record low in March this year. But it is down 37
percent from a multi-year high reached in 2007. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 fell 0.5-0.7 percent.

postponed to next week due to its French partner GDF Suez's
doubts about the Italian utility's business plan and debt
levels, a source close to the Rome company said on Friday. Acea said in a statement on Thursday that it had adjourned
its board meeting -- which was to approve its new business plan
-- to Oct. 21 due to the number of issues that needed to be
addressed. ""The French expressed doubts on the plan and in order not to
go ahead without their approval, it was decided to examine

French utility, which has 9.98 percent of Acea, is keen to
extend this to include natural gas activities. Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno said on Thursday there currently
were no plans to extend the joint venture to the gas sector. The
city of Rome owns 51 percent of Acea. Acea's new business plan would be a stop gap measure ahead

Chairman Gerard Mestrallet said on Wednesday. The French utility is also ready to reach an agreement with
Eni over the Rome distribution gas grid Romana Gas, he added.  Eni sought to sell Romana Gas, valued at around 1.1 billion

the Rome-controlled utility to include natural gas activities.
The French company holds 9.98 percent of Acea. ""We are ready to reach quite a wide accord with Acea, but

525,"Sep 03, 2009 06:06AM ET","SCENARIOS-Possible successors for EDF head, timing uncertain",nan," By Marie Maitre PARIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Pierre Gadonneix's position as
chief executive of French state-owned group EDF has been seen
under threat since running foul of the government this summer
over his calls for bumper rises in electricity tariffs. Here are scenarios on possible successors and the timing of
an appointment to replace him at EDF, the world's biggest
utility group with a market capitalisation of 66 billion euros:  REPLACEMENT NOW OR LATER? French daily newspaper Les Echos reported on Wednesday that
EDF could hold a board meeting on Sept. 23 to decide on a
successor to Gadonneix, 66, whose mandate ends in November. Under EDF's statutes, Gadonneix could seek another mandate
that would end on the eve of his 69th birthday in January 2012. The names of several candidates from industry and political
circles have circulated, but there is no clear contender, which
may lead the government to renew Gadonneix for six to 12 months. But one source close to the situation said French President
Nicolas Sarkozy, who will have the final say in appointing EDF's
new head, was unlikely to further delay the decison.  INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL APPOINTEE? Sarkozy wants an industry leader to take over EDF, two
sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The names of politicians have also been rumoured, including
Sarkozy's speech writer Henri Guaino and former Prime Minister
Alain Juppe, but appointing someone with no industrial
background would not go down well with investors, analysts said.  ALSTOM CEO PATRICK KRON ""Kron would be a dream scenario. He's a proper manager and
has political connections, but let's say he would not go to EDF
for the money"" one analyst said of the 55-year old man who has
turned around a nearly bankrupt Alstom. Kron, who spent 15 years at aluminium group Pechiney after
five years at the French Industry Ministry, has declined
Sarkozy's offer to head EDF, two sources close to the situation
said. ""Kron has told Sarkozy he doesn't want to work in a
state-owned group,"" one of the sources said, adding: ""Leaving
Alstom would also mean giving up on a lot of money."" Alstom's 2008/09 annual report showed that Kron, earned 3.9
million euros including 1.04 million in fixed salary, while
Gadonneix, who has no stock option plans, earned 766,000 euros
in fixed salary. EDF has not yet published his variable income.  VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT CEO HENRI PROGLIO The Veolia CEO, who industry sources say is close to
Sarkozy, is seen as another ""credible"" option, but they doubt he
will leave the world's biggest water group in which he has made
his entire career. Proglio, 60, already turned down the EDF job
in 2004.  GDF SUEZ DEPUTY CEO JEAN-FRANCOIS CIRELLI ""He is the ideal candidate as he is the only one who does
not really have a proper job,"" a second analyst said of Cirelli,
51, who headed Gaz de France before it merged with Suez in 2008. A source close to the issue said Cirelli was ""happy being
No.2"" at GDF Suez, but would accept the EDF job if offered it.  AREVA CEO ANNE LAUVERGEON Lauvergeon has long been rumoured as an option, but industry
sources said she would not leave the nuclear group she built. Other observers said the EDF job would offer Lauvergeon, 50,
a fresh start after a tough year at Areva where she had to bow
to Sarkozy's demand to sell a prized unit to bridge a funding
gap, and faced delays and cost overruns in a landmark
nuclear reactor project in Finland.

the second consecutive day on Thursday, after a choppy session
in which banking stocks retreated from earlier gains and
chemical makers slipped. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 0.5 percent at 968.67 points after being up as much as
976.79 points earlier in a session that saw the index jump
around after U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and jobless
claims data were released. The U.S. GDP figures were not as bad as expected,"" said
Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. ""Markets have
demonstrated a lot of volatility in recent days and I think
markets will see-saw on the back of good and bad news."" ""U.S. jobless figures were a little bit worse than expected,
but still were an improvement on the previous week. These
numbers are volatile and I would not want to base any kind of
assessment on these numbers,"" Dixon said. U.S. jobless claims fell last week to 570,000, slightly
above the 565,000 predicted by analysts. Data also showed that the U.S. economy contracted at an
annualised rate of 1.0 percent in the second quarter, the same
as its initial reading. Analysts had predicted a downwardly
revised reading of -1.5 percent. Banks reversed from earlier gains to feature among the worst
performers. HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Dexia, Lloyds Banking Group and
Royal Bank of Scotland were down 0.8 to 7.8 percent. However, Credit Agricole gained 3.7 percent after it posted
better-than-expected, second-quarter profit and said  its
businesses were well placed despite the tough economic
environment.  BAYER FALLS Chemical stocks were lower. German drugmaker Bayer fell 4.1
percent after traders pointed to concerns that peer Boehringer
Ingelheim may report strong data about its rival drug to Bayer's
anti-blood-clotting pill Xarelto. ""Some people are getting worried (that Boehringer Ingelheim)
will report data on a drug that is the most serious competitor
to Xarelto,"" a local Frankfurt-based trader said. Mining stocks slipped as copper lost 0.1 percent.
Antofagasta, Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto
and Xstrata were 0.4 to 4.1 lower. Beverages were among the big losers on the index. Diageo was
down 4.1 percent after it warned recovery would come in 2010 at
the earliest, prompting it to cut its growth target after it met
forecasts with a 10 percent rise in annual earnings. On the upside, utilities were the top performers. French
power and gas group GDF Suez gained 2 percent after it said it
was confident it would meet its earnings targets despite the
weaker economy that has reduced demand for energy as it
predicted better trading by year-end. A Reuters poll has shown leading investors have kept their
portfolios steady in August, as the northern summer doldrums and
caution about how far the global equity market rally can go led
many to sit back and wait.    Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index
was down 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX was down 0.9 percent and
France's CAC 40 was 0.5 percent lower.

earnings at its investment banking and asset management
divisions. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS

following news in the previous session that state-backed bank
BPCE will provide a safety net of 35 billion euros ($50 billion)

year, shed 6.4 percent after saying late on Wednesday that its

 Japan's yen, which tends to gain at times of economic
adversity, strengthened to its highest level in more than a
month against the dollar and sterling while Japan's Nikkei fell
1.6 percent. Analysts said that investors fretted that a rally in risk
assets since March may have run ahead of a recovery in the
global economy and on worries about the outlook for Chinese
shares, which eased 0.7 percent. But in Europe the outlook seems to be brighter.  German consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in 15
months heading into September, the GfK market research group
said, as lower prices and a stable labour market left consumers
more willing to spend.  Investors will watch U.S. Q2 GDP data and jobless claims

pulling out of recession. German drugmaker Bayer fell 2.9 percent, with traders
pointing to concerns that peer Boehringer Ingelheim may report

 (Recasts with details from analyst conference, shares, analyst) By Marie Maitre PARIS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Suez Environnement cut its 2009
sales and core earnings targets but shares rallied as the French
utility group reported forecast-topping first-half profit
despite a sharp drop in waste business. The world's second-biggest water and waste management group
behind Veolia said on Wednesday it now expected overall
stability in 2009 sales and earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at constant exchange
rates. Suez Environnement, suffering from reduced demand for waste
treatment as industrial and commercial clients cut production,
had previously forecast slightly higher sales and core earnings. The stock was up 8.6 percent to a nine-month peak of 14.16
euros at 0952 GMT as analysts welcomed the results and said the
outlook downgrade was expected given that the group had
previously based its forecasts on a drop of only 2 percent in
gross domestic product in mature economies. The International
Monetary Fund has forecast a 3.8 percent GDP fall in advanced
economies in 2009. ""We think these results are marginally better than bearish
expectations. It supports our view that Suez Environnement is a
more stable company than Veolia,"" said analyst Per Lekander. Earlier this month, Veolia reported a bigger-than-expected
drop in half-year profit but kept its financial targets for the
full year. Suez Environnement reported half-year EBITDA of 951 million
euros ($1.36 billion), down 4.2 percent at constant exchange
rates, on sales down 1.2 percent at 5.87 billion, while net
profit reached 175 million against 201 million a year earlier. This beat average forecasts for EBITDA of 934 million euros
and net profit of 144 million from a Reuters poll of analysts as
strong performances in European water business and international
division helped make up for a poor results in European waste. Chief Executive Jean-Louis Chaussade said a better
second-half performance and increased cost-cutting efforts would
help the group ""cope with a difficult economic environment."" In the first half of 2009, Suez Environnement, which was
spun off from GDF Suez in July 2008, achieved 49 million euros
of the 180 million of cost savings it is targeting for 2008
through 2010, Chaussade said, adding he expected the group to
meet the 180 million euro goal ""sooner than expected"".  LOWER WASTE MANAGEMENT Core earnings at Suez Environnement's European water unit
were up 10.4 percent at 420 million euros after new contracts in
Spain and France, while the international business generated
profit of 197 million euros, up 4.6 percent year on year. But EBITDA at its European waste unit were down 17.8 percent
at 368 million euros as the economic downturn led many
industrial clients to cut production and sometimes close plants,
reducing their waste volumes. Despite the worse economic environment, the waste sector
remains attractive in the long term thanks to stricter
environmental regulation and new waste recovery technologies,
Suez Environnement said. Analysts have said that a lack of recovery in the waste
industry has hindered share gains for sector leaders Veolia and
Suez Environnement, whose stocks have underperformed the
European utility index since the start of the year. Chaussade ruled out making acquisitions in 2009 but said he
expected new opportunities for deals to arise as soon as the
economic crisis ended. ""We'll try to build on where we are already strong and in
businesses were we are already present. Since 80 percent of our
business is in Europe and that we are strong in water in Britain
and Australia, you can see where our priorities are,"" Chaussade
said.

and grew by 0.3 percent. ""If a sustained recovery is a genuine belief, pullbacks will
be bought into as opposed to it being an opportunity for the
bears to cash in,"" said Brian Myers, analyst at ODL Securities. Equity markets ignored U.S. President Barak Obama's
reappointment of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for a
second term to steer the world's largest economy out of its
deepest downturn since the Great Depression. But analysts said that the news had removed an element of
uncertainty in the market. Utilities shares also lost ground, with Hera, E.ON, GDF Suez
 and Centrica falling between 0.4 percent and 1.9 percent. ""People should be cautious in selecting sectors and
companies. They need to go back to fundamentals, they need to go
back to appraise valuations and make sure that they have a well
diversified portfolio,"" said Valerie Plagnol, chief strategist
at CM-CIC Securities, in Paris. ""There is still potential in the stock market. A lot of cash
is around and a lot of people were late in their investment
strategy,"" she added.  MINERS RETREAT Mining shares fell in line with the broader market and as
copper prices fell 1 percent and aluminium dropped 1.4 percent
on worries that the recent price rise was overdone. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,
Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources fell 1.2-2.7 percent. ""The results season has been dominated by BHP and Rio Tinto
and their cautious outlooks,"" UBS said in a note. ""But we look for a more positive September; Antofagasta and
Kazakhmys will report this week and should specifically
highlight the copper story that surprises both in supply
tightness and in western world restocking."" Energy shares were also down. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG
Group, Tullow Oil, Total and StatoilHydro shed 0.1-0.7 percent. British oil explorer Cairn Energy fell 1.9 percent after
warning that meeting targets for the next stages of the
development was becoming ""increasingly challenging"", as it
reported a first-half loss after tax. Irish group CRH fell 1.4 percent after posting a sharp drop
in first-half pretax profit and saying the rate of decline would
ease in the second half due to cost-cutting and improvements in
its core U.S. market. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 fell 0.1-0.3 percent.
 Later in the session, investors' attention will switch to
key macroeconomic data from the United States on house prices
and consumer confidence.

July existing homes sales lifted investor sentiment on Friday,
with banking stocks the major gainers. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed up
2.3 percent at 966.87 points. The index is up nearly 50 percent

results from E.ON boosting utilities and banks up ahead of
Federal Reserve statements on the state of the U.S. economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.1

last year, is up 13 percent in 2009 and has surged 46 percent

utility said it saw signs that demand for energy was stabilising

after first-half profits beat forecasts. ""For the reminder of this year, this kind of profitability
story is the main driver for people to revise next year's
earnings forecasts higher and that's positive for the market,""
said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers. ""Equity markets could easily go higher by about 5 percent in
the short term,"" he added. The DJ STOXX European Utilities Index was among the top
sectoral gainers, up 2.6 percent. GDF SUEZ, Centrica, RWE and
Severn Trent advanced between 1 percent and 4.3 percent. Financial stocks were also among significant gainers ahead
of the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas and Natixis rose
between 2.1 and 5.4 percent. ""I don't think you are going to get anything negative out of
the Fed today. What you want to see is a central bank that is
not going to take any risks on the deflationary side and

the U.S. government have agreed to settle a long-running dispute
over the disclosure of names of wealthy American bank clients
suspected of tax evasion. Britain's Lloyds was up 6.4 percent. The bank said it would
sell the bulk of its Insight Investment unit to Bank of New York
Mellon for 235 million pounds ($386 million) as part of a
shake-up of its asset management units.  EUPHORIA Investors digested a slew of economic news. The Bank of
England said Britain's worst recession in decades would end
early next year, but it would take time for the gross domestic
product (GDP) to return to pre-crisis levels, pushing
unemployment up from the current 13-year high. ""There is a kind of euphoria starting to build in. The
markets are ignoring negative news and much more focusing on
positive news,"" Wenzel said. The U.S. trade deficit widened in June to $27 billion, as
goods imports rose for the first time in 11 months, and euro
zone industrial output fell in June against May, defying
expectations of a small rise. Commodity shares were in demand as crude and metals prices
rose. Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total and
StatoilHydro added 1.6 to 4.9 percent. Among miners, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta and
Xstrata rose 0.5-2.8 percent. Volkswagen and Porsche were up 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent,

 (Adds comments on energy demand, fund manager, Thuega sale) By Peter Dinkloh FRANKFURT, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Germany's E.ON, the world's
largest utility, said it saw signs that demand for energy was
stabilising after a prolonged slump, and tweaked its 2009
outlook higher after first-half profits beat forecasts. The recession has cut power consumption rates, notably among
industrial users, and several European utilities have said in
recent weeks they expect the downtrend to continue. But E.ON said on Wednesday it saw ""the first signs that
power demand contraction is abating, especially in North-West
Europe,"" echoing a rare positive prediction from Spain's
Iberdrola, which said last month it expected domestic usage
rates to recover in the fourth quarter. ""E.ON seems to be benefiting from the strength of its
industrial customer base,"" said Matthias Wilpert, who helps
manage 62 billion euros at Commerzbank's Cominvest fund
management unit. The energy provider, Germany's second-largest company by
market capitalisation, said better profits from domestic
customers in the United States and higher margins at its
pan-European energy trading unit also gave a boost to earnings. It now sees full year net income falling 5-10 percent rather
than 10 percent as interest payments and taxes will be lower
than expected. Shares in the nine-year-old utility rose 4.7 percent to
27.01 euros at 1221 GMT, the strongest riser on a DJ Stoxx
utilities index that gained 1.6 percent and the German benchmark
DAX, which was up 0.8 percent.  DOWNTURN TO CONTINUE? Other large power firms in Europe, including Edison, are
bracing investors for the downturn to continue. Italy's Enel has
predicted the hard slog will last through next year. Utilities remain pessimistic even though many -- including
France's EDF, Enel and Britain's International Power -- have
surprised investors with better-than-expected results. E.ON's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
dropped 1 percent to 5.7 billion euros ($8.1 billion), beating a
5.5 billion euro average of estimates from 14 analysts in a
Reuters poll. It said its still sees 2009 EBIT flat versus 2008.  PLAYING CATCH-UP E.ON also said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell its Thuega
unit, which groups minority stakes in German utilities, to a
consortium of local firms for around 2.9 billion euros in cash,
though Germany's antitrust watchdog said it expected the deal to
be subject to an extended review. Reuters had reported last week that E.ON was set to divest
the unit. The utility is trying to catch up with competitors as it
struggles to earn money from 18 billion euros worth of
acquisitions made in Italy, Spain and Russia, raise its
profitability to the level of its peers and improve the
performance of its shares. Its stock has dropped 33 percent in the past 12 months,
while the DJ Stoxx utilities fell 30 percent and the DAX 17
percent. E.ON trades at 9.2 times estimated earnings per share for
the coming 12 months, the seventh-lowest valuation among 33
European peers, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which
weights analysts estimates according to their track record. E.ON said on Monday its deputy chief executive, Johannes
Teyssen, would take charge of the company from May 2010. German peer RWE is due to report first-half earnings on

utility, on Wednesday reported earnings that beat market
forecasts, helped by higher profits from household customers in
the United States and its pan-European energy trading unit. The German power provider joined major European peers such
as France's EDF, Italy's Enel and Britain's International Power
 in surprising investors with better-than-expected results. A number of European utilities have benefited from strong
earnings abroad while lower demand due to the economic crisis
and higher fuel costs has pressured margins in their home
markets. E.ON also tweaked its 2009 outlook higher, saying it now
sees net income falling 5 to 10 percent rather than 10 percent
as interest payments and taxes will be lower than expected. The German utility's adjusted earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) dropped 1 percent to 5.7 billion euros ($8.1

 (releads with chairman comments on EDF-Enel deal) MILAN, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Italy's A2A SpA was ""upset"" by a
deal on nuclear business between rival Enel and EDF, its French
partner in Edison, the utility's chairman said on Thursday. ""The deal between Enel and EDF took us by surprise and upset
us a bit,"" Giuliano Zuccoli told a conference call with analysts
after the company turned in an 18.9 percent drop in first-half
net profit. ""Our relationship with EDF is positive, but we are in the
situation today to watch closely the need for some key
interventions on Edison itself,"" he said. A2A and EDF jointly control Edison, which is Italy's
second-biggest power producer behind Enel. Earlier this week, EDF and Enel set up a joint venture to
develop nuclear power in Italy. There has been media speculation in recent months that A2A
would like a change in the Edison ownership structure in order
to get more synergies from its ownership of Edison. First-half results for A2A, Italy's biggest
municipally-owned utility, reflected falling demand, triggered
by Italy's worst economic downturn since World War II. Other European utilities have also felt the impact of the
global downturn on power consumption. Spain's Iberdrola said it expected domestic power demand to
recover in the fourth quarter when it reported a 23 percent fall
in first-half net profit last month. Germany's E.ON and RWE will report in August, as will
France's GDF Suez. A2A reported an 8.1 percent downturn in power sales while
overall revenues were up 2.7 percent, boosted by the purchase of
French district heating company Coriance and Aspem, a Varese
power company. Net profit was 129 million euros but excluding the effect of
a tax repayment for state aid, net profit was 185 million euros,
up 16.4 percent from the same period last year. Zuccoli said he expected a full year result in line with
previous forecasts made at the start of the year. On dividend policy, he said this was tailored for a
""reasonable"" scenario and ""going forward we don't believe the
scenario will worsen. There is still the crisis but we don't see
it worsening any more,"" he said. A2A shares closed down 5.38 percent at 1.231 euros. The DJ
Stoxx utilities gauge was down 0.66 percent.

537,"Jul 24, 2009 08:24AM ET",PREVIEW-Eni dividend policy under scrutiny at Q2 -analysts,nan," MILAN, July 24 (Reuters) - Eni's dividend policy will be
under scrutiny along with second quarter results on Thursday as
divestment risks have heightened concerns over the Italian oil
group's balance sheet, analysts said. On Tuesday, Eni affiliate Snam Rete Gas said GDF Suez would
not go ahead with plans to buy Rome gas grid Romana Gas, valued
at around 1.1 billion euros, placing a question mark over the
sale of the asset. ""Our 'sell' rating on Eni is based on our view that the
group's balance sheet is stretched and that as such it will be
difficult for the company to deliver both growth and a
meaningful yield at the same time,"" Societe Generale said in a
note dated July 22. The broker added that GDF Suez pulling out of the Romana Gas
deal has put the issue firmly back on the agenda. Eni, which fully consolidates Snam's results, sought to sell
the grid to GDF Suez as part of a 2008 deal to acquire Belgian
gas company Distrigas. ""GDF Suez's decision to pull out ... is likely, in our view,
to resurrect concerns over Eni's dividend,"" Barclays Capital
said in a note on Thursday. However the broker said dividend concerns were overdone and
forecast the group would pay a flat dividend on the year of 1.3
euros even if the divestment does not occur. The broker said a failed divestment of Romana Gas would
directly impact Eni's gearing by about 2 percentage points to
bring it to 37 percent by year-end, adding it expects an interim
dividend of 0.65 euros per share. A Reuters consensus of nine analysts, which sees Eni's
adjusted second-quarter net profit at an average of 938 million
euros ($1.33 billion), pegged the interim dividend for 2009 at
0.65 euros per share, in line with the previous year. But Barclays noted the European dividend swap option market
is pricing Eni's 2009 dividend at 1.0 euros per share, which
could suggest an interim dividend of just 0.35-0.45. ""A lot depends on the oil price,"" a Milan analyst said. ""A priority for Eni is to maintain a strong credit rating.
The Romana Gas development raises a question. A lot depends on
how far they want to stick to their target of a debt-to-equity
gearing of below 0.40,"" he said. In its statement on Tuesday, Snam Rete Gas said it reserves
the right to take measures to protect its interests with regard
to the Romana Gas deal. Eni's dividend policy is based on a relative yield.
Management has said the 2009 dividend will offer a superior
yield defined as the highest or second highest of the oil
majors. Eni will present second-quarter and first-half results on
Thursday, followed by a conference call with management. (Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; editing by John Stonestreet) ($1=.7043 Euro)

these sectors, the EU's antitrust chief said on Friday. The European Commission, tasked with ensuring fair play in
the 27-country European Union, will also target erring

national gas markets. This followed a 1.06 billion euro penalty on Intel in May
for illegal efforts to squeeze out archrival AMD, marking the
biggest antitrust fine on a single company.
 Kroes last week signalled her determination to crack down on
drugmakers suspected of fixing deals with generics producers to
hold back cheap medicines, saying probes were under way. The Commission is investigating privately owned French
drugmaker Servier and a number of generics firms over the issue. ""We would do no favours to the economy by going soft on

also slipped. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Roche fell 0.5-1.1
percent. ""We are bouncing around on very low volumes,"" said Howard
Wheeldon, strategist at BGC Partners, in London. ""We may
continue moving sideways for many months. The worst of the
crisis may be over, but we're not seeing recovery.""  DRUGMAKERS, BANKS GAIN Financial stocks gained ground, however. Standard Chartered
, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Natixis and Commerzbank rose 0.9-2.9
percent. The banking sector was the second biggest loser in 2008
following a financial crisis, the worst since the Great
Depression of the 1930s, but has recovered this year. The sector has gained 17 percent in 2009 and European Union
finance ministers agreed in principle on Tuesday to make capital
rules for banks more flexible to reduce their likelihood of
worsening boom-and-bust cycles in the economy. Miners also advanced. BHP Billiton, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,
Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources rose 0.7-2 percent. Building materials group CRH Plc warned pretax profit
nosedived in the first half and said trading would remain
extremely difficult, but investors bet the worst was behind the
Irish group, sending its shares 5 percent higher. Among automobile shares, BMW fell 0.6 percent after group
vehicles sales fell 12.7 percent in June to 127,546 units,
bringing the first-half decline to 19.5 percent amid a sharp
economic slump. Across Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were down 0.2-1.2 percent.

FRANKFURT, July 3 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on
Friday, recording their third straight week of losses, led by
utilities, oil & gas and basic resources while banks and media
pulled in the opposite direction. Volumes were thin in the absence of U.S. market participants
due to the extended Fourth of July weekend. ""With U.S. markets closed today for the Independence Day
holidays we have seen the major indexes lack direction,"" CMC
Markets said in a note. ""Major stock specific stories have also been hard to come by
today,"" CMC Markets added. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.1 percent
lower at 842.52 points. It lost 0.2 percent over the week and
has fallen 5.1 percent since its five-month high close on June
11. Utilities shaved most points off the index on Friday. EDF
fell 4.5 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating to
""equal weight"" from ""overweight"". UBS and Citigroup trimmed
their price target on the EDF stock. Also in the sector, E.ON dropped 1.2 percent and GDF Suez
lost 0.6 percent. Weaker oil and copper prices weighed on oil & gas and basic
resources stocks amid renewed doubts about the outlook for
economic growth triggered by weaker-than-expected U.S. June jobs
data on Thursday. Banks added the most points, with Barclays up 2.8 percent,
Banco Santander gaining 2.2 percent, BNP Paribas adding 2
percent, HSBC rising 1.7 percent and Deutsche Bank putting on
1.7 percent. Media stocks advanced after Credit Suisse upgraded the
European sector to ""overweight"" from ""underweight"". The DJ Stoxx
media index rose 0.5 percent. Wolters Kluwer jumped 4.3 percent and Reed Elsevier climbed
3.9 percent. The DJ EuroSTOXX 50 index of European blue chips squeezed in
a gain of 0.3 percent to 2,376.48 points. BayernLB chartists saw support at 2,350 points, saying in a
technical analysis note that a break below that level would
spark a clear ""sell"" signal.  WEEK AHEAD Europe's top-300 index rose 35 percent between March 9 and
June 11, as improving sentiment indicators buoyed economic
recovery hopes, but has traded choppily in a narrow range since. Strategists said that picture was unlikely to change much in
the week ahead. ""Next week brings too little quantitative or qualitative
data to give stock markets any decisive direction,"" said LBBW
investment analyst Michael Kohler. Ad van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment
Management, said ""the road ahead will be bumpy for risky assets""
such as equities, and LandesBank Berlin said stock market
fundamentals remained fragile. ""We don't want to rule out further setbacks. Nonetheless, we
assume that many investors will exploit an eventual temporary
weakness on the market and that as a result some liquidity which
has not yet been invested will flow back into the equity market
again,"" Raiffeisen Research said. Stefan Scheurer, capital markets analyst at Allianz Global
Investors, spun on the same theme, saying investors with big
cash allocations might use phases of stock market weakness to
shift some money into equities. Valuations could also lend some support. According to
consensus data compiled by Goldman Sachs, European shares trade
at on average 11.4 times 12-month forward earnings compared with
a 10-year average of around 13.5. The U.S. corporate earnings reporting season gets under way
next week with aluminium group Alcoa on July 8 and oil major
Chevron on July 9. ""Alcoa will be a signal. Its second-quarter numbers are
probably not good but a positive outlook could lift stock
markets,"" said Joerg Rahn, head of investment at Bankhaus
Marcard, Stein & Co. London's FTSE 100 index and the French CAC 40 both edged up
0.1 percent on Friday while the German DAX lost 0.2 percent and
Zurich's SMI fell 0.3 percent.

not use the billions of euros it has raised in the debt market
since October to fund acquisitions and will continue to focus on
organic growth, its chief said on Friday. Asked by Reuters if GDF Suez was looking for acquisitions,
Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet said: ""No. We haven't changed. We are keeping the same strategy.
We have not increased our level of investment. It is 30 billion
euros and this programme is fundamentally based on organic
growth."" Mestrallet was talking on the sidelines of an economic forum
in southern France. Asked if GDF Suez could change its mind should an attractive
opportunity arise, Mestrallet said: ""This is not in our
projects. We are very relaxed on that."" GDF Suez, born of the merger of Gaz de France and Suez a
year ago, has raised nearly 10 billion euros in several bond
issues since October, fuelling speculation it may be ready to
pounce on a target. Mestrallet also confirmed that GDF Suez aimed to build two
new-generation nuclear reactors in Britain. ""We are looking for land that could welcome two EPR
reactors,"" he said. A consortium of GDF Suez, Iberdrola and Scottish & Southern
Energy made no purchases at an auction of nuclear power sites
run by Britain's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in April,
after being outbid by other European utilities. In May, Iberdrola said it was interested in buying land
owned by EDF Energy that could be used to build new nuclear
plants. Mestrallet said GDF Suez was not currently in talks with EDF
over the land that EDF wants to sell back. ""There are no negotiations. I am not even sure that the
process has been formally launched,"" Mestrallet said. (Reporting by Marie Maitre; editing by John Stonestreet)

in positive territory, gaining 2.2 percent, against a 20 percent slide in the
Jan.-June period in 2008. The FTSEurofrst 300 index of top Euroepean shares hit a lifetime low on
March 9 following the financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and threatened much of
the world with a deep and vicious recession. The index surged 15.9 percent in the Apr.-June period of 2009, the best
quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still
down 48 percent from a multi-year peak scaled in the middle of 2007. The index lost 45 percent in 2008 after five straight years of gains. The
basic resources and banking sectors were among the worst perfomers last year,

issues 
 (Adds details, background) By Marie Maitre and Benjamin Mallet PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - France's Compagnie du Vent may
look abroad to develop its wind power business as political
barriers make projects difficult to push through in its domestic
market, the head of the GDF Suez subsidiary said. ""Despite positive statements (on wind power) from the
president (Nicolas Sarkozy) and members of Parliament... on the
ground it doesn't work at all,"" said Chief Executive Jean-Michel
Germa, who founded Compagnie du Vent in 1989, told Reuters at a
small and mid-cap energy forum in Paris. ""The French wind power industry has been completely
decimated by a de facto moratorium on the ground as local
authorities deliver close to no building permits and lobbies are
attacking these permits,"" he said, also citing a draft law that
could classify wind parks as polluting equipment.
 said Germa who founded Compagnie du Vent in 1989. He also said that the banks would not finance equipment with
a building permit that could be annulled by a court. ""The situation is completely blocked and there is no
recognition by the government of the importance of developing
wind power,"" he said. French utility GDF Suez owns 57 percent of Compagnie du Vent
and Germa holds the rest. Compagnie du Vent, which competes with
EDF Energies Nouvelles, operates 15 wind parks in France,
representing a production of 175 megawatts (MW), and has built
60 MW for third parties in Morocco. Compagnie du Vent, which is based in Montpellier, southern
France, and had sales of 16.8 million euros ($23.64 million) in
2008, targets installed wind power capacity of 2,000 MW by 2015.  GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION Faced with a difficult situation that could compromise
France's efforts to ensure that 20 percent of its power
consumption comes from renewable energies by 2020, Germa said
Compagnie du Vent could decide to stop investing in France. ""We either stand like soldiers on the navigation bridge
looking at the ship sinking or... we redeploy in the rest of the
world,"" Germa said. ""What the French administration doesn't want
for France, many other countries are eager to get it."" Germa declined to say which countries he was targeting, but
he said the company was looking at ""the whole world"" and could
rely on the international presence of GDF Suez for its
development abroad. ""This diversification will be made organically,"" he said. The cost of developing wind farms has decreased thanks to a
fall in turbine prices, which Germa estimated are 25 percent to
30 percent cheaper than they were in 2008. Germa also said that financing needs to develop Compagnie du
Vent's wind power portfolio and reach its 2015 capacity target
would lead to changes in the company's shareholding structure. ""If we build 2,000 MW, we roughly need 2 to 2.5 billion
euros. And you know that about 15 to 20 percent of the financing
of wind power projects is made on equity, meaning we need 400
million to 500 million euros in capital to build new projects,""
he said. ""What will likely happen is that the company's capital will
be increased depending on funding needs and GDF Suez will follow
it but not Germa,"" Germa said, saying rights issues will be made
when needed but giving no details on a timing.

547,"Jun 17, 2009 12:32PM ET",Sal Oppenheim sees equity markets correcting by year-end,nan," * Investment bank recommends defensive stocks, cash, bonds * Increased volatility seen ahead * DAX expected at between 4,500-4,800 points by end-2009 * DJ STOXX 50 seen at 2,250-2,400 points at end-2009  By Tyler Sitte FRANKFURT, June 17 (Reuters) - Stock markets will likely
correct by year-end as they retreat slightly from recent gains
and investors should favour defensive stocks, higher cash
positions and bonds, experts from Sal. Oppenheim said on
Wednesday. The investment bank, which has total assets of around 41
billion euros ($56.83 billion) and is one of Europe's largest
independent banking groups, said its new outlook for the second
half of the year broke from its early forecast and it was now
more conservative than the market consensus. ""The lion's share of the world economy is still in a
recession. The mid-term term growth outlook is moderate at best
as it will likely take several years to work off imbalances,""
said Dieter Pfundt, personally liable partner and head of
investment banking at Sal. Oppenheim. Matthias Joerss, head of the bank's equity strategy team,
said the ""spring fairy tale"", which supported equity markets
earlier this year would likely lose momentum by summer. ""The second half of the year will be characterised by a
period of volatile corrections and lateral movement,"" Joerss
said, pointing to likely further downward revisions in company
earnings estimates and continued overcapacity. While Germany's blue-chip DAX index may temporarily move as
high as 5,300-5,500 points in 2009, Joerss sees the index ending
the year in a band of 4,500-4,800 points. The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 index of the top 50 European large
caps will likely move between 2,100 and 2,700 points throughout
the second half of the year and close out 2009 in a range
between 2,250-2,400 points, Joerss added.  TRANSPARENCY IMPORTANT IN PICKS ""The rebound seen by banking stocks, cyclicals, and capital
goods will likely run its course and there will be a return to
defensive stocks, including healthcare, consumer goods,
telecoms, food stuffs and utilities,"" Joerss said. Among European large caps, Sal. Oppenheim's recommendations
include Allianz, Bayer, Credit Agricole, GDF Suez, RWE and
Philips as part of a defensive portfolio. The bank views a highly visible business model and high
dividend payout as important factors for equity picks. For German small and mid caps, the bank prefers Aareal Bank
, drug supplier Celesio, retail bank Deutsche Postbank,
technology group Gea, biotech testing specialist Qiagen and
internet service provider United Internet.  INVESTORS SETTLE FOR LOWER RETURNS The bank also suggested that at least in the mid-term
investors might have to remain content with lower returns. ""Our clients used to ask how they could achieve (returns on
investment) of 10 percent plus. These days investors are asking,
'How can I keep the value of my investment stable?' Under these
conditions an investor who sees a return of 5 percent is
satisfied,"" Pfundt said. The bank recommends higher cash allocations and investments
in liquid government bonds to help weather difficult markets. Corporate bonds might also be enticing for investors. ""The corporate bond market is a main competitor to the
equity market and as long as spreads remain where they are this
will continue,"" Pfundt said. A commonly held view that stocks are undervalued was not
entirely accurate, the bank contends. ""Valuations might look attractive, but estimates for 2010
are still much too high,"" Joerss said. ""On the other hand, we can't really say the market is
overvalued, because that would mean using company earnings
during a recession as a yardstick to determine value."" Instead, Sal Oppenheim sees a gradual return to historical
profit levels which are somewhere between these two extremes.

Korea's Hydro and Nuclear Power had agreed to take a stake in a
unit of the French state-owned nuclear group. KHNP, which generates 40 percent of South Korea's
electricity, will take a 2.5 percent stake in Societe
d'Enrichissement du Tricastin, which runs the Georges Besse II
plant in southern France, Areva said in a statement. Areva has said it would use industrial partnerships as a way
to help finance its multi-billion-euro investment needs. In March, Areva said that Japan-based Kansai Urban Banking
Corp and Sojitz Corp had agreed to acquire a joint 2.5 percent
stake in its Georges Besse II plant for an undisclosed amount. The deal followed the acquisition by French utility GDF Suez
 of a 5 percent stake in the same plant, which was launched in
2006. Areva's activities cover the full nuclear cycle, from
uranium mining and enrichment to nuclear reactors and spent
nuclear fuel recycling.

549,"Nov 04, 2008 08:40AM ET","Europe builders seen up, defence down if Obama wins",nan," LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - European building materials and
construction stocks could be big gainers from a Barack Obama win
in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, while defence companies
would get a boost if rival John McCain won, analysts said. Democrat Obama led Republican McCain in five of eight key
battleground states, according to a series of Reuters/Zogby
polls as the two candidates face the verdict of U.S. voters
following a long and bitter campaign. ""Obama would spend a lot of money on the public sector,
which would be good for road builders. A landslide Obama win
would also be good for retailers because it would come with a
feel-good factor that would boost consumer spending,"" said Mark
Bon, fund manager at Canada Life. Analysts said the concrete details of Obama's plans for the
economy would have a big bearing on which stocks would benefit. ""A lot hinges on the flavour of what the stimulus is. If
it's going to be just tax cuts, in which case people are going
to look at some of the discretionary end of the consumer spend.
Potentially leisure and retail could do well,"" said Philip
Lawlor, chief portfolio strategist at Nomura. ""My read is that it's going to be a big package of $150
billion but it's much more skewed towards infrastructure, in
which case once the legislation starts to come through people
will realise this has to be beneficial for the construction
stocks and material stocks."" Societe Generale said in a note late last month that it
expected European commercial banking, construction, healthcare
equipment and insurance to benefit from an Obama win. It picked CRH, Holcim and Lafarge as potential winners among
the construction companies, while BBVA and Santander would be
gainers among the banks as opportunities arose to buy U.S.
regional banks. ""A new president with a clear mandate would also be good for
the dollar, and that would boost European exporters,"" Bon said. Aerospace and defense, pharma, investment banking and asset
management, luxury goods, oil, chemicals and nuclear energy
could gain from a McCain win. SocGen picked defence groups BAE Systems, Cobham, drugmakers
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline and Credit Suisse and UBS in the
investment banking and asset management universe. It said luxury goods group LVMH, oil producers BP and Royal
Dutch Shell, industrial gases group Air Liquide and nuclear
energy players Areva, EDF and GDF Suez would also be likely
winners under McCain. Whatever the outcome, analysts said that the progress of a
$700 billion financial stimulus programme agreed under outgoing
President George W. Bush would be key. ""We do think it opens the way as well, more fundamentally
and more relevantly for equity markets at this juncture, for a
speed-up in the fiscal stimulus programme. That is what we will
really be looking at,"" said Ian Richards, strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland.

 (Adds close of U.S. markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A wave of panic selling swept
U.S. stocks on Thursday, driving the blue-chip Dow index down
more than 7 percent, and oil prices dived, as widening fears of
a global recession were unchecked by moves by authorities
worldwide to thaw frozen credit markets. Oil fell below $85 for the first time in almost 12 months
on fears over world demand for energy. As the economic picture
darkened traders ignored calls by some OPEC members to cut
output to prop up prices. Even gold, a traditional safe-haven, fell as investors
opted for cash as global stocks slid. Energy shares on both sides of the Atlantic fell with crude
prices. Financial shares were also top losers in U.S. and
European markets as measures to contain the credit crisis
failed to instill confidence. Investors were shaken when overnight interbank borrowing
costs fell in the wake of deep rate cuts by central banks on
Wednesday, but longer-term lending rates remained high. The high rates cast doubts that money would flow into other
parts of the money markets, such as commercial paper, and free
up the clogged markets to all businesses to keep humming. ""The market is in show-me mode. There's a crisis of
confidence,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at
Delta Global Advisors Inc in Plymouth, Massachusetts. An avalanche of selling in late U.S. trade drove the Dow
below 8,600 for the first time since May 2003. The Nasdaq and
the S&P 500 each also fell to levels not seen in more than five
years. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 678.91
points, or 7.33 percent, at 8,579.19. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index  plunged 75.02 points, or 7.62 percent, at 909.92.
The Nasdaq Composite Index  tumbled 95.21 points, or
5.47 percent, at 1,645.12. Over past seven days, the Dow shed almost 21 percent and
the S&P 500 nearly 22 percent, their worst seven days since
October 1987 in the wake of Black Monday. The Dow is down
nearly 40 percent from a record high above 14,000 hit exactly
one year ago. Shares of General Motors  tumbled 31.1 percent to
their lowest level since 1950 as concerns mounted that an
industry decline that started in the United States was
spreading and as a leading forecaster warned global auto demand
could ""collapse"" in 2009. Wachovia Corp  shares slumped 28.85 percent on
concerns that talks to divvy up the troubled bank had hit a
snag, leading a broader drop in U.S. regional banks. Shares in Morgan Stanley  plunged 25.89 percent on
ongoing concern about the status of a planned $9 billion
investment by Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
<8306.T>, in the U.S. investment bank. Morgan Stanley shot down speculation about the deal. Some
traders blamed the steep drop on short-sellers after the end of
a temporary ban on the downside bets in financial stocks. The S&P financial index slumped 11.7 percent, and the S&P
energy index slid 11.4 percent. European stocks fell, extending a slide to four days, after
trading higher earlier in the session. The FTSEurofirst 300
 index of top European shares fell 2.05 percent to
921.46. The biggest drag on the European index were utilities
, which fell on expectations that declining oil prices,
a barometer for commodity prices, will lead to a cut in
electricity prices. GDF Suez  lost 13.1 percent, EDF  slipped
10.5 percent and E.ON  dropped 10.7 percent. Oil and banking shares also were big drags on the index,
with Barclays  falling 13.2 percent. Royal Dutch Shell
 fell 3.2 percent and BP  shed 1.8 percent. Demand for government bonds, gold and low-yielding
currencies -- all recent beneficiaries of a scramble for
relative safety as global equity markets -- tanked. Analysts said the dollar would stay supported as long as
credit markets remain frozen. ""(There has) been a scarcity of dollars and investors
looking for dollars have gotten some through the forex market,""
said Robert Sinche head of strategy for currencies at the Bank
of America in New York. The dollar rose strongly at day's end on a safe-haven bid,
with the U.S. Dollar Index , a basket of major
currencies, up 0.56 percent at 81.373. Against the yen, the dollar  rose 0.26 percent at
99.51, while the euro  fell 0.18 percent at $1.3605. Euro zone government bonds fell sharply, suggesting that
some risk appetite emerged after the coordinated rate cuts. Although debt yields were higher across all maturities,
shorter-dated paper outperformed longer-dated peers,
underpinned by expectations for more rate cuts and driving the
2/10-year yield curve to its steepest level since February. U.S. Treasuries fell for a third straight day as debt
supply issues weighed on investor sentiment. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  fell
33/32 in price to yield 3.78 percent. After being down most of
the day, the 2-year U.S. Treasury note  pared losses
to trade little changed in price to yield at 1.55 percent.
Gold slipped as investors cashed in gains that took the
precious metal to a nine-day high in the previous session. December gold futures  settled down $20 at $886.50 an
ounce in New York. U.S. crude  settled down $2.36 at $86.59 a barrel
before dropping to $84.63 -- its lowest level since October
2007 -- in post settlement trade when the Dow Jones industrial
average slipped below 9,000. London Brent crude  fell $1.70 to settle at $82.66 a
barrel. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said it
will hold an emergency meeting on Nov. 18 in Vienna to discuss
the impact of the financial crisis on oil markets. ""The Organization is concerned about the deteriorating
economic conditions with contagion risks,"" OPEC said in a
statement announcing the meeting. ""The continuing turmoil in the financial markets has spread
to many regions and created even more uncertainties for the
world economy."" Stocks clung to small gains overnight in Asia. MSCI's index
of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 2.05
percent after a 9 percent tumble on Wednesday, its biggest
single-day fall in at least two decades.

 (Adds close of European markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters) - An equities rally stumbled on
Thursday as investors cast doubt on a coordinated global effort
to stem a worsening worldwide credit crisis by cutting interest
rates, and even safe-haven assets fell as uncertainty ruled the
day. Demand for government bonds, gold and low-yielding
currencies -- all recent beneficiaries of a scramble for
relative safety as global equity markets tanked -- fell. Expectations that energy demand will fall sharply if the
credit crisis pushes the global economy into a prolonged
recession pushed crude oil lower to around $87 a barrel. The yen fell broadly and higher-yielding currencies bounced
as extreme risk aversion receded in jittery financial markets. Key central banks around the world cut rates on Wednesday
in a coordinated response to halt the worst financial crisis to
sweep the world in almost 80 years. Rallies in both European and U.S. stocks proved to be
short-lived, with a downturn on Wall Street quickly echoed in
Europe. Financial and energy shares sold off on both sides of
the Atlantic. U.S. stocks initially rose as investors snapped up
beaten-down shares and took heart from strong earnings from
technology bellwether IBM after a six-day slide on Wall Street
that has pushed the Dow by more than a third a record peak hit
exactly one year ago. By mid-morning, however, the
bargain-hunting bounce fizzled and the Dow and S&P 500 were
lower, although the Nasdaq was slightly higher. ""There's still a significant amount of nervousness that the
credit crisis has not seen its end and there are still more
problems that lie ahead,"" said Michael James, senior trader at
regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. ""People are scared about what they don't know and the fear
of the unknown is what's causing people to sell stocks and ask
questions later."" Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  was
down 120.18 points, or 1.30 percent, at 9,137.92. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index  was down 14.71 points, or 1.49
percent, at 970.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down
4.36 points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,735.97. Shares in Morgan Stanley  plunged as much as 25
percent on ongoing concern about the status of a planned $9
billion investment by Japan's top bank, Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group <8306.T>, in the U.S. investment bank. Energy shares fell on concerns over the economy's effect on
demand, with Exxon Mobil  and Chevron  both down
around 5 percent. ""The market is definitely trading on rumors, not news,""
said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor
Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. The tech-rich Nasdaq rose after International Business
Machines Corp  posted solid profit, lifting its shares
about 1.5 percent. Microsoft  led the Nasdaq higher
with a 2.5 percent gain. European stocks fell, extending a slide to four days, after
trading higher earlier in the session. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
fell 2.05 percent to 921.46. The biggest drag on the European index were utilities
, which fell on expecations declining oil prices, a
barometer for commodity prices, will lead to a cut in
electricity prices. GDF Suez  lost 13.1 percent, EDF  slipped
10.5 percent and E.ON  dropped 10.7 percent. Oil and banking shares also were big drags on the index,
with Barclays  falling 13.2 percent. Royal Dutch Shell
 fell 3.2 percent and BP  shed 1.8 percent. The cost of interbank borrowing overnight cash fell in
response to the move by financial authorities to restore calm
to jittery markets. The cost of dollar, euro and sterling funds
for the overnight rate all fell substantially, although by less
than one-half percentage point. The rate cuts were aimed at unclogging the credit markets
and to keep business activity humming. But the cost of borrowing dollars for any period beyond the
overnight rate rocketed. Three-month dollar Libor hit its
highest rate this year as banks scrambled for greenbacks to
cover U.S. currency positions and to fund dollar assets. ""We're not seeing any relief in term Libor fixings which
tells us that the rate cut has exclusively impacted on the
overnight market but it hasn't touched the Libor market at
all,"" said BNP Paribas rate strategist Alessandro Tentori in
London. ""And that's not a very good sign,"" he said. Euro zone government bonds fell sharply, suggesting that
some risk appetite emerged after the coordinated rate cuts. The December Bund future  traded down 81 ticks at
116.04, but up from a near-one week low of 115.46 earlier in
the session. Although debt yields were higher across all maturities,
shorter-dated paper outperformed longer-dated peers,
underpinned by expectations for more rate cuts and driving the
2/10-year yield curve to its steepest level since February. U.S. Treasuries fell for a third straight day as debt
supply issues weighed on investor sentiment. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  fell
33/32 in price to yield 3.78 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  slipped 8/32 in price to yield 1.69 percent. The low-yielding yen fell from a three-year high against
the euro and a six-month peak versus the dollar that it hit the
previous day, although it later pared some losses. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index  up 0.38 percent at 81.222. Against
the yen, the dollar  was up 1.10 percent at 100.34. The euro  gained 0.11 percent at $1.3644. Gold slipped as investors cashed in gains that took the
precious metal to a nine-day high in the previous session. Spot gold prices  fell $20.05 to $886.45 an ounce. U.S. light crude for November delivery  fell $1.70 at
$87.25 a barrel. London Brent crude  fell $1.37 at
$82.99 a barrel. Stocks clung to small gains overnight in Asia. MSCI's index
of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 2.05
percent after a 9 percent tumble on Wednesday, its biggest
single-day fall in at least two decades.
