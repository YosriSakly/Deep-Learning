Europe's bank index (SX7P) fell 1.7 percent, while oil and mining sectors fell 1.5 percent each. (SXEP) (SXPP) ""Cyclicals are really dependent upon accelerations in growth, they're very real economy sensitive for higher revenues,"" said John Ricciardi, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Kestrel Investment Partners. The inversion of parts of the U.S. yield curve means investors are beginning to panic about future growth and inflation, Ricciardi added. Analysts have cut their estimates for 2019 earnings growth as markets turned sour this autumn.Tech (SX8P) stocks fell 1.4 percent after the highly valued U.S. tech sector sold off.Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell 1.2 percent to 4.5 percent following a sharp drop in chip stocks on Wall Street. German carmakers outperformed the DAX as investors digested what seemed a relatively positive outcome from auto executives' meeting at the White House.U.S. President Donald Trump pressed carmakers to increase investments in the United States, something the executives said they planned to do but wouldn’t be able to if the administration went ahead with threatened tariffs.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, among those in the meeting, said he did not think that car tariffs were imminent. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) were up 0.1 to 0.2 percent and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell just 0.2 percent.  Iliad  (PA:ILD) shares fell back, down 3.7 percent after a strong rally on Tuesday when it unveiled a new high-end set-up box.Shares in valve manufacturers  Rotork  (L:ROR) and Weir (L:WEIR), which supply the oil industry, tumbled after U.S. energy services firm Schlumberger (N:SLB) gave a warning on Tuesday, saying a drop in fracking activity would hit its North America revenues.Swedish pharma firm Elekta (ST:EKTAb) was a rare gainer, up 3.6 percent after it won Food & Drug Administration clearance for its ""Unity"" radiation therapy, clearing it for commercial sales and clinical use in the United States.M&A news was also a driver.Shares in  Shire  (L:SHP) jumped 4 percent at the open, then trimming gains to trade up 2 percent, after shareholders of Japan's Takeda approved the takeover of the London-listed pharmaceutical firm. Among small-caps, Swedish retailer Clas Ohlson (ST:CLASb) provided the latest example of the squeeze on the sector to close physical stores as shoppers switch to online. Its shares opened down 5 percent but swung back to rise 5 percent by 0930 GMT as investors welcomed its new strategy including closures of loss-making stores in Britain and Germany.Broker notes hit some stocks.  Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV) fell 5.4 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut its rating to underweight. Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) shares fell 3 percent, the worst performer on the CAC 40, after JP Morgan cut it to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"".Altran (PA:ALTT) shares fell 4.5 percent after the company announced its North America chairman Frank Kern will retire.

17,"Nov 15, 2018 11:54AM ET","Cheap stocks back in vogue, even if laced with 'value traps'",nan,"By Danilo Masoni and Josephine MasonMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - With world equity markets set to call time on one of the longest bull markets in history, so-called 'value stocks' - wallflowers during the technology-led boom years - are suddenly back in fashion. European value stocks, defined generally as firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their current share price, have outperformed growth stocks since early October as a dramatic sell-off swept across global equity markets unnerved by gradual end of a decade of easy money and rising trade tensions.Companies that boast a faster pace of growth like the big U.S. tech names or Europe's luxury giants have been particularly favored during the past decade of central bank largesse.In contrast, the so-called value end of the market has become cheaper and cheaper, creating some opportunities.Heading into 2019, investors in search of better returns are scanning stocks in beaten-down sectors like banks, builders, autos or telecoms, looking whether cash flows reflect poorly in shares prices or whether other valuation metrics have fallen below historical averages or are disconnected from the sector.""After ten tough years, it's finally getting interesting,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners.""It has all been about technology and the high-flying growth stuff. In the last decade, value has only outperformed a couple of years in Europe, and October has been much better,"" added Sauerbronn, who helps manage nearly $28 billion.In October when world stocks lost $7 trillion of market cap at one point, European value stocks  fell only 4.3 percent while the region's growth stocks  suffered their worst month since August 2015, down 6.5 percent.The outperformance has continued so far in November.Still from the 2009 lows, European growth has risen 150 percent, against a rise of 100 percent for value.Last week, the Fed signaled it was still on course to increase rates next month.""The growth stocks benefited tremendously from having zero rates. That's the status quo forever? I hope not, and I don't think it will be the case,"" Sauerbronn also said.GRAPHIC: Value outperforms since early October - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QsVqJwAVOIDING VALUE TRAPS Buying value, however, is easier said than done, with the main challenge for investors being avoiding the so-called value traps, companies whose share price are cheap for a good reason.""Value investing relies on a handful of stocks that go on to deliver high returns,"" Bernstein strategists said this month.""Investing in the entire Value portfolio is not only impractical for most active investors, but is also subject to a massive return drag from the losers,"" they added.Among their value picks they singled out several European companies in sectors such as mining, oil, airlines, construction and retail:  Anglo American  (L:AAL),  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), LafargeHolcim (S:LHN), and Ahold-Delhaize (AS:AD).Sauerbronn said that battered tobacco stocks also looked attractive now and that he was increasing exposure to the sector.One feature of value stocks is that their valuations have generally fallen below historical averages, whereas growth stocks trade above in a gap that has been widening ever since 2008. Easy monetary policies and the growing success of passive investing has just amplified this spread. Among miners, Anglo American, for example, is traded at around 0.5 times its cash flow, against a historical average of nearly 0.7 times, while peer  Glencore  (L:GLEN) is traded at 0.5 times vs more than 0.7 times. In banks, Italian lender UniCredit (MI:CRDI) prices at around 0.5 times its book value, a 28 percent discount to euro zone banks, while French cement maker Lafarge  Holcim  is trading at its lowest PE multiple since 2011 and builder Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) at its lowest in nearly a decade. ""Today there is very apparent value staring you in the face in certain parts of the market. Does that mean that those stocks go up tomorrow? Probably not,"" said Mark Breedon, who manages a 1.8 billion fund of global equities for Investec in Hong Kong.""The question is getting the timing right. What you need is to start seeing those companies beating expectations or getting some technical momentum behind them as you never want to try catching a falling knife,"" he added.According to Breedon, the most interesting opportunities can be found outside the main benchmarks, whose constituents have been lifted indiscriminately by the big flows provided by passive investing. Most stocks with a market cap above $1 billion are traded outside the dominant benchmarks, he said.GRAPHIC: Growth vs Value over 10 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QuNDuUSTART OF A TREND?Even though it is too early to call the start of the trend in favor of value stocks, this market segment is increasingly becoming a hunting ground for investors.Chris Hiorns, portfolio manager of the EdenTree Amity European Fund with just under 100 million pounds in assets under management and a long-time value bull, believes the recent shift in the market has been a move away from growth rather than a reallocation into value.Hiorns still sees chances for further outperformance and has recently increased exposure to cheaply valued stocks such as tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), construction company Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB), staffing firm  Randstad  (AS:RAND), as well as banks ING (AS:INGA) and Santander (MC:SAN).""The market is still very growth-oriented, but there's lots of capacity for value to outperform this year and into next year,"" he said. ""Value bias is the place to be at the moment.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

29,"Jul 27, 2018 08:42AM ET",Global stocks set for fourth week of gains as trade angst eases,nan,"By Ritvik CarvalhoLONDON (Reuters) - Shares rose worldwide on Friday as strong company earnings reports and as transatlantic trade tensions eased after an agreement between the United States and Europe this week.The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent in London and was set for a sixth straight session of gains, a run not seen since February, and its fourth straight weekly gain.European shares rose, with consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, construction groups Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) and Vinci and bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) gaining after results, lifting the STOXX 600 0.4 percent. (EU)European auto stocks extended to Thursday's gains.Futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street.Trade tensions had not disappeared altogether from investors' radars however. Chinese shares lagged an uptick in Asian shares, with the main Shanghai index down 0.4 percent on the day. Traders attributed this to a still-unresolved standoff between the U.S. and China on trade.""To see the way markets reacted early yesterday...it was almost as if the EU and the U.S. were best buddies again,"" CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson said. ""Nothing could be further from the truth, and while the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn't gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere. That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,"" he said.So far this month, MSCI China A shares have fallen 2.6 percent, taking the biggest hit from U.S. President Donald Trump's threats on tariffs among other issues in major markets, compared with 3.3-percent gains in the MSCI ACWI.The Chinese yuan eased, on course to mark its seventh week of losses, although those losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks' swapping of dollars for yuan in the forward market. Traders said they may also have been selling spot dollars.Borrowing costs in the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, held below six-week highs, a day after the European Central Bank's president backed market expectations for a rise in interest rates late next year. [GVD/EUR]Most 10-year bond yields in the bloc were steady ahead of second quarter U.S. economic growth data due out at 1230 GMT that many economists expect to show a strong reading.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.9880 percent, its highest level in 1-1/2 months, on receding worries about trade tensions.""In fixed income markets, the main question today is whether the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield...will break the 3 percent mark in the wake of the U.S. GDP release,"" a UniCredit note said.Japan's 10-year government bond yield slipped off a one-year high after the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week.Most market players expect central bankers meeting on Monday to stop short of making immediate policy changes and to say instead that they will study ways to reduce the side-effects of the prolonged easing, such as hits to banks' profits.In currencies, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 111.17 yen as the yen got a lift from a rise in Japanese bond yields.Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.1 percent at 94.863, hitting a five-day high. [FRX/]The euro traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1630, having fallen 0.73 percent on Thursday after the ECB signaled no change in its timetable to move away from ultra low rates or end its bond purchase program.In commodities, oil prices edged lower in quiet trading after three days of gains, but took support from Saudi Arabia halting crude transport through a major shipping lane, and falling U.S. inventories. [O/R]Brent crude futures traded down 0.1 percent at $74.49 per barrel, but were set for their first weekly increase in four. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,219.03 an ounce. [GOL/]Copper edged up, again boosted by receding trade tensions. It is on course to gain 2.4 percent on the London Metal Exchange and 3.7 percent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange this week, which would mark its first weekly rise in seven on both bourses after fears of a global trade war dragged prices down.

Shares traded in a narrow range, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index down 0.1 percent by 1010 GMT, still on course for its seventh straight week of gains and the longest winning streak since March 2015. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.4 percent while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was flat in percentage terms.Though moves at the index level were muted, shares in Sika (S:SIK) soared 8.7 percent to the top of the STOXX after the Swiss chemicals company reached an agreement with French building materials firm Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB) to end a long-standing legal dispute.Saint-Gobain, whose shares rose 2.8 percent, is to take a large stake in Sika, but not majority control.""We see this as positive for (Saint-Gobain), which we believe has been negatively impacted, with some investors preferring to remain on the side lines because of the uncertainties linked to the Sika operation,"" Raymond James analysts said in a note.Shares in  Daily Mail  and General Trust (DMGT) (L:DMGOa) rose 2.3 percent, having jumped as much as 9.4 percent, after U.S.-based private equity firm Silver Lake Management Company agreed to buy ZPG (L:ZPG), the owner of British property websites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, for 2.2 billion pounds.DMGT is the biggest shareholder in ZPG, whose shares rocketed about 30 percent to a record high.

The world's biggest steelmaker beat earnings forecasts and gave an upbeat outlook for 2018.So far blended year-on-year earnings growth for the first quarter has come in at 16 percent for MSCI EMU, in dollar terms, compared with 26 percent for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Outside of the STOXX, earnings updates boosted shares in Italian banks. Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) jumped 11 percent after the bank swung to a profit in the first quarter thanks to lower costs and loan losses, while UBI Banca (MI:UBI) gained 1.2 percent after its results.While the Italian banking sector (FTIT8300) has been under pressure recently on the back of political jitters, the sector is up more than 13 percent this year while Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB (FTMIB) has risen 10 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Apr 27, 2018 05:23AM ET",European shares eye fifth week of gains as results season gathers pace,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - Well-received results from Spanish banks and a recovery among tech stocks buoyed European shares in early trading on Friday, setting them up for their fifth week of gains in a row.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.1 percent by 0903 GMT and on track for its longest winning streak in terms of weekly gains since last September, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.7 percent. This week banks have been a key focus, with results from Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK) sending their shares 2 percent and 0.5 percent higher. Both lenders beat profit forecasts thanks to strength in their overseas markets.However, Britain's RBS (L:RBS) was a laggard, reversing early gains to trade 2 percent lower after a concerns over a pending fine from the U.S. Department of Justice eclipsed its first-quarter update.RBS was among the biggest fallers on the European banking index (SX7P), which declined 0.5 percent.Elsewhere industrials performed well as shares in St Gobain (PA:SGOB) popped 3 percent higher after the French construction materials group confirmed its 2018 financial outlook.Satellite firm SES (PA:SESFd) was the biggest gainer, up more than 10 percent after beating first-quarter expectations on the back of strong growth in its networks division.However, Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) fell the most on the STOXX, its shares down 11 percent on a surprise drop in first-quarter core operating profit and a warning on raw material costs. The earnings season has taken the focus from broader issues such as global trade and geopolitics, which rattled markets in March, while concerns over rising bond yields have also been put on the back burner for now. ""We've been able to focus much more the earnings season and underlying trends,"" Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said, adding that companies can be more cautious in the first quarter.""I know markets are very short-term and we do just move from quarter to quarter, but people will remember at the back-end of the year if you upgraded guidance and you've got to revise it down again,"" van Dulken said.""It's not a good look."" So far around a quarter of companies in the MSCI EMU index have given first quarter updates. Nearly 60 percent have either beat or met analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Earnings growth is clocking in at over 15 percent for the quarter, in dollar terms. Tech stocks also helped fuel gains as the sector (SX8P) continued to recover from recent negative sentiment, following well-received results from tech giant Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and U.S. chipmakers.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

59,"Sep 20, 2017 10:10AM ET",Sika wants to step up acquisition drive,nan,"By John RevillZURICH (Reuters) - Sika's (S:SIK) Chief Executive, Paul Schuler, wants to accelerate the Swiss industrial and construction chemicals maker's acquisition drive with more and bigger deals in the next 15 months.Schuler, who took the reins in May, said he expected to buy up to six companies by the end of next year, with revenues ranging from 100 million to 500 million Swiss francs.The purchasing spree would be ramped up from Sika's previous strategy of bolt-on acquisitions of companies with revenues of around 50 million francs.Sika, which makes chemicals used in construction projects like the Gotthard rail tunnel under the Alps, could spend up to 1 billion francs ($1 billion) per year, Schuler told Reuters in an interview, up from the 200 to 300 million francs it has been spending annually.""We would like to be a bit faster, increase the speed of acquisitions,"" Schuler said, adding the group had a strong pipeline of acquisitions. Schuler said it was preferable to buy family-owned businesses which had succession issues, and buying them would allow them to increase their profitability by leveraging Sika's sales, distribution and manufacturing network.""These companies usually have a lower margin, but we can bring efficiencies so after three or four years they are up to our level,"" Schuler said. The company wanted to move faster because it did not want to miss opportunities in a very fragmented market, he said, while it had been buoyed by the success of its recent purchases.Automotive chemicals, where Sika makes adhesives for carmakers including Jaguar Land Rover and BMW, was one area of interest, Schuler said.Schuler said he wanted to see an end to the bitter fight between Sika and the founding Burkard family over the clan's plans to sell their controlling stake to Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB). A court ruling is expected later this year.He described the current deal the family has with Saint-Gobain as a ""no go"" for Sika.""We need a good solution for Sika, for all the employees, and for the Burkards.""A resolution could involve Sika's two classes of shares being combined into one common class, with one share having one vote, and other privileges being abolished, Schuler said.Reaching an agreement to buy the Burkard's stake would not affect Sika's acquisition campaign, Schuler said.""We are in a nice position, we have enough cash flow. Making an offer to the family wouldn't restrict us from investing in other companies.""($1 = 0.9603 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Jul 09, 2017 08:23AM ET",Silence over whether Grenfell Tower materials passed safety test,nan,"By Tom BerginLONDON (Reuters) - The cladding system used on London's Grenfell Tower would only have met British regulatory standards if the two main materials had passed a key safety test together, according to a Reuters analysis of the building code and data on the materials. Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome.The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion. Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations. The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels. France's Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000. The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based ArconicInc, previously known as  Alcoa  Inc (NYSE:AA). If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called ""limited combustibility"", in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations. But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers. This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction. Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower. In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it “met all building regulations” but did not say if the BS 8414test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted. The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out. Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building. The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning. (Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system:http://tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs) COMBUSTIBILITY The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used. Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year, told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings. “Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate,” the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email. The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire. Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: “More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as it’s their area of expertise.” Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire. A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

62,"Jun 28, 2017 01:09PM ET",New computer virus spreads from Ukraine to disrupt world business,nan,"By Eric Auchard, Jack Stubbs and Alessandra PrenticeFRANKFURT/MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - A new cyber virus spread from Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe on Wednesday, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia.The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said.More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread.Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary.U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco.The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May.More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain.Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said.Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and a steelmaker.""No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent.ETERNAL BLUEThe aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.""My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,"" Lord told Reuters on Wednesday.While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack.Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect.Bushiness that installed Microsoft's (O:MSFT) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected.There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update.After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (O:MSFT) security patches.Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said ""a small number"" of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down.Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (O:CSCO) Talos and Symantec (O:SYMC) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc.The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.""Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,"" it said in a technical blog post.Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines.CORPORATE CHAOSA number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country.Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine.Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country.Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted.Other companies to succumb included  BNP Paribas  Real Estate (PA:BNPP), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.""The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,"" the bank said on Wednesday.Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down.Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered ""serious consequences"" but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

79,"Dec 04, 2015 11:29AM ET","Exclusive: Hawkins and Sawiris forge investment partnership, with Adidas in sights",nan,"By Sinead Cruise and Emma ThomassonLONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his colleagues at Southeastern Asset Management to drive change at companies they invest in - and they have sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGn) in their sights.The long-term venture between Sawiris and fellow billionaire Hawkins, founder of the employee-owned global investment firm, combines their personal wealth as well as cash from third-party investors, according to a source familiar with the matter. The new entity - Southeastern Concentrated Value (SCV) - plans to build stakes in up to 10 European companies it deems to be underperforming - to spur boardroom revamps and influence strategy, the source said.It could set its sights on Germany's Adidas, which has struggled to keep pace with bigger rival  Nike  (N:NKE) in recent years and is currently looking for a successor to veteran CEO Herbert Hainer.Sawiris is already independently invested in Adidas via NNS Holding, which owned 1.74 percent of the share capital as of October 30, according to Thomson Reuters data, and around 6 percent of voting rights via a number of options. Southeastern has publicly filed as holding over 3 percent of the company. The stakes were built up this year.A spokeswoman for Southeastern confirmed the existence of a partnership comprising Hawkins, Sawiris and some of its senior staff, but declined to comment further. Sawiris declined to comment.Sawiris' and Southeastern's interest in Adidas comes at a critical juncture for the Bavaria-based company. The German-dominated board is seeking a new boss who can help restore its fortunes in the U.S. market, where sportswear trends are born. Many fund firms have demanded a greater say in how companies are run since the financial crisis, after clients accused them of charging high fees but failing to hold board members to account for weak strategy, poor profits or excessive pay. But investor-led campaigns for change can be stymied by the varying requirements of their clients, in terms of how soon they expect to see returns. Fund firms must often sell shares to return capital to clients before long-term change is fully implemented. SCV, which will be advised by Southeastern's London office, is expected to focus on six to 10 companies at any one time and its partners hope their long-term collaborative approach will maximize shareholder influence, the source said. TEAMING UPSawiris, the youngest scion of one of Egypt's richest families and Southeastern, the investment firm set up by Hawkins 40 years ago, have already cooperated as independent shareholders to significant effect at several large firms. These include U.S. construction supplies firm Texas Industries and cement and aggregates firm LafargeHolcim (VX:LHN). During the protracted merger of  Holcim  and  Lafarge  (PA:LAFP), Sawiris, with the support of major shareholders, including Southeastern, was instrumental in pushing for Lafarge management to retain positions of influence in the combined merger. The appointment of Lafarge veteran Eric Olsen, a dual French and American national as CEO, was welcomed by Southeastern, partly because it believed he had the necessary skills and cultural sensitivity to unite factions in both the Holcim and Lafarge camps. SCV's largest holding is in Swiss chemicals company Sika (VX:SIK), the source said, without disclosing the actual size of the partnership's stake. According to public filings, Southeastern owns just under 4 percent of the company, and is supporting Sika's management and board in their opposition to the sale of the Burkhard family's 16-percent stake to France's Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB) at an 80 percent premium without a concurrent offer to other shareholders. SCV is primarily focused on making sure the companies it backs have the best management and boards in place to deliver on operational strategy and intelligently allocate capital over the long-term, the source said. This, the source added, sets it apart from activist investors, who often try to dictate company business or demand asset sales and mergers and acquisitions in the short-term. ADIDAS CAMPAIGN Both Sawiris and Southeastern have declined to comment on their objectives for Adidas, apart from saying that they are in ""constructive"" dialogue with management. Adidas declined to comment on Friday, but pointed to comments made by CEO Hainer last month when he said the company was open to listening to shareholders.""Hainer's rule has been reined in by the arrival of new investors who the board cannot ignore,"" said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, which owns a 0.75 percent stake.The firm already seems to be responding. Adidas said in August it was considering the possible sale of its golf brands, as demanded by some investors. It recently raised its full-year outlook for sales and profits and said it should be able to repeat the performance next year. After underperforming Nike for the last two years, Adidas shares have soared in recent weeks and are up 57 percent this year, compared with a 34 percent rise for Nike. But they still trade at a 17 percent discount to the U.S. firm, seen by analysts as justified given consistently lower profitability and growth. Adidas expects its sales to rise by almost half to above 22 billion euros by 2020; Nike said last month its sales to rise 63 percent to $50 billion by then.The Adidas board said in February it was looking for a successor to Hainer, who has been in office since 2001 and is the longest-serving boss of a major listed German company.But it seems to be in little rush to end the uncertainty at the top, particularly as Hainer's contract runs until 2017.Global brand chief Eric Liedtke is seen as the top internal candidate, although some industry experts say the board is still looking seriously at external candidates. Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) boss Kasper Rorsted and Amer Sports chief Heikki Takala have been touted as possible candidates in media reports.""We believe it should be an external candidate to break the Hainer system,"" said Speich, who has long been an outspoken critic of Hainer.Some investors want the new boss to focus on the Adidas brand, push ahead with a sale of the golf business and also consider a disposal of long-struggling fitness label Reebok, acquired in 2005.""They should focus on the core brand and split off or sell the others,"" Speich said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Courbevoie, France-based company also said that it does not plan to acquire Sika’s remaining shares.“Given the proximity of Sika’s activities with those of Saint-Gobain (Construction Products and Innovative Materials as well as Building Distribution), the deal is expected to generate 100 million euros in synergies as from the second year (2017), and 180 million euros per year as from 2019. The deal will create value by the fourth year,” Saint-Gobain said in a statement, adding that the Sika transaction would have to be cleared by antitrust authorities and could be finalized in the second half of 2015.However, Sika’s board opposed the transaction in a statement, saying that it “does not support change of control to Saint-Gobain.”“The Board and Group Management of Sika AG have neither been involved nor consulted in connection with the proposed transaction,” Sika said in a statement. “The Board neither sees the industrial logic in the transaction, nor significant synergies for Sika… the Board and the Group Management believe that shareholder value would be impaired as Sika in the planned set-up would not be able to continue its successful growth strategy.”On Monday, Saint-Gobain also stated that it was putting its “Verallia” glass packaging unit up for sale.

losses and rose on Friday, up for a tenth session in a row, as
forecast-beating European macro data eclipsed poor results from
Microsoft and gloomy comments from Ericsson. Banks were among the biggest gainers, with BNP Paribas up 2
percent, Deutsche Bank up 1.8 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland
 up 2.8 percent. At 0905 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.4 percent at 911.77 points, after rising to as
high as 915.34 points, its highest level since mid-November. The
index has soared 12 percent over the past two weeks -- its
longest winning run since December 2006. Optimism about a burgeoning economic recovery and
better-than-feared company profits has propelled the
FTSEurofirst 300 up 41 percent from March's record low, and the
index is now up 9.6 percent on the year, after plummeting 45
percent in 2008. ""The rally over the past two weeks has been very fast and
the market is now dangerously overbought. We're due for a pause,
which would be healthy if we want to keep the upside trend
alive,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff, technical analyst at Aurel
BGC. ""But I'm still cautious on the longer term. We haven't seen
yet a reversal of the downtrend started two years ago."" After an early dip, stocks turned positive when data showed
Ifo's closely-watched German business climate index rose to 87.3
in July, higher than the Reuters consensus for a smaller rise to
86.5. Euro zone provisional purchasing managers' surveys also
showed the services and manufacturing sectors contracted much
less sharply than expected in July but firms continued to cut
jobs in a bid to reduce costs. The gains in Europe on Friday followed a rally on Wall
Street, where upbeat earnings and improving housing data helped
the S&P 500 punch through a critical technical resistance level
at 960, triggering a rally that lifted the benchmark index to
979.42 -- its highest intraday level in eight months. ""It was a very strong breakout for the S&P 500, and volumes
were above average,"" said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP
Paribas. ""So we might not see a long bout of profit taking, because
the danger is that investors have been caught short and have not
been investing, and now they might start to panic."" Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index gained 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, and France's CAC 40 added
0.5 percent. Ericsson dropped 6 percent after the telecom gear maker
posted higher-than-expected core earnings but said the impact of
the economic downturn on its key mobile networks market had
become more notable. Vodafone gained 2.5 percent after the world's largest mobile
phone company by revenues reported in-line sales and reiterated
its outlook. Saint-Gobain surged 5.8 percent after the French building
materials group said it sees signs that the construction market
has reached the low point of the economic recession and would
start to pick up. Merck KGaA tumbled 12 percent after the German drugmaker
posted weaker-than-expected quarterly results and on a negative
opinion by a European regulatory body regarding the use of its
cancer drug Erbitux. (Reporting by Blaise Robinson; editing by Simon Jessop)

in positive territory, gaining 2.2 percent, against a 20 percent slide in the
Jan.-June period in 2008. The FTSEurofrst 300 index of top Euroepean shares hit a lifetime low on
March 9 following the financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and threatened much of
the world with a deep and vicious recession. The index surged 15.9 percent in the Apr.-June period of 2009, the best
quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still
down 48 percent from a multi-year peak scaled in the middle of 2007. The index lost 45 percent in 2008 after five straight years of gains. The
basic resources and banking sectors were among the worst perfomers last year,
both down 65 percent, but the sectors are the best performers so far this year,

103,"Jun 23, 2009 03:27AM ET",UPDATE 1-Danone raises 3 bln euros in capital increase,nan," * Sold 123.2 million shares at 24.73 euros each * Issue 182 percent oversubcribed * Funds to help cut debt, buy smaller rivals 
 (Adds details of the statement, background) PARIS, June 23 (Reuters) - Danone said on Tuesday it had
raised 3.05 billion euros ($4.23 billion) in its first
capital increase in 22 years, as the French food group aims to
cut debt and buy smaller rivals hurt by the financial crisis. Danone said it had sold 123.2 million new shares for 24.73
euros each -- representing a 31 percent discount to the stock's
closing price a day before the rights issue was announced on May
29 -- in an offer that was 182 percent oversubscribed. Shareholders of the world's biggest yoghurt maker were able
to subscribe to 4 new shares for every 17 shares held. The discount is less than that seen in other billion-euro
rights issues in France this year. Drinks group Pernod Ricard
 last month raised about 1 billion euros by selling
shares at a 36 percent discount. French cement group Lafarge and building materials
group Saint-Gobain held rights issues of 1.5 billion
euros with even deeper discounts.
