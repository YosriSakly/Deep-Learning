Sign up here.ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world’s largest steelmaker, is cutting steel production across its European plants to cope with weak demand and rising imports.The company will reduce primary steelmaking production in Dunkirk, France and Eisenhuettenstadt, Germany, according to a statement on Wednesday. It will also cut primary steelmaking production in Bremen, Germany and extend a stoppage planned in Asturias, Spain in the fourth quarter.“This is again a hard decision for us to have taken but given the level of weakness in the market, we feel it is the prudent course of action,"" said Geert van Poelvoorde, the chief executive officer for the company’s flat products division in Europe. ""This will be a temporary measure that will be reversed when market conditions improve.""European steelmakers have been feeling the pinch as demand contracts, especially from the auto sector, and countries such as Turkey export record amounts into the region. Earlier this month, regional lobby group Eurofer warned the industry is on the cusp of a crisis."

40,"May 09, 2019 04:27AM ET",StockBeat - ArcelorMittal Warning Deepens Market's Trade Fears,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- President Donald Trump may put his trust in tariffs as an instrument for good, but the world’s biggest steelmaker isn’t so sure.ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT) shares have fallen 4.5% in early trading on Thursday after the company announced weaker-than-expected earnings and cut its forecast for steel demand outside China this year. It blamed the global economic slowdown and higher input costs – notably from an iron ore market suffering from supply bottlenecks in Brazil and Australia.ArcelorMittal’s warning plays to a general mood of doom and gloom in Europe this morning, dominated by fears that the U.S. -China trade war is about to escalate. Beijing on Thursday threatened retaliation if the U.S. actually implements the tariff increase on imports from China that it has now formally announced for Friday. Analysts see the trade conflict as one of the biggest risks to global economy in the near term.At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 4.12 points, or 1.2% at 378.36, its lowest in six weeks. France’s CAC 40 was the worst hit, falling 1.5% not least due to ArcelorMittal’s heavy weighting in the index. Germany’s Dax was down 1.0% while the U.K. FTSE 100 was outperforming, down only 0.6%.ArcelorMittal said earlier this week it was ‘temporarily’ shutting steel mills in Poland and Spain, not least because the European Commission’s ‘safeguard tariffs’ of 25%, imposed in February, had failed to stop higher imports into the EU.The only bright spot in the global market, according to CEO Lakshmi Mittal, remains China, where government stimulus programs rolled out earlier this year have supported prices.“Although we are somewhat encouraged by the firmer price environment in China, this is not being reflected in Europe,” Mittal said as he unveiled a weak set of first-quarter results.ArcelorMittal’s revenue was flat at $19.2 billion, as sales of its own iron ore offset lower prices for finished steel. But its basic operating earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) fell 15% to $1.65 billion, below estimates."

83,"Feb 25, 2019 05:05AM ET",Trade tariff reprieve triggers relief in European shares,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods drove European shares to their highest since October as carmakers and mining companies rallied.The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.3 percent by 0930 GMT and Germany's trade-sensitive DAX rose 0.5 percent. The STOXX hit 373.18 in early deals, its highest since Oct. 10.Trump said on Sunday he would delay the March 1 deadline for a tariff increase after ""productive"" trade talks and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal an agreement if progress continued.Auto shares jumped 1.6 percent to their highest since early November and basic-resources stocks rose 0.9 percent as the tariff reprieve triggered relief for companies most at risk from slower global trade. Car-parts makers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Faurecia were among the top performers, up 2.6 to 3.4 percent. Steel companies Arcelormittal (AS:MT) and Norsk Hydro and commodity trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) all rose more than 2 percent. Investors stayed cautious, though.""I believe the easiest part is done,"" said Stephane Ekolo, fundamental analyst at Unigestion in Geneva. ""I believe Mr Trump has oversold the positive aspects of the discussions ... the overall deal will be less impressive than what the Chinese and especially Mr Trump are saying about it.""Disappointing results drove some significant declines. Shares in Bank of Ireland dropped 7.5 percent after the bank cut its outlook for 2019 and reported a weaker fourth-quarter net interest margin (NIM).""A weaker Q4 NIM and a lower outlook for 2019 weigh on near-term forecasts, while guided regulatory capital consumption is higher than anticipated,"" wrote Davy Research analysts. Covestro shares fell 3.7 percent after the German chemicals group said its 2019 core earnings may fall as low as half of last year's level. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings have been disappointing, and analysts have been steadily cutting their expectations for European earnings growth. https://tmsnrt.rs/2EtnGIsHowever, Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed the market, climbing 1 percent as government bonds jumped after Fitch affirmed the country's BBB credit rating.Shares in banks, which have significant government bond holdings, jumped 2.3 percent.M&A was also a driver: French healthcare company Ipsen fell 2 percent after agreeing to buy U.S. peer Clementia Pharmaceuticals in a deal worth up to $1.31 billion.PostNL surged 9.6 percent, set for its best day in more than two years, after saying it planned to buy its main rival Sandd for an estimated 130 million euros.Chipmaker AMS climbed 6.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after it introduced a new component for mobile 3D sensing applications.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

156,"Jan 18, 2019 02:50PM ET",ArcelorMittal to build its first ever desalination plant in Brazil: executives,nan,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT), the world's largest steelmaker, is set to build its first-ever desalination unit in Brazil to handle unforeseen water needs at its plant in the eastern state of Espírito Santo, senior company executives said in an interview on Friday. The unit is aimed at lessening the company's dependence on state water utility company Cesan and avoiding production cuts at times of water crises as the state suffered in 2015 and 2016, said Jorge Ribeiro, president of operations at ArcelorMittal's Brazilian flat steel division.While the plant is ArcelorMittal's first, desalination facilities have already become fixtures at some rival steelmakers and multiple mining operations, which tend to be water-intensive.The company is in the final stages of picking a firm to build the plant, Ribeiro said, adding that the decision will likely be taken next month, with companies from India, the United States and Spain among those interested.The planned investment is about 50 million reais ($13.32 million) and the project should start operating in two years, he said.In an initial module, the plant will be capable of desalinating 500 cubic meters (132,100 gallons)of sea water per hour.""It's a modular process, more modules can be added in the future,"" said Ribeiro.ArcelorMittal Brazil's chief executive, Benjamin Baptista Filho, noted that during the 2015 water crisis in Espírito Santo, the company was told by the state government to reduce its consumption from Cesan by 30 percent.""What we are doing is insurance, because if there is another rationing event, we can respond ... If there is another rationing, without the desalination, we would have to stop some of the production,"" said Filho.According to Filho, the desalination plant will be the first in Brazil to operate exclusively with seawater. The plant will use reverse osmosis technology and consume electricity produced by the steel mill itself.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

203,"Nov 08, 2018 04:30PM ET",Builders on Canada's west coast ask for steel tariff relief,nan,"(Reuters) - Construction industry leaders in British Columbia are urging the Canadian government to ease new limits on steel imports that they fear will have a disproportionate impact on the western province, according to a letter seen by Reuters.The letter, sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Finance Bill Morneau on Wednesday, asks that 100,000 tonnes of rebar, steel bar used to reinforce concrete, be exempt from new steel quotas and tariffs announced last month, and that any steel in transit before the new measures also be excluded.""British Columbia's construction industry is caught in a precarious position as a result of your government's provisional safeguard measures,"" the letter said. It was signed by the presidents of the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association of BC, the Vancouver Regional Construction Association, and the Urban Development Institute, which represents major developers.On Oct. 25, Canada imposed new steel import controls called safeguards on seven types of steel, capping imports from most countries based on historical shipments, and setting a 25 percent tariff on any imports above those caps.The measures were meant to reassure U.S. officials that cheap metal would not leak across the border if U.S. tariffs were lifted, and ensure that steel shut out of the U.S. market did not harm Canadian steel mills owned by  Stelco  Holdings (TO:STLC), ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AS:MT) and others.""Our government is listening to the concerns of some in the sector and is assessing ways to minimize the impact of safeguards in certain specific import situations, while maintaining the broad objectives of the provisional safeguards,"" Department of Finance spokesman Pierre-Olivier Herbert said in an emailed statement.Safeguards are intended to stabilize markets during unusual import surges, not raise prices. But their impact may vary across the country, as most Canadian steel is produced in Ontario. British Columbia, which does not produce steel and is separated from the rest of the country by the Rocky Mountains, relies heavily on rebar shipped from the northwest United States and overseas.Residential land prices have soared in British Columbia in recent years, raising the cost of housing. Tariffs may raise costs even more, at a time when sales are plunging and consumers are struggling with higher mortgage rates.""Shipping across the country from the east is cost prohibitive, and importing from the U.S. and from overseas has now become more expensive,"" said Fiona Famulak, president of the Vancouver Regional Construction Association. ""We have a lot at stake.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

222,"Oct 05, 2018 09:37PM ET",Exclusive: U.S. Commerce's Ross eyes anti-China 'poison pill' for new trade deals,nan,"By David Lawder and Karen FreifeldWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signaled on Friday that Washington may flex its muscle with additional trading partners in order to exert pressure on China to open its markets, saying that a ""poison pill"" provision in the recently completed pact with Canada and Mexico could be replicated.Ross said in an interview that the provision was ""another move to try to close loopholes"" in trade deals that have served to ""legitimize"" China's trade, intellectual property and industrial subsidy practices.The United States is now in the early stages of talks with Japan and the European Union to lower tariff and regulatory barriers and try to reduce large U.S. trade deficits in autos and other goods.If the EU and Japan signed on to provisions similar to the one in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), it would signal that they are fully aligned with Washington in trying to increase pressure on China, the world's No. 2 economy, for major economic policy changes.The provision in USMCA, which is expected to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, effectively gives Washington a veto over Canada and Mexico's other free trade partners to ensure that they are governed by market principles and lack the state dominance that is at the core of President Donald Trump's tariff war against China.Under the provision, if any of the three countries in the USMCA enters a trade deal with a ""non-market country,"" the other two are free to quit in six months and form their own bilateral trade deal. ""It's logical, it's a kind of a poison pill,"" Ross said.Ross, asked if the provision would be repeated in future trade deals, said: ""We shall see. It certainly helps that we got it with Mexico and with Canada, independently of whether we get it with anyone else.""He added that with a precedent now set, it will be easier for the provision to be added to other trade deals. ""People can come to understand that this is one of your prerequisites to make a deal,"" he said.MORE STUDY ON CAR TARIFFS Hanging over the talks with the EU and with Japan is the threat of a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported autos and auto parts as the Commerce Department pursues a study on whether such imports pose a national security threat. The USMCA deal largely exempts Canada and Mexico from such tariffs.The United States cited national security concerns when it announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from a number of countries in early March.Ross said Canada and Mexico are effectively ""really not in a position to object to (the national security tariffs) anymore because they’ve signed an agreement that says if we put them in we’ll exempt the first 2.6 million"" vehicle imports from each country.Ross declined to discuss timing for releasing the ""Section 232"" auto probe's findings, noting that Trump has said he would not impose car tariffs while the EU and Japan talks are under way.But in a signal that the probe could take longer, Ross said the Commerce Department was now incorporating details on autos trade from the USMCA deal, including new provisions that will effectively require more automotive content to be made in the United States. Ross also said Japan should take steps to ""move manufacturing into the U.S."" to cut its $40 billion automotive trade surplus with the United States. He declined to say if the Trump administration would seek a voluntary autos export cap from Japan. ""The methodology that we’ll use will be determined by the negotiations. There are plenty of ways you can solve things,” Ross said. ""We want more production of everything in the United States. That’s our theme song with everybody.""Ross said he did not expect much movement on China trade talks until after the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, adding that Chinese officials do not appear in a mood to talk at the moment. He said the view among some Chinese officials that Trump will be weakened by Democratic Party gains in Congress is a miscalculation, because ""the real farmers, the real ranchers are hanging in there"" and are not likely to turn away from Trump and Repubulicans in Congress.The November elections are being closely watched to see if the Democrats can wrest control of the Senate or the House of Representatives from Republicans. Some of the key races are in states and Congressional districts where farming dominates and that had voted for Trump in 2016. ZTE SCRUTINYRoss trumpeted the Commerce Department’s June settlement with ZTE Corp (HK:0763), China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker, saying it brought an unprecedented level of change and scrutiny to the company that could be used in other cases.Commerce virtually put ZTE out of business in April when it banned U.S. companies from supplying ZTE with components for its smart phones and networking gear for failing to comply with a deal to settle violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.Under the settlement deal that allowed ZTE to resume shipments, the company replaced its board and senior management, allowing a Commerce Department monitor access to the company for 10 years, in addition to agreeing to a $1 billion penalty and a $400 million escrow payment.""We’ve set the pattern that a huge, publicly owned company…changed its management, changed its board and permitted extreme intrusion by a foreign government regulatory agency,"" Ross said. ""I don't think you'll find anything comparable to that anywhere in the world.""Ross also highlighted the current labor contract talks between U.S. steel companies and the United Steelworkers union, saying that wage increases are a likely outcome and that they would be a bellwether for the broader U.S. labor market.United States Steel Corp  (N:X) and ArcelorMittal USA, a unit of ArcelorMittal  (AS:MT), have been negotiating new labor contracts for about 31,000 workers represented by the United Steelworkers union since July. A deal, however, remains elusive as workers are demanding a share in the profits from soaring steel prices.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

250,"Aug 24, 2018 12:00PM ET",Builders on Canada's coasts brace for new steel protections,nan,"By Allison MartellTORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's latest steel tariff proposal has alarmed construction companies, who have warned it could have an outsized impact on the country's coasts, boosting costs in places like Vancouver, already Canada's most expensive housing market, while protecting steel producers in central Canada.The new measures could make steel more expensive in regions that depend on imports from overseas, raising the cost of large building projects like condominium towers as subcontractors pay new duties on supplies like rebar, used to reinforce concrete. ""It's baffling to me. They're trying to appease a very small group of east coast mills - there is no west coast support,"" said Ron McNeil, chief executive of LMS Reinforcing Steel in British Columbia, where there is no primary steel production.The Canadian government is considering safeguards - special limits on steel imports from all countries in seven product categories - to protect steelmakers as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs send overseas producers in search of new markets. [L1N1V50V7]Safeguards would protect plants owned by  Stelco  Holdings (TO:STLC), ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AS:MT) and others. They come on top of retaliatory duties that have made it more expensive to import U.S. steel, Canada's response to Trump's tariffs.With about 1,000 employees, McNeil's LMS imports some 90 percent of its rebar from Asia. The closest Canadian mill, Edmonton's AltaSteel, supplies some of LMS's Alberta projects, but their capacity is limited. McNeil said it does not make sense to move rebar by rail from Ontario because transportation costs would be triple what they are from Asia. Fabricators typically quote fixed prices and lose money when steel prices rise.""The shipping cost is five times more to ship it from Quebec to Newfoundland as opposed to Turkey,"" said Cory Pittman, operations manager at Allstar Rebar in St. John's, Newfoundland on Canada's Atlantic coast.Pittman, who said all Newfoundland's construction steel comes from overseas, is part of the new Canadian Coalition for Construction Steel that is urging the government to proceed carefully on safeguards.Canada's finance department said any new measures would stabilize ""the impact of steel imports, and minimize trade disruptions.""But it was not clear how the government can ensure shifting supply lines do not disrupt some regions. A July study commissioned by the construction coalition estimated that tariffs on U.S. steel would raise the average price of rebar by 6 percent in British Columbia and safeguards would add another 7 percent, while reducing shipments.""We know that not all provinces have equal access to steel, just by their geography,"" said Mary Van Buren, president of the Canadian Construction Association. ""That could create a shortage of steel and then secondly could lead to price escalation."" Steel is a relatively small part of the cost of most buildings. Real estate consultants Altus Group estimates rebar is about 4 percent the total building cost of an average condominium tower in Toronto. Other factors like labor shortages have already raised costs this year, and every new expense hurts when revenue is fixed due to advance sales, said David Schoonjans, senior director at Altus. ""Even if it's done with the best of intentions, I think there's a high risk of things happening that nobody foresaw,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

256,"Aug 16, 2018 02:49PM ET","Angry, yes. But anti-business? Italy likely to contain its bridge rage",nan,"By Gavin JonesROME (Reuters) - Italy's government has unnerved investors with its angry reaction to this week's deadly bridge collapse, threatening to renationalize toll roads and accusing its predecessors of being in thrall to big business.But as the new anti-establishment government barks at the private sector, and at motorway operator Autostrade per l'Italia in particular, sources close to the government said it would not bite, at least not so hard as to frighten off investment.Even delivering on the prime minister's threat to revoke Autostrade's nationwide concession could be unaffordable for the heavily indebted state. It may settle for a heavy fine instead, two government sources said.Assuming Rome emerged victorious from appeals Autostrade could lodge in the courts, it would have to pay between 15 and 20 billion euros ($17-$23 billion) to compensate the company for investments in the motorway network, sector experts told Reuters.""The government will certainly take action against the concession holder,"" Deputy Transport Minister Edoardo Rixi told Reuters. ""We don't need to wait for investigations because it has objective responsibility for underestimating the risk."" However Rixi, from the right-wing League party, added that the action will not necessarily be revoking the concession. It could be a fine, or only withdrawing the concession for the single motorway that collapsed, he said.The government has kept investors on edge since it took office in June, seeking to rewrite a contract to sell a major steel plant and sometimes speaking out against large infrastructure projects already under way.A government source from the 5-Star Movement, the League's coalition partner, confirmed it was ""possible"" that Rome's attack on Autostrade would end in no more than a fine. The message was different earlier in the day from Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of 5-Star.""We have to end the contract. If these people are incapable of running our motorways ... it means the state will do it itself,"" he told reporters. He denied the government would have to pay any penalty if it could prove Autostrade was at fault.SHARE DIVEShares in Autostrade's parent company  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) closed down 22 percent on Thursday after falling as much as 25 percent in early trading.Some commentators say the clash with Autostrade may increase suspicions in the business community that the government has a punitive approach to private enterprise. ""It is worth thinking about whether this further fuels the populist feeling across Italy and elsewhere,"" said a fund manager at a large London-based investor.""The government has been quick to blame others - the EU, the company itself. It will certainly raise some issues with many other companies in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.Rome has already said it could pull out of other multi-billion-euro business commitments it inherited from previous governments. These include a high-speed rail link between Turin and Lyon, a pipeline transporting gas to Europe from Azerbaijan and a commitment to sell Europe's largest steel plant to the multinational AcelorMittal (AS:MT).However, coalition officials deny the government is hostile to companies. They point out that the electoral base of the League is among the small-and-medium-sized enterprises in Italy's richest northern regions.""This is actually a very pro-business government,"" said Carla Ruocco, a prominent 5-Star Movement lawmaker and president of the lower-house finance committee.She told Reuters the coalition wants to eliminate the cronyism by which previous Italian governments had offered concessions to its business friends on favorable terms, and this would help competition and free up resources for infrastructure, especially in the poor south.""I think investors have an interest in a more healthy state and a level playing field,"" she said, adding that government plans to cut taxes, simplify bureaucracy and give income support to the poor should also be welcomed by business.""We want to redistribute wealth, help domestic demand and recreate a middle class that can play a constructive role in society like it used to,"" she said. ""Isn't that a pro-business agenda?""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

349,"May 21, 2018 06:33PM ET",U.S. slaps heavy duties on Chinese steel shipped from Vietnam,nan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday slapped steep import duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated in China after a final finding they evaded U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders.The decision marked a victory for U.S. steelmakers, who won anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against Chinese steel in 2015 and 2016 only to see shipments flood in from elsewhere. The industry has argued that Chinese products are being diverted to other countries to circumvent the duties. U.S. customs authorities will collect anti-dumping duties of 199.76 percent and countervailing duties of 256.44 percent on imports of cold-rolled steel produced in Vietnam using Chinese-origin substrate, the Commerce Department said in a statement.Corrosion-resistant steel from Vietnam faces anti-dumping duties of 199.43 percent and anti-subsidy duties of 39.05 percent, it said.The department has said it would apply the same Chinese anti-dumping and anti-subsidy rates on corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled steel from Vietnam that starts out as Chinese-made hot-rolled steel.The duties will come in addition to a 25 percent tariff on most steel imported into the United States that resulted from the Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminum imports.Although the steel subject to the latest anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties was processed in Vietnam to be made corrosion resistant or cold-rolled for use in autos or appliances, the Commerce Department agreed with the claims of American producers that as much as 90 percent of the product's value originated from China.The global steel industry is struggling with a glut of excess production capacity, much of it located in China, that has pushed down prices.The decision followed a European Union finding in November that steel shipments from Vietnam into the EU also circumvented tariffs.The Commerce Department said that after anti-dumping duties were imposed on Chinese steel products in 2015, shipments of cold-rolled steel from Vietnam into the United States shot up to $215 million annually from $9 million, while corrosion-resistant steel imports rose to $80 million from $2 million.The case stems from a petition filed by U.S. producers ArcelorMittal USA (AS:MT),  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), AK Steel Holdings Corp (N:AKS) and United States Steel Corp (N:X) alleging that Chinese producers began diverting their steel shipments to Vietnam ""immediately"" after the duties were imposed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

358,"May 11, 2018 06:32AM ET",European shares head for longest weekly winning streak in 3 years,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - European stocks were set to achieve their longest weekly winning streak for more than three years on Friday as M&A activity added to an advance on the back of a busy earnings season. Shares traded in a narrow range, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index down 0.1 percent by 1010 GMT, still on course for its seventh straight week of gains and the longest winning streak since March 2015. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.4 percent while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was flat in percentage terms.Though moves at the index level were muted, shares in Sika (S:SIK) soared 8.7 percent to the top of the STOXX after the Swiss chemicals company reached an agreement with French building materials firm Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB) to end a long-standing legal dispute.Saint-Gobain, whose shares rose 2.8 percent, is to take a large stake in Sika, but not majority control.""We see this as positive for (Saint-Gobain), which we believe has been negatively impacted, with some investors preferring to remain on the side lines because of the uncertainties linked to the Sika operation,"" Raymond James analysts said in a note.Shares in  Daily Mail  and General Trust (DMGT) (L:DMGOa) rose 2.3 percent, having jumped as much as 9.4 percent, after U.S.-based private equity firm Silver Lake Management Company agreed to buy ZPG (L:ZPG), the owner of British property websites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, for 2.2 billion pounds.DMGT is the biggest shareholder in ZPG, whose shares rocketed about 30 percent to a record high. Shares in fellow British classifieds websites  Rightmove  (L:RMV) rose 6.5 percent and Auto Trader (L:AUTOA) rallied 4.1 percent. ""A lot of companies that hold overseas money (are) looking in and realizing that they're getting a bit of value at the moment with how weak the pound is, relatively speaking,"" Vertex Capital Group market analyst Jasper Reimers said, referring to the UK equity market. While the first quarter earnings season was winding down in Europe, basic resources (SXPP) was the best-performing sector after shares in ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) rose 2.2 percent. The world's biggest steelmaker beat earnings forecasts and gave an upbeat outlook for 2018.So far blended year-on-year earnings growth for the first quarter has come in at 16 percent for MSCI EMU, in dollar terms, compared with 26 percent for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Outside of the STOXX, earnings updates boosted shares in Italian banks. Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) jumped 11 percent after the bank swung to a profit in the first quarter thanks to lower costs and loan losses, while UBI Banca (MI:UBI) gained 1.2 percent after its results.While the Italian banking sector (FTIT8300) has been under pressure recently on the back of political jitters, the sector is up more than 13 percent this year while Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB (FTMIB) has risen 10 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

387,"Mar 27, 2018 08:30AM ET",Aluminum wrestles with steel over electric vehicle market,nan,"By Eric OnstadLONDON (Reuters) - When electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. launched its first mass market model last summer, it sent a shockwave through the aluminum industry by largely shifting to steel and away from the lighter weight metal it had used in its first two luxury models.The switch by Elon Musk's Tesla to the heavier-but-cheaper metal highlights how steel is fighting back against aluminum, which had widely been expected to be the bigger beneficiary of the electric vehicle revolution.Aluminum had been seen as the key to offsetting the weight of batteries in order to extend the range of electric vehicles, crucial to increased consumer acceptance.But as makers of battery-powered cars look to tap into bigger markets with cheaper vehicles - and embrace technological developments in batteries and components - many are increasingly looking to steel to cut costs. The price of Tesla's mass-market orientated Model 3 is around half of the £70,000 luxury Model S.""Before the aim was 'Let's get the [electric vehicles] developed', now it's 'Let's get them developed at the right price point,'"" says Mauro Erriquez, a partner at McKinsey & Company in Germany who specializes in the auto sector. It is the latest tussle in a decades-long battle between steel and aluminum for market share among automakers, seeking to cut the weight of vehicles to help slash emissions and meet tough government pollution standards.Steel is also winning back some market share among gasoline vehicles, such as the Audi A8. The latest model abandoned its heavy use of aluminum and shifted to a mix of steel, aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber.The competition between the metals has intensified amid rapidly growing demand for battery-powered cars.Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are due to surge to 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants CRU, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year. In China, the world's largest auto market, sales of new energy vehicles are due to grow by 40 percent this year to top 1 million vehicles, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Tesla declined to comment, but in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month it said it designed the Model 3 ""with a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing cost-effectiveness for this mass-market vehicle"". Other makers of mass market electric vehicles that have also chosen steel over aluminum include Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) Leaf, the world's best-selling all-electric vehicle, and Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) e-Golf. The e-Golf has 129 kg of aluminum and the Leaf uses 171 kg while Tesla's luxury Model S contains 661 kg of the metal, according to A2mac1 Automotive Benchmarking. A detailed breakdown was not available for the Tesla 3.(For a graphic of Metals used in vehicles click https://tmsnrt.rs/2G9OuvQ)STEP CHANGEAluminum is still expected to benefit greatly from the electric vehicle revolution, however, especially from hybrids because they have two engines.Both the combustion engine block and transmission are typically made of aluminum while the metal is also often used for housing the battery and motor in electric vehicles, according to auto metals specialist AluMag in Germany.And, because it is expected to be years before pure electric vehicles become widely used - in part due to the lack of power charging networks - the growth of hybrids in the interim is expected to benefit aluminum.According to CRU Consultant Eoin Dinsmore, demand for aluminum from electric and hybrid vehicles is forecast to increase ten times to nearly 10 million tonnes by 2030.Aluminum was used in the first electric London black cab, which launched last year, spurring the reopening of a UK aluminum plant in Wales owned by Norway's aluminum producer Norsk Hydro (OL:NYH).""We chose aluminum as a material as it is nearly three times lighter than steel in its raw form, and it absorbs twice as much energy in a crash,"" said Chris Staunton, chief engineer of body structures for the firm that developed the taxi for the London Electric Vehicle Company (HK:0175).Both Staunton's firm and the London Electric Vehicle Company are owned by China's Geely Automotive Holdings Ltd 0175.HK>. (Graphic: Aluminum content climbs in vehicles - http://reut.rs/2FIHfLl)BETTER BATTERIES But aluminum remains more expensive than steel. Benchmark aluminum futures  on the London Metal Exchange are around $2,050 per ton, more than three times the cost of LME steel rebar (SRRc1) at $585 a ton.The price gap between the types of aluminum and steel used in autos was not as wide, but still represented significant savings by using steel, industry experts said. Meanwhile, stronger and cheaper batteries for electric vehicles as well as developments in the components that generate power and overall structural design have lessened the need for aluminum to cut weight to extend the range. Since 2010, the cost of batteries have tumbled to as low as $114 per kilowatt hour from $1,000/kwh and are expected to drop further in coming years, according to AluMag.""I think car makers are finding that as battery costs fall they can achieve their range requirement with an all-steel solution,"" said George Coates, technical director for WorldAutoSteel, the automotive arm of the World Steel Association. Improvements in the powertrain - the main components in a car that generate power - have also had a big impact. The 2017 model of the Nissan Leaf extended its range by nearly 50 percent to 172 km compared to the 2011 version mainly by improving the powertrain, consolidating four separate systems into one, said McKinsey's Erriquez. (For a graphic on Aluminum vs Steel prices click https://reut.rs/2IS9oBr)MATERIAL MIXAt the same time, the steel industry has developed Advanced High Strength Steel products, which are stronger and lighter than normal steel, and importantly, cheaper than aluminum.""(Steel) companies like ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG) and ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), they're not going to just give up this market share. There will be a battle for the material,"" said Jost Gaertner, partner at AluMag. Future models will likely contain a complex mix of materials, including various grades of steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, magnesium and plastics, automakers and consultants said.BMW, which used large amounts of costly aluminum and carbon fiber in its i3 and i8, told Reuters it was not planning to increase the use of those materials in future electric models.""There is no 'one material fits all' solution"" for future electric vehicles, the German carmaker said in an email.""We will continue to employ each material in a way and in a quantity which brings in its specific advantages.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

413,"Mar 02, 2018 05:49AM ET","Nippon Steel raises capex, M&A budget for next three years, bids for Indian mill",nan,"By Yuka ObayashiTOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401), Japan's biggest steelmaker, will raise domestic capital spending by 35 percent over the next three years to upgrade aging plants and triple its investment budget to step up global expansion. Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-biggest steelmaker by crude steel output, outlined its new three-year business plan starting in April in a statement on Friday. The company said it will earmark a total of 1.7 trillion yen ($16 billion) for domestic capital expenditures, up from 1.26 trillion yen spent over the previous three years.Japanese steelmakers, including smaller rival JFE Steel, a unit of JFE Holdings Inc (T:5411), are making hefty investments in aging domestic plants. Glitches at the plants - some more than 40 years old - have prevented them from manufacturing as much steel as they would have liked.Nippon Steel also plans to set aside 600 billion yen for business investment, including for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), for the next three years, up from 210 billion yen spent over the previous three years. ""We are boosting our investment budget to move quickly with more flexibility when the alliance or big M&A opportunity arises,"" Nippon Steel President Kosei Shindo told a news conference.""On top of our existing business models of exporting products from Japan and processing products in overseas, we will consider taking in some overseas steelworks that are equipped with blast furnaces and processing lines,"" he said.As a first step, Nippon Steel said it would jointly bid for bankrupt steelmaker Essar Steel India Ltd with ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT), the world's largest steelmaker.If their bid to acquire Essar succeeds, it would help Nippon Steel tap into the Indian market ""where steel demand is expected to grow sharply in the mid- and long-term"" and be a key growth driver for the company, Shindo said.Under the new business plan, the Japanese company aims to raise its return on equity to 10 percent in the year to March 2021, against 5.3 percent for the current year, and boost its dividend ratio to around 30 percent in 2020/21, up from its current target of 20 percent to 30 percent.To raise its steel output, Nippon will start operating a new blast furnace, already built in Wakayama in western Japan, sometime around March 2019. The company will then close the existing 30-year-old blast furnace at the plants, which is the world's oldest blast furnace in operation.The switch will boost its annual crude steel output capacity by 500,000 tonnes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

414,"Mar 02, 2018 03:50AM ET",European shares fall as trade tensions weigh,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell to new two-week lows on Friday after Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, prompting worries over a global trade war.Such concerns sparked a broad sell off in Europe, sending the pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) index down 0.7 percent by 0825 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 1.1 percent and Britain's FTSE (FTSE) dropped 0.3 percent.All sectors were trading in negative territory, with autos (SXAP) leading the drop and weighed down by a 3.7 percent slump in  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) shares on concerns that the U.S. tariff move could increase raw material costs.Steel and aluminum stocks were also generally lower with ArcelorMittal (AS:MT),  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG) and Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) all down around 2 percent. Steel pipes maker  Tenaris  (MI:TENR), which has production and marketing facilities in the United States, however, rose around 0.6 percent.Precious metal miners outperformed as investors sought refuge in safe-haves assets such as gold following Trump's announcement. Randgold (L:RRS), Centamin (L:CEY) and  Polymetal  (L:POLYP) all rose more than 1.7 percent.Swedish radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb), up 9.9 percent, led gainers on the STOXX after it reported above-forecast earnings, while IMI (L:IMI) dropped 7.5 percent as its trading update disappointed. The STOXX was on track to end the week, already marked by worries over faster rate hikes in the United States, down more than 2 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

422,"Feb 19, 2018 05:12AM ET","European share rebound loses steam, steel stocks gain on US move",nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - European shares dipped in choppy trade on Monday as a poor update from  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) hit consumer staples, outweighing gains among financials and strength in steel makers after the U.S. outlined proposals for hefty import curbs. Shares in  Tenaris  (MI:TENR), Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) and Arcelor Mittal (AS:MT) - which have facilities in the United States - were the biggest gainers in Europe, up between 1.7 and 3.1 percent.Their gains and strength in financial stocks helped STOXX 600 (STOXX) post small gains at the open but the pan-European benchmark index was later dragged lower by a fall in consumer staple stocks. The index was down 0.1 percent by 0930 GMT.Monday's slight decline took place after the STOXX posted a 3.3 percent gain last week when strength of corporate updates and a return of inflows into equity funds helped global equities rebound from a turbulent start of the month. The index needs to rise another six percent to climb back to the 2-1/2 year peak hit at the end of January. Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB) missed profit expectations and its profit margins declined, hurt by a tougher pricing environment in developed markets and increased commodity costs. It said these issues would continue in the near term. [nL8N1Q910Z]Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB), the maker of Durex condoms, Lysol disinfectant and Mucinex cold medicine, fell 5.4 percent. Shares in  Unilever  (L:ULVR),  Diageo  (L:DGE), Nestle (S:NESN) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) also declined.Analyst at Investec affirmed their sell rating on Reckitt following the update, saying operating margin missed expectations and sales growth fell a little short of the more optimistic hopes given the strong flu performance from peers.The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended that President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas. [nL2N1Q60V8]  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the European Commission could respond with measures to limit steel imports to the European Union, and that ArcelorMittal and SSAB (ST:SSABa) would benefit the most from rising U.S. spreads. SSAB rose 2.5 percent. Banks (SX7P) were among the leading gainers, up 0.4 percent. The sector was supported by a 1.6 percent gain in shares of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) after analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch upgraded the German lender to neutral on optimism over investment banking trading revenues. [nL8N1Q911U] German industrial giant  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) rose one percent after announcing plans to list its healthcare division in the first half of the year. Mercedes maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) was a weak spot, down 1.7 percent, after reports said U.S. investigators probing Daimler had found that its cars were equipped with software which may have help them to pass diesel emissions tests.

436,"Feb 01, 2018 08:01PM ET",Exclusive: U.S. steel executives urge Trump to curb steel imports,nan,"By David Lawder and Lesley WroughtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executives of top American steel companies and related groups urged President Donald Trump on Thursday to urgently impose trade measures to curb excess steel capacity and surging imports they say are undermining the U.S. industry.A letter, sent to the White House and Congress by the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Steel Manufacturers Association, called on Trump to immediately act under the rarely used ""Section 232"" of a 1962 U.S. trade law, which allows for restrictions to protect national security.""We urge you to implement a remedy that is comprehensive and broad based, covering all major sources of steel imports and the full range of steel products, with only limited exceptions forproducts not currently available in the United States,""according to the letter seen by Reuters.Companies that signed the letter included Alton Steel, AK Steel Corp (N:AKS), Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (N:CLF), TimkenSteel Corp (N:TKR),  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), and ArcelorMittal USA (AS:MT).The letter was the second in five months from the steel industry to Trump, who promised in his presidential campaign to protect American steelworkers from imports and ordered an investigation last April of foreign steel imports under Section 232.The results of the investigation were handed to Trump on Jan. 11, 2018. He has 90 days to respond.A U.S. administration official said the White House was ""aware of the needs and concerns of stakeholders.""""The president has 90 days to make his decision and we will announce that decision at the appropriate time,"" the official told Reuters.Forcing a reduction of excess production in China, which now supplies half the world’s steel, is a key goal of any potential restrictions. The United States, the world's biggest steep importer, and China have long been at odds over how to combat excess capacity in the global steel sector. China has argued that it has done its bit to tackle the problem by cutting capacity.'WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH'Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, said there was optimism that Trump would come up with effective measures following his decision on Jan. 22 to slap tariffs on imported washers and solar panels.""I confident he will come up with a remedy that is effective and he still has 70 days to review it and make a decision,"" Bell told Reuters. ""We will have to take a wait-and-see approach, but it is clear the steel industry continues to be challenged and that 232 action sooner rather than later is important.""The letter underscored that despite the threat of trade actions, imports continue to swamp the U.S. market. In June 2017, steel imports hit their highest monthly total in more than two years by capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market, the letter said.Efforts to address global excess capacity through international consultations and groups such as the G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had failed, the letter added. The European Union has warned it will retaliate if European steelmakers suffer collateral damage from import restrictions under the Section 232 investigation.While the measure would mainly target China, NATO allies like Britain have expressed concern because the two countries have traded steel for military purposes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

453,"Jan 11, 2018 11:10PM ET","U.S. Commerce Dept sends Trump steel probe findings, keeps details under wraps",nan,"By David Lawder and Eric WalshWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday said it sent President Donald Trump the results of its probe into whether steel imports threaten U.S. national security, but declined to reveal any details of its recommendations.In a statement that offered no insight into the investigation's conclusions, the Commerce Department said Trump now has 90 days to decide ""on any potential action"".The probe could lead to broad tariffs or import quotas.White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement that Trump would announce his decision ""at the appropriate time.""Trump opened the ""Section 232"" investigation in April. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross set an internal deadline of end-June for announcing his recommendations, but an announcement was delayed for a G20 summit and bilateral talks with China in July.Trump said later in July that a final decision could wait until other top priority issues on his agenda were addressed, including healthcare and taxes.The investigation was kept under wraps at the Commerce Department, but the agency faced a Monday statutory deadline to present its report to the White House. A similar national security probe into aluminum imports invoking the same Cold War-era trade law is due on Jan. 22.""Although the report is not yet public, we believe that the investigation findings will confirm what domestic steelmakers already know. Imports of certain steel products to the United States should be restricted on national security grounds,"" said Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.In a statement, Bell called for ""broad, meaningful and impactful"" remedies that reduce the volumes of subsidized and dumped foreign steel products. Trump has promised he would take action to protect steelworkers from imports. But potential broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum have been the subject of intense debate in the White House, among officials who favor more aggressive restrictions and pro-business factions that favor a more cautious approach to avoid a run-up in steel prices or disruptions to U.S. allies.While forcing a reduction of excess production in China, which now supplies half the world's steel, is a key goal of any potential restrictions, broad tariffs would have a bigger impact on steelmakers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and Turkey.Most direct steel imports from China are already blocked by previous product- and country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.But anticipation of restrictions after the steel probe was launched triggered a surge in steel imports in 2017, causing them to rise by about 18 percent through November compared with 2016, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.Imports held about a 27 percent market share last year, helping to keep several U.S. steel mills idled and thousands of workers laid off. In August, senior executives from 25 U.S. steel and steel-related companies sent a letter to Trump asking for immediate import restrictions.The executives from companies including  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), U.S. Steel (N:X), ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) and Commercial Metals Co (N:CMC) said the sustained surge of steel imports into the United States had ""hollowed out"" much of the domestic steel industry and was threatening its ability to meet national security needs.Critics charge that using national security to erect steel tariffs could trigger a trade war with China, undermine the global rules-based trading system and hurt U.S. allies more than China and damage global growth prospects.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

473,"Dec 20, 2017 12:50PM ET",Thyssenkrupp shareholders get impatient for change,nan,"By Tom Käckenhoff and Christoph SteitzDUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Some investors in German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) are becoming impatient with the pace of its restructuring, putting pressure on Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger to fix underperforming units and revive its flagging share price.In the job since 2011, Hiesinger is seeking to transform the sprawling engineering and steel group into a company with a focus on high-tech elevators, the construction of industrial plants, materials trading and its businesses serving car makers, its biggest single customer group.Since he took over nearly seven years ago, shares in Thyssenkrupp are down about a fifth, underperforming an 87-percent rise in the DAX <0#.GDAXI> but better than the 55-percent decline of ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker.But for some investors that's not good enough.""There are areas that are lagging expectations and need fixing,"" one of Thyssenkrupp's top 20 shareholders said, declining to be named.The muted performance even caused activist investor Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder with an 18-percent stake, to recently question whether the group's conglomerate structure was still appropriate.Hiesinger, in a letter to shareholders last month, said it was still Thyssenkrupp's goal to enable the ""optimum development of all business areas so as to strengthen the performance of the group as a whole"".Cevian, in the meantime, has repeatedly suggested a demerger of better-performing units, including Thyssenkrupp's most profitable elevator business that accounts for almost half of its operating profit, calls which Hiesinger has so far resisted.""The major break-through is still lacking,"" said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which usually represents 1 percent of Thyssenkrupp's voting rights at its annual general meeting.Hiesinger has spent a lot of resources on severing ties to Thyssenkrupp's steel business, whose roots go back more than 200 years, and in September struck an initial deal to merge its European steel unit with that of  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).IN FOCUS""Other divisions have perhaps not been in focus that much as a result and that poses a problem now,"" said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder that owns about 0.3 percent of Thyssenkrupp.""Profitability levels of the individual businesses show that there is still a lot of room for improvement.""Investors and analysts are most concerned about Thyssenkrupp's Industrial Solutions division, which builds plants, ships and submarines and has been hit by low-margin legacy orders and weak demand for plant in recent years.Thyssenkrupp has already unveiled job cuts and recently announced a five-year high in orders at the division, but at 2 percent its operating margin is still below the 6-7 percent medium-to-long term target.""I think the division is more cyclical than we all thought,"" said Bjoern Voss, analyst at Warburg Research. ""Now the division needs to be restructured.""Some analysts also expect that Thyssenkrupp will at some point sell Materials Services, its materials distribution and trading division, a move analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) say would be a ""major catalyst"" for the group's stock price.The division's operating margin stood at 2.3 percent in the last financial year, compared with a mid-term target of 3-4 percent.Smaller German steel distributor  Kloeckner  & Co (DE:KCOGn) has expressed an interest in some parts of Materials Services, but said last week no talks were currently underway about a possible consolidation.So far, Thyssenkrupp only wants to sell a small part of the division -- Acciai Speciali Terni (AST), its Italian stainless steel unit, which made 1.78 billion euros ($2.11 billion) of sales in 2016/17 and has been labeled non-strategic.The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake, declined to comment.($1 = 0.8421 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

507,"Nov 09, 2017 12:51PM ET",European shares suffer worst day since June as earnings underwhelm,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday as a series of underwhelming earning updates, including from industrial giant  Siemens , (DE:SIEGn) prompted investors to take profits out of a market still trading near two-year highs.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index fell 1.1 percent, suffering its biggest daily loss since end-June, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 1.5 percent.The STOXX 600 is up 7.9 percent so far this year following a rally that has been fueled by a combination of strong economic data, solid earnings and easing political fears. Earlier this month it climbed back to its highest since August 2015.Following such a strong run traders said earnings needed to deliver strong positive surprises to justify further gains but on Thursday a number of companies disappointed.Siemens (DE:SIEGn) fell 3.7 percent. The German engineer posted a worse than expected 10 percent drop in quarterly industrial profit and signaled a tough year ahead as it restructures its turbine and wind power businesses.""The going is getting a bit harder at this stage,"" wrote  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst James Stettler, reiterating his ""equal weight"" rating on the stock.Vestas (CO:VWS) fell 19 percent after the world's largest maker of wind turbines lowered its 2017 profit margin outlookAmong heavy losers were also British luxury brand  Burberry  (L:BRBY), down 9.9 percent after results, and drug maker Hikma (L:HIK), which lost 4.1 percent after lowering 2017 revenue guidance for its generics business for a third time. According to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists, EPS (earnings per share) growth for the STOXX 600 has slowed to 7.6 percent in the third quarter following the broad-based earnings surge in the first quarter and the financials-driven beat in the second.It said the result were in line with expectations, with earnings beats hitting the lowest since the end of 2015 as euro strength offset the positive impact of a strong growth backdrop.The mood on Thursday was also dampened by worries over tax reforms in the United States. In spite of the pull-back some investors remained upbeat for prospects of the region's equities.""European equities have delivered excess returns this year and we see this as one of the better markets for coming years,” said Kamal Fahad, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros. Elsewhere ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) fell 3.4 percent after EU regulators said they would investigate whether its proposed purchase of Italian steel plant Ilva would lead to price hikes. Banks were again in focus with Italian lenders (FTIT8300) rebounding 1 percent after being hit in the previous session by worries over non-performing loans and Creval's (MI:PCVI) move to raise cash to shed bad debts. Daniele Nouy, the ECB's top supervisor, said on Thursday that the European Central Bank was prepared to delay and improve its new, stricter rules on bad bank loans after fierce criticism from the European Parliament and Italy. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rose 2.4 percent after it swung to net profit in the third quarter. The German bank reiterated it was still expecting to eke out a ""slightly positive"" net profit for the full year.Still in the financial sector, shares in Dutch insurer  Aegon  (AS:AEGN) were up 4.8 percent as it reported earnings above consensus.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

572,"Sep 02, 2017 03:20PM ET",EU's Vestager says Essilor-Luxottica merger requires thorough vetting,nan,"CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - The proposed merger of Italian spectacles maker  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) with French lens manufacturer Essilor (PA:ESSI) will require thorough vetting by European antitrust authorities, the head of the bloc's competition watchdog said on Saturday.Luxottica, the world's biggest eyewear company whose brands include Ray-Ban and Oakley, agreed in January a merger with Essilor, the biggest lens maker, to create an industry giant with a market value of 47 billion euros ($56 billion), more than 15 billion euros in revenues and 144,000 staff. The deal needs to clear antitrust hurdles in several countries and if approved is expected to close around the end of the year.The EU Commission was officially notified on Aug. 22 .EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said it was too early to say whether approval may require the companies to make significant concessions.""These are companies that have very big market shares and also, when it comes to sunglasses and lenses for glasses, obviously this is an important market, it is a very valuable market so I cannot say,"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti business conference in Italy.A negative reaction from Essilor's customers to the merger, which the company said in July had affected its first-half sales, has raised concerns among analysts that the two companies may be required to take more substantial concessions to satisfy the competition regulators than initially anticipated.Exane-BNP Paribas analysts said in a recent note the examination of the deal by EU competition authorities would include sounding out competitors, clients, and professional associations as well as reviewing possible complaints. ""Hence our concern over the mounting pushback from customers, recently stressed by Essilor,"" they said. A 'vertical integration' between two companies operating at different stages of the production chain is normally less worrying for competition watchdogs than a ""horizontal"" merger boosting a firm's market share. But a vertical tie-up can still risk blocking rivals' access to suppliers or buyers, a process known as 'foreclosure'.Vestager said a careful examination was necessary given the size of the two companies.""Even if it is a vertical integration, when you have market shares of this kind, in the high double digits, of course we have to be thorough in our analysis to make sure you don't foreclose,"" she said.Also asked about possible competition hurdles for the purchase of the troubled Ilva steel plant in southern Italy by ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker, Vestager said it was a ""very tricky case"" but good cooperation so far with the Italian authorities boded well for the approval process ahead.($1 = 0.8434 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

582,"Aug 24, 2017 05:48PM ET",Exclusive: U.S. steel executives appeal directly to Trump for import restrictions,nan,"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - American steel industry executives have appealed directly to President Donald Trump for immediate import restrictions in a letter seen by Reuters, as a U.S. Commerce Department national security probe languishes and steel imports surge back to 2015 levels. Senior executives from 25 U.S. steel and steel-related companies sent the letter to Trump late on Wednesday, saying the industry was suffering the consequences of government inaction that could change with his ""bold leadership"" and ""America First"" vision.""The need for action is urgent. Since the 232 investigation was announced in April, imports have continued to surge,"" the executives said in the letter.""Immediate action must meaningfully adjust imports to restore healthy levels of capacity utilization and profitability to the domestic industry over a sustained period,"" they wrote.A White House spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment on the letter.The Commerce Department has delayed the release of its recommendations from a ""Section 232"" investigation into whether steel imports pose a threat to national security, a finding that could lead to Trump imposing broad quotas or tariffs on steel imports. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an industry trade group, reported on Wednesday that total steel imports through July this year were up 22 percent from the same period a year ago, with imports taking 28 percent of the U.S. market.Imports captured 30 percent of the U.S. market in June, according to Commerce Department data compiled by the institute. Steel imports dipped briefly last year because of Commerce Department anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed on steel products from China and some other countries.The letter followed last week's departure of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who had been a vocal advocate for steel tariffs and other trade protections in the administration's internal debates over trade.'SOONER RATHER THAN LATER'The executives from companies including  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE) U.S. Steel (N:X), ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) and Commercial Metals Co (N:CMC) said the sustained surge of steel imports into the United States had ""hollowed out"" much of the domestic steel industry and was threatening its ability to meet national security needs.""Your leadership in finding a solution to the crisis facing the steel industry is badly needed now. Only you can authorize actions that can solve this crisis and we are asking for your immediate assistance,"" they wrote.Under the Cold War-era law authorizing the steel national security probe, Trump would have 90 days to act once the Commerce Department submits its probe.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had set an internal deadline for announcing his steel recommendations at the end of June, but it was delayed for a G20 summit and bilateral talks with China in July. Trump said later that month a final decision may wait until other top priority issues on his agenda are addressed, including healthcare and taxes. The steel executives are concerned that the Commerce report could be delayed further, pushing off a decision on quotas or tariffs until next year and allowing more foreign steel to flood the U.S. market, said Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, who also signed the letter.""This needs to be wrapped up sooner rather than later and we wanted to help the president understand that,"" Bell said.Another signatory, AISI President Tom Gibson, told Reuters the industry was trying to keep the issue ""front and center"" while Trump administration officials deal with a range of other issues from North Korea to fiscal policy.He said that domestic steel producers' capacity utilization rate was hovering around 75 percent, as steelmakers from South Korea to Turkey target U.S. demand to soak up their excess output.""Over the long term, that is not a sustainable level,"" Gibson said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Euro zone stocks and blue-chips also dropped 0.7 percent, while the miner-heavy FTSE underperformed and was down 0.8 percent.Eurostoxx volatility, the main European gauge of equity investor anxiety, jumped to a near four-month high, though it remained near historically depressed levels.Asian and U.S. equity markets had extended their sell-off overnight as a war of words between the U.S. and North Korea intensified.On Friday basic resource stocks dropped 2.6 percent to a month low as Chinese base metal prices collapsed as political pressures took their toll. Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO),  Glencore  (LON:GLEN),  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), BHP Billitonand Arcelormittal (AS:MT) all fell 2.3 to 4.1 percent. Falling crude prices made oil & gas stocks a weight too, dropping 1 percent with  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) the top faller.Banks also fell 0.9 percent, putting the index on track for its worst week in nine months.UK mid-cap Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) was the worst-performing on the STOXX, falling 7.6 percent after a top-rated Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst cut the retailer by two notches to ""underperform"", citing concerns about its mobile business.The probability of a market correction is increasing, HSBC's European equity strategists said. The MSCI Europe index has enjoyed a 406-day run of near uninterrupted gains, which they said was its second-longest stretch in the post-crisis bull market.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Overall, analyst are calling for about 9 percent year-on-year earnings growth for top European firms, compared to about 8 percent for the U.S., according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

739,"Mar 31, 2017 08:19AM ET",Germany urges EU to file WTO complaint against U.S. in steel row,nan,"By Michael NienaberBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany urged the European Union on Friday to consider filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States over its plan to impose duties on imports of steel plate from five EU member states.U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders on Friday aimed at identifying abuses causing huge U.S. trade deficits. He is also preparing to meet Chinese President Xi next week in Florida, with contentious trade issues likely to be high on the agenda.Global steel prices have slumped as Chinese producers, who account for about half of the worldwide steel supply, have flooded the export markets, leading to protests and anti-dumping complaints by the United States, the European Union and others.On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a final finding that European and Asian producers dumped certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate in the U.S. market, allowing it to impose duties ranging from 3.62 percent to 148 percent.Among the affected companies are firms in Germany, Austria, Belgium, France and Italy.Gabriel said the U.S. government seemed prepared to give U.S. firms an ""unfair competitive advantage"" over European producers even though this violated international trade law.""We Europeans cannot accept this. The EU must now examine whether it also files a complaint at the WTO. I strongly support this,"" Gabriel said. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is in charge of trade matters in the 28-member bloc.""The WTO rules are the backbone of the international trade order. To deliberately violate them is a dangerous step,"" he said. ""It is the first time that the U.S. in such a case resorts to distorting practices that do not comply with the WTO rules.""In Brussels, a spokesman for the European Commission said it regretted the U.S. move to impose anti-dumping measures, adding that the duties were ""artificially inflated"".""Our comments and notably those concerning the use by the U.S. of methodologies which artificially inflate the preliminary dumping margins have not been given expected consideration,"" the spokesman said. The final duties were in many cases higher than the preliminary duties set in November. ""We will look now into the detail of the decision taken by the U.S. and consider the appropriate steps,"" he said.THREATGabriel said Germany had to stand up to the U.S. and fight ""accounting tricks"" that put Germany's internationally competitive steel industry at a disadvantage.""If the U.S. got through with unfair competition, other industries would also be subject to the same threat,"" Gabriel warned.Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said Germany would, along with the European Commission, continue to campaign for Washington to stick to WTO rules.""The signals the U.S. is sending in the steel sector really worry us,"" Zypries said, adding that she would raise the issue when she visits the United States in May.Cut-to-length steel is used in a wide range of applications, including buildings and bridgework; agricultural, construction and mining equipment; machine parts and tooling; ships, rail cars, tankers and barges; and large-diameter pipes.The U.S. Department of Commerce's finding is the result of a petition from  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE) and U.S. subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal SA (AS:ISPA) and SSAB AB (ST:SSABa).For Austrian producers and exporters, dumping duties on the Voestalpine group (VI:VOES) and all others were set at 53.72 percent. Among French manufacturers and exporters, duty rates were set at 148.02 percent for Industeel France and 8.62 percent for Dillinger France and all others.In Germany, duties were set at 5.38 percent for AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke, 22.90 percent for the  Salzgitter  group (DE:SZGG) and 21.03 percent for all other exporters and producers.The chief executive of Italian steel firm Marcegaglia said the U.S. risked setting off a trade war if it implemented its plans for a border tax, an issue that should be taken to the WTO.""And when you start a war you don't know where you will end up,"" Emma Marcegaglia told reporters in Rome.Marcegaglia said it was still possible that the issue could be resolved through trans-Atlantic negotiations.Italy's industry minister warned that a U.S.-EU trade dispute would hurt growth and global governance at a time when the West needs to show a unified front against unfair trade practices.""Any trade clash between the United States and Europe would be dangerous not only for our economies, but also for the rules that govern globalization,"" Carlo Calenda told reporters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

765,"Mar 07, 2017 01:52AM ET",India mulls local steel requirement for $59 bln infrastructure spend,nan,"By Neha DasguptaNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India may soon mandate the use of local steel in government infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars, sources said, pitching it as a WTO-compliant protectionist measure aimed at further cutting cheap imports, mainly from China.The government expects the move to boost sales of local companies such as  JSW Steel  (NS:JSTL) and  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), and eventually attract global steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal (AS:ISPA) and POSCO (KS:005490) to invest in the country, five steel ministry sources told Reuters.India, the world's third largest steel consumer, has budgeted a record $59 billion for 2017/18 for steel-intensive infrastructure projects such as ports, roads, railways and power.""The preference in procurement will enhance demand and thus production. Definitely it is 'Make in Steel' and thus 'Make in India',"" Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh told Reuters.""It is preference with no compromise on quality and competitive pricing. To use domestic produce is an acceptable norm.""Analysts said a similar proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump requiring the use of domestic steel to build two energy pipeline projects could violate international trade laws, but Indian officials say their plan will fall within WTO rules. [nL5N1FF3PI][nL1N1FF202]A government document on the proposal, seen by Reuters, cites an article under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of the World Trade Organization, allowing an exception to ""procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for commercial sale"".Abhijit Das, head of the New Delhi-based think-tank Centre for WTO Studies, said the provision had been invoked by the United States in the past and India could do the same.The protectionist move would, however, shrink foreign companies' sales in the world's fastest growing steel market. Japan has already threatened to take India to the WTO over some recent steel restrictions. [nL4N1FD2V0]BOOST PRODUCTION, CUT IMPORTSIndia wants to nearly triple its production capacity by the next decade and acquire technology to produce higher value products including automotive steel. ""Current level of capacity utilization of domestic steel producers is below 80 percent,"" said Sanak Mishra, secretary-general of the Indian Steel Association in New Delhi.""If demand picks up on account of increased government spending on infrastructure and government mandates the use of domestic steel in such projects, the domestic steel producers are fully capable of raising the production level.""The proposal to use local steel, which will not be applicable to smaller projects, will be taken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet in a month, two of the sources said.Modi, under pressure to create millions of jobs, wants steel to contribute heavily to the government's target of raising the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25 percent by 2022 from 17 percent now, according to a steel ministry document seen by Reuters.""In the absence of domestic capacity, India would have to largely rely on China for its steel requirement since it is the only country with adequate surplus capacity to meet India's requirement,"" said the document. ""For a strategic product like steel which has uses in defense and infrastructure sector, this is a worrying proposition.""DEBT BURDENSMost Indian steel companies are so saddled with debt, however, that large-scale expansions will be difficult, analysts say. The steel industry contributes 29 percent of overall banking sector bad debt of around $135 billion, according to government data. [nL4N1DO1SN]Most companies have reported losses as prices fell after imports into India more than doubled to 13 million tonnes in 2015/16 from the levels of 2013/14. China contributed to more than a third of the imports.Following some restrictions on imports, April-to-January shipments into India fell a third to around 6 million tonnes.""The steel ministry has found an innovative way of clearing the bad debt by ensuring procurement,"" said one of the sources. ""When we say we will give preference to Indian steelmakers, the fence-sitters (among foreign steelmakers) will gear up to start investing in India.""Global companies including POSCO have made multiple field visits over the past few months but have not committed to any new projects in India. Steel ministry officials have also unsuccessfully courted  Hyundai Steel  (KS:004020), including offering them a strategic stake in SAIL's money-losing units, over the past months.POSCO and Hyundai Steel declined to comment about their India investment plans.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

893,"Nov 10, 2016 12:20PM ET",Bets on Trump loosening purse strings spark global reflation trades,nan,"By Jamie McGeeverLONDON (Reuters) - From construction companies in Spain to copper traders in London's financial district, Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election is being felt around the world as investors bet on a lasting rise in global inflation.If Trump delivers on his pledge to give the U.S. economy a growth and inflationary shot in the arm from a multi-trillion-dollar package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, the impact will likely be felt far beyond American borders.Analysts at M&G Investments this week went as far to ponder whether his election victory had triggered ""the end of global austerity"".Inflation has slumped to historic lows since the financial crisis, and much of the developed world has been battling deflation. A significant rise in inflation, or reflation - if it comes - would mark a sea change for markets.The U.S. economy is the world's largest, so inflationary moves there will be felt elsewhere. Investors are also betting that American fiscal stimulus will be replicated to varying degrees in Europe and Asia, thereby magnifying the effect. They are now trying to pick out the biggest winners from rising prices, across geographical regions, asset classes and industries. Much of their focus is centering on government bonds, base metals like copper and steel, and companies related to resources and construction - areas most sensitive to sharp moves in inflation and infrastructure spending.""At its core Mr Trump's offering is reflation,"" Nomura's asset allocation and foreign exchange strategy teams said on Thursday, adding that rising prices and market interest rates in the United States needed to be accompanied by a rise in real economic growth. ""That price discovery process on domestic reflation will take a long time to determine,"" they said.In the meantime though, they recommend buying the dollar against the euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar because the anticipated inflationary impulse could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next year faster than currently expected. DOLLAR, BONDSNomura expects the dollar to rise to 110 yen  within three months from 106.75 currently, to climb to C$1.40 from $1.34  and the euro to fall to $1.05 from $1.09 . A similar view is held by Michael Hasenstab, chief investment officer of the Templeton Global Macro fund who made his name with bets on Irish and Hungarian bonds among others.""We continue to expect rising inflation in the United States, rising U.S. Treasury yields, depreciations of the Japanese yen and euro, and currency appreciations across a select set of emerging markets,"" he said. U.S. inflation expectations as measured by five-year inflation swap contracts  jumped in the wake of Trump's victory to 2.38 percent on Wednesday - the highest level since July last year - from 2.24 percent the day before. Long-dated Treasury yields have leapt too in anticipation that tighter monetary policy will be needed to cool these inflationary pressures, with the 10 and 30-year yields hitting their highest levels since January (US10YT=RR) (US30YT=RR).The rise in the 30-year yield, in particular, has been remarkable. It is up more than 30 basis points this week, on course for its biggest weekly rise since 2009 and among the biggest of the last three decades.This has led to a so-called ""steepening"" of the yield curve, where the gap between short and longer-dated yields widens. Flattening curves often indicate a weaker outlook for growth and inflation, while steeper curves suggest the opposite.The seismic moves aren't exclusive to the U.S. bond and inflation markets. Bonds across the developed world have been on a near-uninterrupted bull run for 35 years, and some analysts say this year is the turning point.Euro zone inflation expectations as measured by five-year inflation swap rates  posted their biggest rise since August last year on Thursday, and the 30-year German yield surged almost 20 basis points. .CONSTRUCTION, METALSThese shifts across global interest rate markets in response to the changing inflation outlook are being mirrored in commodity and equity markets too.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) on Thursday reiterated its ""overweight"" position on the European basic resources and oil sectors, areas where investors are still ""underweight"". Copper surged more than 5 percent to a 16-month high of $5,714 a ton on Thursday . Nickel also hit its highest since July 2015 and zinc rose to a 5-1/2 year peak  .This is already filtering into related sectors and companies across global equity markets. Shares in the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMital (AS:ISPA) rose more than 10 percent on Thursday.The steel sector is poised to continue in the same vein, says  Barclays  (LON:BARC), especially if China responds to Trump's U.S.-focused largesse with a fiscal stimulus of its own to lift its domestic economy.""The outcome of the U.S. elections is a positive surprise for steel equities. Mr. Trump aims to boost infrastructure spending and tighten trade protection, further supporting the local steel sector,"" Barclays added.Europe's constructions and materials index hit a nine-year high on Thursday (SXOP). Shares in Spanish construction conglomerate ACS (MC:ACS), which does business around the world, rose more than 5 percent on Wednesday, the biggest rise since February. They are up 10 percent so far this week.Irish construction firm CRH (I:CRH), which derives half of its revenues from the United States, hit a nine-year high on Thursday, at 34.40 euros. That was within a whisker of its all-time peak of 34.56 euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Brazilian exports are dominated by Cia. Siderúrgica Nacional (SA:CSNA3) and Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (SA:USIM5).Other companies whose exports are affected by the decision include South Korean steelmakers POSCO (KS:005490) and  Hyundai Steel  Co (KS:004020), Indian producer  JSW Steel  Ltd (NS:JSTL) and a British subsidiary of  Tata Steel  Ltd (NS:TISC). Cold-rolled steel is used in automotive body panels, appliances, shipping containers and construction.U.S. officials launched probes into the imports after being petitioned by AK Steel Corp, a subsidiary of AK Steel Holding Co (N:AKS); ArcelorMittal USA LLC, a unit of ArcelorMittal SA (AS:ISPA);  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE);  Steel Dynamics  Inc (O:STLD); and United States Steel Corp (N:X).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1174,"Mar 30, 2016 02:30PM ET",Tata's UK steel exit raises expectations of European mergers,nan,"By Georgina ProdhanFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tata Steel's (NS:TISC) plan to sell its British steelmaking business has raised expectations of a long-awaited consolidation in the European steel sector, which is suffering from years of unaddressed overcapacity.Since the multi-billion-euro takeovers of Europe's Arcelor and Corus by Indian giants Mittal and Tata in 2006 and 2007, dealmaking in Europe's steel industry has been all but paralyzed as cash-starved producers battled the global economic crisis and a slowdown in China that encouraged it to export cheap steel.Lacking the means to consolidate further, which would have brought capacity reductions, Europe's steel mill owners continued to produce more than was needed, trying to protect their market share and jobs but feeding into a vicious circle of gluts and falling prices.At stake is an EU industry with annual turnover of about 170 billion euros ($193 billion) that directly employs 330,000 people, with many times that number in manufacturing industries dependent on it for a living.""The consolidation of the steel sector in Europe makes tons of sense but the problem is that the industry has waited for so long and the crisis is so big that you are dealing with businesses which are really cash flow-negative,"" said a London-based metals and mining banker who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly.Now, Tata at least has reached a pain point that it says forced it to act, even if this could mean shutting down the British operations it has spent almost a decade trying to turn around if it fails to find a buyer.Tata said it had extended ""substantial financial support"" to its UK business, which employs about 15,000 people, and written its assets down by more than 2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion). ""Selling over running it at a loss may clearly be a priority for Tata. If nobody comes they will shut it down,"" said Berenberg analyst Alessandro Abate.OPPORTUNITIESInitial interest from potential buyers appeared muted, with the business seen as unattractive because of Britain's vulnerability to cheap Chinese imports, its high energy prices and the cost of transporting steel to customers in continental Europe, as well as a disadvantageous exchange rate for exports.But severing its cash-bleeding British operations one way or another would allow Tata to seek a partner such as Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) for its profitable Dutch business - a combination that would create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal (AS:ISPA).Thyssenkrupp has signaled clearly in recent months it would like to combine its European steel operations with those of another player - as long as it does not involve spending cash.""We have always had over the last years overcapacity in the European sector and this definitely needs to be addressed and therefore we think there are opportunities,"" Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff told analysts on a call last month.""Combinations could address that issue, and therefore be value-accretive overall.""Such a merger would support prices for other European players such as ArcelorMittal,  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG) and Voestalpine (VI:VOES) - a development that could strengthen their hand to pursue their own acquisitions.""Tata Steel's exit from the UK might spark European consolidation in the steel space,"" Berenberg bank wrote in a note. European steel stocks rose on Wednesday on the news of Tata's move.But Seth Rosenfeld, a steel analyst at Jefferies, was skeptical. ""Unfortunately, if other steelmakers gain in terms of higher prices thanks to consolidation, this may only provide them more headroom to maintain the status quo for years to come,"" he said.""This is an industry that has seen waves of consolidation in times of either extreme distress or empire building. This environment is neither.""A successful sale could depend on sweeteners that Tata or the British government may be prepared to offer, said commodities trader Liberty House, which last week agreed to buy two of Tata's Scottish plants.A spokesman said the firm was potentially interested in the slab processing operations but not the more commoditised iron and steelmaking activities. ""We are waiting to see what sale proposal is on the table before deciding whether to bid for any of the assets,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It fell to $62 last year.The company said it had sold its 28 percent stake in Gestamp Automacion to majority shareholders, the Riberas family, for 875 million euros ($979 million), ending a joint venture formed in 1998.ArcelorMittal said core profit (EBITDA) dropped by 32 percent to $5.2 billion last year and would be ""in excess of"" $4.5 billion in 2016.""2015 was a very difficult year for the steel and mining industries. Although demand in our core markets remained strong, prices deteriorated significantly during the year as a result of excess capacity in China,"" Lakshmi Mittal said.The group, which makes about 6 percent of global steel, said apparent steel consumption in 2016 would be flat to slightly higher, as stronger demand in the United States and Europe would be outdone by declines in China, Brazil and former Soviet states.($1 = 0.8934 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1414,"Dec 01, 2014 05:10AM ET",Belgian strike hits international rail services,nan,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A strike on Monday in parts of Belgium over government austerity measures halted international rail services to and from Germany and Luxembourg and disrupted public transport across the country. Unions, disgruntled over pension and social security reforms planned by Belgium's new center-right government, are staging a series of regional strikes on Mondays until Dec. 15, when they plan a day of nationwide action. Monday's strike in parts of Western and Eastern Belgium, the second regional stoppage, caused rail operators Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] and Thalys to scrap all of their services between Belgium and Germany.  Luxembourg's rail operator CFL added that there would be no cross border trains to or from Belgium. Local rail and bus services in Belgium were also severely impacted, especially for connections to and from Ghent, Bruges and Liege. The action affected a number of company sites, including the plants in Ghent of steelmaker ArcelorMittal and Volvo Cars. While Eurostar services to London operated normally on Monday, the company said there would be no trains operating on Dec. 8 and 15, when the strikes will hit Brussels. Belgium's government says the cuts to pensions and social security benefits are needed to make the country more competitive and balance its books. Unions argue the measures target working families while sparing the rich.  (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Alison Williams) "

They said they plan to go ahead on Sunday with a vote that some fear could lead to a civil war.European equities strengthened on Thursday, after Mario Draghi said the ECB governing council is comfortable with acting at its next meeting, after the bank has published fresh forecasts for inflation and growth.Speaking at the ECB’s post-policy meeting press conference, Draghi said that recent weakness in inflation has been due to food and energy prices, but added that the strong euro and weak domestic demand are also pushing down inflation.Financial stocks were mixed, as BNP Paribas (PARIS:BNPP) slipped 0.21% and Societe Generale (PARIS:SOGN) added 0.14% in France, while Germany's Deutsche Bank (XETRA:DBKGn) gained 0.48%.Among peripheral lenders however, Italy's Unicredit (MILAN:CRDI) and Intesa Sanpaolo (MILAN:ISP) lost 0.04% and 0.29% respectively, while Spanish banks BBVA (MADRID:BBVA) and Banco Santander (MADRID:SAN) edged down 0.12% and 0.17%.Elsewhere, Publicis (PARIS:PUBP) dropped 0.92% following reports it and Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) abandoned their $35 billion plan to create the world’s largest advertising company. The two companies said they were not able to overcome obstacles that slowed progress toward the deal’s completion.In earnings news, Arcelormittal (AMS:ISPA) reported a 12% rise in first-quarter profit and reiterated its earnings target for the year. Shares in the steelmaker were still down 1.81%.In London, FTSE 100 slid 0.24%, led by Petrofac (LONDON:PFC), whose shares sank 15.27% after the energy services group warned its 2014 net profit would fall by as much as 11% to between $580 million and $600 million, due to a poor performance from its Integrated Energy Services division.Meanwhile, mining stocks were broadly higher, as Glencore Xstrata (LONDON:GLEN) rose 0.31% and Rio Tinto (LONDON:RIO) gained 0.50%, while rival Randgold Resources (LONDON:RRS) rallied 0.93%.Financial stocks were also mostly higher. Shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland (LONDON:RBS) edged up 0.18% and Lloyds Banking (LONDON:LLOY) added 0.31%, while Barclays (LONDON:BARC) jumped 1.31%. HSBC Holdings (LONDON:HSBA) underperformed however, slipping 0.16%.In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a moderately lower open. The Dow 30 futures pointed to a 0.12% fall, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.09% loss, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.13% slip.Also Friday, official data showed that Germany's trade surplus narrowed to €14.8 billion in March from €15.8 billion in February, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated surplus of €15.7 billion.Analysts had expected the trade surplus to widen to €16.6 billion in March."

1448,"Jul 27, 2011 04:48AM ET",U.S. debt stalemate pressures European shares,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.5 pct; falls for third session * Financials among top decliners; sector index down 2.4 pct * Risk appetite drops on U.S. debt talk impasse
 By Atul Prakash	 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - European shares fell on
Wednesday as a deadlock over raising the U.S. debt limit raised
concerns about a possible default and a downgrade of the
country's top-notch credit rating, prompting investors to cut
their exposure to riskier assets.	 The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index , one of Europe's 	
main barometers of sentiment, rose 6.5 percent, indicating a 	
decline in investors' desire to buy equities.	 Banks were among the top losers, with UniCredit 
falling 5.1 percent and the STOXX Europe 600 banking index
 down 2.4 percent. The index has fallen about 7 percent
in less than a week and is down more than 10 percent this year.	 Goldman Sachs downgraded European banks to ""neutral"" from
""overweight"" after last week's bounce, saying doubts over the
latest rescue package for Greece have started to emerge after
initial optimism.	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
fell for a third straight session. At 0817 GMT the index was
down 0.5 percent at 1,094.92 points after falling 0.3 percent in
the previous session. It is down 2.2 percent this year.	 ""Nervousness and volatility will probably be our companion
for the second half of the summer,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head
of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.	 ""Our base scenario is still that some sort of eleventh hour
deal will be reached. However, there is always a risk that they
do not come to a compromise. The impact would be formidable and
the U.S. economy may not be strong enough to take this,"" he
said, referring to the U.S. debt talks.	 Deeply divided Republican and Democrat leaders are
scrambling to find common ground with less than a week before
the government hits its borrowing limit approved by Congress. A
downgrade of U.S. credit rating would raise its borrowing costs
and hurt economic recovery. 	 The chances of a quick resolution narrowed after a vote on a
deficit plan from the top Republican in Congress was pushed back
to Thursday from Wednesday.	 ""There is a very simple logic that higher bond yields are
bad for economic growth and yet all the politicians are refusing
to budge on this issue. The politicians are underestimating the
fire that they are playing with,"" said Richard Greenwood, fund
manager at Bedlam Asset Management, which manages $700 million.	 ""I see equities moderately attractive in the medium term,
with a lot of interesting opportunities within the market. I
expect more upward pressure on gold prices, so gold miners would
be a favoured sector,"" he said, adding the fund company raised
its exposure to the precious metals sector about two weeks ago.	 Gold prices , generally seen as a safe-haven asset, 
hit a record high on Wednesday for the sixth time in two weeks. 	  EURO ZONE CRISIS	 Investors also remained cautious following persistent
worries about the euro zone debt crisis. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said Berlin was against a carte blanche for
the euro zone's rescue fund to purchase bonds on the secondary
market.	 In reaction, Spanish and Italian government bond yields
rose. Schaeuble's remarks added to investor worries about
whether a new Greek bailout plan agreed last week would be
enough to stop the spread of contagion to bigger euro zone
economies. .	 Spains' IBEX 35 index fell 1.8 percent, while
Italy's FTSE MIB lost 2.6 percent and regional banks 
lost ground, with the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Banks
index down 4.1 percent and the FTSE Greek
banks index down 2.4 percent.	 The Euro STOXX 50 , the euro zone's blue-chip 
index, fell 1.1 percent to 2,710.44 points. The index had formed
a bullish pattern on the weekly candlestick chart last week,
indicating some potential for recovery.	 However, the gap at 2,790 proved to be a strong resistance
and needed to be closed in order to confirm the bullish view.   
 The index is trading below its 20-day moving average and found
some support around 2,711.	 ""If broken, the next support levels will be at 2,682 and
2,636. It is likely that the index will suffer more losses to
either of these levels before forming a short-term bottom and
closing the gap,"" RBS technical analyst Dmytro Bondar said.	 Meanwhile the Stoxx 600 Europe auto sector index 
fell 1.4 percent on worries about vehicle demand. Daimler
 was down 0.7 percent after second-quarter revenues
came in below analysts' expectations but PSA Peugeot Citroen
 dropped over 8 percent after it warned that
profitability would be hit by raw material costs and the impact
of the Japan disaster.	 Miners, however, were in demand as copper rose on supply
worries following a strike at the world's larget copper mine in
Chile. The sector index rose 0.6 percent.	 Among individual movers, ArcelorMittal gained 1.9
percent after the world's largest steelmaker beat second-quarter
profit expectations.

Tuesday, gaining ground for the fourth consecutive session after
UBS's results sparked a rally in the financial sector. Gains were limited as heavyweight mining shares retreated
along with metal prices as investors trimmed their exposure to
risky assets such as resource-related stocks ahead of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's interest rate meeting. At 1128 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,144.41 points, after rising to a
two-week high of 1,146.37 points earlier in the session. ""People are cutting risk ahead of the Fed meeting. The
cautious stance is not only on the end of QE2 and the outlook
for rates but also on the fact that Bernanke will hold his
first-ever post-meeting press conference. The fact that the Fed
is changing the way it communicates is keeping investors on
edge,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading,
at Paris-based Global Equities. Anglo American was down 1 percent and ArcelorMittal down 0.9
percent. The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index, one of Europe's main
barometers of anxiety, was up 5.2 percent on Tuesday, signalling
a rise in investors' risk aversion ahead of the Fed's two-day
policy meeting that starts on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to stick to its plan to
complete its $600 billion bond-buying program in June, but
questions about the exit strategy will likely arise on Wednesday
when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds a news conference during
which he may give hints on the central bank's thinking on the
matter. ""(Bernanke) may more clearly signal that QE2 is indeed
expected to end on June 30. Since this outcome is widely
anticipated, more interesting would be any comments with respect
to the Fed's reinvestment program,"" RBS strategists wrote in a
note. ""At this time, most market participants expect the
reinvestment of MBS securities to extend beyond June 30. Any
signal that the Fed might be considering an end to ""QE lite"" at
the end of June as well could trigger a rethink of the Fed's
timetable for policy normalisation,"" they wrote. Shares in Swiss lender UBS rose 5.3 percent after saying
money poured back into its core wealth management arm in the
first quarter. Swiss rivals Julius Baer and Credit Suisse were
up 1.9 to 2.2 percent, while Barclays was up 0.7 percent and
Deutsche Bank up 0.8 percent. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.3 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.2
percent. ""I think it makes sense to be 'long' on stocks in the medium
term. That being said, it's not a bad idea for protection
against potential downside moves to play a put spread using the
100-day moving average on Euro STOXX 50 futures as a trigger.
You buy the put when the futures move above the 100-day moving
average,"" Global Equities' Thebault said. Italian dairy group Parmalat rose 11.5 percent after French
rival Lactalis launched a $4.9 billion takeover bid for it. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares has gained
3.2 percent over the past week, supported by
better-than-expected corporate earnings. So far, nearly 60 percent of 31 STOXX Europe 600 companies
that have reported first quarter earnings have met or beaten
analysts' forecasts, a figure that trails behind Wall Street's
strong showing so far in the earnings season, according to data
from Thomson Reuters StarMine. Of the 156 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly
results, 81 percent have either beaten or met market
expectations, while 19 percent have missed forecasts.

 (Adds quotes, details)	 By Hyunjoo Jin	 SEOUL, April 22 (Reuters) - POSCO's annual
earnings may remain under pressure due to fragile demand and
high raw materials costs after the world's No. 3 steelmaker
missed expectations with a 36 percent fall in quarterly profit.	 The global steel sector, seen as a barometer of the broader
economy's health, is facing a margin squeeze on record output
from China and stubbornly high prices of iron ore and coaking
coal.	 China's tightening is also weighing on steel demand and
Japan's devastating earthquake has dimmed overall demand
prospects from key consumers such as carmakers and shipbuilders
as they struggle to normalise production.	 ""Profits are seen improving gradually, but I don't expect
booming demand ahead. Therefore there will be no strong upward
momentum for (POSCO's) shares,"" said Cha Kyung-jin, a fund
manager at Golden Bridge Asset Management, which owns POSCO
shares.	 ""Also, there isn't any clear signs of growth in the Chinese
construction market, which may weigh on further demand,"" Cha
said on Friday.	 Shares in POSCO, which counts billionaire investor Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway   as a major
shareholder, have underperformed this year in a broader market
 up 7 percent.	 JFE Holdings , the world's No. 5 steelmaker,
reported a 67 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday after
the March 11 earthquake curtailed shipments. The firm provided
no outlook for the current financial year. [ID:nL3E7FL0OH]	  Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it could take
until the end of the year before production fully recovers to
levels before the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.
[ID:nL3E7FM0CG]	  HIGHER OPERATING PROFIT	 POSCO CFO Choi Jong-tae said the company's annual operating
profit is expected to be higher than last year, helped by price
hikes. But he did not provide any profit target.[ID:nL3E7FM0F7]	 This week, POSCO raised domestic steel prices by a
higher-than-expected 16-18 percent in its first increase since
July last year to reflect surging iron ore and coking coal
costs. Spot iron ore prices have jumped more than 30 percent
since July. [ID:nL3E7FJ05O][ID:nTOE65L006]	 The company increased its sales target for 2011 by 11
percent to 40 trillion won following the price increase and
expected earnings would improve from the second quarter, as it
aims at 1 trillion won in cost savings.    	 POSCO, which trails ArcelorMittal and Baosteel
 , reported January-March operating profit of 921
billion won ($852 million), below the consensus forecast of 1.1
trillion won by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	 The profit compares with 1.44 trillion won a year ago and
519 billion won in the previous quarter, POSCO said.	 The disappointing result comes after the World
Steel Association forecast this week that growth in apparent
global steel use this year will slow to 5.9 percent from last
year's 13 percent due to uncertainties in Europe, the Middle
East and Japan.	 POSCO said it had agreed to pay a quarter more for iron ore
purchases in the second quarter from the previous quarter and 47

group * Mongolia suspended deliveries following accidents - Xinhua

 (Adds details, comment from South Gobi Resources)	 BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - Mongolia has halted truck
deliveries of coal from the South Gobi region to China, with the
ban expected to last about two days, after China closed a part
of the border on Tuesday citing a technical glitch, a lobby
group for the Mongolian mining sector said.	 The South Gobi region is the location of the Tavan Tolgoi
property, one of the world's biggest coal deposits. Mongolia has
yet to build railway infrastructure in the region and exporters
continue to depend on trucks.	 ""The Chinese side said they had some problems (at the border
crossing of Zamyn Uuud) with their computer software registering
the vehicles,"" said Baasanjav Enkhbaatar, chairman of the
Mongolian Mining Club.	 ""It affected all the traders in Mongolia and so the
Mongolian government is taking countermeasures.""	 Official Chinese news agency Xinhua said Mongolia suspended
coal deliveries following a spate of accidents on a dirt road
running from Tavan Tolgoi.	 Citing local media, it said 23 people were killed in 31 road
accidents on the Tavan Tolgoi highway in 2010, with another
three fatalities in the first quarter of 2011.	 Officials at the Mongolian Mining Corp were not immediately
available for comment.	  ""The Mongolian government does close off shipments for a day
or two when there has been an accident -- sometimes there is so
much dust caused by the trucks and local herds or herdsmen are
hit,"" said Jim Reichert, senior infrastructure specialist with
the World Bank in Ulan Bator.	 ""They need to build a railway as soon as possible to
transport the coal -- there are any number of reasons to do
that,"" he said.	 Private financing was available to build railways south to
China, but the Mongolian government blocked construction in
order to concentrate on a cross-country rail network that would
link Tavan Tolgoi with Russia and the Pacific coast.	 The Tavan Tolgoi project is estimated to contain 6 billion
tonnes of coal reserves and its eastern block is scheduled to be
listed on an overseas stock exchange within a year.	 The government is currently assessing bids for the western
block of the project from ArcelorMittal , Vale
 and Xstrata , among others. [ID:nL3E7FD0IE]	 China imported 16.59 million tonnes of coal from Mongolia in
2010, up 176 percent on the year and behind only Indonesia,
Australia and Vietnam.	 Mongolia hopes to become China's biggest foreign supplier,
but its transportation infrastructure is already creaking under
the strain.	 The Mongolian Mining Corp and South Gobi Resources
 also have mining operations in the South Gobi region.	 David Bartel, vice-president in charge of Mongolian
operations at South Gobi Resources, said deliveries from the
company's mine were not affected.	 ""The block is just from the Tavan Tolgoi area -- they have
not stopped shipments from our mine,"" he said.	 The mine is about 400 km from Tavan Tolgoi and 45 km from
China and the company is currently building a dedicated road to
the border, he said.

biggest one-day fall in a month on Tuesday, with the main
indexes breaking below their 50-day moving averages, as Japan's
worsening nuclear crisis sparked a bout of profit taking. Alcoa's lower-than-expected revenue figures also fuelled
concerns over the upcoming earning season and rattled investors,
who were quick to book profits following an 8 percent rally over
the past month. Mining and metal stocks featured among the top losers, with
Xstrata down 4.1 percent and ArcelorMittal down 3 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares dropped
1.7 percent at 1,127.28 points, the index's lowest close in
nearly two weeks. The benchmark index, as well as the broader STOXX Europe 600
, the euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50, France's CAC 40 and
Germany's DAX all broke below their 50-day moving average,
sending a clear bearish signal. ""Strictly speaking, valuation levels remain very low, but
there are mounting doubts over the impact of rising energy and
commodity costs, as well as interest rates, on companies'
results. This hasn't been completely priced in yet in earnings
forecasts,"" said Pierre-Yves Gauthier, head of research at
AlphaValue in Paris. ""Earnings growth will not be as strong as hoped earlier this
year, probably 2-3 percent lower, and forecasts are being
trimmed which is never good for the market. On the positive
side, the long-awaited M&A revival has started. With current
interest rates, making acquisitions seems a no brainer."" Energy shares dropped, with BP down 2.8 percent, Total down
2.5 percent and Repsol down 3 percent, as U.S. oil futures
tumbled 3.6 percent to around $106 a barrel, trimming a small
portion of their recent sharp rally, as Goldman Sachs warned
again of a price reversal and the International Energy Agency
said high prices could be eroding demand. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index fell 1.5 percent,
Germany's DAX index shed 1.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 lost
1.5 percent. Investors' risk aversion was on the rise on Tuesday, with
the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index surging as much as 15 percent
to 22.9 points, a two-week high. The higher the volatility index, based on sell- and
buy-options on the Euro STOXX 50 stocks, the lower investors'
appetite for risky assets such as equities. ""I'm not expecting very positive surprises from the earnings
season. All sorts of negative things should emerge. The dollar
has weakened and we have to adjust (European corporate earnings)
forecasts with that. The pressure will also come from higher
commodity prices,"" said AXA IM fund manager Chrysoula
Zervoudakis, who manages around 520 million euros ($752
million). ""On the positive side, stocks are very cheap compared with
other asset classes. Companies have started to raise their
dividend, and yields are significant,"" Zervoudakis said. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, STOXX 600 companies
due to post first-quarter results in the upcoming reporting
season are expected to post an average negative earnings
surprise of 1 percent.

1454,"Apr 06, 2011 12:40PM ET",UPDATE 2-Indian govt further delays Cairn-Vedanta deal,nan," * Cabinet refers deal to ministerial panel  * Oil Minister Reddy finds complex issues * Says decision should not be taken in a hurry  * Cairn shares close down 2.8 percent, Vedanta down 0.8 pct
 (Adds quotes, stock prices, details)  By Devidutta Tripathy and Nidhi Verma   NEW DELHI, April 6 (Reuters) - Vedanta Resources appeared no
closer to winning India's approval for its $9.6 billion deal to
buy Cairn Energy's India assets after the government stuck to
its stance on royalties and referred the matter to a panel for
further review. The cabinet on Wednesday referred the deal to a panel of
ministers after discussing it in a meeting which had been
expected to reach a final decision. The referral further delays the deal, which would be the
largest in India's oil and gas sector and could help boost
investor sentiment in Asia's third-largest economy. ""All eyes are on this deal -- especially companies
considering foreign investment into India. The longer this drags
out, the more negative a reflection it has,"" said Ash Lazenby,
an analyst with Liberum Capital in London.  The issue would be considered by the panel only after
India's regional elections, which will take at least a month, a
government source said.  ""There are some complex issues. The cabinet committee felt
such a decision should not be taken in a hurry,"" India's Oil
Minister S.Jaipal Reddy told reporters. Cairn Energy agreed last August to sell a majority stake in
Cairn India to Vedanta, but the deal has been delayed due to a
dispute over royalty payments by Cairn India's partner,
state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).  SHARED BURDEN  ONGC, which has a 30 percent holding in the Cairn-operated
Rajasthan fields in western India, pays 100 percent of the
royalties.  India's oil ministry has been pushing to share the royalty
burden between ONGC and Cairn India but this is opposed by both
Cairn and Vedanta. Any change in the royalty structure would
impact valuations and could jeopardise the deal, analysts have
said. ""Even after eight months there doesn't seem to be any change
in the government's stance ... and if they continue to maintain
it to be cost recoverable, then I think the deal may not go
through,"" said K.K. Mital, head of portfolio management services
at Globe Capital. Shares in Cairn closed down 2.8 percent while Vedanta eased
0.8 percent. Cairn has set an internal deadline of April 15 to
seal the deal. Vedanta said it would go ahead with its open offer to Cairn
India's minority shareholders as scheduled, reflecting optimism
for the deal. It said its offer would open on April 11 and close
on April 30.  ""It is surprising that they are going ahead with the open
offer, because if the government gives a conditional acceptance,
then it will be value-destructive for Vedanta,"" said Deepak
Pareek, sector analyst at Mumbai brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher. Oil minister Reddy said he presented two options to the
cabinet: ""One was to give conditional clearance, the other was
to give clearance while leaving the legal course open to both
parties,"" he said. ArcelorMittal, the world's top steel maker, has also faced
years of delays in building several plants in India and some
analysts say regulatory uncertainties threaten to taint India's
attractiveness for foreign firms eager for a slice of its
booming $1.3 trillion economy. India in January approved plans by South Korea's POSCO for a
$12 billion steel mill after years of delay.

 (Adds detail) BRUSSELS, April 4 (Reuters) - EU regulators cut 80 percent
off a fine imposed on ArcelorMittal for taking part in a steel
cartel because subsidiaries of the Luxembourg-based steelmaker
could not pay their penalties. The European Commission said on Monday it was cutting the
fine, handed down last year, to 45.7 million euros ($65 million)
from 230 million. ""This was not an error. The Commission reduced the fine
because the subsidiaries could not pay it and ArcelorMittal
refused to do it for them,"" EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia
Torres said. It was the second time the Commission has reduced the fine.
In October, the EU watchdog cut an original 276 million euro
fine, citing an accounting error. The Commission also cut the penalty for Ori
Martin/Siderugica Latina Martin to 16.0 million euros from 19.8
million. Fines for other companies were unchanged. The latest reductions meant the total fine for the group of
17 steel producers fell to 269 million euros from 458 million.
The Commission charged the group last year of operating a cartel
for 18 years, from 1984 to 2002, in 24 EU countries.

 (Adds CEO comment, analyst quote, background) By Nick Vinocur and Johan Ahlander STOCKHOLM, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Swedish specialty steelmaker
SSAB expects cost cuts and some restocking to improve its
fourth-quarter performance, after weak demand and low prices
kept it in the red in the third quarter. SSAB said cost-cutting had already saved more than 500
million Swedish crowns ($71 million) since the start of the year
and would yield annual savings of twice that starting in 2010. Global demand for steel is showing signs of improving and
the company said production and deliveries picked up in the
United States during the third quarter.      ""Operating earnings in the fourth quarter will clearly be
better than what was reported for the third quarter,"" Chief
Executive Olof Faxander said in a statement. ""Despite a certain degree of stabilisation, there is
continued uncertainty regarding the pace of recovery,"" he added. SSAB shares, up by 50 percent since the start of the year,
were up a further 8 percent by 1057 GMT. Analysts said the pace of recovery in U.S. volumes had
surprised to the upside, driving the share price reaction. ""The rebound in volumes in the United States came a little
faster than expected,"" said Vincent Lepine, an analyst with
Exane BNP Paribas. Faxander said that deliveries in the United States in the
fourth quarter would be higher than in the preceding quarter,
while plants would be running at full capacity.  STEEL HURTING Steel prices have slumped more than 70 percent since their
peak in mid-2008 as demand from key industries such as
automotive and construction has evaporated. But improving macroeconomic data and restocking by
customers, coupled with government stimulus for the U.S. and
European automotive industries, have helped to lift prices off
their lows. SSAB's Faxander said he could not offer any outlook for
price trends, saying that visibility was even more limited than
in normal times and volatility remained high. The company posted a pretax loss of 1.1 billion Swedish
crowns ($157.1 million), slightly better than expectations, but
down from a profit of 2.7 billion a year ago. The forecast in a
Reuters poll of 15 analysts was for a loss of 1.2 billion
crowns. Sales were down 48 percent to 6.9 billion crowns during the
period due to an extended period of destocking, a process which
Faxander said was now complete in Europe and North America. Earlier this week, ArcelorMittal damped recovery hopes with
a muted forecast for the final quarter, even though it returned
to profit in July-September. ($1=7.046 Swedish Crown) (Reporting by Nick Vinocur and Johan Ahlander, editing by

percent. The company forecast core profit in the fourth quarter
of $2.0 to $2.4 billion, below analysts' expectations.  Software companies were also lower. Germany's SAP slumped
6.2 percent after it cut its outlook for software sales and
related services revenues for the full year after reporting
lower than expected quarterly results.    ""Sales were
disappointing on all levels. Regarding the
all-important licence sales, there was a clear shortfall of

1469,"Oct 26, 2009 12:00PM ET","Steel group urges Kirk, Locke press China on yuan",nan," WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. steel companies on
Monday urged U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke to press China in talks this week to raise
the value of its currency. ""The Chinese government's ongoing currency interventions to
keep the RMB significantly undervalued versus the dollar
threaten the fragile U.S. recovery and constitute an unfair
practice in international trade,"" the American Iron and Steel
Institute said in a letter to the Cabinet officials. The group's members include U.S. Steel , Nucor 
and ArcelorMittal Flat Americas . Kirk and Locke are the U.S. co-chairs of the U.S.-China
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, which is led on the
Chinese side by Vice Premier Wang Qishan. The meeting is set
for Wednesday and Thursday in Hangzhou. Many U.S. manufacturers believe Beijing keeps its currency,
the yuan, undervalued against the dollar to give Chinese
exporters an unfair advantage in international trade. The steel group also complained about Chinese government
subsidies it said have allowed China to increase its share of
the U.S. trade deficit even though overall trade is down this
year because of the global financial crisis. The yuan, also known as the renminbi  ,
rose 21 percent against the dollar from 2005 to July 2008 but
has budged little since then. President Barack Obama complained loudly about China's
currency practices during last year's campaign, but he has
taken a softer approach since taking office. In a  semi-annual report this month, Obama's Treasury
Department said China's yuan was ""undervalued"". But it continued the practice of former President George W.
Bush of not labeling China a currency manipulator -- a
designation that could trigger negotiations leading to possible
trade sanctions against an offender. U.S. trade officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified, declined to say last week whether Kirk and Locke
would raise China's exchange rate policies this week. But ""obviously, currency is part and parcel of our overall
economic relationship with China,"" a USTR official said. Locke, during a trip to China in July, said the United
States wanted Beijing to move to a ""freer floating exchange
rate.""

1470,"Oct 22, 2009 09:30AM ET",PREVIEW-ArcelorMittal to signal steady post-crisis rebound,nan," * Set to report improvement in Q3 from first half * Reliant on roaring Chinese demand * Europe, United States still sluggish  By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal is expected to
signal a steady improvement of the steel market next Wednesday
even though it is seen reporting a fourth consecutive quarterly
loss. The world's largest steelmaker will release third-quarter
results on Oct. 28, numbers that should be markedly better than
for the wretched first and second quarters, when the company was
only running at half capacity. It is still seen reporting a net loss in the July-September
period, albeit of only $0.01 per share. ArcelorMittal, with output some three times greater than
nearest rival Nippon Steel and nearly 8 percent of the global
market, is also expected to show the market is clearly split
between a sluggish developed world and roaring emerging demand,
notably from China. Chief executive Lakshmi Mittal has said he did not expect
markets to normalise in Europe and the United States in 2010
after the near-collapse of key steel markets of construction,
machinery and car production. European steel industry body Eurofer said in a report on
Thursday that the EU steel market remained ""stuck in slow
motion"" even after a likely return to growth of the overall EU
economy in the third quarter. However, Chinese domestic demand, which Mittal expects to
grow by more than 15 percent, should ensure steady global growth
of 3 to 5 percent per year after the crisis. The World Steel Association forecast earlier this month that
global steel consumption will rebound by 9.2 percent in 2010
after a decline this year of 8.6 percent, less acute than
earlier expected due to Chinese growth. China's daily steel production matched the previous month's
record in September, according to data released on Thursday.
Wolfgang Eder, the head of Austria's Voestalpine said China
could damage the delicate stabilisation of the market by ramping
up exports. ArcelorMittal investors will closely watch the company's
forecast for the fourth quarter, by when its plants should be
working at some 75 percent of capacity, from 66 percent in the
third quarter, and price hikes should have taken effect. Lower raw materials prices should also have a stronger
impact in the fourth quarter than the third, although the
company will face the cost of restarting blast furnaces. It is seen forecasting EBITDA (earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $2.4 to $2.9 billion in
the final quarter. World number two Nippon Steel is due to report its
first-half results next Thursday. South Korea's POSCO, global
number four, earlier this month signalled a brighter outlook for
the sector on improved global demand.

sales * Shares up 4.3 percent ahead of results, beat wider market By Jungyoun Park and Cho Meeyoung SEOUL, Oct 14 (Reuters) - POSCO, the world's No.4
steelmaker, signalled a brighter outlook for Asian steelmakers
on improved global demand after providing a robust outlook.  The South Korean steelmaker, the first major Asian
steelmaker to kick off quarterly results, said the industry's
recovery would extend through the fourth quarter and into 2010. Helen Lau, an analyst at Osk Securities in Hong Kong said,
POSCO's full-year target is an indication the global market is
improving and demand for steel is recovering in industries such
as shipping and manufacturing. ""This is good news for Chinese steel makers such as
Baosteel, which are likely to benefit from a revival in
exports,"" Lau said on Wednesday. Quoting the latest figures released in October from the
World Steel Association, POSCO said global steel demand is
expected to grow 9 percent to 1.206 billion tonnes next year,
with demand from developed countries seen rising 15 percent and
emerging market countries 10 percent. Analysts expect POSCO to perform even better in the current
quarter, leading a global steel market recovery, backed by
healthier demand from domestic automakers, whose need for flat
steel was fueled by robust domestic and overseas sales. According to Reuters calculations, the full-year operating
profit target figure implies a fourth-quarter operating profit
target of 1.64 trillion won, up 17 percent from a year ago
period. This turns positive on a year-on-year basis after three
quarters of negative growths. Shares in POSCO ended up 4.25 percent, beating the wider
market's 1.2 percent rise. The company said it was aiming to post full-year operating
profit of 3.2 trillion won for 2009 on a bullish outlook for
global steel demand, lower production and raw material costs. POSCO follows ArcelorMittal, Japan's Nippon Steel and
China's Baosteel in world rankings, For related graphic click on: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/109/KR_PSCO1009.gif KEY RISKS POSCO reported July-September operating profit of 1.018
trillion won ($875 million), in line with an average forecast
for 980.19 billion won according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit declined 6.2 percent to 1.14 trillion won from a
year ago but rose 165 percent from April-June as a stronger won
helped cut costs of imported raw materials. Third-quarter revenue fell 22.3 percent year-on-year to
6.85 trillion won but was up 8 percent quarter-on-quarter. While POSCO was able to rapidly pull out of the worst slump
in decades helped by the high quality of its products and price
competitiveness, there were murmurs of caution as global
economies have yet to show strong signs of a turnaround. Key risks to POSCO's earnings momentum include a
slower-than-expected pickup in the region's economies and
continued weakness in industries that POSCO is sensitive to,
such as shipbuilding, said Jeong Eui-suc, a research director
at Shinhan Investment Corporation. An oversupply situation could also dampen earnings. ""A bigger concern is possible oversupply in Asia and
China's macro-economic outlook next year. That could weigh on
the steel shares after strong third-quarter results,"" said
Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management. POSCO president said the company was considering bidding
for energy developer Daewoo International, but said acquisition
talks with Thainox Stainless Pcl are pending due to rising
share prices.

Meredith Whitney downgraded her rating on Goldman Sachs. By 1042 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,001.85 points. The benchmark index is up more than 55 percent from its
lifetime low of March 9 and 19 percent for the year, but is
still down 39 percent from its mid-2007 peak. ""Investors now are in wait-and-see mode. They are waiting
for earnings news, with major U.S. financial companies beginning
to report tomorrow,"" said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at Fortis
Bank. ""Everyone would like to see top-line growth, but I think it
is possible companies could disappoint on this."" Financials featured among the worst performers, with banks
taking the most points off the index. A downgrade by Whitney on Goldman to ""neutral"" from ""buy""
also put pressure on the market. Whitney shot to fame by
predicting much of the banking sector meltdown. Deutsche Bank shares slipped 1.4 percent as traders cited
market speculation that Germany's biggest bank may be planning a

after non-farm payrolls data contributed to a 1.9 percent fall
on Friday. The U.S. service sector expanded in September at a faster
pace than expected, with the Institute for Supply Management's
services index coming in at 50.9, compared to a forecast of 50. Markit's Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index of
around 2,000 companies showed the euro zone's services economy
returned to growth for the first time in 16 months in September
at a slightly better rate than first expected, but job losses
grew. Banks, which are sensitive to changes in risk appetite,
gained. Barclays, HSBC, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank added
0.5-1.7 percent.  Q3 EYED However, investors said sentiment was still relatively
fragile and third-quarter results from the U.S. companies, which
get under way this week with aluminium giant Alcoa, will
determine where share prices head. ""Investors will be looking at what guidance companies will
give for next year. I think they will disappoint so it will be a

percent since hitting a floor in early March, and is up nearly
17 percent so far this year on hopes of a 'V'-shaped economic

rally, buoyed by governments' liquidity injections and consumer
demand in the United States and Europe would remain weak. ""I do not see a strong pick-up in employment because quite a
few layoffs are still in the pipeline. If you look at the

 (Adds detail, comments from shareholders' meeting) By Prashant Mehra MUMBAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tata Steel, the world's No. 8
steelmaker by output, fell to a surprise net loss in the June
quarter on a slowdown in demand in Europe and the United States
and warned of a slow global recovery. The Indian company, whose shares ended 5 percent lower, said
it was aiming to rationalise operations in Europe and sharpen
its focus on cost management. Analysts said a rebound in earnings would be difficult in
the absence of a revival in demand. ""There is still no enthusiastic sign of demand coming back
in Europe and that remains a worry,"" said Niraj Shah, a sector
analyst at Centrum Stock Broking in Mumbai. ""The numbers are
really disappointing."" Shares in Tata Steel, with a market value of $6.9 billion,
ended down 5.1 percent at 436.40 rupees, having extending losses
to as much as 7.3 percent in the last half hour of trade after
the results. The Mumbai market overall closed up 0.1 percent. Tata Steel said its consolidated April-June net loss after
minority interests and share of profits of associates was 22.09
billion rupees ($452 million), compared with a forecast of 660
million from a Reuters poll of six analysts and a profit of
39.01 billion a year earlier. Consolidated net sales fell to 231.81 billion rupees from
433.75 billion, against a forecast of 230 billion. Global steel production slumped by a fifth in the first
seven months of this year as demand from the building and
automotive sectors shrank, but is gradually picking up as steel
mills revive idled capacity.  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT The world's top two steelmakers, ArcelorMittal and Nippon
Steel Corp, last month posted quarterly losses and warned the
industry's return to growth from the economic slump would be
gradual. Chairman Ratan Tata said the loss at Tata Steel, which
bought Corus, Europe's second-largest steelmaker, in 2007,
reflected a continued squeeze in demand in the United States and
Europe. ""There are now weak signs of recovery in terms of iron ore
prices but it is still difficult to say if this is sustained
recovery or just a plateau,"" Tata told the annual shareholders'
meeting. ""We aim to make Tata Steel the lowest-cost producer and
rationalising operations in Europe and optimising their
effectiveness will be a major challenge,"" he said. The World Steel Association in April forecast steel demand
would tumble 15 percent this year, its steepest fall since World
War Two. Tata Steel, which last month raised $500 million through a
share sale on the London Stock Exchange, has said it has strong
liquidity and no material repayment obligations or refinancing
for the next 12 months. The funds are being partly used to finance its capacity
expansion in India, where it is betting on annual demand growth
of about 25 percent. ""The global recovery is expected to be slow and the company
will continue to focus on operating performance and liquidity
management,"" B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel,
said in a statement. Tata Steel stock has more than doubled so far in 2009 after
tumbling 77 percent last year. The broader index is up nearly 64
percent so far this year.

expanded for the first time in 15 months in August, a survey of
purchasing managers showed on Friday, in a hopeful sign for
third quarter economic growth. A flash estimate of the Markit/CDAF composite purchasing
managers' index (PMI) -- which combines data from firms in the
services and manufacturing sectors -- rose to 50.9 in August
from a final reading of 47.3 in July. A reading of 50 separates growth from contraction.  The euro zone's second largest economy grew a surprising 0.3
percent in the second quarter, data last week showed, boosting
hopes that the worst is over. ""The French economy remained on the path to recovery in
August, as manufacturing output rose at a robust pace while
services activity showed signs of stabilisation,"" Markit
economist Jack Kennedy said in a statement. The factory sector moved into positive territory for the
first time in 15 months, rising to 50.2 from a final July
reading of 48.1. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, said last
month it was restarting production in the middle of August at a
site in France to respond to an increase in demand. The site had
shut in May after orders fell sharply. New factory orders climbed to 53.4 from 51.3 in July, the
PMI survey showed. Activity at services companies stayed stuck below 50, but
improved to 48.9 from 45.5 in July. New business rose to 50 from
45.2 in July. However, Kennedy sounded a note of caution. ""Although recent developments are undoubtedly positive, the
pace and sustainability of future growth are open to question as
falls in inflation begin to unwind, government stimulus measures
fade and the labour market continues to weaken,"" he said. The composite indicator for employment stayed well below 50,
but rose to 43.5 from 39.8 at the end of July. Economy Minister Christine Lagarde has welcomed the improved
outlook for the French economy, saying it is has been helped by
45 billion euros in government stimulus. However, she has also warned that unemployment will continue
to rise this year.

1482,"Aug 20, 2009 02:24AM ET",UPDATE 3-Voestalpine upbeat on outlook after tough Q1,nan," * Q1 EBIT loss 24 million euros vs 30 million forecast * CEO expects company to at least break even in full year * Shares up 2.5 percent at 1200 GMT

 (Adds real economy quotes, outlook) By Sylvia Westall and Alexandra Schwarz VIENNA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine
stuck to its full-year outlook when reporting an expected
first-quarter operating loss on Thursday, and said there were
signs that demand and prices were stabilizing. But the company, which expects to break even at the
operating level next quarter, cast doubt on whether positive
economic signals will translate into a sustainable upswing soon. ""If there is not at least a slight economic improvement on a
broad basis in Europe and the United States, then ... there will
be the certain risk of setbacks,"" Chief Executive Wolfgang Eder
told journalists in a conference call. Last week, Salzgitter, Germany's No. 2 steelmaker, gave a
downbeat outlook while sector leader ArcelorMittal has
reaffirmed its second-half target. Voestalpine, which said it should have a full-year profit on
the operating level, will also at least break even on its net
profit line, Eder said. Analysts also predict positive earnings before interest and
tax (EBIT) for the year to March 2010 but predict a net loss of
around 9 million euros ($13 million). ""Improved demand (from low levels) for automotive components
supports the outlook,"" Citigroup analyst Johan Rode said,
referring to the EBIT goal. ""The group's product mix and raw
material negotiating power should provide a buffer in a
downturn."" Shares climbed over 6 percent in early trade on Thursday
before paring gains to trade 1.6 percent higher at 20.96 euros,
underperforming the DJ Stoxx Basic Resources index.  TOP PICKS In a recent note on the steel sector, in which ArcelorMittal
was a top pick, Nomura rated the Voestalpine stock as the most
defensive, due to the long-term price contracts and the group's
exposure to infrastructure spending. But Voestalpine is one of Deutsche Bank's preferred stocks
in the sector, according to a note on Thursday. Voestalpine made an April-June EBIT loss of 24 million euros
($34.15 million), slightly narrower than market expectations,
and down from a 358 million profit last year. It suffered weak demand in nearly all markets and
industries, with commercial vehicle, machinery manufacturing and
construction sectors badly hit. Voestalpine said while there were signs short-term steel
prices may bottom out due to massive production cuts, any
stabilisation will have a time-lag because of plant shutdowns. Eder sees hard months ahead for the stainless steel
division, but said there should be a slight improvement by the
year-end. The steel division, should have ""positive numbers"" in
the fourth quarter, Eder said. The two divisions combined made
up nearly two-thirds of sales in the last financial year. Nomura Equity Research analyst Gavin Wood said that while
Voestalpine results were perhaps slightly better than expected,
it may only see improvements in earnings later than its peers. ""Voestalpine earnings may be more stable but because of its
long-term price contracts it is likely to suffer later than its
peers,"" he said.

 (Adds trader comment, background) TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Nippon Steel Corp, the world's
second-biggest steelmaker, swung to a quarterly loss amid weak
demand and inventory write-offs and widened its first half loss
forecast, pushing its shares down nearly 4 percent. The results strike a contrast with Japanese rival JFE
Holdings Inc, which forecast on Tuesday that it would post a
profit this year as its core steel business recovers,
triggering a sharp rally in its stock. Nippon Steel also said it would not pay a first half
dividend and warned that it may need to revise its full-year
forecast for zero profit given the uncertain demand outlook. ""Ahead of the announcement, shares of Nippon Steel had
risen following JFE's better-than-expected results, and
investors were inevitably disappointed with the first-half
downward revision,"" said Mitsuo Shimizu, deputy general manager
of the equity department at Cosmo Securities. """"But I think the steel sector has already hit the bottom
and will be on a recovery trail in the second half along with
improvement in the overall economy."" Steelmakers globally have taken a beating so far this year
as the global economic downturn triggered a slump in demand. Japanese blast furnace makers now appear to have passed
through the worst stage as orders and production are rising,
helped by a recovery in demand for exports and cars, where the
contraction in orders had been most severe. CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK Nippon Steel, which trails only ArcelorMittal in the global
steel market, plans to restart its biggest blast furnace in
southern Japan next month, though it has taken a cautious tone
on demand in the second-half. ""Our full-year forecast figures could prove temporary given
the unclear environment in the second half,"" Shinichi
Taniguchi, executive vice president of Nippon Steel, said at a
news conference. The company, which also competes with China's Baosteel and
South Korea's POSCO, said its recurring loss, which is before
tax and special items, for April-June came to 56.7 billion yen
($600.7 million) compared to a profit of 144.1 billion yen a
year earlier. It widened its recurring loss forecast for the
April-September first half by 10 billion yen to 110 billion
yen, but kept its full-year outlook at nil, against a consensus
estimate of a 3.4 billion yen loss from 17 analysts polled by
Thomson Reuters. JFE, which ranks fifth globally, forecast on Tuesday a 40
billion yen profit for the year to March 2010. Its stock was up
2.8 percent as of 0524 GMT, adding to Tuesday's 7 percent
surge. Recent spikes in export prices and the potential for
stronger demand in China are expected to help JFE most among
the Japanese blast furnace makers, as exports account for about
40 percent of its sales. Shares of Nippon Steel were down 3.7 percent at 363 yen.
The benchmark Nikkei average was up 0.2 percent.

1484,"Jul 28, 2009 08:32AM ET","INTERVIEW-Iraq starts privatisation drive, but progress slow",nan," * Iraq privatisation plans hit by global financial crisis * Iraq plans import tariffs early next year * Eyes deals with Marubeni, Daimler, ArcelorMittal  By Mohammed Abbas BAGHDAD, July 28 (Reuters) - Iraq's industry chief is
battling a global crisis and a deep-rooted aversion to Western
capitalism as he presses ahead with privatisation to wrench the
country free from past Soviet-style policies. Fawzi al-Hariri, minister of industry and minerals, says he
has broken new ground by ushering in Iraq's first public-private
partnerships, and plans to introduce new import regulations to
bolster Iraq's own industries. ""It's little in international terms but a leapfrog in Iraqi
terms,"" he said of the up to seven joint ventures he has
fostered between private investors and state-owned enterprises. ""It is unheard of to have private sector involvement in the
public sector. We broke that taboo,"" he said in an interview
with Reuters. As well as trying to entice private investment into war
ravaged industries, Iraq plans to introduce import tariffs of
between two and 20 percent early next year, a move it hopes will
encourage foreign manufacturers to open factories in Iraq. Iraq has some 67 state owned enterprises, which include 240
factories employing between 100 and 4,000 workers each. Yet equipment is ancient, and even before sanctions and the
war that ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq had long supported
unproductive state industries to keep people employed. Plans to privatise or partly privatise Iraqi industries have
hit a wall of suspicion among Iraqi lawmakers and the public who
for decades lived with Saddam's socialist economic policies. Privatisation legislation is stuck in parliament awaiting
ratification, and Hariri said he did not expect any state
industry stake sales until at least 2012. Utilities such as water and electricity, and industries such
as cigarette manufacturing are unlikely to privatised at all. ""You can see the sentiment in parts of the government and
legislative parties regarding oil contracts, and how they view
that as selling the state silver,"" Hariri said, referring to
rows over deals with foreign firms to develop Iraq's oil fields.  SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS In the absence of privatisation legislation, Hariri can only
offer production sharing deals to foreign investors, who are
promised the bulk of output over 10 to 15 years. But plans to conclude 35 such deals by the end of last year
were scotched by the global economic crisis and a sharp increase
in state wages, which raised production costs, Hariri said. However, he said he had had some successes.  Japan's Marubeni Corp has entered a joint venture with Iraq
and a private investor to develop a fertilizer plant, and the
company has also expressed interest in a cement factory. Iraq has a deal with Swedish truck maker Scania to assemble
vehicles in the country, and also has an initial agreement with
German carmaker Daimler for a production line, a deal Hariri
hopes to finalise in August. He said he hoped to revive a deal with the world's largest
steel maker ArcelorMittal, hit by last year's slump in steel
prices, to invest $1 billion in a Basra steel plant. Iraq hopes to ratify import tariff legislation early next
year in preparation for its entry into the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), a move Hariri said the body had approved. Iraq is currently a virtual free-for-all for importers. ""We want to certain protections, because once you're in the
WTO, you're open and fair game for everybody in the club,""
Hariri said, adding that some protectionist measures would only
be in place for five years by agreement with the WTO. Korean products by manufacturers such as South Korea's LG
Corp are particularly popular in Iraq, and Hariri hopes import
rules will push such firms to manufacture in Iraq. ""LG said to me, 'Why should we manufacture or assemble in
Iraq when we could be selling?',"" Hariri said. ""I said, 'Well, not for long'. They're now talking to us.""

 (Updates with ArcelorMittal comment, analyst comment) BRUSSELS, July 27 (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world's
largest steelmaker is looking into a possible joint venture
spin-off of its stainless steel business, worth around $3
billion, the Financial Times reported on Monday. ArcelorMittal, which is striving to bring down its debt, was
evaluating various options for the stainless business, but was
not planning to dispose of it completely, the newspaper said. ArcelorMittal said in a statement that consolidation was
needed in the stainless sector. A company spokesman declined to
say whether contributing assets to a joint venture was an
option.""ArcelorMittal continues to evaluate various options as it
has done in the past. While no assurance can be given that such
options will lead to consolidation, ArcelorMittal has no
intention to dispose of its stainless business,"" the company
said.  ArcelorMittal is in a quiet period ahead of second-quarter
results on Wednesday. At 1107 GMT, The company's shares were up 2.3 percent at
26.65 euros compared with a 1.4 percent gain of the DJ Stoxx
European basic resources index. The FT said that ArcelorMittal had discussed a possible
joint venture with South Korea's POSCO, although the talks had
not gone far. Finnish stainless steel maker Outokumpu was
another possible partner, the paper said. Both POSCO and Outokumpu declined to comment. Outokumpu, of
which Finland owns 31 percent, has previously said it is ready
to be an active player in the consolidation of the industry. ArcelorMittal's Stainless Steel unit shipped 1.96 million
tonnes last year, had sales of $8.3 billion and employed 12,415
workers at plants in Belgium, Brazil and France. As part of any joint venture deal, there would probably be
output cuts in parts of the business, most likely in Belgium and
France, the Financial Times said. Stainless steel, best known in the form of cutlery, has
suffered along with the rest of the steel sector from the
economic downturn, with output down as far as 50 percent of
capacity. Oddo Securities analyst Luc Pez said that a tie-up with the
likes of Outokumpu in a fragmented sector -- with the top five
producers only accounting for 37 percent of the market -- would
make sense. Overcapacity and a lack of market discipline meant there was
a need for consolidation of the stainless steel industry. ArcelorMittal also lacked a critical mass, with stainless
representing only 4 percent of EBITDA (earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortisation). The company's stainless steel activities are almost came
with the 2006 takeover by then Mittal Steel of Arcelor. ""Stainless has always been marginal in the portfolio. The
key question is whether you end up acquiring or bringing assets
to another player,"" Pez said.

SSAB said on Monday losses in the second quarter in line with
forecasts would widen in the current three months amid a fragile
market and seasonal order reductions by customers. Shares in SSAB were down 2.5 percent by 0745 GMT,
underperforming a 0.3 percent gain in the Stockholm bourse's
blue-chip index. ""It is a reasonable reaction. What disappoints the markets
today is that they are saying that results will be weaker in the
third quarter. They are relatively cautious about the outlook,""
said Johnson Imode, an analyst at S&P Equity Research. Steel prices have fallen in the wake of the worldwide
downturn which has hit demand for metals and delayed
construction projects, forcing steelmakers to cut output, delay
shipments and scale back investment plans. The company said the global steel market was still tinged
with uncertainty, and that it expected a wider loss in the third
quarter than in the second. ""It is too early to talk about a definite turnaround. What
we can note is stabilisation,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect that the result for the third quarter will be
weaker than for the second quarter, primarily due to seasonal
variations as a consequence of our customers' holiday outages,""
the firm said. SSAB reported a pretax loss of 1.10 billion Swedish crowns
($147 million) in the three months to June, down from a profit
of 3.0 billion a year ago. That compared with the average
forecast for a 1.08 billion loss in a Reuters poll of 13
analysts. ""The numbers were roughly in line with expectations. The
cash flow was stronger than expected, but the outlook is
somewhat weaker than expected,"" said Stefan Ward, an analyst at
Handelsbanken Capital Markets. The firm, which unveiled plans to cut 1,300 jobs at the end
of last year to adjust to the weaker demand, said its
cost-cutting programme had had a more rapid impact than
expected. ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker, is seen

positive over the course of this year helped by seasonality
and initial impact of cost-cutting,"" Banc of America Merrill
Lynch analysts wrote in a note. After the bell on Wall Street on Tuesday, Intel Corp's
quarterly results and outlook trumped analyst forecasts on
better-than-expected consumer demand for PCs, especially in
Asia. Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs also pleased investors
on Tuesday with better-than-expected results. However, Goldman's strong results are not necessarily a
preview of what to expect from all the banks, said Marie-Pierre
Peillon, head of equity and credit research at Groupama Asset
Management, in Paris. ""We're in the process of making the distinction between the
winners and the losers. Goldman is one of the winners, but other
banks are still struggling,"" she said.  BRACING FOR MORE EARNINGS Banking stocks were in positive territory, with Deutsche
Bank, HSBC, BBVA and Societe Generale up 1.2-2.7 percent. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.9 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 1.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 1
percent. Mining and steel stocks also gained ground, bolstered by
rising metal prices. Xstrata gained 3.3 percent, Rio Tinto added
2.7 percent and ArcelorMittal climbed 2.8 percent. So far this year, the DJ STOXX basic resources index is up
38 percent, the banking index is up 22 percent and the tech
index is up 14 percent. Optimism about a burgeoning economic recovery sparked a
sharp stock rally during the spring, propelling the FTSEurofirst
300 up 38 percent, but mixed macro data and rekindled doubts
over the outlook for corporate results halted the rally last
month, with the FTSEurofirst 300 down 4.7 percent since June 10. Investors were bracing from more earnings from global
companies due later this week, with Google, IBM, JPMorgan
reporting on Thursday, and Bank of America, Citigroup and
General Electric reporting on Friday. (Reporting by Blaise Robinson; editing by Simon Jessop)

 (Adds comments, details) By Miyoung Kim SEOUL, July 13 (Reuters) - POSCO <005490.KS>, the world's
No.6 steelmaker, reported its lowest quarterly profit in at
least nine years due to low prices and weak demand from
automakers and other manufacturers, but forecast second-half
earnings would nearly quadruple from the first half. The worst may now be behind most Asian steelmakers, which
had to cut output by as much as 50 percent in the first half,
as manufacturers have now started to replenish low inventory,
boosting prices by around 15 percent from recent lows in April. But a strong rebound in steel output growth worldwide is
threatening to reverse the recovery, as demand has yet to fully
recover amid fragile signs of a global economic rebound. ""The steel sector has relatively underperformed because of
oversupply worries. The poor (POSCO) earnings only confirmed
that those concerns were valid,"" Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at
Korea Investment and Securities. ""It looks like earnings have hit the bottom but the pace of
recovery in the future will depend on supply control, such as a
possible restructuring."" South Korea's POSCO, which competes with Japan's Nippon
Steel <5401.T> and JFE <5411.T> and China's Baosteel
<600019.SS>, raised its 2009 crude steel output target by 6.4
percent to 29.8 million tonnes and gave its first guidance for
2009 operating profit at 2.6 trillion won ($2 billion). The figure suggests second-half profit would top 2 trillion
won, up sharply from 543 billion won in the first half, as it
cranks up production using cheaper raw materials and as global
steel prices rebound. The firm cut second-quarter steel output by 15 percent from
a year ago to 7.13 million tonnes, but that marked a 16 percent
rise from the first quarter, when production fell by a quarter. POSCO, the first major Asian steelmaker to report results,
is faring better than rivals such as top-ranked ArcelorMittal
 and Nippon Steel, which have made output reductions
of around 40 percent early this year. Japanese steelmakers including Nippon and JFE are the
biggest casualties of the downturn in Asia and are seen
reporting heavy losses later this month, hit by price cuts and
reduced demand from the auto industry, their main customer.
[ID:nSEO3184] HIGHER STEEL PRICES Global steel prices have more than halved to below $500 a
tonne early this year from record highs hit last year. Prices have since rebounded, with China, the world's No.1
steelmaker, leading the recovery, helped by a near-$600 billion
infrastructure-focused stimulus package. POSCO expected a modest rise in global steel prices in the
second half as automakers increase production and Chinese
demand improves. April-June operating profit tumbled 91 percent to 170
billion won ($131.7 million), the lowest since it started
releasing quarterly results in 2000, but in line with an
average forecast for 172 billion won by 12 analysts. Net profit was 431 billion won, sharply above the 197
billion won forecast, thanks to increased foreign exchange
related gains. Revenue dropped 15 percent to 6.34 trillion won as POSCO
made record steel price cuts in May and reduced output. In May, POSCO agreed to cut fine iron ore prices by a third
and coking coal prices by around 60 percent with Australian
suppliers for 2009 contracts. Shares in POSCO closed down 1.3 percent on Monday ahead of
the earnings release, outperforming a 3.5 percent drop in the
broader market . The cost of buying protection against default by POSCO on
its debt has fallen in recent months, with its 5-year credit
default swap (CDS) spreads tightening to 147 basis points at
the end of last week from 419 points in the first week of
March, according to CDS data provider Markit.

trade on Thursday, halting a sharp five-session losing streak,
as forecast-beating results from U.S. bellwether Alcoa 
calmed fears over the incoming earnings season. At 0748 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was up 0.8 percent at 823.44 points, bouncing
back from a 10-week low on Wednesday. Miners and steelmakers were among the biggest gainers, with
Xstrata  up 1.5 percent, ArcelorMittal  up 3.1
percent, BHP Billiton  up 2.5 percent and Anglo American
 up 4.2 percent. ""There has been nothing reassuring in macro data lately, so
people are really hoping for good surprises on the earnings
front,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading,
at Global Equities, in Paris. ""We're still in a downward trend, with a lot of 'puts' from
institutional investors, so if we don't get better-than-expected
results and positive comments from companies, stocks are heading
for another 10 percent drop."" Kicking off the much-awaited earnings season, U.S. aluminium
major Alcoa Inc reported a third consecutive quarterly loss on
Wednesday, but cost cuts helped the company beat estimates by a
large margin. Alcoa's CEO Klaus Kleinfeld said there were signs that weak
demand for aluminium -- which has prompted production cuts and
sinking metals prices in the last nine months -- might be
easing. Alcoa's shares traded in Frankfurt  were up 7.4
percent. Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index  gained 0.5
percent, Germany's DAX index  rose 1.1 percent, and
France's CAC 40  added 0.6 percent. German business software maker SAP  rose 3.7
percent, after Banc of America-Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock
to ""buy"" from ""neutral"". ""Given the low expectation level we do not see negative
surprises from the second quarter,"" the broker wrote in a note. Shares in pharmaceutical and food companies slipped, with
GlaxoSmithKline  down 0.8 percent, and Unilever 
down 0.9 percent. On the macroeconomic front, data showed German imports fell
by more than exports rose in May, pushing the trade surplus
higher than expected to 10.3 billion euros ($14.34 billion) and
lending some support to hopes the country's export engine may be
firing up again. [ID:nL9393931]  EYES ON BOE ""This gives hope that exports will rise in the coming
months,"" said Thorsten Polleit, economist at Barclays Capital. ""This isn't the start of an upswing, however, but rather a
recovery from a low level. The economies of many important
trading partners remain weak."" Later in the session, investors' focus will turn to the Bank
of England's interest rate decision, due at 1100 GMT. According
to a Reuters poll, the Bank of England will leave rates
unchanged and is coming to the end of a quantitative easing
programme that economists say will prove to have been effective.

trade on Wednesday, mirroring big losses on Wall Street and
losing ground for the fifth straight session, as investors
braced for the start of the corporate earnings season. Oil firms were among the biggest losers, falling along with
crude prices on growing doubts over the health of the global
economy. Royal Dutch Shell was down 0.8 percent and Total down 1
percent. Banks were also losing ground, with Banco Santander down 1.7
percent, Barclays down 1.9 percent and UniCredit down 2 percent. At 0825 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.5 percent at 821.99 points, after falling to a
10-week low of 820.01 earlier. The fifth consecutive drop also
marked the index's longest losing streak since mid-January. ""The downward trend is set to continue for a while,"" said
Alexandre Le Drogoff, analyst at Aurel BGC. ""We might get a small rebound at some point, but there will
still be room on the downside, and you can expect a typical

drops."" After reaching a record low in early March, the pan-European
index surged 38 percent during the spring. But the sharp rally
stalled last month and stocks have given up some of their gains
on rekindled concerns about the economic recovery and corporate
results, with the FTSEurofirst 300 down 7.7 percent since June
10. Aluminium major Alcoa is due to kick off the second quarter
corporate earnings season later on Wednesday. Shares of mining and steel companies -- recently hit by
worries that earnings might not justify valuations after the
sector's sharp jump during the spring rally -- were mixed on
Wednesday, with Rio Tinto up 1.6 percent, Xstrata down 0.9
percent and ArcelorMittal down 1.3 percent. The sector, which plummeted 65 percent in 2008, is up 29
percent this year, making it the best performing in Europe.  TURNING DEFENSIVE But with mounting doubts over the prospect of a quick
economic recovery, investors' focus is turning to sectors seen
as more defensive, such as health care, telecoms and utilities. ""Over the last four weeks we have seen the greatest level of
buying in telecoms, which has also been the best performing
sector over this period,"" UBS strategist Nick Nelson wrote in a
note. On Wednesday, telecom group Vodafone was up 0.7 percent,
drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline put on 0.4 percent and Italy's utility
Enel was up 1.1 percent. Also on the upside, German chipmaker Infineon surged 7.7
percent after the company said late on Tuesday it would sell its
wireline communication unit (WLC) to a U.S. investor for 250
million euros. ""Post this transaction, (the company's) net debt position
will come down to only 75 million euros, according to our
(estimates), with gross cash going up to 1.1 billion euros,""
Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.3 percent,
Germany's DAX index slipped 0.3 percent, and France's CAC 40
eased 0.7 percent. So far this year, the FTSE 100 is down 5.9 percent, the DAX

Wednesday as energy stocks drew strength from higher oil prices
and Chinese economic data gave a lift to resource stocks such as
steelmaker ArcelorMittal . By 0917 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 1.2 percent at 860.09 points, boosted
also by banks, notably Commerzbank  which shot up on
news of a political deal giving German banks greater scope than

half of 2009 thanks to a gain of 15.9 percent in the second
quarter, after hitting a lifetime low on March 9. The second-quarter rally came to a halt by mid-June and the
FTSEurofirst has remained range-bound since then. It fell 1.1
percent on Tuesday. ""Some investors seem to be ready to buy on the dips,"" said
LBBW analyst Michael Koehler. ""There is no clear downward dynamic,"" he added. Other strategists said many investors appeared to be on
hold, awaiting the U.S. second-quarter corporate earnings season
kicking off with bellwethers such as Alcoa  on July 8 and
Intel  and Johnson & Johnson  on July 14. ""Q2, 2009 earnings revisions have now turned positive with
the season only a week away, a striking contrast to recent

JPMorgan said in a June 30 strategy note. Oil & gas  added the most points to the FTSEurofirst
early on Wednesday, with Royal Dutch Shell , BP

crude stocks buoyed hopes of a demand recovery. [ID:nSYD509355] China's manufacturing sector extended its recovery in June,

direct knowledge of the matter said StanChart was in talks to
purchase assets in China and India owned by the Royal Bank of

in positive territory, gaining 2.2 percent, against a 20 percent slide in the
Jan.-June period in 2008. The FTSEurofrst 300 index of top Euroepean shares hit a lifetime low on
March 9 following the financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and threatened much of
the world with a deep and vicious recession. The index surged 15.9 percent in the Apr.-June period of 2009, the best
quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still
down 48 percent from a multi-year peak scaled in the middle of 2007. The index lost 45 percent in 2008 after five straight years of gains. The
basic resources and banking sectors were among the worst perfomers last year,

1493,"Jun 26, 2009 01:16PM ET",Steel demand to fall up to 15 pct in 2009 -UNCTAD,nan,"* UNCTAD says world steel demand to fall up to 15 percent * Report concludes iron ore oversupply to continue 
GENEVA, June 26 (Reuters) - Global steel demand will fall as
much as 15 percent this year, though there are signs of resumed
appetite in China, the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD
said on Friday. ""The steel industry is facing its worst demand downturn
since the oil crisis of 1974-1975,"" an UNCTAD report, The Iron
Ore Market 2008-2010, said. ""A current oversupply situation, in which falling steel
production is occuring as iron ore production capacity
increases, will not go away soon."" Demand for steel from auto and appliance makers has fallen
sharply in line with the global slowdown, and the most widely
traded steel products, like hot-rolled coil and billet, have
also slowed. The biggest steel producing countries include Australia,
Brazil, South Africa and India, along with China, which alone
produced 366 million tonnes last year, according to UNCTAD. China is also the world's largest iron ore importer, having
purchased 444 million tonnes last year, a 16 percent import
increase over 2007. Its imports are closely watched for signs of
revival of the world economy. Earlier this week, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest
steelmaker, said recovery in world demand was largely dependent
on emerging markets such as China and Brazil, where growth has
already begun to rebound. And Brazilian iron ore miner Vale said on Wednesday that
demand from steel mills has begun to improve from its late-2008
low. UNCTAD's report, released in Geneva, concluded that this
year would be a difficult one for the iron ore sector. ""In 2009, world steel demand is expected to fall by as much
as 15 percent, although there are signs of resumed demand growth
in China,"" the Geneva-based agency said.

trade on Wednesday, halting a steep two-day slide that had
dragged the shares to their lowest level in five weeks, with
Oracle's forecast-beating results boosting techs.
  Heavyweight mining shares were on the upside, bolstered by
rising metal prices as the dollar softened. Anglo American was up 3.5 percent, Rio Tinto up 4.2 percent
and ArcelorMittal up 2.8 percent. At 0810 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.3 percent at 836.10 points. The index had lost
3.2 percent in the previous two sessions. ""We're seeing a bounce, helped in part by Oracle's results
that were not as bad as they could have been,"" said Edmund
Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas. The world's No. 3 software maker late on Tuesday reported
quarterly earnings above expectations as its profit margin hit a
record, thanks to robust growth in its maintenance business. SAP added 1.7 percent, Capgemini gained 1.2 percent and
Infineon rose 4.2 percent. ""But it doesn't change the broad picture: the market is
still oriented to the downside. People are cautious on the macro
side, with data today showing that Japanese exports are still
poor, and the global recovery isn't yet in place,"" Shing said. Data showed Japan's exports continued to drop in May,
further evidence that the turnaround in the world economy some
investors have been betting on is still some distance off.  FED EYED Investors were also bracing for the U.S. Federal Reserve's
interest rate decision and statement due on Wednesday. The Fed is seen keeping its benchmark short-term interest
rate near zero, but investors' attention will be on whether the
Fed might expand a $300 billion programme of Treasury purchases,
and signal how it might curtail its easy-money policy as the
recession is abating. Investors will also keep an eye on U.S. new home sales data,
looking for further insight on the health of the battered
housing market. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.1 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 0.1 percent, and France's CAC 40 down 0.1
percent. Banks gained ground, with BNP Paribas up 1.6 percent,
Barclays up 2.1 percent and UniCredit up 1 percent. Deutsche Bank rose 2 percent. Citi upgraded its rating on
the German lender to ""hold"" from ""sell"". ""Legacy risks have been greatly reduced, nominal capital
metrics now appear less stretched, and while certain businesses
still need to be repositioned, the strength of the fixed income
franchise should ensure a strong operating result in the second
quarter,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note. Stocks in sectors seen as defensives were on the downside on
Wednesday, with pharma groups GlaxoSmithKline down 1.6 percent
and Sanofi-Aventis down 2.2 percent, food majors Nestle down 0.6
percent and Unilever down 1.8 percent. On the year, the FTSEurofirst 300 is up 0.7 percent and the
DJ Stoxx 600 is up 2.9 percent, led by basic resources, up 37
percent, banks up 16 percent, techs up 10 percent, while health
care stocks are down 3.8 percent, and telecoms down 7.8 percent.

1495,"Jun 22, 2009 03:56AM ET",ANALYSIS-Xstrata-Anglo deal could rattle steelmakers,nan," * Steelmakers could face tougher bargain on coal * BHP, Rio Tinto unlikely to trump Xstrata's move on Anglo By Sonali Paul and James Regan MELBOURNE/SYDNEY, June 22 (Reuters) - A $68 billion merger
of coal giants Xstrata and Anglo American would rattle a global
steel industry that is already reeling from a tie-up between
two of its biggest iron ore suppliers. Xstrata wants a merger with Anglo American that would
create the second-largest producer of steel-making coals and
also mirror developments in iron ore, where major suppliers BHP
Billiton and Rio Tinto plan a joint venture. The prospect of BHP and Rio Tinto joining forces in iron
ore has brought cries of unfair competition from Asian and
European steel bodies fearing a loss of price control. But in both coking coal and iron ore, the miners could
argue they are simply doing now what steel mills have long
endorsed for themselves: merging and cutting costs. Steelmakers bulked up in a round of tie-ups earlier in the
decade, culminating in Tata Steel swallowing Corus and Lakshmi
Mittal buying Arcelor to create ArcelorMittal. If Xstrata acquires Anglo American, it would control 11
percent of the world's metallurgical coal market, according to
Australia's AME Mineral Economics. That would make it second
only to BHP in terms of coking coal production. ""This would put the supply of coal in fewer hands and at a
time when price is a sensitive subject,"" said Patersons
Securities coal analyst Andrew Harrington. ""That can't sit well with the buyers."" Global pricing of iron ore, which is based on benchmarks
set in annual price negotiations between producers and
steelmakers, is already under strain. An Xstrata deal with
Anglo American could add to pressure to shift to index-pricing
for bulk commodities, including iron ore and coking coal. ""The steel industry has inevitably got to try and respond
in a rational way,"" said Ken West, a partner at fund manager
Perennial Growth Partners. For now, coal miners are bracing for a sharp drop in
revenues as global recession hits steel production. Global
steel output fell 23 percent in January-February from a year
earlier, according to the World Steel Association. In March, BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) agreed to
accept a price cut of around 60 percent from Japan's Nippon
Steel, effectively setting the year's benchmark. In Japan, spokesmen at Nippon Steel and JFE Holdings
declined to comment on a possible Xstrata-Anglo American
marriage, though analysts see trouble looming for the mills. ""It's going to have a negative impact on steelmakers as
more consolidation in the raw materials sector would mean their
bargaining power would grow in line,"" said Yang Ki-in, a Daewoo
Securities steel analyst. ""It's something they would not welcome and may have a
longer-term impact."" NO RIVAL BIDS BHP and Rio are unlikely to try and block Xstrata and Anglo
American merging in the hope of saving the spoils for
themselves. ""I can't see either Rio or BHP being particularly
interested in doing anything on the corporate side with Anglo
or Xstrata,"" said Neil Boyd-Clark, portfolio manager at Fortis
Investment Partners. BHP Billiton CEO Marius Kloppers has been telling analysts
his company has not come across any opportunities to rival the
planned Rio iron ore joint venture. Both BHP and Rio are focused on their iron ore plan, where
they see at least $10 billion in savings. Rio is also
concentrating on paying down nearly half its debt. It plans to
raise $15.2 billion in a rights offer of new shares this month. Brazil's Vale, the world's top iron ore producer, is also
less likely to join the fray after being spurned by Xstrata in
an approach last year.

 (Updates with details, background) ISTANBUL, June 19 (Reuters) - Erdemir, Turkey's largest
steelmaker, said on Friday it was fined 20.12 million lira ($13
million) for violating competition rules and was ordered to end
its partnership with ArcelorMittal. Erdemir said in a statement it would appeal the decision by
the government's Competition Board. The Ankara-based board said Erdemir's purchase of a 25
percent stake in ArcelorMittal Ambalaj Celigi, a Turkish unit,
was illegal. It also ordered Erdemir to terminate its stake in Borcelik,
a Turkish flat-steel producer, that is also owned by
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, and
Istanbul-based Borusan Holding. Erdemir said in September it was ending its partnership with
ArcelorMittal in Borcelik, a flat-steel producer. Shares in Erdemir rose 3.3 percent to 4.36 lira on Friday.
The statement came after the bourse closed.

percent in early trade on Thursday, falling for the fifth
session in a row led by energy stocks, in spite of steady oil
prices, but the drop was limited by rising defensive shares. At 0914 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.3 percent at 842.94 points. Oil majors were among the biggest losers, with Total down
0.9 percent, BP off 1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell down 1.3
percent. Most banking stocks moved lower, with HSBC down 1.1 percent,
Barclays down 0.8 percent and Credit Suisse down 0.8 percent. The Swiss National Bank kept up its drastic measures to
fight recession and fend off deflation, and called for rules to
split off parts of its dominant banks or limit their size, if
needed, to protect the economy. Miners and steel makers were also on the downside,
surrendering early gains. Antofagasta was down 0.7 percent,
Lonmin down 1.7 percent and ArcelorMittal down 2.1 percent. Xstrata bucked the trend, up 0.6 percent, boosted by rating
upgrades from Citi and Morgan Stanley.  ""The trend is now downward,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff,
technical analyst at Aurel BGC, in Paris. ""The correction started a few sessions ago will continue for
a while,"" he said, pointing out that major stock indexes
including the FTSEurofirst 300 and the DJ Stoxx 600 crossed
their 200-day moving averages on the downside on Wednesday,
signalling a trend reversal after the strong spring rally. Fuelling recent doubts over a speedy economic recovery, data
on Thursday showed British retail sales fell unexpectedly in
May, driven by falls in clothing and footwear. ""Retail sales numbers for May came in lower than analysts
had expected, throwing doubt on any near-term economic recovery.
Those 'green shoots' aren't looking so green now,"" said Manoj
Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, in London.
 Around Europe on Thursday, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.4
percent, Germany's DAX index was down 0.3 percent, and France's
CAC 40 was down 0.3 percent. Shares in Q-Cells fell 4.2 percent after the solar company
said Chief Financial Officer Hartmut Schuening would leave the
company after the annual general meeting in June, earlier than
planned. On the upside, stocks seen as defensive gained ground, with
telecom group Vodafone up 1.8 percent, pharma firm
Sanofi-Aventis up 1 percent and utility group E.ON up 1.6
percent. HeidelbergCement jumped 16 percent after the debt-laden
German cement maker secured a 8.7 billion euro loan
restructuring plan from its banks, giving it until the end of
2011 to sell assets and cut costs to overhaul its strained
finances. Chipmaker Infineon rose 2.3 percent after Credit Suisse
raised its target price on the stock to 2.7 euros from 1.7
euros. Club Mediterranee SA surged 6 percent after entrepreneur
Bernard Tapie told French newspaper Le Monde in an interview
that he had bought just over 1 percent of the company's capital,
fuelling speculation about his intentions. Later in the session, investors will keep an eye on the
macro front, with U.S. leading indicators due at 1400 GMT, as
well as U.S. weekly jobless claims, due at 1230 GMT. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares has gained
31 percent since reaching a record low in early March as
better-than-feared macro data and corporate results calmed fears
of a prolonged recession, but the rally has lost steam over the

1498,"Jun 17, 2009 01:00PM ET",Growth and bank health woes weigh on Europe stocks,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 down 1.9 pct to lowest close since May 15 * Financials, oil & gas, basic resources leading losers * Defensive telecom, pharma stocks gain; Vodafone up 3.7 pct
 By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, June 17 (Reuters) - European shares fell for the
fourth straight session on Wednesday amid doubts about a return
to economic growth, which hammered commodity stocks, and with
banks in the red on fresh concerns about U.S. financial sector
health. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1.9
percent to 845.76 points -- its lowest close since May 15 -- but
remains up 1.7 percent year-to-date. ""We've seen a couple of weak days but no radical sell-off,""
said Commerzbank Chief Strategist Hans-Juergen Delp, who
attributed the downward move to a persistent discrepancy between
upbeat sentiment indicators and weak real economy data. ""The sentiment indicators have been positive but have not
been backed up by hard real economic data,"" he said. ""We need new impulses to kick off sustained gains but no
such impulses are in sight."" Banks took the most points off the European benchmark index. Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings and revised its
outlooks on 22 U.S. banks. ""Operating conditions for the industry will become less
favorable ... characterized by greater volatility in financial
markets during credit cycles, and tighter regulatory
supervision,"" S&P said, adding the changes also reflected an
ongoing broad-ranging reassessment of industry risk for U.S.
financial institutions. In Europe, Allied Irish Banks tumbled 17 percent, Dexia lost
6.8 percent, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse both fell 4
percent, and UBS dropped 3.9 percent.  DEMAND WORRIES London copper fell to a near two-week low as doubts about
the global economic recovery renewed worries over metals demand.
 Among miners, Xstrata plunged 10.2 percent, Rio Tinto lost
7.8 percent, Anglo American fell 6.3 percent and BHP Billiton
was down 3.9 percent. Steelmakers also suffered, notably ArcelorMittal, which
dropped 6.4 percent to its lowest close in three weeks. Softer oil prices hit energy stocks, with Repsol down 3.2
percent, BP down 2.4 percent and Total down 2.2 percent. Economic data on Wednesday showed the euro zone's unadjusted
exports fell 27 percent year-on-year in April and imports
dropped 28 percent. Bank of England policymakers acknowledged recent data on
Britain's economy had been encouraging but stuck with gloomy
projections published in May, minutes to this month's policy
meeting showed. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs lowered its
forecast for the domestic economy to contraction of 2.7 percent
this year and 0.4 percent in 2010, suggesting a deeper and
longer recession than so far anticipated. U.S. package delivery company FedEx Corp gave an outlook
well below Wall Street estimates, saying the next two quarters
would be ""extremely difficult"" although there were signs that
the pace of economic decline had slowed. ""The bulls have lost their swagger and after a week long
stalemate, the bears appear to be winning (the) recovery debate.
Financial markets have now broken out of last week's unusually
tight trading range,"" BetOnMarkets.com said in a note.  TRIPLE-WITCHING Some analysts have said the so-called triple witching -- the
simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options
and single stock options -- on June 19 could be playing a role. Technical analysts, or chartists, at UniCredit, said that
impact may have run its course by now. ""In the last five quarters, expiration effects already
occurred at the beginning of the week ... we expect most of the
expected pressure already to have happened,"" they said in an
equity strategy note. ""The market is clearly missing some real inspiration,""
UniCredit said, citing turnover on the New York Stock Exchange,
the trend of which European equity markets tends to follow. The day's European gainers were mainly in traditional
defensive sectors such as telecommunications and healthcare. In
telecommunications, Vodafone added 3.7 percent, Deutsche Telekom
 put on 2.1 percent and France Telecom rose 1.6 percent. Among healthcare stocks, AstraZeneca was up 2.5 percent and
Sanofi Aventis rose 1.5 percent. It was thin on the corporate news front, but some companies
made waves. Sainsbury fell 5.7 percent after Britain's third-biggest
grocer said it would raise about $700 million to accelerate its
expansion. ""The market isn't buying the capital raising and expansion
plans,"" ETX Capital said in a note. ""Analysts are concerned that the UK grocery market is
developing into a `barbell' shape, with giant Tesco at one end
and low-cost retailers like Morrison's and Asda (part of U.S.
WalMart) at the other. Sainsbury's, in this analysis, looks
uncomfortably stuck in the middle,"" ETX Capital said. Shares in K+S fell 14 percent after the German fertiliser
and salt maker warned of a bigger drop in earnings and sales
this year than previously forecast, as farmers continue to hold
off on potash orders.

at midday on Monday, weighed down by oil and gas stocks such as
Royal Dutch Shell and miners, notably Rio Tinto, as a stronger
dollar depressed commodity prices. At 1120 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 1.4 percent at 872.89 points. The index fell 0.2
percent on Friday, breaking a three-day winning streak, but
ended last week with a gain of 1.5 percent. ""Today, the bears are on the prowl,"" said Giuseppe-Guido
Amato, strategist at brokerage Lang & Schwarz. ""There is no news. The market is driven by technical
preparations for the triple-witching on Friday,"" Amato said,
referring to the June 19 expiry of contracts for stock index
futures, stock index options and single stock options. Stock market volatility often increases in the run-up to
triple-witching. International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said the worst of the global economic crisis may be yet to come.
""The large part of the worst is not yet behind us,"" Strauss-Kahn
said. The 16-country euro zone lost a record 1.22 million jobs in
the first quarter of 2009. The number in employment fell 0.8
percent against the previous quarter to 146.2 million. ""Markedly weakening labour markets are a major threat to
recovery prospects in the Eurozone. Sharply higher and rising
unemployment will weigh down on Eurozone consumer spending,""
said IHS Global Insight Chief Economist Howard Archer. ""It will be some time before any improvement in economic
activity feeds through to help the jobs outlook,"" he said,
adding that ""economic activity will remain too weak to actually
generate jobs overall until well into 2010."" JPMorgan said it might take months before the earnings
outlook for cyclical companies becomes clearer. ""Signs whether a recovery has started and what normal demand
is should become clearer after September, which could be the
first month less affected by production shutdowns and
de-stocking,"" JPMorgan said in a note, citing feedback from its
June 10-11 European Capital Goods CEO conference. ""Companies see early signs of stabilization in parts of
their business, but most remain skeptical about a recovery.
Derived from the comments at the conference, we expect most
companies to report similar or worse results in Q2 than in Q1
and give a cautious near-term outlook,"" JPMorgan said.  DOLLAR RALLY Oil & gas stocks took the most points off the European
benchmark index by midday on Monday, with Royal Dutch Shell down
2.5 percent, Total 1.6 percent lower, BP dropping 1.6 percent
and ENI down 1.3 percent. Oil fell over 1 percent towards $71 a barrel, extending its
retreat from eight-month highs. The oil price slide was attributed mainly to U.S. dollar
strength after Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said the
dollar's role as the world's main reserve currency was unlikely
to change in the near future. The stronger dollar also hurt base metals, with London
copper prices down 3 percent. Mining stocks fell, with Rio Tinto down 5.6 percent, Xstrata
 down 4.6 percent and Vedanta Resources down 3.8 percent. Among steelmakers, which together with miners carry the most
weight in the DJ Stoxx basic resources index -- which was down 3
percent -- ArcelorMittal fell 4 percent, Voestalpine dropped 3.5
percent and Salzgitter lost 1.9 percent. Autos rivalled basic resources as the day's weakest European
sector after world number two truck maker Volvo said its truck
deliveries fell 57 percent year-on-year in May. Volvo's share price fell 2.3 percent. Among other truck
makers Daimler was down 4.7 percent, MAN SE dropped 2.8 percent,
and Scania fell 1.5 percent. Navigation device maker TomTom NV dropped 11.6 percent on
the company's plan to raise 430 million euros in a share issue
to pay down part of its debt. Air France-KLM fell 4.5 percent after Citigroup cut its
rating on the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"". Bayer dropped 3.3 percent after the chief executive of its
pharmaceutical unit told a newspaper that price pressure in the

1500,"Jun 08, 2009 09:00AM ET",UPDATE 1-RusSpetsStal eyes defence orders to survive crisis,nan," * Red October steel output a quarter of last year's level
* Defence sector demand will sustain production * Avoiding mass lay-offs * General director backs creation of Russian steel giant 
 (Adds details, quotes, background) By Robin Paxton MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - State firm Russian Technologies
is counting on defence sector demand to sustain its Red October
steel mill through an economic slowdown that has slashed output
to a quarter of last year's levels, a company official said. RusSpetsStal, set up by Russian Technologies to manage its
special steel assets, wants to acquire other plants when the
economy emerges from crisis, but is concentrating now on
avoiding mass redundancies, General Director Sergei Nosov said. ""We have not laid anybody off. We are trying not to repeat
the experience of Pikalyovo,"" Nosov said, referring to the town
where Prime Minister Vladimir Putin publicy rebuked billionaire
Oleg Deripaska last week over unpaid salaries. ""Red October has a chance. The defence sector, one way or
another, will spend money. Our support will come from the
defence sector,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of the Metal
Bulletin Russian Steel Summit. Steel makers in Russia, the world's fourth-largest producer,
have cut output as orders dry up from the crisis-hit automotive
and construction sectors. Production fell almost 30 percent in
April, year-on-year, official data showed. The Red October, or Krasny Oktyabr, plant in the southern
city of Volgograd -- RusSpetsStal's main production unit -- is
producing a monthly average 10,000 tonnes of finished steel this
year, compared with 40,000 tonnes last year, Nosov said. RusSpetsStal was founded in 2006 with the aim of grouping
some of Russia's main producers of special steel for the
defence, machine-building and aerospace sectors. It acquired Red
October in January 2007 but has yet to buy another major plant. Parent company Russian Technologies, run by businessman
Sergei Chemezov, is a state-owned empire that spans titanium
producer VSMPO-Avisma, leading Russian car maker AvtoVAZ and one
of the world's biggest arms exporters.  NATIONAL CHAMPION Nosov, a former Evraz Group executive, said Russia should
follow the example of ArcelorMittal and create a steel giant to
challenge the world's largest producers. ""The Russian steel industry would be so much stronger if it
worked together,"" he said. ""A company that could produce 20, 30
or 40 million tonnes a year would be a serious player on the
market. And if it were vertically integrated, all the better."" Russia produced 68.5 million tonnes of steel last year, 5.2
percent of global output. Four firms, Severstal, Evraz Group,
Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works and Novolipetsk Steel, each
melted over 10 million tonnes. Nosov said he supported a merger between steel makers, not
the ambitious mega-merger proposed by some Russian billionaires
that might also have included Norilsk Nickel. ""I'm not prepared to say that Russian Technologies is
playing a role, or will play a role. It's too early to say."" He added: ""It would be interesting to make acquisitions for
pennies, but on the other hand where are the market prospects? ""Whoever comes through this period -- and it might be an
extended period -- will be successful in the future.""

1502,"May 18, 2009 08:08PM ET",FEATURE-Luxembourg hopes to turn rules to advantage,nan," * Duchy's image hit by Madoff scandal, waning bank secrecy * Tougher regulation seen as threat, some say * Others see maintaining reputation of safe centre as key  By Lisa Jucca LUXEMBOURG, May 19 (Reuters) - Down in Clausen, a trendy
area near Luxembourg City's landmark gorge, the professionals
smoking cigars and sipping mid-week wine in a brewery-turned-
sushi bar seem oblivious to the threat to their economy. But in the high-rise steel and glass buildings that dot
Europe's investment funds capital, the market turmoil and its 
consequences for the small land-locked Grand Duchy are a
recurrent talking point. Luxembourg, where the financial sector accounts for 45
percent of the economy, is facing two specific headaches: its
tradition of bank secrecy is crumbling, and ripples of Bernard
Madoff's fraud have cast a pall over its successful funds
industry. ""We have to accept that our reputation has been a bit
tarnished by Madoff, even if this is an (isolated) incident,""
said John Li, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of consultancy
KPMG Luxembourg. Luxembourg's no-quibble procedures for fund registration,
stable political scene and well-educated workforce have helped
it become Europe's top funds centre -- followed by France. At
the pinnacle of its growth, in 2007, its funds managed assets
worth 2 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion). That figure dropped by a quarter after the financial storm
hit in 2008. Madoff's fraud made matters worse: investors lost
$1.7 billion to Madoff in Luxembourg, mainly via the large
mutual fund Luxalpha.  Combined with a global crackdown on secretive offshore
centres led by countries such as the United States and Germany,
the impact on the country's lean financial system may be heavier
regulation: Luxembourgers and foreign investors fear that could
threaten its ability to market its funds abroad. ""The big challenge for Luxembourg is to remain a safe but
flexible financial centre even after the crisis,"" said
29-year-old Laurent Muller, who along with his brother runs
family-owned corporate tax advisory business Paddock. ""Overregulation is not what we are looking for right now."" Sally Wong, CEO of the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association, told fund managers at a conference earlier this
year the questions about Madoff and Luxembourg had reached board
level among her clients. ""One board member asked me the other day: what is the impact
of Madoff on Luxembourg, what is going on there?""  FINANCIAL BY DEFINITION Besides relatively affordable gasoline and Villeroy & Boch
porcelain, finance defines Luxembourg: advertisements for its
banks plaster even the brochures handed out by the tourist
office. Nestled between Belgium, Germany and France, this nation
whose 490,000 people are typically quadrilingual has impressed
rivals with its ability to evolve into a sophisticated financial
centre from being heavily dependent on steel. ArcelorMittal, headquartered in Luxembourg, is still the
world's largest steelmaker with 10 percent of global output. The
industry built up on the Grand Duchy's seam of iron ore now only
accounts for 11 percent of the country's economy. Founded around a 1,000-year old fortress and a centuries-old
crossroads for European armies, Luxembourg first attracted
capital around the time of Congo's independence in the 1960s as
rich Belgians moved wealth from the former colony, bankers say. Other waves coincided with the rise of the left in France
and the start of a withholding tax in Germany in the 1980s. Luxembourg became the world's third-richest country by
output per head after it jumped on the funds bandwagon when the
financial products took off in the 1980s. It now administers an estimated $1 trillion of foreign
wealth or 14 percent of the wealth stashed abroad globally,
making it the world's third-largest offshore centre, and it has
more than 70,000 people working at its banks. In contrast to offshore leader Switzerland, which manages
about $2 trillion and caters for the ultra-rich, Luxembourg
banks have mainly served middle-class French and Germans.  FRENCH ATTACK America was the epicentre of the Madoff scandal, but
Luxembourg's situation was complicated in January by a
diplomatic offensive launched by its funds rival France, French funds managed assets of about 1.3 trillion euros in
2007 according to European funds industry association EFAMA and
France is, lawyers say, home to many of the wealthy investors
who have lost money on the Madoff Ponzi scheme. French Minister Christine Lagarde asked the European Union
to review rules governing mutual funds in light of the Madoff
scandal, in what was widely seen as an attack on the way
Luxembourg had applied them. Luxembourg strongly rejected such criticism and Peter De
Proft, director at EFAMA, said that of 35,000 funds available to
the broad public, only four were affected by Madoff, which was
the only significant fraud to hit the country's industry in 20
years. While fighting to restore its reputation on the Madoff
front, Luxembourg is also under pressure from cash-strapped
western nations to let foreign tax authorities access untaxed
wealth hidden in bank secrecy strongholds around the world. The Duchy, together with other major offshore centres,
decided in March to relax its strict privacy rules, allowing
banks to pass some tax-related client data to foreign
authorities to pursue tax cheats. But local support to bank
privacy continues strong. ""It's not for banks to do the policing,"" said KPMG's Li. Nonetheless, as more and more financial segments are caught
in the regulatory net, Luxembourg hopes that its EU status and
expertise in the funds industry can help it outperform offshore
islands that solely rely on untaxed money and murky hedge funds. ""If there is one lesson to be learnt from the financial
crisis is that there is huge value in good and safe regulation,""
Claude Kremer, Chairman of Luxembourg's funds association. ""Those exotic centres that are doing unregulated funds will
necessarily see a shift of business towards regulated centres.
And there Luxembourg can play a really important role."" (Additional reporting by Michele Sinner; Editing by Sara

1503,"May 04, 2009 01:48PM ET",UPDATE 1-Traxys says will stop buying eastern Congo tin,nan," * Metals merchant under pressure from United Nations * Minerals trade funding rebel groups in Congo  (Adds quotes, detail, background) By Joe Bavier KINSHASA, May 4 (Reuters) - Belgium-based minerals merchant
Traxys will stop purchasing tin ore from violence-ravaged
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in response to pressure
from the United Nations, a company official said on Monday. The minerals trade has long been a key source of revenue for
illegal armed groups in the east, including the Rwandan Hutu
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), composed
in part of fighters responsible for Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Traxys' decision to pull out of eastern Congo comes amid
growing pressure from the United Nations and rights groups to
clean up that trade. ""As of June 1, we will stop sourcing any minerals from
eastern Congo, that is to say, from (the provinces of) North
Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema,"" said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. A report published late last year by a U.N. panel of experts
charged with investigating violations of a Security
Council-imposed arms embargo found that Traxys was part of a
mineral supply chain that led back to the Rwandan rebels. The U.N. report said Traxys purchased in 2007 1,631 tonnes
of the tin ore cassiterite and 226 tonnes of coltan, both used
to manufacture electronics devices, such as mobile phones and 
video games consoles, from four Congolese companies which
systematically buy from FDLR-controlled mines. Traxys, which lists among its shareholders several private
equity firms and steelmaker ArcelorMittal, rejected the U.N.
claims and said on Monday that it had set up its own framework
to verify that the minerals it purchased did not support illegal
armed groups. ""According to the U.N., that's not enough...We prefer to
stop until we can come up with a protocol that will satisfy
them,"" the company representative said.  MOUNTING PRESSURE The coordinator of the U.N. experts, Dinesh Mahtani, said on
Monday that Traxys had not been told to withdraw from Congo, but
that the group had asked Traxys for further information on its
due diligence scheme. ""There is no current U.N. ban on export of natural resources
from the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" he said in a statement. ""The Group will continue its research on due diligence and
on whether companies are knowingly buying minerals controlled by
non-state armed groups."" A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted last year calls
upon countries to ""ensure that importers, processing industries,
and consumers of Congolese mineral products"" exercise due
diligence on the minerals they purchase. A campaign being led by U.S.-based human rights group Enough
Project is calling for more transparency in the sector and
stricter laws to force companies to prove the origins of the ore
they buy. However, some observers fear that increasing restrictions on
Congolese minerals will simply push companies to look elsewhere
for their raw materials and endanger the livelihoods of
thousands of local miners. ""Traxys is among the biggest buyers. This will have serious
economic consequences here,"" Namegabe Mudekereza, the head of
South Kivu's business association and the patron of one of the
U.N.-cited mineral suppliers, told Reuters on Monday. North and South Kivu remain a volatile patchwork of rebel
and militia strongholds despite the official end of a 1998-2003
conflict. The war and subsequent humanitarian disaster have
killed an estimated 5.4 million people over the past decade. (Editing by Daniel Magnowski and Peter Blackburn)

 (Updates after conference call) By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world's
largest steelmaker, slumped more than expected in the first
three months and unveiled a share issue plan, depressing its
stock despite a forecast of a second-quarter pick-up. The company's shares yo-yoed in early trading but by 1420
GMT were down 5.9 percent at 17.57 euros, extending a 6 percent
drop on Tuesday, against a 1.9 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx
European basic resources index. The much-watched EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation) dropped 82 percent to $883
million in the January-March period, compared with the average
$1.0 billion in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts. However, this also included a $503 million gain from
unwinding a hedge for raw materials purchases. ArcelorMittal had forecast a figure of about $1 billion,
with a 15 percent variation, due to final quarter price cuts of
up to 40 percent and nearly halved output as key auto and
construction markets fell into crisis. It forecast production would remain at around 50 percent of
capacity in the second quarter. (for a steel supply analysis
click The company later unveiled plans to offer about $2.5 billion
of shares and $500 million of 2014 convertible notes to
accelerate debt reduction. Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal
said the offering should be completed soon. Net debt crept up to $26.7 billion in the quarter from $26.5
billion at the end of 2008. It has a $22.5 billion debt target
by year end and had calmed market nerves after the fourth
quarter with a $6 billion cut. Its debt mountain has raised speculation that ArcelorMittal
might need to close sites permanently or sell core assets.
Chairman and Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal said he had no
intention of doing either. The World Steel Association forecast on Monday that steel
demand would tumble 15 percent in 2009, its steepest fall since
World War Two, and one exacerbated by consumer destocking. U.S.
auto sales slid 37 percent in March and home sales a
month-on-month 0.6 percent. The CEO said he was a little less pessimistic and believed
global destocking would be completed in the second quarter. ArcelorMittal's slump mirrors that of rivals. On Tuesday,
China's top steelmaker Baosteel reported a 98 percent drop in
first-quarter net profit and world No.2 Nippon Steel forecast
zero profit this financial year. Economists believe the first quarter may have been as bad,
or even worse, than the wretched fourth quarter of 2008.  Q2 PICK-UP SEEN ArcelorMittal forecast core profit in the second quarter
would recover to some $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. It had
previously seen the first quarter as the low point in terms of
profitability. It made a net loss in the first quarter of $1.1 billion due
in part to $1.2 billion of pretax exceptional charges, mainly
for writing down inventories. In the fourth quarter, this figure
had been $4.4 billion. It also said it saw potential for price increases during the
second and third quarters across major markets and products,
although in a presentation it said that it expected a lower
average steel price. ""Although market conditions remain challenging, a technical
recovery is inevitable and ArcelorMittal will benefit from
this,"" Lakshmi Mittal said. The market had been braced for a weak first quarter, but
some analysts commented that the ""clean"" EBITDA figure was much
worse than expected. The second-quarter guidance of an
improvement was generally deemed positive. ""It's a fair jump upwards ... Another positive is the
decline in the size of writedowns for inventory,"" said Dirk
Nettling, analyst at Commerzbank. The share issue, while dilutive, would ease concerns that
ArcelorMittal would breach its debt covenants, analysts said. The company, formed from Mittal Steel's takeover of then
world No.2 Arcelor, went on a spending spree during the
commodities boom, ratcheting up debt.

1505,"Mar 17, 2009 11:08AM ET",ANALYSIS-Kazakh mining output fall stokes fears of unrest,nan," By Maria Golovnina ALMATY, March 17 (Reuters) - A sharp fall in Kazakhstan's
industrial output has put Central Asia's biggest economy on
course for its worst slowdown in a decade, raising the prospect
of social unrest in its crucial mining sector. Data for the first two months of the year showed the worst
year-on-year contraction in output was in the metals sector, the
lifeblood of Kazakhstan's export-oriented economy, which has
suffered as a result of the deepening global financial crisis. In Kazakhstan a fall in metals output is particularly
worrying as it affects hundreds of thousands of miners in many
remote industrial towns that often rely on a single Soviet-era
factory for survival.  ""People are getting angry,"" Eduard Poletayev, an independent
political analyst, said. ""A fall in metals output means that
entire cities out there could face social collapse."" Miners around the world are cutting production and jobs as
the economic slowdown erodes demand for metals. Copper and
aluminium have more than halved in value in the last 12 months. Kazakhstan, an ex-Soviet republic wedged between Russia and
China, is a significant metals producer and home to industry
majors Kazakhmys, the world's No.10 copper producer, and ENRC,
one of the world's top ferrochrome producers. Metals account for 20 percent of jobs in Kazakhstan's
industrial sector, and more than a quarter of total exports. Expectations that the economy could worsen pose a test for
President Nursultan Nazarbayev's two-decade rule after seven
years of double-digit economic growth and rising incomes.
Mining, along with oil and gas, was a significant contributor to
people's new-found wealth. ""The increasing pressure on metals and mining companies has
serious social consequences, as these firms are also the largest
employers after the public sector,"" Kaan Nazli, an analyst with
Medley Global Advisors, said. ""The Kazakh population is quiet when it comes to political
issues but very vocal when economic issues take them to the
streets.""  DISCONTENT Discontent is already rising in regions such as Karaganda,
home to the coal mines of ArcelorMittal and Kazakhmys, as well
as other mining towns like Pavlodar and copper centre
Zhezkazgan, locals say. ""I've been to many mining towns around here. People have
enough money and there is enough food to keep them going for
maybe another few months,"" Pavel Shumkin, head of a mining trade
union in Karaganda, said by telephone from Karaganda. ""But if the crisis continues, protests are not just possible
but inevitable. The government will certainly try to prevent it
but its efforts are awkward. It does not know what's going on."" ArcelorMittal's local unit did not respond to a written
request for comment. In the 1990s, as in other mining regions of the former
Soviet Union, wage disputes and falling living standards set off
riots in Kazakh regions like coal-mining centre Karaganda. Those
were eventually settled through talks with the government. As part of its efforts to deal with the problem this time,
the government promised this year to offer tax cuts to mining
companies in exchange for pledges not to sack workers.  But the Labour Ministry says up to 350,000 Kazakhs may lose
their jobs this year, a large proportion in the mining sector. A
breakdown of jobs figures was not available. ""At the moment our priority is to provide people with jobs,""
Labour Minister Gulshara Abdykalikova told Reuters, adding the
government would spend up to $1 billion to create jobs. Oil revenues, which accounts for 60 percent of Kazakhstan's
exports, are still growing, providing a cushion for the economy.
But the overall outlook remains bleak. Official data released at the end of last week showed
overall industrial output fell 3.2 percent in January and
February, compared with the previous year. Crude steel output fell 19 percent year-on-year and iron ore
24 percent in the first two months of 2009, official data shows.
Copper production, dominated by Kazakhmys, fell 3.1 percent and
ferro-alloy output fell as much as 42 percent in the period. Some units of mining and metals group ENRC have more than
halved output due to falling demand, ENRC shareholder Alexander
Mashkevich said last month. The government has said it may
partially nationalise lead producer Yuzhpolimetall, which halted
output last year and sent workers on unpaid leave. Although an 18 percent devaluation of the Kazakh tenge
currency last month has helped exporters, producers continue to
bear the brunt of falling global demand. Some analysts, however, said mass layoffs and signs of
discontent could be avoided as long as the government continued
to coordinate efforts with producers. ""Politically, this is quite a sensitive subject,"" Rob
Edwards, managing director of metals and mining research at
Renaissance Capital, said. ""You are not going to see thousands
of job cuts you may be seeing at some of the Russian steel
plants."" The rich are suffering too. Kazakhmys Chairman Vladimir Kim, long ranked Kazakhstan's
richest man by Forbes magazine, disappeared from the list this
year as some of his fortune evaporated. Four other Kazakh
billionaires were also dropped from the list.

CPI Feb. 12, rates Feb. 4, GDP March 4. * Inflation seen steady, small majority sees 25-50 bps cut. * Q4 GDP seen slowing to 5.2 percent.  By Marius Zaharia BUCHAREST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank is
expected to cut interest rates for the first time in 19 months
on Wednesday to protect the strained economy, with analysts
nearly halving their 2009 growth forecasts over the last month. Storm clouds have begun gathering over Romania in recent
weeks, even though it largely escaped economic pain last year,
as major companies such as ArcelorMittal and Renault's carmaker
Dacia announce repeated work stoppages. Most analysts revised their economic growth forecasts after
November's industrial output data, which dropped by an
unexpected 11.5 percent on the year, signalled the effects of
shrinking euro zone demand could be more harmful in Romania. Ten out of 17 surveyed analysts expect the central bank to
cut interest rates, now at the highest level in the European
Union, to ease the cost of borrowing as external sources of cash
dry up for local businesses and consumers. Many said inflationary risks stemming from a weak currency
were now overshadowed by declining growth. ""Although substantial leu depreciation fuels inflation and
inflationary expectations, we believe the central bank is not
likely to ignore the deterioration in economic activity,"" said
ING's Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, who forecast a 25 basis
points cut to 10 percent this month. Other countries in eastern Europe already began cutting
interest rates last year as growth figures started declining
sharply. Like many of them, Romania faces the burden of a frail
currency that lost 20 percent against the euro in the last three
months, but it also has the additional burden of bloated current
account and fiscal deficits. Prices are seen growing 6.3 percent on the year in January,
at the same pace as in the previous month, as the weak leu offsets the benefits of cheaper fuel. But analysts expect inflation worries to fade, helped by
falling demand stemming from rapidly slowing lending growth,
while concerns over economic growth will begin to prevail. The economic expansion is expected to slow to just over 5
percent in the fourth quarter, from 9.1 percent in the third,
bringing last year's growth to 7.8 percent. But this year's outlook appears more gloomy, as growth is
forecast at a modest 1.7 percent, compared to 3 percent in a 
similar Reuters survey last month. Moreover, 2009 forecasts vary from -3.5 percent to 4.1
percent, underlying deepening uncertainty over Romania's ability
to fight the cash shortage. ""The prospects for the real economy remain gloomy as some of
the most important industrial plants ... have already closed
temporarily, resulting in a further industrial production drop
and export volume fall,"" said Rozalia Pal, head of macroeconomic
research at UniCredit Tiriac Bank. Pal sees economic growth at 0.6 percent in 2009. She is one
of 10 analysts who see interest rates flat at 10.25 percent this
month.

1507,"Dec 22, 2008 09:45AM ET",UPDATE 1-Belgium's Dec leading indicator hits all-time low,nan," (Adds details, background, analyst comment) BRUSSELS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Belgian business confidence
index, a bellwether for the euro zone, fell in December to a
record low as manufacturing sentiment dropped sharply, putting
more pressure on the European Central Bank to cut rates further. The index, often referred to as the leading indicator,
dropped to -31.3, its lowest level since records began in 1980,
from -23.7 in November, the central bank said on Monday. The figure was worse than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Reuters poll of 12 economists which produced a median forecast
of -26.5, with a range from -30.0 to -20.0. ""The confidence of business chiefs again fell noticeably in
manufacturing industry. The decline was less pronounced in
construction and commerce,"" the bank said in a statement. Steven Vanneste, an economist at Fortis, said that the
serious impact of the financial crisis was clear. ""The financial crisis is impacting the real economy through
sentiment. This fear has to be resolved."" Last week, the closely watched German Ifo business climate
index also fell for the seventh month in a row and by more than
expected in December to its lowest level since 1982. Belgium, whose economy expanded by 0.1 percent in the third
quarter, is widely believed to have entered recession in the
final three months of the year. Its very open economy feels the pain of its neighbours and a
number of companies, including Ford, steel giant ArcelorMittal
 and steel cord maker Bekaert, have made headlines with job cuts
in Belgium. The European Central Bank cut interest rates by 175 basis
points in three monthly moves since October to 2.5 percent but
has signalled it could pause in January to see the effects of
the cuts before easing policy any further.""At the moment the ECB needs to put out the fire, which they
can only do by lowering interest rates as much as possible to
get the engine running again,"" Frank Lierman, economist at Dexia
said.

its economic downturn could threaten stability as pressure grew
on the European Central Bank to make a big cut in interest
rates to help contain the global financial crisis. In India, emerging Asia's other economic titan, financial
markets were closed after Islamist militants killed more than
100 people in the commercial capital, Mumbai. Violence in India and political unrest in Thailand
highlighted political risk as another potential threat to
emerging markets battered by the global crisis. A crisis that began last year with the collapse of the U.S.
housing market has spread around the world, bringing several
financial institutions to their knees and pushing the United
States, Japan and Europe into recession or to the brink of it. Unemployment is rising in many countries. ArcelorMittal,
the world's largest steelmaker, said it would cut up to 9,000
more jobs, saving $1 billion a year. In France, the number of job seekers rose past the 2
million mark, as the economic crisis took its toll on
employment. CASE FOR MORE RATE CUTS Central banks around the globe have slashed interest rates
to try to ease the flow of credit and restart stalled
economies. Economic sentiment in Europe's single currency zone hit
15-year lows in November and inflation expectations plunged,
boosting the case for a big rate cut from the European Central
Bank next week. ""The euro zone is in a deep recession, upping the pressure
on the ECB to cut interest rates further,"" said Christoph Weil,
economist at Commerzbank. ""We envisage a first move next week
on a scale of 75 basis points to 2.5 percent."" European governments disagreed on funding for measure to
stimulate growth in the European Union, with German rejecting
French calls for Berlin to provide billions more euros, and the
Irish government saying it has no room for any further fiscal
stimulus as it works to slice its deficit. The Bank of England is also expected to cut rates by 50
basis points or more on Dec. 4, a Reuters poll showed. Benchmark rates are 3.25 percent in the eurozone and 3.0
percent in Britain, against 1.0 percent in the United States. China's central bank cut interest rates by the biggest
margin in 11 years on Wednesday in response to a crisis that is
reining in its once runaway growth, bringing worries about
social unrest as jobs disappear. China's State Information Center forecast annual growth
would slow to 8 percent this quarter from 9 percent in the
third quarter, a cooling from double-digit rates recorded in
the past five years. The country's top economic planner said the financial
crisis was still spreading and its impact was deepening in
China. ""Excessive bankruptcies and production cuts will lead to
massive unemployment and stir social unrest,"" Zhang Ping,
chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission,
told a news conference. REDUCING JOBS, WORKING HOURS ArcelorMittal said it would launch a voluntary redundancy
scheme for largely white-collar staff to make its job cuts,
which could affect about 3 percent of its workforce. Germany's Daimler AG plans to talk to labor groups about
reducing working hours at four German Mercedes-Benz auto
assembly plants from January until the end of April. Should this step be implemented, at least 47,000 employees
could have shortened work weeks, for which the German
government would compensate wage shortfalls. General Motors Corp aims to cut staff costs at its European
operations by at least 10 percent, in part by reducing the
number of hours employees work. The number of German unemployed fell in November to its
lowest level since 1992, but officials said a labor market boom
was fading as recession hits Europe's biggest economy. In Britain, retailer Woolworths put its variety stores
business into administration, jeopardizing thousands of jobs. European equities rose 2.6 percent, buoyed by sharp gains
in Asia and the United States, but the grim economic reports
pushed government bond yields in Europe to a three-year low. However hedge funds remained under great strain. BlueBay
Asset Management closed its long-short emerging market fund
after losing about $600 million. Demonstrating growing concern about the scale of U.S.
government programs to boost the economy and guarantee
financial assets, the risk premium on U.S. Treasury credit
default swaps, essentially the price investors pay to insure
against the U.S. government defaulting on its debt, hit record
highs. U.S. markets were closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday,
but some retailers were breaking with tradition and opening to
try to boost sales. ""Black Friday"" -- the day after Thanksgiving -- normally
marks the start of the U.S. shopping season in the run-up to
Christmas. Its name comes from marking the point when retailers
could move into profit for the year. The sluggish global economy took a toll on large projects,
as Royal Dutch Shell Plc delayed another Canadian oil sands
project, Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau postponed a $524 million
investment in a new plant in Argentina, and mining company BHP
Billiton delayed plans to build a $120 million plant in Chile.

 (For more stories on the global crisis, click By Mike Peacock LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The United States and Europe
prepared fresh measures on Tuesday to tackle a sharp economic
downturn, which top miner BHP Billiton cited in abandoning a $66
billion bid for Rio Tinto. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the third
quarter, revised data showed, and authorities announced an $800
billion life-support scheme for the U.S. financial system. A further deterioration is expected this quarter, putting
the world's largest economy into recession stretching into 2009. Wary of the effects of the worst financial crisis in 80
years, BHP Billiton called off its hostile bid for rival Rio,
catching markets off their guard. ""We have concerns about the continued deterioration of
near-term global economic conditions, the lack of any certainty
as to the time it will take for conditions to improve and the
risks that these issues imply for shareholder value,"" BHP
Chairman Don Argus said in a statement. U.S. consumers cut spending at the steepest rate in 28
years, according to a Commerce Department report underlining how
rapidly activity was slowing. China, the world's biggest consumer of many metals, this
month unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) spending package
to prop up its economy, but growth would still likely slow to
around 7.5 percent in 2009, the World Bank said. That would be China's slowest growth rate since 1990. Official data confirmed Germany is in recession for the
first time in five years. And falling consumer and business morale in Italy and France
pointed to a continent heading for a prolonged recession, with a
surprise tick up in consumer sentiment in Germany seen as an
isolated and temporary blip.  U.S. PUTS UP $800 BLN After Britain announced on Monday a 20 billion pounds fiscal
boost, including a 2.5 points cut in value-added tax, the United
States and European Union put their shoulders to the wheel. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion programme
to buy mortgage-related debt and securities and a $200 billion
facility to back consumer loans, including student, auto, and
credit card loans. ""This action is being taken to reduce the cost and increase
the availability of credit for the purchase of houses, which in
turn should support housing markets and foster improved
financial conditions more generally,"" a Fed statement said. What started more than a year ago as a meltdown in the U.S.
market for high-risk mortgages has engulfed the world, freezing
access to credit, sparking bank collapses and requiring the
financial bailout of entire countries. U.S. stock futures shot higher in response to the plan.
European shares reversed earlier losses. The European Commission will propose on Wednesday measures
to stimulate the recession-hit European economy including VAT
cuts and a call for lower European Central Bank rates. The draft proposal, obtained by Reuters, did not specify the
size of the stimulus plan, which Germany said last week could be
worth some 1 percent of European Union gross domestic product. The French government will launch its own ""quite massive""
stimulus in the next 10 days, President Nicolas Sarkozy said. ""In less than 10 days we will announce a revival plan to
save the car industry ... and strengthen the building sector,""
Sarkozy said during round table discussions in northern France. A more reticent Chancellor Angela Merkel said the German
government would decide in January whether additional measures
to support growth were needed.  RECESSION A REALITY Paris-based think-tank the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development projected the U.S. economy would
shrink 0.9 percent next year. It revised its forecast for the euro zone, saying it would
contract 0.6 percent, more than the 0.5 it had predicted. ""The recession which we are heading into now may turn out to
be even deeper and even the world economy at large may go into
recession,"" OECD chief economist Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel said. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Britain's fiscal
package would mitigate its recession but not solve it. ""The most pressing is to ensure that normal bank lending is
resumed,"" he told a parliamentary committee. ""Without that, the
downturn in activity could become protracted and extremely
damaging."" Following huge losses tied to the U.S. housing market
collapse, banks continue to hoard cash rather than lend it to
each other, to businesses and individuals. Corporate gloom was widespread, eclipsing relief at the
rescue of number two U.S. bank Citigroup. AXA, Europe's second-biggest insurer based on premium
income, cut its 2008 profit forecast and said its 2012 financial
goals were increasingly ""obsolete"". The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal is poised to
cut 16 percent of its U.S. workforce, beginning in January, the
Wall Street Journal said. Australia's Qantas airline cut its 2009 profit forecast and
Honda, the world's top motorcycle maker, said sales could stop
growing in 2009.

1510,"Nov 10, 2008 04:42AM ET",UPDATE 1-French industry output falls as car sector suffers,nan," (Adds background, detail, analyst comment) By James Mackenzie PARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - French industrial production fell
in September, weighed down by a sharp drop in car manufacturing,
according to data on Monday which reinforced expectations that
France is heading into recession. Industrial output shrank 0.5 percent month-on-month in
September following an unrevised 0.4 percent fall in August, 
national statistics office INSEE said. The drop was slightly less than a 0.6 percent fall forecast
by economists polled by Reuters. However, it added to
expectations that gross domestic product figures on Friday will
show the euro zone's second largest economy contracted in the
third quarter as well as in the second, meaning the nation is in
recession. ""All of this data is consistent with an economy in recession
in the way we imagine it,"" said Alexander Law, chief economist
at Paris-based consultancy Xerfi. ""Total output of the economy, that is GDP growth, is going
to be negative in the third quarter and it looks very much like
we're heading that way also for the fourth quarter,"" he said. Economy Minister Christine Lagarde last week cut official
forecasts for growth next year to between 0.2-0.5 percent. Manufacturing industry, which excludes energy and
agricultural production, posted a 0.8 percent fall in output in
September, Monday's data showed. The sharpest drop was in the
automobile sector, which reported a 3.1 percent decline in
production. Like their counterparts worldwide, French carmakers have
been hit by sharp falling demand, with little sign of
improvement. The country's two main automobile groups, Renault and
Peugeot, have both been forced to shut plants temporarily and
stand workers down, pointing to even sharper production declines
in the next few months. Monday's industrial output data followed dire figures last
week when France posted its biggest trade deficit on record in
September as the economies of its major trading partners began
to suffer in the global slowdown. Output of semi-finished goods also fell 1.5 percent in
September, notably in metals, chemical and plastics products.
Energy output was down 0.7 percent. Last month's decision by ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest
steelmaker, to close half its furnaces in France temporarily
because of weaker demand, suggests that the trend will continue. By contrast, consumer goods output was up 0.4 percent,
capital equipment 0.7 percent, and food and agriculture 2.0
percent. Despite some volatility, the figures showed an overall 
slide in output over recent months, with production over the
past three months down 0.7 percent from the preceding quarter
and down 2.1 percent from the same three months a year earlier.

 (Adds close of U.S. markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dived and risk
aversion rose on Wednesday as the financial crisis sparked a
fresh round of bleak news and gave U.S. president-elect Barack
Obama a grim welcome a day after his historic election. With Obama's victory less than 24 hours old, U.S. and
European equity markets tumbled and American and euro zone
government debt rose in a flight to safety after data from the
services sector pointed to a prolonged worldwide slowdown. The three major U.S. equity indices all fell more than 5
percent, with the Dow pulled down the most by industrial icons
Exxon Mobil, Boeing and United Technologies. Company reports underscored the daunting task Obama faces
when he takes office in January and tries to lead the United
States and the world out of the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. ""Even though there's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of
excitement around the new president, I think it's going to be
very difficult for anything quick to happen,"" said Dean Barber,
president of investment firm Barber Financial Group in Kansas
City. ""Today we just had reality set in that,"" Barber said.
""We're still losing jobs and we still have consumer spending at
very low levels and we are heading into a holiday season that
looks like it could be one of the worst."" The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 486.01
points, or 5.05 percent, at 9,139.27. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index  was down 52.98 points, or 5.27 percent, at 952.77.
The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 98.48 points, or
5.53 percent, at 1,681.64. Finance company GMAC LLC reported a $2.52 billion loss in
the third quarter, hurt by slumping housing and auto markets,
and said its Residential Capital LLC mortgage unit may fail. United Technologies Corp  said it stood by its 2008
profit forecast, though a strengthening dollar could put
results near the low end of the range. United Technologies fell 6.2 percent. In Europe a slew of bank results did little to lift a gloom
that has darkened on a recurring trend of falling profits and
rising provisions stemming from the deepening global crisis. Euro zone service sector activity touched a fresh decade
low in October, a final index reading showed, while a U.S.
non-manufacturing report displayed weakness all around, with
employment at its lowest on record and new orders tumbling. ""The surveys continue to show record pessimism,"" Guillaume
Menuet, an economist at Merrill Lynch in London, said about the
European services data. ""Sentiment has continued to deteriorate
and it's obviously bad news for the economy in the fourth
quarter."" European shares fell after six straight rising sessions as
commodity shares tracked sharp losses in oil and metal prices. ArcelorMittal , the world's No. 1
steelmaker, forecast a weaker final quarter, slashed output and
froze growth plans in the face of a global slowdown. Its shares fell almost 16 percent. Commodity stocks were one of the biggest sectoral losers on
the index as crude oil prices fell about 6 percent, and copper,
zinc and nickel prices slipped by between 3.7 and 6 percent. ""Nothing immediately is going to change as a result of the
election victory. We still haven't broken the downtrends,"" said
Darren Winder, head of economics and strategy at Cazenove. Oil dropped 7 percent to below $66 a barrel after a U.S.
government report showed fuel stockpiles growing as demand in
the world's top consumer continued to slow.  U.S. crude  settled down $5.23 to $65.30 a barrel
while Brent crude  lost $4.57 to settle at $61.87 a
barrel. Gold dropped 2 percent on tumbling oil and as Obama's
decisive win bolstered the dollar, dampening sentiment for
commodities across the board. The December futures contract for gold  settled down
$14.90 at $742.40 an ounce in New York. Treasuries rose late in the day after stocks slumped. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  gained
9/32 in price to yield 3.69 percent, and the 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  rose 1/32 in price to yield 1.36

the yen, the dollar  fell 1.12 percent at 98.49. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
 rose 2.3 percent for a seventh consecutive

 (Recasts with U.S. markets, adds byline; changes dateline;
previous LONDON) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A new batch of weak U.S. data
drove fears of slower global growth, driving stocks around the
world and oil sharply lower on Thursday, even as the U.S.
Congress worked toward passing a revised bill to rescue the
ailing financial sector. U.S. and euro zone government debt rose in a renewed
safe-haven rally as reports on jobless claims and factory
activity led economists to say the United States was in
recession. The dollar rose to its highest level in over a year against
the euro after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet said inflation risks in the euro zone have eased,
opening the door to the ECB's first rate cut in five years. Investor confidence ebbed and commodity prices tumbled amid
the bleak economic picture painted by the latest U.S. data,
despite the U.S. Senate's approval late on Wednesday of a
revised $700 billion plan to bail out banks holding bad debt. The deteriorating economic outlook led investors to dump
gold and other precious metals as the dollar firmed. Oil fell
more than $4 to settle just under $94 a barrel. The Senate's approval of the rescue plan initially
reassured European stock markets, but U.S. stocks fell sharply
on the economy and on jitters over passage of the bailout, with
the broad S&P index closing down 3 percent. The grim U.S. news dragged down stock markets throughout
Latin America, as well as Europe, led by a more than 7 percent
drop in Brazil's blue-chip Bovespa index. The U.S. government reported the number of people filing
for new jobless benefit claims rose to a seven-year high in the
latest week and factory orders showed a steeper-than-expected
drop in August. The data shows how much damage the credit crisis has cast
on the U.S. and global economies, said Alan Lancz, president of
Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio. ""It's almost a perfect storm and it's starting to hit
home,"" Lancz said. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 348.62
points, or 3.22 percent, at 10,482.45. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index  shed 46.81 points, or 4.03 percent, at
1,114.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index  lost 92.68 points,
or 4.48 percent, at 1,976.72. Economic bellwethers were hard hit on Wall Street. General Electric  slid 9.6 percent to $22.15 after
the company, seeking to raise cash, said it priced a share
offering below the stock's closing price on Wednesday. Insurance stocks, led by Hartford Financial ,
Principal Financial  and MetLife , fell after
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid raised the question of
whether an unnamed, well-known insurer could be in financial
trouble. Hartford shares fell 32 percent, Metlife slid 14.9
percent, and Principal Financial shed 16.3 percent. European stocks fell on the U.S. economic data, knocking
down mining and industrial stocks. ArcelorMittal  sank 9.3 percent, Rio Tinto 
dropped 7.9 percent and Siemens  lost 4.6 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 1.3 percent lower at 1,058.81 points, after being ahead
earlier in the session. The index is down 30 percent in 2008. ""The U.S. is tipping into recession,"" said Marc Touati,
economist at Global Equities in Paris, who held out a bit of
hope that all was not lost. ""But we're getting to the end of
the tunnel on the credit front, and if the rescue plan goes
through, it will certainly help the economy."" Money market stress eased in Europe but lending rates for
overnight loans among banks remained above central bank
targets, reflecting a strong aversion to counterparty risk and
how economic strains are making lending costlier. The U.S. commercial paper market contracted dramatically
for a third straight week as business lending and borrowing
effectively shut down, Federal Reserve data showed Thursday. The overnight rate for the London interbank offered rate in
dollars  fell more than a full point to 2.68125
percent, while euro overnight rates also eased. But longer maturity rates jumped, with benchmark
three-month rates -- which now cover the year-end period --
fixed higher in dollars and euros. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose
26/32 to yield 3.64 percent, while the 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  gained 11/32 to yield 1.64 percent. Gold fell more than 4 percent as investors sold bullion to
cover losses on other markets. Silver plunged more than 12
percent in sympathy, while platinum shed over 5 percent to its
weakest level since January 2006 after U.S. carmakers reported
a fresh drop in auto sales in September on Wednesday. December gold futures  settled down $43 at $844.30 an
ounce in New York. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index  up 1.04 percent, but against the
yen, the dollar  slipped 0.58 percent at 105.17. The euro  fell 1.60 percent at $1.3795. Oil fell as turmiol in financial markets stoked concerns
about fuel demand and sent investors seeking safer havens. U.S. crude  settled down $4.56 at $93.97, while
London Brent  fell $4.77 to settle at $90.56 a barrel. Asian stocks fell. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks
outside Japan  fell 1.2 percent, while Tokyo's
Nikkei average  dropped 1.9 percent to end at its lowest
close in three years.
