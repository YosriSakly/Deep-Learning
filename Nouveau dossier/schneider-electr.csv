The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.01 percent by 0940 GMT, retreating from an eight-month high and set to snap a six-day winning streak ahead of the Easter holiday. Losses in bank-heavy Milan and Madrid indexes led declines, while Germany's DAX edged higher.The yield on the German 10-year bund fell further after flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data unexpectedly fell to 51.3, a downturn led again by the bloc's manufacturing industry.The data came on the heels of the German government lowering its forecast for 2019 economic growth on Wednesday, which was overshadowed by better-than-expected economic data out of China. ""We ... have confirmation that we are in a bit of a weak spot in Europe, if you look at the services sector and the composite PMI, and this is the reason why you're seeing stock markets in Europe soften,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at CityIndex.""But I think the PMI data is the wrong data at the right time. We are coming to the end of a very short week,"" Odeluga added.Also due are retail sales data and flash PMIs from the United States.Bank stocks fell 0.7 percent, their steepest loss in three weeks.Shares in Osram were among the biggest percentage losers on the STOXX 600 after a German magazine reported that private equity groups Bain and Carlyle were losing confidence in their bid for the lighting group.SIGNS OF SLOWDOWN Kering  (PA:PRTP) dropped 3.6 percent and weighed heavily on France's CAC 40 after signs of a slowdown at the French fashion company's Gucci brand, particularly in the United States.Top gainer in Germany's DAX was  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn), after the Federal Network Agency cleared the way for the postal company to significantly increase the cost of sending letters after the company pledged to hire an extra 5,000 delivery workers.Not all earnings were disappointing. The food and beverage sector raked in a 1 percent rise, the most among European sectors, lifted by upbeat earnings from Nestle.The food group's shares advanced after it maintained its full-year forecast after good momentum in the United States and China.London and Amsterdam-listed shares of Unilever topped the STOXX 600 after the consumer goods group reported stronger than expected quarterly underlying sales growth, helped by increased prices and volume.Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) rose after the French company beat first-quarter revenue estimates.Lab equipment maker Sartorius Stedim Biotech rose 3 percent after it maintained full-year guidance as first-quarter revenue rose. French vouchers and card provider  Edenred  (PA:EDEN) gained 2.3 percent after keeping its outlook for 2019 unchanged. Rival Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was up 0.5 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

9,"Dec 04, 2018 07:28AM ET",Special Report: Wall Street cleans up on 'clean' coal subsidies,nan,"By Tim McLaughlin(Reuters) - Earlier this year, the chief financial officer of global insurance giant Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (N:AJG) explained to analysts how the company had turned a little-known U.S. energy subsidy into a profit machine, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line.The money came from the U.S. “clean coal” tax credit, a provision of the American Jobs Act of 2004 meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation’s power plants.To capitalize on the subsidy, A.J. Gallagher arranged investor partnerships to produce vast quantities of refined coal, as the fuel is known in the industry, for utilities across the nation, splitting the benefit of the lucrative government incentive – now worth more than $7 per ton.“Our return on investment is staggering,” CFO Douglas Howell told analysts in the March 14 call. “Oh, 200 percent, 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. I mean, just because it costs so little to develop” clean coal facilities.A.J. Gallagher’s experience reflects a truth about the U.S. refined coal tax credit, a subsidy that now costs taxpayers about $1 billion a year: While coal mining firms, utility companies and power consumers can benefit indirectly from the subsidy, the big winners are a diverse group of investors – ranging from Wall Street’s most powerful banks to insurers, meat packers and drug makers – who identified the incentive as an easy way to make money.Over the past decade, these companies have financed the construction of facilities to produce refined coal, which are situated next to coal-fired power plants and typically cost about $4 million to $6 million each to develop. They then sell the resulting coal to utilities below cost, but make eye-popping returns from the subsidy rather than the underlying business, according to regulatory documents and interviews.A.J. Gallagher’s Howell took credit for designing a business model to maximize profits from the subsidy in his March call with analysts.“It is our machine,” he said. “We developed it. We pioneered it.”The company has accumulated about $850 million worth of tax credits, mostly from its side business in taxpayer-supported refined coal, Howell said on an Oct. 25th conference call with investors and analysts.“And at current production levels” of refined coal, he said, “that may total another $700 million through 2021.”Howell declined to comment for this story. A.J. Gallagher spokeswoman Linda Collins minimized the importance of clean coal to the company.“Refined coal is not a part of our core brokerage and risk management business,” Collins said in an email.Refined coal activities, however, accounted for 25 percent of the company’s $5.28 billion in total revenue during the first nine months of this year, according to AJ Gallagher financial statements. They also made up about a fifth of the company’s $516 million in net earnings attributable to controlling interests during that period.While the subsidy has proven a boon for investors, it has often failed to achieve the intended reductions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, the primary contributor to smog and acid rain. Utilities that burn refined coal have trailed competitors burning raw coal in lowering NOx emissions, and 22 of 56 plants burning refined coal have seen NOx emission rates rise instead of fall, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data vetted by industry experts.The refined coal tax subsidy is scheduled to expire in 2021. But lawmakers, including Republican Senator John Hoeven of coal-producing North Dakota, have introduced legislation to extend it another 10 years. They argue it helps the environment, extends the life of the ailing coal industry – a centerpiece of the Trump administration’s energy policy – and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap, subsidized source of coal.“This is really an incentive to operate in a way that’s more environmentally friendly while keeping power costs low,” said Hoeven, whose state sits atop an 800-year supply of lignite coal.If the extension goes through, those best placed to gain from the subsidy are an eclectic list of refined coal investors, including Wall Street banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (N:JPM) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF); wealth management giant Fidelity Investments; drugmaker Mylan NV (N:MYL); U.S. affiliates of global commodities trader Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG); industrial supplier W.W. Grainger Inc (N:GWW); Kansas-based pork producer  Seaboard Corp  (N:SEB); and ethanol plant investor Rex American Resources Corp (N:REX), according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, state environmental regulators and the U.S. Tax Court.CapitalOne, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Mylan, Noble, Rex American, Seaboard and W.W. Grainger declined to comment on refined coal’s impact on NOx pollution.These and other refined coal investors stand to gain at least $10 billion in tax incentives over the next decade if the law is extended, based on the current annual consumption of refined coal and the existing level of the inflation-adjusted tax credit.BIRTH OF THE BUSINESSAs originally drawn in 2004, the refined coal tax credit required producers to increase raw coal’s market value by 50 percent to qualify for the subsidy. The market-value clause made cost-conscious utilities unwilling to buy the specialized product. Prospects for the clean coal business were dim.But in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, two U.S. senators changed the landscape by deleting the market-value clause – a subtle tweak tucked away in the massive $700 billion U.S. financial rescue package.A.J. Gallagher, along with utility firms  Ameren Corp  and DTE Energy, also had been lobbying on the issue of refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings, though it is unclear if they lobbied specifically on the market-value clause. Officials at Ameren and DTE declined to comment on the lobbying.The policy edit – by Democrat Max Baucus of coal mining state Montana and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa – made it possible for refined coal producers to receive the subsidy even if they sold their product to utilities below cost. That paved the way for investors to set up operations and to ultimately make billions of dollars building refined coal to its current share of about a fifth of the U.S. coal market.Baucus said he does not remember the change to the refined coal tax credit. “It was a tax-credit blizzard; a deluge of credits was being discussed,” Baucus said. “It’s very easy to change the code to give credit to companies to spur investment. The code gets crusted with barnacles of credits, and then they’re removed. It’s the natural ebb and flow of things.”Grassley declined to comment for this story.The subsidy is now worth more than $7 a ton, an amount that covers losses on the discounted pricing and the operations that produce refined coal, while often leaving a profit that can amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year per investor, according to disclosures by tax credit investors. Because some of the operating expenses of running a refined coal facility are deductible, the tax credit’s effective value can top $9 a ton.Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most powerful banks, is currently generating estimated annual gross tax credits of about $50 million from two Missouri power plants alone, according data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing refined coal consumption patterns at the plants. Goldman declined to comment.“It was virtually impossible to make money producing clean coal for utilities,” said Roger Jones, senior counsel at McDermott Will & Emery LLP in Chicago, who has represented refined coal tax investors. “But as soon as the credit was there, people thought about capital-raising to engage in this activity.”After the tax credit was revised, A.J. Gallagher led the race to build refined coal facilities, constructing them next to power plants that burned the most coal in the country so as to maximize credit volumes.It now has investments in 34 refined coal facilities in the United States, along with a 46.5 percent controlling stake in Chem-Mod LLC, a leading supplier of chemicals used to refine raw coal, according to A.J. Gallagher SEC filings.Gallagher’s main rival, Colorado-based Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc (O:ADES), holds interests in 19 refined coal facilities with tax credit investors, through a joint venture with Goldman Sachs and NexGen Resources Corp. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs account for most of those investors, SEC filings show.Goldman Sachs, in 2011, purchased a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, a refined coal operator called Tinuum Group LLC, formerly known as Clean Coal Solutions, for $60 million. Advanced Emissions owns a 42.5 percent stake in Tinuum, whose operations produced and sold about 60 million tons of refined coal during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, SEC disclosures show.DRUG, TRASH FIRMS GET INTO COALSome partnerships include players even farther afield from the energy business. In one of refined coal’s earliest and biggest financial commitments, trash collector Waste Management Inc (N:WM) teamed up with JPMorgan Chase to invest in the refined coal facility at Coal Creek Station in North Dakota.The bank and the trash company invested in a facility that treats coal by preheating it in a process that dries out several million tons of soggy lignite coal each year, increasing its energy output. Electric cooperative Great River Energy, the owner of the plant, agreed to lease its refined coal facility to JPMorgan and Waste Management for $530 million over 16 years, according to a January 2011 deal disclosed by the co-op.JPMorgan and Waste Management declined to comment for this story.Another big beneficiary is drug maker Mylan. Refined coal tax credits were the second biggest component in producing a tax benefit of $358.3 million in 2016, according to Mylan’s annual report. That tax benefit lifted its consolidated earnings for the year to $480 million, from $121.7 million.Power plant owners typically sell their coal at cost to refined coal operations controlled by tax credit investors. Once the coal is treated with chemicals or dried out at an on-site refined coal facility, the tax credit investors sell the coal back to the power plants at a discount that can be anywhere from 75 cents to $2 per ton – a way to ensure utilities get some benefit from the subsidy, according to agreements filed with state regulators. Central-Appalachian coal, which has high energy content for power generation, costs about $75 a ton.Coal plant owners also may structure deals with refined coal producers to collect coal-handling and licensing fees or to charge rent through leases of their land used for the facilities, the disclosures show.Last year, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, a unit of PPL Corp (N:PPL), struck a deal with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs to burn refined coal at the utility’s Ghent power station. The utility stands to receive $10 million a year in incentives and would bear no expense for running the refined coal operations, according to disclosures with Kentucky regulators.For Goldman and any other tax credit investors in the deal, the gross annual tax credit, before refined coal operating expenses and incentives for the utility, is $39 million, Reuters estimates. That estimate is based on Ghent’s average annual coal consumption of 5.5 million tons multiplied by the $7.03 per ton tax credit.Goldman declined to comment on the revenue or profit it derives from clean-coal tax credits.Utility companies themselves haven’t been in the vanguard of capitalizing on the refined coal subsidy. That’s because the original wording of the refined coal tax credit, passed in 2004, stipulated that the producer of refined coal had to sell it to an “unrelated person.” So, utilities couldn’t invest in clean coal and sell it to themselves.The IRS issued new guidance in 2009, however, that opened the door for affiliates of utilities like Detroit-based DTE Energy to control or take stakes in refined coal production facilities in recent years. DTE has received some $639 million in refined coal tax credits since 2012, SEC disclosures show. DTE declined to comment for this story.PAYING NO TAXESIn today’s thriving clean coal industry, A.J. Gallagher’s early moves to monetize the tax credit seem prescient. Months before the subsidy first entered the tax code in 2004, the company paid $300,000 for a 5 percent ownership stake in Chem-Mod, which at the time was developing chemical treatments designed to reduce coal pollution. A core group of five people at A.J. Gallagher was overseeing the move into the business, according to the company’s disclosures to investors.A.J. Gallagher was among several investors who paid Washington firms to lobby on refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings. In 2008, before Congress modified the refined coal tax credit to erase the market-value clause, the company paid two law firms – Winston & Strawn, and Steptoe & Johnson – to lobby on “refined coal” and “energy and tax” issues, respectively. The lobbying disclosure documents do not detail what specific objective the companies had in their lobbying activities.Officials from those law firms involved in the lobbying declined to comment.David Lowman, a partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, was lobbying on refined coal on behalf of a different company at the time. He said the refined coal industry successfully pushed to have the market value clause eliminated. In return, the industry agreed to double the pollution reduction requirement on mercury and sulfur dioxide to 40 percent from 20 percent.By the end of 2008, Gallagher had built up a 42 percent stake in Chem-Mod for a total investment of $13.3 million, according to company disclosures. Now it was ready to launch into developing facilities.The dive into a newly subsidized business was part of the company’s strategy to find profits in taxpayer-financed incentives. Dating to the 1980s, Arthur J. Gallagher has sought out opportunities, for example, in subsidized low-income housing and the so-called synfuel tax credit, designed to promote domestically-produced synthetic fuels that can reduce U.S. import dependence.Gallagher’s approach to refined coal, however, has made it a heavyweight, and it has been pivotal in recruiting tax investors to help finance refined coal operations throughout the country. In 2009, it negotiated partnerships with Fidelity and the U.S. subsidiary of France’s Schneider Electric SE (PA:SCHN) to produce refined coal for a utility at three South Carolina power plants, U.S. Tax Court disclosures show. Gallagher also has struck deals to put refined coal operations inside the fence of power plants owned by DTE and St. Louis-based utility Ameren Corp (N:AEE).Net earnings from its “clean energy” investments are estimated to be $115 million in 2018, or 17 times more than what the company reported in 2010. Looking ahead, the company can carry forward its stockpile of $850 million in credits to reduce its taxes in future years.“We will not be paying much, if any, U.S. federal income tax for many years to come,” CFO Howell said this spring during a conference call with investors."
10,"Dec 03, 2018 07:17AM ET",Special Report: U.S. 'clean coal' program fails to deliver on smog cuts,nan,"By Tim McLaughlin(Reuters) - Champions of coal say the superabundant fossil fuel can be made environmentally friendlier by refining it with chemicals – a “clean coal” technology backed by a billion dollars in U.S. government tax subsidies annually.But refined coal has a dirty secret. It regularly fails to deliver on its environmental promises, as electric giant  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) found.Duke began using refined coal at two of its North Carolina power plants in August 2012. The decision let the company tap a lucrative federal subsidy designed to help the American coal industry reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides – also known as NOx, the main contributor to smog and acid rain – along with other pollutants.In nearly three years of burning the treated coal, the Duke power plants collected several million dollars in federal subsidies. But the plants also pumped out more NOx, not less, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analyzed by Reuters.The NOx emission rate at Duke’s Marshall Steam Station power plant in Sherrills Ford, North Carolina, for example, was between 33 percent and 76 percent higher in the three years from 2012 to 2014 than in 2011, the year before Marshall started burning refined coal, the EPA data shows.The utility also discovered that one of the chemicals used to refine the coal, calcium bromide, had reached a nearby river and lakes – raising levels of carcinogens in the water supply for more than a million people in greater Charlotte.Duke stopped using refined coal at the plants in May 2015 because of the water pollution problems, said spokeswoman Erin Culbert. Bromide levels in the region’s drinking water dropped sharply several months later, said Barry Gullett, the city’s water director, in a 2015 memo.Duke’s experience reflects a fundamental problem with the U.S. clean coal incentive program, a Reuters examination has found. Refined coal shows few signs of reducing NOx emissions as lawmakers intended, according to regulatory documents, a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data, and interviews with power plant owners, scientists and state environmental regulators.Consumption figures compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that American power plants are on track to burn about 160 million tons of clean coal in 2018 – a fifth of the U.S. coal market. That amount would generate about $1.1 billion in incentives at the current tax credit amount of $7.03 per ton.But most of the plants receiving the subsidy failed to reduce NOx emissions by 20 percent – the threshold required under the policy – in 2017 compared to 2009, the last year before they started burning refined coal, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data on power plant emissions.Reuters identified 56 plants that burned refined coal in 2017 using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and disclosures from energy companies and refined-coal developers.Only 18 of that group reduced NOx emissions by more than 20 percent in 2017 compared to 2009. And 15 of those 18 only reported the improvements after installing or upgrading pollution control equipment or switching a portion of power production to cleaner-burning fuel, complicating the question of whether their pollution reductions are attributable to refined coal.At 22 of the 56 plants, NOx emissions were higher in 2017 while burning refined coal than they were when using raw coal in 2009.As a group, the fleet of U.S. power plants that burn refined coal also underperformed the rest of the industry in cutting emissions of NOx, the Reuters analysis found. NOx emissions rates declined 19 percent among the 56 power plants that reported burning refined coal in 2017. That compares with a 29 percent reduction by 214 other coal-fired power plants over the same period.The analysis included U.S. coal-fired power plants with at least 100 tons in annual NOx emissions in 2017.Investors in plants that failed to show substantial NOx emission cuts collected the tax credit anyway because the Internal Revenue Service allows them to prove emissions reductions with laboratory tests. The results of those tests – conducted for several hours a couple of times a year – often do not translate to real-world improvements at plants that burn millions of tons of coal annually.The IRS, which approves applications for the tax credit, declined to comment on the design or effectiveness of the testing regimen.“It’s hard to hang your hat on refined coal as the way to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions,” said Ron Sahu, an environmental engineer who has consulted with utility companies, the EPA and the U.S. Justice Department on power plant emissions. Sahu, who reviewed the data and methodology used by Reuters, said the analysis shows refined coal has little to no impact in reducing NOx emissions at actual power plants.“It’s clear that any benefit from refined coal can easily be overwhelmed by modest changes in combustion conditions” at power plants, Sahu said. “It’s debatable that a tax credit should be given for NOx reduction.”Reuters sent its analysis of EPA emissions data to every major utility operating power plants that burn clean coal, along with the leading U.S. investors who finance clean coal facilities in partnerships designed to take advantage of the subsidy. Most companies declined to comment or did not respond. The handful that did respond did not contest the findings of the analysis.“We do agree with the overall assessment that emission controls have a more measurable impact on emissions reductions over refined coal,” DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility that uses refined coal, told Reuters.The Edison Electric Institute, which represents the U.S. electric utility industry, did not respond to requests for comment.The law requires all refined coal producers seeking the subsidy to show that burning their product can lead to a 20 percent cut in NOx emissions. The producers also must show a 40 percent reduction in either mercury or sulfur dioxide. They are given the choice of which of those two pollutants to target.Refined coal investors tend to target mercury as the second pollutant for cuts, according to disclosures by the corporations involved in the program. That’s because reducing mercury emissions with refined coal is a cost-effective way for plants to comply with other, relatively new EPA regulations governing the pollutant. Utilities already have spent tens of billions of dollars on equipment to filter out sulfur dioxide, making additional reductions of that gas more difficult.The subsidy program has been more successful at combating mercury than NOx, the analysis found. The mercury emission rate at power plants burning refined coal product, for example, fell 75 percent between 2009 and 2017, more than the 40 percent cut required to qualify for the subsidy. Some of those cuts can also be attributed to other pollution control measures, such as the installation of scrubbers that filter coal plant exhaust, according to the EPA.High exposure to mercury can damage the intestines, kidney and nervous system, according to the EPA. Sulfur dioxide and NOx can cause lung damage.The refined coal subsidy was adopted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, alongside credits for generating renewable energy from solar and wind. The legislation had broad bipartisan support and generated little public debate. The subsidy is set to expire in 2021, and coal-state lawmakers, including North Dakota Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer, are moving to extend it for another decade.“The tax-credit program is bridging the divide to make coal clean and beautiful,” said Cramer, borrowing President Donald Trump’s two favorite adjectives to describe coal.Trump has promised to advance the interests of the coal industry to support blue-collar energy jobs. His administration has argued coal provides a more reliable fuel for power generation than natural gas, solar and wind, which can be more easily interrupted by pipeline problems or uncooperative weather.The White House did not respond to requests for comment.‘TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE’In one of the industry’s first refined coal ventures, power plant operator Associated Electric Cooperative Inc in 2010 signed a 10-year deal with affiliates of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to burn refined coal at the New Madrid and Thomas Hill power plants in Missouri.As a tax credit investor, Goldman worked with Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc to build refined coal facilities next to the cooperative’s power plants. A refined coal operation typically costs about $6 million to develop, featuring new conveyor belts and sprayers to move and treat the coal with chemicals, according to presentations to investors by Advanced Emissions. Silos also are installed to store the refined coal chemicals.The deal called for the utility to sell raw coal to the Goldman-led investment group at cost, and then buy it back at a discount after it was treated, saving the utility millions of dollars, disclosures show. Goldman and its investment partners collected about $63 million in gross tax credits from the program in 2017, based on an estimate in Associated’s annual report that its plants used 9 million tons of coal that year. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Associated had no upfront cost for the refined coal facility and contributes nothing to its annual operating costs. It forecast the arrangement would bring in $7 million to $9 million in annual revenue through at least 2018. “The project at first was questioned as simply too good to be true,” the utility wrote in its 50th anniversary report released in 2011.The money-making deal also illustrates how the potential benefits of refined coal on air quality can be erased by a variety of complex factors.The New Madrid plant in southeast Missouri, for example, has seen its production of NOx soar to a higher rate than any other U.S. coal plant while burning refined coal. In 2017, the plant’s NOx emission rate was 298 percent higher than it recorded in 2009, before New Madrid started burning clean coal, according to the EPA. During the first quarter of 2018, the rate jumped even further, to seven times the 2009 level.Associated Electric said the increase in NOx emissions at New Madrid was due in part to the cooperative’s purchasing tradable pollution credits through the U.S. cap-and-trade system. The market-based system sets an overall limit on pollution, and allows power plants that cut their pollution to earn credits that can be stockpiled or sold to other polluters. When large volumes of credits are generated, the cost of buying them can be lower than the cost of running pollution control equipment.“At times during the last seven years Associated has met compliance with emissions rules by purchasing NOx credits from the cap-and-trade markets, rather than running the control equipment all year,” the electric cooperative said in a statement, which it issued through Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally.The National Mining Association, which represents the U.S. coal industry, supports extending the tax credit. It said the cap-and-trade system was the primary reason NOx emissions went up at many power plants in the Reuters analysis. The association said clean coal lowers emissions, but provided no data to support the claim.Duke Energy said in a statement that routine changes in electricity demand can also make clean coal ineffective in reducing NOx by changing boiler temperatures and catalyst conditions in pollution control devices.Sahu, the environmental consultant, said refined coal is most effective at reducing NOx emissions when a utility burns the fuel at a relatively low temperature, something that typically occurs when electricity demands on the plant are low.But using low temperatures over an extended period can also damage power plant boilers by causing corrosion and soot buildup, he said. Conversely, burning the coal at a relatively high temperature – more common during high-demand periods – can reduce the risk of damage but limit the effectiveness of smog reductions.The Grand River Dam Authority stopped burning refined coal at its Oklahoma power plant last year because corrosion and other problems outweighed any upside, said John Wiscaver, head of GRDA’s corporate communications.“We had too many problems with refined coal,” he said.TROUBLED WATERSRefined coal has also led to contamination of water supplies for more than a million people, according to regulators and utility officials.In 2012, the South Carolina Department of Health & Environmental Control noticed elevated levels of bromides, the chemicals used to treat refined coal, in the Santee Cooper-Lake Moultrie public water system, said Tommy Crosby, a spokesman for the agency.The South Carolina plant’s refined coal operation stopped spraying bromide on the coal burned at the Cross Generating Station out of concern for the elevated levels of cancer-causing trihalomethanes, Crosby said, and the levels decreased within six months. Trihalomethanes are created when bromide mixes with the chlorine in treated drinking water.The plant’s refined coal facility was financed by global insurance firm AJ Gallagher, Boston-based mutual fund giant Fidelity and a U.S. subsidiary of France’s Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) SE. Fidelity declined to comment on the elevated TTHM levels and pointed out that federal limits were not exceeded. Schneider Electric and AJ Gallagher declined to comment.The North Carolina town of Mooresville, downstream of Duke’s Marshall power plant, saw its trihalomethanes surge as high as 127 parts per billion at times in 2015, after the facility discharged bromide used to treat coal into a nearby lake, according to the town’s drinking water quality report.That did not trigger a violation of federal clean water rules because the town’s annual average of 54 parts per billion that year was below the maximum trihalomethane contaminant level of 80 parts per billion. The same was true of the South Carolina plant, where trihalomethane levels in 2012 rose to 67 parts per billion.Over the past decade, however, many studies have shown that exposure to trihalomethanes at much lower levels than the federal limit raises the risk of cancer and of problems during pregnancy. Some people who drink water containing TTHMs in excess of the maximum standard over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer, according to the EPA.In 2016, the EPA included bromide in the Safe Water Drinking Act as an unregulated contaminant to be monitored by public water systems.Research by Jeanne VanBriesen, director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Center for Water Quality in Urban Environmental Systems, found that bromide additives used to reduce mercury could significantly boost trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies downstream of coal plants. Her 2017 study focused on 22 drinking water systems serving 2.5 million people in Pennsylvania.Once Duke Energy halted refined coal operations at the North Carolina plant, bromide dropped about 75 percent in the nearby Catawba River, Zachary Hall, director of environmental science at Duke, said in a February 2017 deposition given to the Southern (NYSE:SO) Environmental Law Center.Duke officials concede that bromide applications contributed to the elevated trihalomethane levels.“While bromides from our facilities were not the sole cause,” Duke’s Culbert said, “we felt it was important to partner with downstream water utilities and suspend the program.”  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Oct 23, 2018 01:10PM ET",Russia likely behind dangerous attack on Saudi energy plant: FireEye,nan,"By Christopher BingWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A dangerous computer virus designed to destroy safety systems at industrial plants was likely developed by a Russian government-backed research institute, U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye said on Tuesday.It was the first time that Russia has been accused of developing the virus, dubbed Triton, which was used in a 2017 attack on safety systems at a Saudi energy plant that caused operations at the facility to shut down.When the attack was first disclosed, FireEye and other firms said it was likely the work of a nation state but did not identify any suspects.FireEye said the virus was developed with the help of Moscow’s Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics.FireEye was hired by the victim to investigate the 2017 attack, in which Triton took remote control of a workstation running a safety system made by Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) SE. The virus sought to reprogram controllers used to monitor the plant for potential safety issues, causing some controllers to enter a fail safe mode.The claim suggests that Russia has moved from conducting probes and reconnaissance in industrial environments to developing viruses capable of causing destruction at such plants, said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis for FireEye.""They've crossed red lines. The intent was always there. This shows they also have the capability to cause significant damage,” Hultquist said.Technical details in the code of the Triton virus provided evidence as to who developed the malware and where it originated, according to a report released by FireEye.The cybersecurity firm said it believed the hackers who deployed Triton remain active, as they have also conducted “network reconnaissance” against additional, unnamed targets.Representatives from the Russian embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment.Russia has repeatedly denied allegations from private cybersecurity firms, the United States and its allies that Moscow was responsible for a string of cyber attacks around the world."

29,"May 04, 2018 12:01AM ET",China says will steadily push forward capital account convertibility,nan,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange regulator said on Friday that it will steadily push forward with the convertibility of its capital account, and at the same time fend off risk from cross-border capital flows.The head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), Pan Gongsheng, made the comments in a meeting with foreign companies on Thursday on deepening China's foreign exchange reforms and improving business conditions.Foreign firms that participated in the meeting in Beijing included HSBC PLC (L:HSBA),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), DBS (SI:DBSM),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, BMW (DE:BMWG) and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) [SCELIA.UL]. President Xi Jinping pledged in April to further widen access to the country's economy this year, as China marks the 40th year of its opening up. In recent weeks, China said it will resume two key outbound investment schemes, allowing domestic financial institutions to invest in overseas securities.The suspension of those outbound investment schemes came after gyrations in Chinese stock and currency markets in 2015 prompted a capital flight that led Beijing to burn its vast foreign exchange reserves by nearly $1 trillion to shore up the yuan and reduce outflows.China had also stepped up its crackdown on outbound investment deals that authorities suspected were highly speculative and were being used to circumvent capital controls.Over the past year, Chinese equities have steadied while the yuan  has gained sharply against the dollar, easing worries over potentially destabilizing capital flight.Outbound investment deals have also seen double-digit growth in the first quarter this year after falling 29.7 percent in 2017.China's forex regulator last month also widened the quotas of two other outbound investment schemes in Shanghai and Shenzhen as part of the government's efforts to liberalize financial markets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Apr 19, 2018 05:23AM ET",Publicis and industrials lead the pack as earnings dominate European stocks trading,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Advertising group Publicis and industrial stocks made gains on Thursday as strong results spurred them higher, while the main European indices stalled, showing signs of fatigue after a two-day rally took them to six-week highs. Earnings dominated trading, with Swiss industrial equipment maker ABB (S:ABBN) and French electric components firm Schneider (PA:SCHN) the biggest boosts to the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. ABB rose 3.9 percent after reporting its best start to the year since 2015, while Schneider's profit beat sent its shares up 2 percent. Shares in ABB rival  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also rose 1.5 percent.Advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) shone at the top of the STOXX after delivering a first-quarter sales beat helped by a rebound in North American activities.Its shares jumped 6.1 percent, boosting the media sector (SXMP) up 0.8 percent. ""The fact we have now had a second agency group [after U.S. firm Omnicom on Tuesday] report top-line positive organic revenue growth should reassure on the secular concerns,"" said Liberum analysts.Publicis' British rival WPP (L:WPP) also gained 3.4 percent as the results helped improve sentiment on agencies, which has been very negative.A surge in metals prices, after Russian sanctions sparked concerns over global supply, lifted the basic resources index (SXPP) up 0.4 percent, having soared 4.3 percent on Wednesday.Finnish steel firm Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) gained 2.8 percent, reflecting a rise in Japanese steelmakers overnight after a summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump produced no bad news on tariffs.Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) also rose 2.3 percent.Overall the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) hovered near six-week highs as a weaker healthcare sector outweighed gains in resources stocks. Novartis  (S:NOVN) shares fell 1.8 percent despite the Swiss drugmaker confirming 2018 targets. Baader Helvea analysts pointed to weaker first-quarter performance for its Sandoz drug in the U.S., and lower than expected profitability in the Innovative Medicine segment.Results from Nestle and  Unilever  reignited concerns about large consumer goods firms' pricing power. Unilever (L:ULVR) declined 2 percent after investors focused on weaker pricing which the Chief Financial Officer said was expected, due to difficulties in Brazil, North America and the UK.""We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.Nestle (S:NESN) shares barely budged despite the maker of Kit Kat chocolate confirming its outlook and saying volumes had picked up.Tech stocks also held the STOXX back with chipmakers arms (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), STMicro (MI:STM), and ASML (AS:ASML) all falling after Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) reported weaker than expected results.Merger and acquisition news also drove some big share price moves.  Weir Group  (L:WEIR) shares jumped 5.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm agreed to acquire U.S. mining tools maker ESCO for $1.05 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It has 60 signatories, with 30 of those countries having ratified the agreement.The treaty-based organization, launched by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, aims to promote solar energy in 121 countries. Speaking at the conference, Macron said France was more than tripling its commitment to the alliance, and its total monetary contribution to the alliance stood at one billion euros.Other than leaders from member countries, the event was attended by leaders from major development banks such as the Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank who are expected to sign solar energy-related agreements.The organization's main goal is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage, Upendra Tripathy, director general of ISA, told Reuters ahead of the conference on Friday.Macron, traveling with a delegation of French companies including EDF (PA:EDF), Dassault Aviation, Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and Suez, will inaugurate a solar plant built by Engie in Uttar Pradesh as a part of a four-day tour of India.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I want France to be its entry point,"" Macron said.""I want your creativity, your entrepreneurship, your young people to be much more present in France. Much more known and recognized. And I want to see the same from the French side.""India was the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into Britain in 2015, contributing to its position as Europe's top destination for foreign direct investment, according to official British figures. By comparison, India was only the 30th largest investor in France, according to 2013 Bank of France figures. Among recent wins for France is India's purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in 2016. It beat out the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is built by a European consortium that includes Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES).But talks to sell six new-generation EPR nuclear reactors built by state utility EDF and Areva have dragged on.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The main European stock index was still down 6.5 percent from its 2 1/2-year peak hit as recently as Jan. 23.Cyclical sectors drove the market higher, with basic resources, industrials, banks and technology stocks the best performers, recovering from their sharp drop last week.The rapid recovery from a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation reported on Wednesday took some by surprise, and investors said the bounce back indicated underlying strength in the market. ""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.""Earnings took center stage once more, with strong results driving the top gainers Airbus,  Ipsen  (PA:IPN),  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).Airbus (PA:AIR) shares jumped 8.8 percent after Europe's largest aerospace firm beat profit and earnings expectations, though it booked a new 1.3 billion euro charge on its A400M military plane.Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) was a top CAC 40 gainer, up 5 percent after the electrical equipment producer reported a strong profit margin despite headwinds from the rise in the euro.Shares in Dutch insurer Aegon (AS:AEGN) gained 3.7 percent after the firm reported a doubling of quarterly net income and raised estimates for future earnings, thanks to a tax cut in the U.S. where it does around 60 percent of its business.Insurer  NN Group  (AS:NN) fared less well than its rival Aegon. The Dutch firm's shares fell 3 percent after it reported profit undershooting analysts' expectations. Another notable faller was Nestle (S:NESN) whose shares hit a 10-month low, down 2.4 percent after the Swiss food giant reported last year's organic growth was the weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996.Meanwhile bank and insurance firm  Old Mutual  (L:OML), and mining company  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose to the top of Britain's FTSE 100 after President Jacob Zuma resigned in South Africa, sending the rand to near three-year highs.Both firms derive a high proportion of their revenue in South Africa, where the parliament was set to confirm Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president later on Thursday.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm, embroiled in an accounting scandal, said it would hold its annual shareholders' meeting on April 20.Overall fourth-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the previous year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.""Earnings estimates have also been raised, so that's definitely one of the supporting factors of the rally,"" said Robeco's Daalder.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

46,"Dec 14, 2017 01:16PM ET",Hackers halt plant operations in watershed cyber attack,nan,"By Jim Finkle(Reuters) - Hackers likely working for a nation-state recently invaded the safety system of a critical infrastructure facility in a watershed attack that halted plant operations, according to cyber investigators and the firm whose software was targeted. FireEye Inc (O:FEYE) disclosed the incident on Thursday, saying it targeted Triconex industrial safety technology from Schneider Electric SE (PA:SCHN). Schneider confirmed that the incident had occurred and that it had issued a security alert to users of Triconex, which cyber experts said is widely used in the energy industry, including at nuclear facilities, and oil and gas plants.FireEye and Schneider declined to identify the victim, industry or location of the attack. Cyber-security company Dragos said the hackers targeted an organization in the Middle East, while a second firm, CyberX, said it believe the victim was in Saudi Arabia. It marks the first report of a safety system breach at an industrial plant by hackers, who have in recent years placed increasing attention on breaking into utilities, factories and other types of critical infrastructure, cyber experts said. Compromising a safety system could let hackers shut them down in advance of attacking other parts of an industrial plant, potentially preventing operators from identifying and halting destructive attacks, they said.Safety systems ""could be fooled to indicate that everything is okay,"" even as hackers damage a plant, said Galina Antova, co-founder of cyber-security firm Claroty.""This is a watershed,"" said Sergio Caltagirone, head of threat intelligence with Dragos. “Others will eventually catch up and try to copy this kind of attack.”In the incident, hackers used sophisticated malware to take remote control of a workstation running a Schneider Electric Triconex safety shutdown system, then sought to reprogram controllers used to identify safety issues. Some controllers entered a fail safe mode, which caused related processes to shut down and caused the plant to identify the attack, FireEye said. FireEye believes the attacker's actions inadvertently caused the shutdown while probing the system to learn how it worked, said Dan Scali, who led FireEye's investigation.The attackers were likely conducting reconnaissance to learn how they could modify safety systems so they would not operate in the event that the hackers intended to launch an attack that disrupted or damaged the plant, he said.PUBLIC WARNINGS The U.S. government and private cyber-security firms have issued public warnings over the past few years about attempts by hackers from nations including Iran, North Korea and Russia and others to attack companies that run critical infrastructure plants in what they say are primarily reconnaissance operations. CyberX Vice President Phil Neray said his firm found evidence that the malware was deployed in Saudi Arabia, which could suggest that Iran may be behind the attack. Security researchers widely believe that Iran was responsible for a series of attacks on Saudi Arabian networks in 2012 and 2017 using a virus known as Shamoon. Schneider provided Reuters with a customer security alert, dated Wednesday, which said it was working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate the attack.""While evidence suggests this was an isolated incident and not due to a vulnerability in the Triconex system or its program code, we continue to investigate whether there are additional attack vectors,"" the alert said.Department of Homeland Security spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency was looking into the matter ""to assess the potential impact on critical infrastructure."" The malware, which FireEye has dubbed Triton, is only the third type of computer virus discovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear program.The second, known as Crash Override or Industroyer, was discovered last year by researchers who said it was likely used in a December 2016 attack that cut power in Ukraine.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

51,"Oct 17, 2017 02:44PM ET",Crude Oil Prices Settle Flat Ahead of Inventory Data,nan,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled flat on Tuesday as expectations of a ramp up in U.S. production weighed on sentiment while easing conflict in Northern Iraq between Iraqi and Kurdish forces lessened concerns over potential supply disruptions in the region.On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 1 cent to settle at $51.88 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 20 cents to trade at $58.03 a barrel.Crude oil prices came under pressure on renewed oversupply concerns following data indicating that U.S. producers will increase output.A monthly report from the Energy Information Administration released Monday showed expectations for a rise of 81,000 barrels a day to 6.12 million barrels a day in shale oil production from seven key U.S. shale regions in November.The recent uptick in crude prices above $50 a barrel is widely viewed as an incentive for shale producers as it’s the price level at which they can ramp up output.“WTI prices have found some breathing room above the $50 [a barrel level] and the market is increasingly concerned that those levels will trigger rising rig counts and stronger production growth further down the line,” said Robbie Fraser, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).Also weighing on the crude prices was a fall in geopolitical tensions in Northern Iraq as the threat of ongoing fighting between Iraqi and Kurdish forces eased after Kurdish forces pulled out of disputed areas in region.""The security premium built into prices from the (Iraqi-Kurdish) situation is in the process of vanishing,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.Crude prices staged a late-session rebound, however, as traders looked ahead to a fresh batch of crude inventory data expected to show a continued draw in crude oil stockpiles.U.S. crude inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday as well as a further report from EIA on Wednesday are expected to show a decrease in U.S. crude inventories for the fourth-straight week."

53,"Sep 25, 2017 07:00AM ET",ABB buys GE business for $2.6 billion in bet it can boost margins,nan,"By John MillerZURICH (Reuters) - Power grids maker ABB is buying General Electric's Industrial Solutions business for $2.6 billion in a bet it can improve the division's lackluster margins over the next five years, the Swiss engineering company said on Monday.Zurich-based ABB sees potential for annual cost benefits of $200 million with the deal, which includes an agreement for long-term use of GE's brand and a strategic partnership. In 2016, the GE business had sales of $2.7 billion.The GE products include circuit breakers, switchgear, components for lighting control and power supply equipment for facilities including data centers. ABB's portfolio includes similar products. ABB is seeking to better penetrate the North American market and gain access to GE's larger installed base of electrical installations worldwide.ABB said the business had been ""an unloved child"" and pledged to upgrade aging products with its own technology to help arrest a declining U.S. market share.ABB is suspending its $3 billion share buyback program as part of the deal, which will bolster its position as the second-biggest supplier of electrical components behind France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).ABB is also wagering on being able to cut costs and boost profitability at the Georgia-based GE unit. ""The key rationale of the integration is, first we will make this business better. And then afterwards, we will make this business bigger and better,"" said ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer. ABB expects integration costs of $400 million.The GE unit's operating earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) are just 6 percent of sales, less than half the 15 percent operating margin at ABB's comparable Electrification Products division. Spiesshofer said he agreed to the transaction only after striking a supply partnership where ABB and GE will increase buying and selling from each another. ""Without that, the economics wouldn't have worked,"" he told reporters on a call. ""With the supply partnership, the economics at the price of 0.9 times revenue is working.""GE has been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to sell assets and focus on higher-margin businesses.Some analysts said the price was surprisingly high given the GE business's low profitability.""GE Industrial Solutions isn't in top shape, so ABB has its work cut out for it,"" said Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Richard Frei.ABB said it would finance the deal -- likely its last for some time -- with cash and did not need to raise equity capital. Its shares were little changed in early trading. GE had resumed negotiations to sell the business to ABB after moderating its price expectations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in August. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Dyal Co acted as financial advisers to ABB, and Davis Polk & Wardwell provided legal counsel.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The bullish outlook on oil demand, lifted expectations that the demand and the supply imbalance in oil markets would continue to narrow in the coming months.The duo of reports overshadowed data showing U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected last week, as the fallout from Hurricane Harvey, which tore through the U.S. oil heartland of Texas in August, forcing refineries to shutdown weighed on crude demand.The post-Harvey refinery recovery is underway, however, as data earlier in the week from IHS Markit indicated that 13 of 20 affected U.S. refineries were restarting operations.Crude output is expected to remain subdued as U.S. oil rigs continued to decline, pointing to a slowdown in production which could bolster crude prices.Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States declined by 7 to 749.The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.“On the U.S. side, steadily declining rig counts of late have raised the possibility of stalled U.S. production gains, with current output still holding below pre-Harvey levels,” said Robbie Fraser, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric (PA:PA:SCHN), in a note."

59,"Sep 05, 2017 01:43PM ET",Third time lucky as Aveva agrees £3 billion software deal with Schneider,nan,"By Paul Sandle and Noor Zainab HussainLONDON (Reuters) - France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) will take a 60 percent stake in an enlarged industrial software business worth about 3 billion pounds after agreeing to combine with Britain's Aveva Group at the third time of asking.Jean-Pascal Tricoire, chairman and CEO of Schneider Electric, said the combined company would be better placed to serve a wide range of industries and its enhanced capacity would also benefit investors.Completion of the deal, due around the end of the year, will mark the end of independence for the last $1 billion-plus tech company founded in the English university city of Cambridge, an area known as ""Silicon Fen"".The British company's chief executive James Kidd said he was confident the merger would get over the line this time after two failed attempts to do a deal since 2015.""We are in a much further progressed position than we've been before; we've signed a binding merger agreement with Schneider,"" he said in an interview.Aveva's products are used to design and manage oil rigs, ships and chemical plants, while the French multinational spans electrical components, energy management and industrial automation systems.The tie-up will create a global leader in engineering and industrial software with combined revenue of around 657.5 million pounds ($856.5 million) and adjusted earnings of 145.8 million pounds this year, the companies said.Kidd, who will be the interim chief executive of the combined group before taking the deputy CEO and CFO role, said the logic of the deal remained compelling.It gave Aveva a bigger presence in sectors such as food and beverages and pharmaceuticals as well as in its strongholds in oil and gas, mining, and marine, he said.""They have also got a substantial presence in the US, which has been one of our key strategic objectives for some time and this gives us a great platform,"" he said.Shares in Aveva, which have underperformed the FTSE 250 index by 21 percent in the last two years, soared 26 percent to 24.25 pounds at 1500 GMT.Schneider Electric was little changed at 69.09 euros.REVERSE TAKEOVERSchneider will take a 60 percent stake in the enlarged group in a reverse takeover that will enable Aveva to retain its London listing.Tricoire said Schneider had decided against a full takeover because he believed a dedicated software company had ""its own DNA, its own culture, and own way of thinking"".The merged group said it was in the process of seeking a new chief executive with experience of running a global software business.The collapse of the first tie-up attempt was blamed by Aveva on the ""highly complex structure of the proposed transaction"" and worries about ""significant integration challenges"".Kidd said on Tuesday that Schneider had worked to separate its software assets ahead of the deal this time.Under the terms of the deal, in return for ceding control, Aveva shareholders will receive 550 million pounds of cash, worth around 858 pence per share, from Schneider and another 100 million pounds, worth around 156 pence per share, of cash on Aveva's balance sheet.Analysts at Investec, who put their ""hold"" rating on Aveva under review, said the deal was ""sensible"" considering the strategic challenges Aveva faced.""In absence of any bids being made by other potential suitors over the last couple of years, this seems like the best option for Aveva shareholders to help overcome the strategic growth challenges of being largely focused on the oil and gas market,"" they said.The deal, including the cash return, implied a total value for the shares of about 25-26 pounds, they said.Analysts at Jefferies said the rationale looked reasonable, but the details were less convincing for shareholders in the French group.""Aveva's recent record is poor, with profits 30 percent below the 2014 peak and minimal growth,"" they said. ""The deal also increases Schneider's exposure to Oil & Gas capex,"" they added, an area that has come under pressure as energy companies trim their budgets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares in  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) were all down between 1.7 and 1.9 percent.In spite of the weakness analysts at some big investment banks were upbeat. UBS strategists upgraded European banks to overweight from neutral as they expect cyclical sectors to get a boost when the ECB eventually scales back its stimulus. They also said that the recent strengthening in the euro made them more cautious on U.S.-exposed stocks but more positive on domestically exposed companies. On the macroeconomic side, a survey showing that euro zone business activity remained strong in August was the latest evidence that the bloc's recovery is maintaining its pace.The recovery has been a key support behind the robust earnings growth of the past two quarters.Energy stocks (SXEP) were among the top-gaining sectors, up 0.56 as oil prices rebounded. [O/R]Health stocks also rose, led by Germany's Merck KGAA (DE:MRCG), up 2.4 percent, which said that it was considering selling its consumer health business. Among mid caps, Aveva (L:AVV) rose 25.7 percent. The British engineering software firm agreed to combine with Schneider Electric's (PA:SCHN) software business, creating a London-listed company worth more than 3 billion pounds ($3.90 billion).Shares in Schneider Electric advanced 0.3 percent. Inmarsat  (L:ISA) fell 6.5 percent after broker Numis began its coverage of the stock with a ""sell"" rating, with analysts saying that they were cautious over the company's revenue prospects and margin outlook.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Aug 23, 2017 06:30PM ET","GE, ABB restart talks over industrial solutions deal: sources",nan,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Alwyn Scott(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) has resumed negotiations to sell its industrial solutions business to Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd (S:ABBN), after the U.S. industrial conglomerate moderated its price expectations, people familiar with the matter said.The move underscores the determination of John Flannery, who took over from Jeffrey Immelt as GE's chief executive on Aug. 1, to continue to divest non-core assets, as he carries out a review of the company's portfolio.GE is entertaining the possibility of selling its industrial solutions business for a little over $2 billion after initially hoping for more than $3 billion, four sources said this week. The talks with ABB had ended last month over price disagreements.There is no certainty of a deal and another bidder could still emerge, the sources said. However, French electrical component and energy management group Schneider Electric SA (PA:SCHN), which Reuters reported in April was vying for the GE unit, has since lost interest, the sources added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. GE and ABB declined to comment, while Schneider Electric did not immediately respond to a request for comment.GE's industrial solutions business offers circuit breakers, relays, panel boards and other industrial electrical equipment for several markets, including the healthcare, mining, renewable energy, telecommunication, construction and data center sectors. GE, which makes everything from power plants and jet engines to medical scanners and locomotives, has been reviewing its portfolio after divesting its finance, appliances and NBCUniversal units in recent years. Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP has also been pressuring GE to cut costs and focus on its core industrial businesses.Earlier this year, GE agreed to sell its industrial water treatment business to French waste and water group Suez SA (PA:SEVI) and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion). Last month, Schneider Electric said it would acquire automatic transfer switch maker Asco Power Technologies for $1.25 billion from Vertiv, the former network power business of Emerson Electric Co (N:EMR) that is now owned by private equity firm Platinum Equity LLC. That deal eliminated Schneider Electric as a potential buyer for GE's industrial solutions business, because such a deal would face significant antitrust hurdles, according to the sources.ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer has been under pressure to tackle lower profitability at the Swiss engineering company, after higher raw material prices and overcapacity issues dented its latest quarterly earnings.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Aug 15, 2017 02:41PM ET",Crude oil settles at 3-week lows on downbeat data,nan,"Investing.com – Crude futures settled lower on Tuesday, as data showing weaker-than-expected oil demand in China continued to weigh on sentiment while concerns remained Opec may struggle to tackle the glut in supply, following a drop in compliance with the deal to curb production.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery fell 4 cents to settle at $47.55 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained $0.12 cents to trade at $50.85 a barrel.Crude futures started the session on the back foot falling to three-week lows, following data on Monday showing Chinese oil refineries in July operated at their slowest rates in nearly twelve months.The downbeat data fuelled concerns that a glut of refined fuel products could lessen demand for oil from China, the world’s second-largest consumer, reducing the prospect of oil inventories falling below the five-year average. Meanwhile, an announcement by the Nigerian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell that it had lifted a force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports, also added to oversupply jitters.Crude futures attempted to pare losses in the late afternoon U.S. session, as investors looked ahead to bullish U.S. crude inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday as well as a further report from EIA on Wednesday. Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by 3m barrels in the week ended Aug 11, the seventh-straight week of declines. An uptick in U.S. shale production, however, is expected to curb sentiment on oil prices, after the EIA said Monday it expected to see a climb in crude output from key U.S. shale regions of 117,000 barrels per day (bdp) in September to 6.149 million bpd.“While global inventories have managed to decline in recent months, the threat of U.S. shale has meant inventory draws have found difficulty providing significant price support,” said Robbie Fraser, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN)."

77,"Apr 21, 2017 02:44PM ET","GE shares fall on cash, business worries though profit beats",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co reported quarterly sales and adjusted earnings results that beat analysts estimates on Friday, but its shares fell on concerns about some of its industrial businesses and its cash outflow.The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment also reported a negative $1.6 billion in cash flow from industrial operating activities compared with a negative $600 million it expected for the quarter due to a $1.3 billion increase in working capital and the timing of bills to customers. Investors have been watching cash flow as an indicator of GE's operating performance, and GE said it still expects to hit its cash target of $12 billion to $14 billion for the full year.Shares were down 2.3 percent at $29.57 in afternoon trading, making it the second-biggest decliner on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.""There was immediate disappointment that cash came in low,"" said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital markets. Analysts asked numerous questions about it on the conference call and ""it gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter.""The company also raised concern by giving itself wiggle room to deliver fewer LEAP aircraft engines this year, a key risk for the company. It said the range for the year was 450 to 500 engines, instead of nearly 500 it stated earlier. ""It is notable that GE is taking a more cautious slant by backing away from a firm target of ""500,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said.But GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview there was no change in the LEAP forecast.""We're not changing our view on our ability to deliver the LEAP engine this year for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus,"" Bornstein said. GE shipped 81 engines in the first quarter and expects to ship 100 in the second quarter, he said, adding: ""There's no delays to customers whatsoever.""GE beat analysts estimates for adjusted earnings and revenue, even though revenue fell 1 percent to $27.66 billion, due to lower sales in its oil-and-gas and lighting businesses. Analysts expected $26.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 21 cents a share were unchanged from a year ago and beat analyst estimates of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.GE said industrial organic revenue, which is from continuing businesses, grew 7 percent in the quarter, a strong showing according to analysts. Industrial operating profit margins rose by 1.3 percent points, also more than analysts expected, and ahead of the 1 percentage point forecast for the year.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt noted a 10 percent rise in quarterly orders and said the world economy was ""an attractive environment for GE.""""We see global growth accelerating, while the U.S. continues to improve,"" Immelt said on the conference call, adding that growth in China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa this year were all ""stronger than last year.""Separately, European engineering groups ABB Ltd and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) SE are competing for GE's solutions division, which could fetch as much as $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

However, Trump's victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event.Trump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord.The 360+ group called on U.S. leaders to continue to participate in the Paris Agreement, support the continuation of U.S. commitments on climate change and continue to invest in low-carbon solutions at home and abroad. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,"" the group said, in the statement presented at U.N. climate talks being held this week in Marrakesh, Morocco.""Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy prosperity to all,"" the group added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

95,"Jun 22, 2016 10:50AM ET",Chinese robot maker Siasun scouting Europe for acquisitions,nan,"By Georgina Prodhan and Irene PreisingerMUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - China's biggest maker of industrial robots, Siasun, is looking for acquisitions in Europe to expand the proportion of sales it makes abroad, its president said on Wednesday.China is the world's largest robot market, but government support is rapidly expanding the number of robot makers, intensifying competition while growth is slowing.""We have a team in Europe. They are looking for robot companies, electronics companies, controller companies and so on. They want to buy,"" Daokui Qu said in an interview at the Automatica robotics fair in Munich.Chinese home-appliances maker Midea last week launched a 4.5 billion-euro ($5.1 billion) bid for German industrial robot maker Kuka, the biggest German company yet to be targeted by a Chinese buyer.Qu said he aimed to raise the share of sales that Siasun makes abroad to 40 percent, from 20 percent, in five years' time.Siasun has a market capitalization of 39.4 billion yuan ($5.99 billion) and made total sales of 1.69 billion yuan last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Qu estimated that prices for industrial robots were falling by about 5 percent a year in China as the number of domestic competitors explodes. ""In the last three to five years, many, many new companies appeared - maybe up to 800. It's a terrible number,"" he said. ""It's fierce, fierce competition."" China's industrial robot market is dominated by foreign players such as Japan's Fanuc, Swiss ABB and Kuka, but the International Federation of Robotics estimates the share of domestic players rose to 31 percent last year from 25 percent in 2013. Qu said he believed Siasun was ahead of the pack in China but a tier below foreign competitors in terms of technology. Siasun has won foreign customers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) by competing in areas outside the core area of industrial robots, which are mainly stationary and do heavy work enclosed in cages. These include mobile robots, which can navigate spaces and move objects around, and service robots used for personal care, in the home or in medical environments - where Qu said Siasun had gained expertise thanks to China's large elderly population. Qu said many Chinese robot makers could go out of business because fierce price competition would not allow them to spend what they needed to on research and development. ""Maybe some of the robot companies in the future will go and die,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

98,"Dec 08, 2015 02:10PM ET",Siemens ups research spending to keep innovative edge,nan,"By Georgina ProdhanMUNICH (Reuters) - German industrial group Siemens is to raise research spending and expand activities with start-ups to help to keep its innovative edge as industry rapidly turns digital.The trains-to-turbines group said it would raise research and development spending by 7 percent this year to 4.8 billion euros ($5.2 billion), with the bulk of this flowing to its major strengths of automation, digitization and energy systems.The Munich-based group has been instrumental in the development of the telegraph, X-ray machines and the trolley bus and depends on its ability to keep innovating to maintain pricing power and outpace the markets in which it is active.""Innovation is part of our DNA,"" Chief Technology Officer Siegfried Russwurm told analysts and reporters at a capital markets day.But Siemens increasingly has to compete with software companies who can develop technology faster without the legacy of physical machinery or the complexity of eight different industrial businesses that Siemens has to manage.About 5 percent of its 350,000 staff are software engineers.To become more nimble, Siemens said it would bundle and expand its activities with start-ups into a kind of incubator that would be a consultant, promoter and risk capital provider for businesses and projects.Siemens Venture Capital has invested more than 800 million euros in start-ups over 20 years. They include Munich-based energy-management technology company Caterva and Stuttgart logistics technology provider Magazino.Siemens also said it would create a new, three-year fund of 100 million euros for employees to develop their own projects, establish a new research center for 100 people in Munich and hire 300 new R&D staff in China.The increase in R&D spend is slightly above the ""moderate"" sales growth Siemens expects for its current fiscal year and keeps the proportion of sales it spends on research at around 6 percent, comparable with arch-rival  General Electric  (N:GE).European peers ABB and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) spend 4 and 4.9 percent respectively.Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said Siemens' quota would probably remain at around 6 percent for the next years, but would presumably rise over time.One of the areas where Siemens wants to invest is decentralized energy systems, the smaller power-generating units and smart transmission technology gradually displacing the large turbines in which Siemens held a cutting edge.Its acquisitions of Dresser-Rand and Rolls Royce (L:RR) turbines and compressors over the last year have already strengthened its position in this area, helping to redress the balance after GE won a battle to buy Alstom's power business. Siemens said it had won a 900 million-euro order to supply technology for a new power line linking Germany's industrial south with northern windfarms, a market in which it sees huge potential as renewable power sources proliferate.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Gates and a group of developing and developed countries will start the Clean Tech Initiative. Goldman's pick of stocks exposed to the $600 billion low-carbon economy included low-emissions lighting stocks like Acuity Brands (N:AYI) or Germany's Hella (DE:HLE) as well as tyremaker Continental (DE:CONG).Shares of SolarEdge were among the biggest gainers from Goldman's note, rising 2.1 percent to $19.49 in late-morning U.S. trading. Acuity Brand was up 0.5 percent at $232.64. Tesla shares were flat at $231.64 and Albemarle was up 0.9 percent at $53.59.European premium turbine manufacturers Vestas (CO:VWS) ,  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) and  Gamesa  (MC:GAM) are also long term winners, Goldman said.Meanwhile, Moody's warned that environmental risks would weigh on the credit quality of almost a dozen industries including mining, steel, building materials and oil and gas. ""Whether in autos, capital goods, basic materials, or utilities, both the opportunities and risks associated with spreading low carbon technologies and tightening emissions regulations have become too big to ignore,"" Goldman Sachs said.World leaders were meeting in Paris on Monday to launch an ambitious attempt to hold back the earth's rising temperatures, urging each other to find common cause in two weeks of bargaining meant to steer the global economy away from dependence on fossil fuels. Barclays  (L:BARC) last week backed European renewable energy and engineering stocks like  Vestas Wind  Systems (CO:VWS), ABB (VX:ABBN) and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) as relative winners if the talks had a successful outcome.Goldman said the possible opportunities offset the challenges of competition, subsidy-induced volatility and rapid technology developments.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

107,"Jul 20, 2015 08:50AM ET",Schneider Electric takes control of UK software firm Aveva,nan,"By Paul SandleLONDON (Reuters) - France's Schneider Electric (PARIS:SCHN) is combining its software operations with Britain's Aveva to create a business active in sectors ranging from nuclear power to pharmaceuticals and less reliant on oil and gas markets.Schneider will pay 550 million pounds ($858 million) towards the issue of new shares in Aveva, a company that designs shipping, industrial plants and nuclear power stations. It will take a 53.5 percent stake in the enlarged company.The deal will see Aveva shareholders receive about 10 pounds a share in cash in return for the French company taking control, according to brokers.Investec, who upgraded Aveva to ""Buy"", calculated the payment, plus a 15 percent profit boost from cost savings, resulted in a value of about 2,600 pence a share. That would represent a 47 percent premium on Friday's close. The tie-up reduces Aveva's exposure to oil and gas markets, the source of about 45 percent of its revenue, and where lower oil prices have cut demand for rigs designed using its software.""This deal has a clear and compelling industrial logic,"" said Aveva's chief executive Richard Longdon, who will remain in charge of a group he has led since 1999. ""(It) will diversify Aveva's end markets, significantly enhancing its position in oil and gas, power and marine, but also adding a big presence in other verticals including chemicals, food and beverage, mining water and pharmaceuticals.""Shares in Aveva, which was founded in 1967 as a spin-off from Cambridge University, jumped to a four-year high of 2,344 pence on Monday morning, and they were trading up 29 percent at 2,282 pence at 1225 GMT.Shares in Schneider Electric, a much bigger group with annual revenues of 25 billion euros ($27 billion) last year, were trading up 0.9 percent at 64.48 euros. The deal will more than double the size of Aveva, giving it annual revenue of about 534 million pounds and adjusted earnings of about 130 million pounds.It will also see former assets of Britain's Invensys, bought by Schneider two years ago, united with Aveva.Longdon said Schneider had decided to structure the deal as a reverse takeover rather than the straight acquisition that had been mooted in media reports to retain more flexibility to make further acquisitions.""There was not an offer on the table to buy the business outright,"" he said.The merged business will retain its listing on the London Stock Exchange, and Schneider Electric will need approval from Aveva's independent directors if it wanted to increase its shareholding further or to delist the group.Lazard advised Aveva, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Ondra Partners advised Schneider.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

117,"Mar 13, 2015 12:51PM ET","Weak euro to help European companies, force U.S. rivals to adapt",nan,"By Tom Bergin and Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - The euro's slide toward parity with the dollar will provide a much-needed boost for European companies this year and force U.S. rivals to adapt their businesses or risk losing market share.While currency hedging arrangements mean the benefits may not be seen straight away, the currency's weakness has already cheered European chief executives by making their products cheaper overseas and lifting the value of dollar-based sales.""We have been handicapped by the strength of the euro, but now it seems that the wind is turning and we intend to make the most of this very positive currency effect that will help us deliver a nice increase of our sales and our profits in 2015,"" Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) told investors last month.Other companies predicting a tail wind from the around 20 percent drop in the value of the euro over the past six months to $1.06 on Friday include jet manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR), German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and French engineering groups Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and  Alstom  (PARIS:ALSO). Some U.S companies also see positives from the weaker euro, including lower borrowing costs, better performance at European units which export, stronger demand from Euro zone-based customers and, for the leisure sector, increased travel into the continent.However, most U.S. groups that discussed the currency in recent weeks including Apple (O:AAPL), Dupont (N:DD), Priceline (O:PCLN),  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and  General Electric  (N:GE), have warned they may face headwinds in Europe and elsewhere, and some, including Xerox (N:XRX), have cut earnings guidance as a result.These companies have said they are now looking to cut costs, increase the portion of inputs they source from inside the euro zone and adopt new pricing policies, to try and maintain market share and margins.""U.S. companies exporting goods to Europe could face margin pressure from price adjustments or promotions in Europe,"" said James Targett, analyst at Berenberg.With euro weakness likely to persist due to the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program and a likely hike in U.S. interest rates on the back of a stronger U.S. economy, longer term planning is a must.""You have to think about where your revenues are, where your manufacturing is and where you're buying your raw materials from,"" he added.TIME LAGMany companies said hedging contracts would mean the impact of the lower euro would take time to feed through. Paris-based Alstom and Swiss-headquartered engineer ABB, which has manufacturing plants in the euro zone, said it may not be felt until the second half of the year. Airbus said it was fully hedged for 2015, 2016 and ""largely"" for 2017, leading analysts to predict it could be 2018 before the group experienced any meaningful uplift.In the meantime, the weaker euro may actually weigh on some European companies' earnings because companies must report drops in the values of hedging instruments, which move in the opposite direction to companies' revenues. ""In itself, the drop in the euro is some good news. It should have a positive impact on our revenues, and our operating income. But, of course, in the short term it will have -- it will be a drag on our profitability rate,"" Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci and Puma owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), said on an analyst call last month.Kering said it was switching to the use of options, paying a premium to hedge against currency moves, rather than entering swap contracts which must be revalued each quarter with the changes in value put through the user's profit and loss account.U.S .companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and PepsiCo (N:PEP). said hedging would mitigate their losses in the short term. However, businesses are also looking at how they can reconfigure their operations to limit the hit from a weaker euro and capitalize on any opportunities.A number of companies said they would look at cutting costs. Others said they would try and push through euro price rises in Europe to try and compensate for the fact the euro is now worth less, although deflationary pressures across the continent means companies have little pricing power.U.S. conglomerate 3M (N:MMM) said it was looking at pegging some prices to the dollar and even renegotiating the prices at which it purchases goods.REGIONAL SELF-SUFFICIENCYMany companies said they were considering locking the benefits of the euro into their supply chain. ABB (VX:ABBN) CEO Uli Spiesshofer said his company was looking at ""taking further advantage of euro-based suppliers"". Nick Gangestad, CFO of 3M said his company was aim for more ""regional self-sufficiency"".This strategy may reduce costs in the short term but it poses risks.""The downside to this, however, is that local sourcing fails to leverage global scale and could make procurement less efficient. Scale is great for pricing power,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.For some U.S. companies, the lower currency will be a boon for long-struggling European subsidiaries. U.S.-based Caterpillar said it had been forced to downsize its excavator plant in Grenoble in recent years but that the weak euro could help drive its recovery.""A euro at parity (to the dollar) will just be a great tailwind for that… the currency benefit will just be gravy on that,"" CEO Doug Oberhelman said.Philip Morris International (N:PM), which has a significant portion of its debt denominated in euros, said they were also benefiting from lower borrowing costs, since meeting the coupons on euro debt was now cheaper in dollar terms.For a small number of U.S. companies, the euro drop may even be a net positive, operationally. Europe-based hotels' higher reliance on external visitors than those in the United States meant the draw of the weaker European currency may outweigh the costs of a stronger dollar in putting tourists off.""Roughly 30 percent of our European lodging demand comes from outside Europe, with about 20 points from North America and 6 points from Asia,"" said Arne Sorenson, Marriott International, Inc. CEO. ""In the United States, for example, 95 percent of our business is US business; 5 percent is inbound business.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote
