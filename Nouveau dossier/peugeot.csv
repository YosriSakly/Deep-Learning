4,"May 27, 2019 04:39AM ET",StockBeat: The Spirit of Marchionne Lives on in FCA-Renault Deal,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Sergio Marchionne may be gone, but his spirit lives on.The former Fiat boss would surely have applauded his successor’s plan for another transformative merger to address the problems of slowing demand and frighteningly large investment obligations as mobility becomes electric, autonomous and connected.FCA's (NYSE:FCAU) strongest card is the extra efficiency such scale creates: it estimates annual synergies at over 5 billion euros, in addition to those that  Renault  (PA:RENA) currently enjoys with its merger partner Nissan (T:7201). A combined FCA-Renault would be the world’s third-largest automotive group behind Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). But – more importantly – it could also convince Nissan and Mitsubishi (T:8058) that there is no long-term alternative to deeper integration with Renault. That could enhance the efficiencies of scale still further.But as with so many of Marchionne’s grand designs, Fiat Chrysler’s move on Renault risks being bogged down by the details – and by the sheer number of moving parts in the deal.First, there is the promise of no plant closures. This comes after a six-month period in which – according to Bloomberg calculations – global carmakers have announced 38,000 job cuts. Of those, only 1,500 have come from FCA and none from Renault. The two companies are behind in the race to trim costs and this promise reduces their ability to extract the maximum benefit from the deal (although it’s conspicuous that there’s no promise about the safety of white-collar jobs)Second, there's the ownership question: the Financial Times has cited an unnamed French government official as saying the government isn’t opposed to the deal, but the French state’s stake would be diluted in a merged company, and it would only be the second largest shareholder behind Exor, the Agnelli family holding company now run by Johann Elkann. FCA has tried to address concerns of control by proposing an 11-member board with four members each from FCA and Renault, with one more from Nissan.Either way, markets have decided they like the idea, and have pushed Renault 13.7% higher on Monday morning, while FCA is up 9.9%.  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), which could see its competitive position jeopardized, is down 2.6%. That’s helping the Italy lead Europe’s stock markets higher on a morning where the mood has been lifted by the reasonably strong showing of centrist parties in elections to the European parliament.The FTSE MIB is up 0.9%, while the French CAC 40 is up 0.3%. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, which includes a lot of U.K. stocks that aren’t trading today due to the local bank holiday, is up 0.4% at 377.32 as of 4.30 AM ET (0830 GMT)."

6,"May 13, 2019 04:18AM ET",StockBeat: Tariff Spotlight Shifts to European Automakers,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- The U.S. is now preparing to widen 25% tariffs on all imports from China. Will Europe be next?Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain. Parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) is at the bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5%, tiremakers Continental (DE:CONG) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) are also down sharply, and even chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are being affected by the general malaise, due to their exposure to the auto sector.All that said, the sector may get a stay of execution. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that “there are signs that (the deadline) could be extended because of the talks between the U.S. and China.”“We’re prepared for the worst,” she added, noting that the EU has drawn up a list of U.S. products that would also have tariffs imposed on them if the U.S. goes ahead with its threat"
7,"Apr 30, 2019 11:38AM ET","Lyft elevates GM first-quarter profit, pickups in driver's seat",nan,"By Nick Carey and Ben KlaymanDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted by revaluations of shares it holds in ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). Excluding the benefits of those revaluations, GM delivered results in line with analyst predictions, driven mostly by highly lucrative pickup truck sales in the U.S. market. The No. 1 U.S. automaker's shares were down 2.7 percent in morning trading.The earnings came after a 7 percent decline in U.S. new-vehicle sales in the first quarter, in which smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's pickup trucks outsold GM's. ""We remain concerned with the U.S. auto cycle, both from a pricing and volume perspective,"" Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note. ""Moreover, specific to GM, we are concerned about recently monthly pick-up truck and market share stats.""GM's sales in China also dropped almost 20 percent and profit there declined 37 percent. Auto sales in China industrywide fell 2.8 percent last year and were down again in the first quarter.GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters that the Chinese market remains ""volatile.""""From an economic standpoint, there are green shoots,"" she said. ""But we have yet to see that translate to vehicle demand.""GM will launch 20 new models in China in 2019, most of them in the second half of the year. In the United States, the automaker had around four months supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck on the ground as of the beginning of April, a high level in an auto market that overall is expected to decline in 2019.CFO Suryadevara said that the company's inventory would be brought down over the course of the year without use of heavy consumer discounts. She said that tariffs and higher commodity prices would cost GM around $1 billion in 2019.As recently as late last year, GM executives insisted the automaker's Cruise self-driving unit would launch a commercial ride-hailing service by the end of 2019. However, when asked several times on Tuesday when that service would launch, neither CFO Suryadevara nor Chief Executive Mary Barra would provide a date, repeatedly responding that GM's efforts would be ""gated by safety."" GM said it is ""bullish"" on pickup truck sales for the rest of 2019 as more versions of its new Silverado hit dealer showrooms and its heavy-duty trucks launch in the second half of the year. Last week, rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market and said it was confident its 2019 results would be better than those of last year.Ford said last week it will invest $500 million in U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC, joining Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in backing the potential rival to Silicon Valley's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. According to sources, GM had previously been in talks with Rivian about a possible investment.GM CEO Barra told analysts on Tuesday the automaker will produce a full range of electric vehicles, including an all-electric pickup truck, but she did not provide details.General Motors has preferred shares in Peugeot from when it sold its German Opel unit to the Paris-based automaker in 2017. Lyft completed an initial public offering at the end of the first quarter and the value of GM's stake rose $300 million. The increased value of those stakes added 31 cents per share to GM's first-quarter profit.GM reported a first-quarter net profit of $2.2 billion, or $1.48 per share, up from $1.05 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-items, the company earned $1.41 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.11. The company's revenue for the quarter fell to $34.9 billion from $36.1 billion a year earlier. GM reiterated its full-year 2019 profit outlook for earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Earnings before interest and tax slid 16% although, at 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion), they still beat consensus forecasts by nearly 10%.Even though outgoing Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche reaffirmed the company’s full-year outlook, the company’s shares were still down 0.3% on the news. That was lagging the local Dax index, which was broadly unchanged.The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was also flat, losing 0.12 points – less than 0.1% to 390.02. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.Daimler is facing a steep rise in investment obligations as it migrates to electric vehicles, along with its German peers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG). The three are all facing the prospect of fines from the European Commission for colluding to keep sub-optimal diesel engines on the road when they had better technology available to deploy.Renault has problems of a slightly different nature, most obviously in the enormous distraction created by the criminal charges against its long-time CEO Carlos Ghosn. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Friday that the French company is preparing to propose a merger with Nissan, its Japanese partner, hoping to restore a relationship that has been badly strained by the Ghosn affair.Renault's greater exposure to emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina has hurt it in recent months, and like its European rivals it has had to abandon hopes of making money in Iran in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to tighten sanctions on the country.Renault’s sales were down 5.6%, although it eked out a 2% gain in Europe, its most important market. As a result, its shares outperformed the local CAC 40 index, rising 1.7%.Europe’s other carmakers such as Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) have also reported weak first quarters."

Growth was 2.2% in the final quarter of 2018.Economists are more upbeat about the first quarter growth outlook after data last week showing that the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in February as Chinese imports plunged in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs.Another report showed that U.S. retail sales grew at their strongest pace in one-and-a-half years in March.One closely tracked gauge of quarterly GDP, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow forecast model, showed Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.8% annualized rate in the first quarter.A month ago, GDPNow estimated annualized growth of just 0.2%, which would have been the lowest since a one-off GDP contraction in the first 2014 quarter.2. Other economic reportsAhead of the GDP report, data on Thursday will look at durable goods orders for March, with the consensus forecast for a rebound of 0.7% after a 1.6% decline in February. Other U.S. data includes reports on homes sales on Monday and Tuesday and a look at consumer sentiment on Friday.Germany’s Ifo business confidence index, due on Wednesday, will be closely watched amid lingering concerns over the outlook for the euro area’s largest economy at a time when European Central Bank policymakers are debating whether stimulus measures are enough to spur inflation.3. Earnings kick into high gearU.S. first quarter earnings season ramps up after getting off to a mixed start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all reporting.Also on the docket are Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS),  Lockheed Martin  Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  United Tech  (NYSE:UTX), Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), AT&T (NYSE:T), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa (NYSE:V), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).In Europe, the auto sector will be in focus with a flurry of earnings due from  Michelin  (PA:MICP),  Continental  (LON:0LQ1), Daimler (LON:0NXX),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), and  Renault  (PA:RENA). These stocks are particularly sensitive to growth in China and will be watched as the stirrings of a recovery were felt in recent Chinese GDP data .4. Central banksCentral banks in Japan, Canada and Turkey are all to hold meetings this week.The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold at its meeting on Thursday and to forecast that it expects inflation to remain below its 2% target.The BOJ is facing a daunting task in its years-long efforts to help push up inflation toward its 2% goal, with a slowdown in global growth and trade making its task even more difficult.The Bank of Canada will meet on Wednesday, with no change in interest rates expected.Turkey’s central bank is to announce its latest rate decision on Thursday, and is also expected to keep rates on hold. The lira has recently come under pressure amid speculation that the central bank is borrowing to boost its foreign currency reserves.5. U.S.-Japan trade talksDonald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are due to meet in the White House on Friday for talks on U.S.-Japan trade and efforts to contain North Korea’s nuclear program.Last week U.S. and Japanese officials held a first round of talks toward a new trade deal Trump has sought and the U.S. side raised concerns over the “very large” trade deficit with Tokyo.Discussions on North Korea are likely to cover next steps after Trump’s failed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.-- Reuters contributed to this report"
11,"Apr 01, 2019 05:50AM ET","Autos lead rally in European shares on trade hopes, China data",nan,"By Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh(Reuters) - European shares were on course for their biggest daily gain in eight weeks on Monday, as a surprise recovery in China's factory data and signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks boosted investor sentiment on the first trading day of second quarter.Following the best quarterly performance in four years, the pan-European index climbed 0.9 percent at 0922 GMT, with all major sectors higher. While gains spread across all regional bourses, Germany's trade-sensitive DAX outperformed with its 1.3 percent rise, helped by 3 percent jump in auto stocks which were set for their best daily surge since Jan. 4. Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) rose about 3 percent while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles gained 1.6 percent on a report that the two companies are exploring a partnership to share investments to build cars in Europe.European chip stocks were another bright spot after better-than-expected results from Apple-supplier Foxconn Industrial. Shares in Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Infineon Technologies, Ams AG and Siltronic AG and STMicroelectronics N.V. rose between 3 percent and 5 percent.The upbeat mood spilled over from Asian markets, after both official and private surveys showed factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March.China's economic data comes on the heels of fresh concerns over a slowing world economy that resurfaced last month after the U.S. Federal Reserve abruptly ended its plans for policy tightening this year and signals from the bond market of an imminent recession.""The economic growth in China will strengthen from here and that is the strongest signal which is driving the markets today,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.In contrast, markets seemed to shrug off a survey that found factories in the euro zone had their worst month in March for almost six years. Another survey showed Germany's Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to an 80-month low reading of 44.1.""The German number is nothing short of a disaster. We are talking of recession territory over here and this is a huge concern for the European Central Bank. But for the markets today, the focus is on China and the optimism around it,"" Aslam said. Adding to the buoyant mood, China said over the weekend that it would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, the latest sign of optimism as the world's two largest economies work out a deal to end their trade dispute.Swiss logistics group Panalpina jumped 14 percent on bowing to an increased 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion) bid from Danish rival DSV, ending a more than two-month takeover battle designed to build scale in the consolidating transport sector.EasyJet slipped 7 percent, among the biggest decliners on the STOXX, after the British low-cost airline warned that demand and pricing were suffering from Brexit jitters and a weaker economic outlook.Ryanair Holdings also shed over 3 percent.London's FTSE 100 and the Dublin bourse, often seen as a barometer for Brexit sentiment, rose 0.7 percent each.Britain's exit from the European Union was in disarray after a third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce.Parliament will vote on different Brexit options on Monday and then May could try to bring her deal back to a vote in parliament one more time, possibly as early as Tuesday.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says the balance of risks around Brexit outcomes is tilted toward a softer, longer departure from the European Union, after a May's withdrawal agreement was rejected for a third time.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

12,"Mar 27, 2019 08:20AM ET",The Car Giants Are Getting Pretty Desperate,nan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In view of the bad feeling unleashed by Japan’s detention of Carlos Ghosn in November, one might have expected  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to keep things quiet for a while. Ghosn was head of the giant Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance and one theory for his downfall was that he was pushing too hard for a full combination of the French and Japanese companies.But now, according to the Financial Times, Renault SA hopes to restart those merger talks with Nissan Motor Co within 12 months and then launch a bid for another big carmaker, possibly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. This is surprising, to put it mildly. Seeking fresh discussions about a tie-up risks opening barely healed wounds in Tokyo.That Renault would even consider such a move suggests relations with Nissan have improved since Ghosn was ousted. But even more than that, it underscores the desperation of carmakers as they try to respond to the industry’s epochal challenge: The hugely expensive shift to electric and automated vehicles.The history of automotive M&A hasn’t been a happy one; Daimler’s takeover of Chrysler is but one of many failed marriages. So it’s remarkable how lively the carmaker courtship rumor mill has been lately.  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has reportedly approached Fiat; Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are trying to deepen a nascent partnership; and fierce rivals  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG are teaming up in autonomous driving and car sharing. Elsewhere, Jaguar Land Rover’s heavy losses might put it in play, Daimler may sell a stake in its loss-making Smart unit and the FT says Ghosn courted Fiat when he was still Renault boss.One word explains all this frantic positioning: Scale. The more electric cars a manufacturer can produce, the less burdensome the investments in new technology and plants. The same goes for software, which will become even more pivotal (and costly) once cars drive themselves.It’s in the interest of both Nissan and Renault, then, to maintain their 20-year old cost-sharing alliance. Unpicking it would be hugely expensive, especially now that key markets like China and the U.S. are slowing down.But a full-blown merger is something else entirely. Surely they have enough problems to manage without attempting that. The immediate priority is embedding a new governance system at Nissan and the alliance, to replace the dominance of Ghosn. His departure helps, but the French and Japanese sides still have a long way to go to restore trust.In fairness, the alliance now has a new boss, the understated Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, who brings a more placatory approach. Nissan may be open to renegotiating the alliance’s capital structure if Senard proves reliable, the FT reported, citing people close to the Japanese group.But this is almost certain to be a fraught endeavor, regardless of the personalities at the top. Unpicking a clearly unbalanced cross-shareholding structure (Renault holds 43 per cent of Nissan, whereas the more profitable Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault) is a delicate enough task in view of the French state’s stake in Renault. Trying to then agree merger terms that both parties consider fair would be harder still. If you take away its holding in Nissan, the stock market ascribes little value to Renault’s own carmaking operations.Meanwhile, these deliberations would be taking place at the same time as Ghosn’s trial, which will no doubt be a huge distraction for both companies in the coming months.And what of Fiat? Its U.S. trucks and SUV profits are attractive, but does the Renault-Nissan alliance (which includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp.) really need to get any bigger? It already sells more than 10 million cars a year. That’s on a par with industry giants Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp.If you think the politics of Nissan and Renault are thorny, just try to add Fiat Chrysler’s Italian and American mix. Another French carmaker, the less geographically diverse Peugeot, is more in need of an international dance partner like Fiat. France also owns a stake in Peugeot.There’s also the problem of job cuts at a time of rising populism. It only makes sense for automakers to consolidate if they’re willing to close excess capacity and share resources. Merge or not, the car industry will probably shed thousands of jobs over the next decade: Building an electric car is about 30 percent less labor intensive than a combustion engine model.As such, you can see why companies will consider even the most impossible-looking deals. That doesn’t mean they can be done."
13,"Mar 27, 2019 05:09AM ET",StockBeat: Markets Fall as Draghi's Magic Wears Thin,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Mario Draghi made his reputation by promising “to do whatever it takes” to save the euro. It says a lot for the faulty design of the euro zone that his language has barely changed even though he’s now well into the last year of his mandate.In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Draghi wrapped up by saying “the ECB will adopt all the monetary policy actions that are necessary and proportionate to achieve its objective.”If you look closely enough, the only material difference is that the question is no longer the immediate existential one of the euro’s survival, but rather the ECB’s inability to meet its mandated task of keeping prices stable (inflation has undershot the medium-term target consistently over the last decade). What has not changed is the need to beg the markets for trust.The appeal is starting to wear thin. When the ECB announced its latest attempts to prop up the economy with cheap long-term loans, markets slumped. This morning euro zone stock markets have turned lower, once again focusing on the implications of Draghi’s gloomy assessment of the economy rather than his promise to fix it.“We are now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand,” Draghi said, and markets listened. They appeared not to bother with the next sentence: “But a “soft patch"" does not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump.”By 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.12 points, less than 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, the French CAC 40 down 0.2% and the Spanish IBEX 35 down 0.1%.It’s not hard to see why: housing and consumer confidence data out of the U.S. on Tuesday were miserable. China reported overnight that profits at its largest industrial companies fell 14% on the year in the first two months of 2019. Italian business and consumer confidence surveys, released this morning, have both fallen in March, and by more than expected.Away from monetary policy, the biggest noise in the market this morning is from the auto sector, where  Renault  (PA:RENA) is up more than 3% after a Financial Times report saying that it wants to acquire Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) once it has completed a relaunched merger with Nissan (OTC:NSANY) that was put on ice by CEO Carlos Ghosn’s tax troubles.The more important element of the story is arguably not so much Renault’s desire, but the tantalising suggestion that Fiat could be the subject of a takeover battle, given that  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has also reportedly approached it. Merger optimism needs to be weighed against the likelihood of any Italian government approving such a deal, however."

15,"Mar 25, 2019 04:54AM ET",StockBeat: Stronger Ifo Report Can't Stop Markets Sliding,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Confidence is a relative concept.Weak business surveys out of Europe triggered the global rout in stock markets on Friday, and the wave of negativity was still going strong after completing its circuit around the world on Monday morning until German research institute Ifo announced its business climate report for March.The closely-watched index rose by more than expected to 99.6 from last month's four-year low, with both the current conditions and expectations sub-indexes beating expectations. That caused a sharp, but apparently only brief, reversal across the region's markets.By 05:15 AM ET (09:15 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 2.28 points, or 0.6% at 373.74, while Germany's Dax was down 0.1% and France's CAC 40 was down 0.5%.Concerns about a U.S. recession are starting to build after short-term dollar interest rates rose above 10-year bond yields during Friday’s sell-off. While that is often cited as a reliable indicator of a coming recession, plenty of financial professionals take it with a large pinch of salt.Among the few stocks bucking the negative trend before the Ifo release was Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), which was reported by The Wall Street Journal as being the subject of a takeover approach from France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP). The Italian company reportedly rejected the approach. Peugeot, which has rapidly turned around General Motors (NYSE:GM)' struggling European brands, indicated earlier this year it wants to break into the U.S. market.The one domestic story capable of generating positive news to stop the trend – Brexit – signally failed to generate anything of the kind over the weekend.A mass demonstration in London on Saturday appears unlikely to achieve its goal of a second referendum, given that the current government is resolutely opposed to one. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting with her cabinet Monday morning in London, against a backdrop of reports that they will pressure her to step down. May wrote to lawmakers at the weekend that she would only bring her twice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement back for a third vote if it commanded enough support, which senior Conservative party figures said isn't the case.The FTSE 100 was down 0.3%."

21,"Feb 26, 2019 03:29AM ET",MarketPulse Europe: Peugeot Heads Back to the U.S. ,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) is heading back to the U.S. after a gap of nearly 30 years - and the market doesn't like it.Shares in the French carmaker are down 4.0% and are at the bottom of both the CAC 40 index in France and the Euro Stoxx 50, lagging a market which is correcting downwards after hitting its highest level in nearly five months on Monday. At 04.00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Stoxx 600 index was down 0.3% at 371.14.The market is worried that the group, which has gone from strength to strength under chief executive Carlos Tavares, is biting off more than it can chew. Launch costs will be high, competition fierce, the current business cycle in the U.S. is old and nobody really knows what vehicles will be wanted in tomorrow's 'mobility' market. And it's not the only launch Peugeot is planning: It also wants to break into the Indian market with its Citroen brand, and build out newly-acquired Opel in Russia.But the company needs to diversify outside of Europe, where it sells more than 75% of its vehicles. The acquisition of GM's European operations has reinforced that geographical concentration - even if it has immediately restored profits to brands that had lost money constantly for 20 years. It expects the European market to stagnate.On the other side of the channel, U.K. stocks are among the worst performers this morning, partly as a result of the Brexit paradox: news of a possible delay to Brexit has launched sterling higher, which depresses the accounting value of all the dollars that FTSE-listed miners, oil companies and drinks makers generate. The FTSE 100 is down 0.8%, and it's conspicuous that the better performers are those exposed less to global markets, such as retailers  Next  (LON:NXT)and Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS).Elsewhere, Germany's Dax and Italy's FTSE MIB are both down 0.3%."

That’s the highest weekly outflow since the summer of 2016 – and once again it’s Brexit that is the main cause of the selling.For the last two years, markets have been able to ignore the possibility of a disorderly Brexit disrupting the European economy, but it’s increasingly hard to ignore, with Prime Minister Theresa May still unable to get her withdrawal plan through parliament with less than 50 days to go till March 29.The auto sector is particularly exposed to Brexit issues, given the deep cross-border integration in supply chains and the value of the U.K. market. But Brexit isn’t the only problem it faces – tighter emissions standards in Europe and slower demand in China aren’t helping either.New data out Friday showed new car registrations in Europe were down 4.6% on the year in January, suggesting that the industry is only slowly getting over the problems it had with new testing standards last year.

Sectors reliant on trade and exports to China, such as tech, industrials, basic resources, and autos, were the top gainers on Tuesday though they pared gains fast after the open.Some investors were doubtful this stimulus would have much impact on European exporters.""To give a real boost to European exporters, we would need more than just an announcement on tax cuts, we would need commitments to infrastructure investment (from China),"" said Martin Moeller, co-head of Swiss and global equity portfolio management at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva.The autos sector (SXAP) jumped to its highest since Dec. 5 on the stimulus news and after a strong update from  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) soothed investors' concerns about carmakers facing slowing demand in China.Shares in the French carmaker climbed to their highest since mid-November after reporting record sales for 2018.

28,"Jan 10, 2019 12:28PM ET","Ford, Jaguar slash thousands of jobs across Europe",nan,"By Edward Taylor and Costas PitasFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ford (N:F) and Jaguar Land Rover unveiled sweeping job cuts across Europe on Thursday as carmakers struggle with a slump in demand for diesel vehicles, tougher emissions rules and a global economic slowdown led by China.Tata-owned JLR , based in central England, said it will cut 4,500 out of 42,500 jobs, while Ford (N:F) said it will slash ""thousands"" of jobs as part of an overhaul that could result in plant closures and the discontinuation of some models.A trade war between China and the United States combined with Britain's pending exit from the European Union has fragmented once global markets, forcing carmakers to reassess the profitability of individual models and locations.In recent quarters, JLR and Ford's profits have lagged behind those of peers BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Peugeot , ramping up investor pressure on managers to stem losses. ""We are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,"" Steven Armstrong, group vice president, Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in a statement on Thursday.Ford Europe, which employs 53,000 people, has been losing money for years and pressure to restructure its operations has increased since arch-rival General Motors (M:G) raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France's Peugeot SAC (PA:PEUP).JLR said demand in China, once one of its strongest countries, fell by 21.6 percent in 2018, the biggest drop of any of its markets. ""The economic slowdown in China along with ongoing trade tensions is continuing to influence consumer confidence,"" said Jaguar Land Rover Chief Commercial Officer Felix Brautigam.The job cuts come as Ford and JLR have been hit by a fall in demand for diesel-engined cars and after European policymakers last month agreed stricter pollution limits, forcing carmakers to accelerate investments to make electric cars.""We believe Ford Europe could require as much as a 20 to 30 percent reduction of capacity and headcount,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Thursday.Ford said it will seek to exit the family vans or MPV segment, review its operations in Russia, and combine the headquarters of Ford U.K. and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex to achieve a 6 percent operating margin in Europe.""We want to be a net contributor of capital and not a net detractor,"" Armstrong told journalists on a later call, referring to Europe's financial contribution to U.S. parent Ford Motor (N:F).Ford Europe reported a 245 million euro ($282 million) loss before interest and taxes in the third quarter, equivalent to a negative 3.3 percent EBIT margin.JAGUAR CUTSJaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata Motors and employs around 40,000 people in Britain, on Thursday reported a 4.6 percent drop in full-year sales to just under 600,000 vehicles. It lost 354 million pounds between April and September 2018.Automakers have been hit by a regulatory clampdown on diesel emissions ever since Volkswagen admitted to systematic cheating in 2015, leading regulators to discover massive discrepancies between real-world and theoretical pollution levels.Diesel accounts for 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's British sales and 45 percent of global demand, the company said last year, as demand tumbles following new levies in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal. Ford's Armstrong said pressure to build electric and hybrid cars had forced the carmaker to make choices about where to allocate its capital. ""In smaller vehicles the diesel decline is accelerating. It is unlikely that we will further develop small diesel engines for smaller passenger cars,"" Armstrong said. BREXIT Armstrong said any Ford layoffs and plant closures would be subject to negotiations with labor representatives, and such plans did not account for the possibility of a 'hard' exit by Britain from the European Union.""If Brexit went in the wrong direction we would have to have another look, to mitigate that,"" Armstrong said. A Ford spokesman said the carmaker currently assumes that any Brexit deal would keep tariff-free trade between Britain and Europe.Jaguar Land Rover Chief Executive Ralf Speth said he had serious concerns about the impact of a hard Brexit but it was not possible to predict what steps might be required if that happens.""I don't want to make at the moment any statement about Brexit and/or the closure of the plant or further implications out of it not knowing the results from politics. We have to know first what is going on.""Fellow carmakers Mini, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and Honda have said they would temporarily close plants in April after Brexit to avoid any disruption.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Dec 03, 2018 01:25PM ET","'Yellow vest' protesters knock wind out of French business, economy",nan,"By Inti Landauro and Myriam RivetPARIS (Reuters) - Three weeks of ""yellow vest"" protests have hit the French economy hard, with trade in shops, hotels and restaurants falling significantly, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday.Speaking after a meeting with industry groups and business federations affected by the protest movement, Le Maire said sector revenues had been hit by between 15 and 50 percent.While not providing a precise breakdown, Le Maire said small retailers had seen a fall in revenue of between 20 and 40 percent, and the hotel industry was seeing reservations down 15 to 25 percent.Restaurants, depending on their location, had seen takings collapse by between 20 and 50 percent.""The impact is severe and ongoing,"" Le Maire said, emphasizing it was nationwide, although Paris, after riots and looting in some of its most upmarket districts on Saturday afternoon and evening, was particularly affected.The movement began on Nov. 17 as a social-media-planned protest against fuel-tax rises, but has since morphed into an anti-Macron uprising.The ministry was not able to say what sort of impact the unrest would have on gross domestic product, but having hoped for a pick-up in the fourth quarter on the back of rising consumer spending, that now appears less likely.Holiday season shopping has started poorly, according to industry group Federation du Commerce et de la Distribution, which expects a slump in hirings and a transfer of shopping to e-commerce, mainly on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a spokeswoman said.Amazon was not immediately available to comment but CDiscount, the e-commerce arm of retailer Casino, attributed the record number of visits to its websites partly to ""demonstrations or blockades organized outside some shops"".Market data aggregator Nielsen said on Monday retail sales had contracted during three days of nationwide protest since Nov. 17, and had struggled to recover in between. It said supermarket sales had plunged 35 percent on day one on Nov. 17 and 18 percent on day two, Nov. 24.Last week, sales were down six to 13 percent Monday through Wednesday, picked up slightly on Thursday and Friday, but then fell eight percent again on the third day of nationwide protests on Saturday, it said. During Saturday's disturbances in Paris, tourists were left shocked, with some saying they would cut short their visit.MANY SECTORS AFFECTEDWhen they started, the ""yellow vests"" protests were focused on denouncing a squeeze on household spending brought about by President Emmanuel Macron's taxes on diesel, which he says are necessary to combat climate change and protect the environment.But for the past two weekends there have also been violent demonstrations and clashes with security forces in Paris and other major cities, with protesters calling for Macron to resign. Some call it a revolution against a president who they see as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.Saturday's protests in Paris turned particularly violent, with protesters from the far-right and far-left mixing with the ""yellow vests"" and intent on causing as much damage as possible.The Arc de Triomphe was defaced and avenues off Paris's Champs Elysees were the scene of mass-vandalism.Shops on the Champs Elysees and in the heart of Paris, including the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and Dior and Chanel boutiques, had their windows smashed. Some others were looted. Prestigious Parisian department stores Printemps and Galeries Lafayette protectively shut their doors on Saturday afternoon.Luxury groups such as SMCP, Hermes and LVMH, which are heavily dependent on foreign tourists visiting Paris during the Christmas season are likely to suffer, said Berenberg analysts in a report.The effect may extend through the holiday season.Hotel industry group UMIH said some Paris hotels were seeing cancellation rates of 20 percent to 50 percent and reservations down 10 percent to 15 percent.""We have received calls from many worried customers and we have reassured them,"" said Carlos Conesa, head concierge at the five-star Napoleon Hotel. ""During the protests, the hotel didn't suffer any damage and most of our guests decided to stay inside and had dinner in our restaurants.""While the violence in downtown Paris stunned the country, waves of protests have also targeted road infrastructure, with a another potential impact on the economy.Vinci Autoroute, France's largest toll-road operator, has seen dozens of road blockades and forced openings of barriers since the protests erupted two weeks ago. Protesters have also damaged infrastructure, a spokesman said.French oil major Total has said 75 of its 2,200 petrol stations have run dry as ""yellow vests"" blockade fuel depots. Car manufacturer  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) said production at a plant in eastern France was disrupted for half a day. It takes almost two weeks to recover disrupted output, it said.Le Maire said both Peugeot and rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) had lost vehicle orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"Nov 26, 2018 11:05AM ET","Fiat Chrysler aims to boost margins, keep jobs with European production plan",nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Stefano RebaudoMILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is expected to commit to producing a raft of new models in Italy, including Jeeps and an Alfa Romeo SUV, union sources said, as the carmaker strives to fill underutilized plants and lift profit margins in Europe.The plans, which the sources said would also include building a new Maserati sportscar in Italy, would deliver on the strategy outlined by the group's late boss Sergio Marchionne.New European chief Pietro Gorlier will meet with unions on Thursday to discuss the proposals and present them to journalists later that day. FCA declined to comment. FCA appointed Gorlier last month to tackle a region where profitability is below that of peers, thousands of workers are on temporary layoff schemes, and some plants run below capacity.In his last strategy unveiled in June, Marchionne vowed to keep converting Italian plants to churn out Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis instead of less profitable mass-market vehicles in an attempt to preserve jobs and boost margins.FCA's Melfi plant in southern Italy, which already produces the Jeep Renegade, is expected to also produce the Jeep Compass, the sources said. The Compass will replace the Fiat Punto, which was discontinued in August. The Pomigliano factory near Naples is set to keep the Fiat Panda, the most sold vehicle in Italy, the people added, dismissing earlier reports the model could return to FCA's plant in Poland, where it was made until 2011. Pomigliano will also get the new Baby Jeep, smaller than the Renegade, which will be another model targeting European clients.Unions have been awaiting news of product plans to see whether workers, some of whom have been on temporary layoff schemes for years, would be brought back,Marchionne initially promised to fill all European plants by the end of 2018, but in June said that goal would likely slip to the end of the current strategy plan in 2022. The Fiat brand will be reduced to a few models such as the iconic 500 and the popular Panda hatchback. The 500 family in particular will become a big part of the company's electric vehicle drive in Europe.The Mirafiori plant in Fiat's hometown of Turin may be chosen to assemble the new electric Fiat 500, the sources said, but added the plans were not yet final, especially as the combustion engine version is currently made in Poland.Mirafiori may also be used to revive the Fiat 500 Giardiniera wagon, they added.Mirafiori already produces the Maserati Levante, but sales of the luxury SUV fell sharply in recent months due to weak Chinese demand. The Levante platform may also be used to produce a new SUV for the Alfa Romeo brand, bigger than the Stelvio SUV that was launched in 2016, the people said. Maserati's sporty Alfieri model will likely be made in the brand's hometown of Modena, the sources added. The world's seventh-largest carmaker in June outlined a global plan to ramp up production of SUVs and invest 9 billion euros ($10.2 billion) - out of a total spending plan of around 45 billion euros - in electric and hybrid cars in an effort to double operating profit by 2022.FCA's operating margin in Europe recovered to 3.2 percent last year, which compares with Europe-focused PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) global automotive margin of 7.3 percent.

40,"Nov 23, 2018 10:22AM ET",Peugeot's UK Vauxhall to cut more jobs at Ellesmere Port car plant,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Vauxhall, which is owned by  Peugeot  parent company PSA (PA:PEUP), is to shed an extra 241 jobs from its Ellesmere Port car plant in the latest cuts at the site, deepening union concerns over the future of the factory. The firm said in October last year it would cut roughly 400 out of the then 1,900 people at the location, and then announced a further 250 jobs losses in January as Peugeot restructured the loss-making sites it bought from General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2017.Vauxhall builds the Astra Sports Tourer family estate model at Ellesmere Port and the brand has seen its sales fall 11 percent so far this year, faster than the overall decline of 7 percent in Europe's second-biggest autos market. ""The restructuring is necessary to make it a competitive plant when compared to the benchmark,"" Vauxhall said in a statement.The firm said the announcement was not related to Britain's imminent departure from the European Union. PSA boss Carlos Tavares said earlier this year that the French carmaker will decide in 2020 on whether to make fresh investment to keep the plant in northwest England open.Britain's biggest trade union Unite said it was seeking urgent assurances over the future of the site. ""Unite will not tolerate the death by a thousand cuts of Ellesmere Port and will leave no stone unturned in securing the future of the plant and its skilled workforce,"" said Unite regional coordinating officer Mick Chalmers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The broader European auto sector index (SXAP) was up around 0.2% in midday trade.French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) tacked on 0.7% in Paris.In Germany, BMW AG (DE:BMWG),  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were all in positive territory, trading higher by 1.4%, 1.1% and 0.9% respectively.Italian automakers were also higher, with  Fiat  NV (MI:FCHA) and  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE) gaining 0.6% and 0.5%."
42,"Nov 19, 2018 05:55AM ET",Iranian jobs go as U.S. sanctions start to bite,nan,"By Bozorgmehr SharafedinLONDON (Reuters) - Tamnoush, an Iranian company that makes fizzy drinks, has shut down its production line after 16 years and laid off dozens of workers. It was facing massive losses as U.S. sanctions pushed up the price of imported raw materials.""All our 45 workers are jobless now. The men are driving taxis and women are back to being housewives,"" said CEO Farzad Rashidi.Reuters interviews with dozens of business owners across Iran show hundreds of companies have suspended production and thousands of workers are being laid off because of a hostile business climate mainly caused by new U.S. sanctions.The Iranian rial has fallen to record lows and economic activity has slowed dramatically since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the big powers' nuclear deal with Tehran in May.He imposed sanctions directed at purchases of U.S. dollars, gold trading, and the automotive industry in August. Iran's vital oil and banking sectors were hit in November.""We have lost around five billion rials ($120,000 at the official rate) in the last few months, so the board decided to suspend all activities for as long as the fluctuations in the currency market continue. It is stupid to keep driving when you see it's a dead end,"" Rashidi said.The country has already experienced unrest this year, when young protesters angered by unemployment and high prices clashed with security forces. Official projections indicate unrest could flare up again as sanctions make the economic crisis worse.Four days before parliament fired him August for failing to do enough to protect the jobs market from sanctions, labor minister Ali Rabiei said Iran would lose a million jobs by the end of year as a direct result of the U.S. measures. Unemployment is already running at 12.1 percent, with three million Iranians unable to find jobs.A parliamentary report in September warned that rising unemployment could threaten the stability of the Islamic Republic.""If we believe that the country's economic situation was the main driver for the recent protests, and that an inflation rate of 10 percent and an unemployment rate of 12 percent caused the protests, we cannot imagine the intensity of reactions caused by the sharp rise of inflation rate and unemployment.""The report said if Iran's economic growth remains below 5 percent in coming years, unemployment could hit 26 percent.The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran’s economy will contract by 1.5 percent this year and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to dwindling oil revenues.PRODUCERS STRUGGLING Iran's vice president has warned that under sanctions Iran faces two main dangers: unemployment and a reduction in purchasing power.""Job creation should be the top priority ... We should not allow productive firms to fall into stagnation because of sanctions,"" Eshaq Jahangiri said, according to state media.But business owners told Reuters that the government's sometimes contradictory monetary policies, alongside fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, price increases for raw materials, and high interest loans from banks have made it impossible for them to stay in business. Many have not been able to pay wages for months or had to shed significant numbers of workers.A manager at the Jolfakaran Aras Company, one of the biggest textile factories in Iran, told Reuters that the firm was considering halting its operations and hundreds of workers might lose their jobs.""Around 200 workers were laid off in August, and the situation has become worse since. There is a high possibility that the factory will shut down,"" the manager said, asking not to be named.Ahmad Roosta, CEO of Takplast Nour, was hopeful that a drought in Iran would provide a boost for his newly launched factory, which produces plastic pipes used in agriculture.""I will wait one or two months, but I will have to shut down if the situation remains the same ... The farmers, who are the main consumers of our products, cannot afford them,"" Roosta told Reuters.The sanctions have affected the Iranian car industry, which had experienced a boom after sanctions were lifted two years ago and it signed big contracts with French and German firms.French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) suspended its joint venture in Iran in June to avoid U.S. sanctions, and German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business.Maziar Beiglou, a board member of the Iran Auto Parts Makers Association, said in August that more than 300 auto parts makers have been forced to stop production, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in the sector.A spokesperson for Iran's Tire Producers Association blamed the government's ""changing monetary policies over the last six months"" for problems in the sector.""Fortunately tire factories have not slowed down, but the production growth that we had planned for was not achieved,” Mostafa Tanha said in a phone interview from Tehran.YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENTWashington says economic pressures on Tehran are directed at the government and its malign proxies in the region, not at the Iranian people. But Iran's young people, bearing the brunt of unemployment, stand to lose the most. Maryam, a public relations manager in a food import company, lost her job last month. ""The prices went so high that we lost many customers ... In the end the CEO decided to lay off people and started with our department.""She said the company had stopped importing, and people who still worked there were worried that it might shut down after selling off its inventory.Youth unemployment is already 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30. The unemployment rate among young people with higher education in some parts of the country is above 50 percent, according to official data. Armin, 29, has a mechanical engineering degree but lost his job in the housebuilding industry when the sector was hit by recession following the fall of rial.""The property market is slowing because high prices have made houses unaffordable ... It is getting worse day by day,"" he told Reuters from the city of Rasht in northern Iran. Nima, a legal adviser for startups and computer firms, believes sanctions have already affected many companies in the sector that depended on an export-oriented model and hoped to expand in the region. He said even the gaming industry in Iran has felt the sanctions pinch: ""The situation has become so severe that many of these teams decided to suspend development of their games and are waiting to see what will happen next. Without access to international markets, they see very little chance of making a profit."" Saeed Laylaz, a Tehran-based economist, was more sanguine. He said youth unemployment was a product of Iran's demographics and government policies, and sanctions were only adding to an existing problem.""The sanctions, the uncertainty in the market and Rouhani's zigzag policies have put pressures on the economy and the job market, but I predict that the market will find a balance soon,"" Laylaz told Reuters. ""We will defeat this round of sanctions as we have done in the past,"" said Laylaz who met Rouhani last month with other economists to offer advice on economic policies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

50,"Oct 12, 2018 06:31AM ET",China auto sales post biggest drop in 7 years as growth engine stalls,nan,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - China's car sales fell the most in nearly seven years in September, stoking concerns the world's biggest auto market could contract for the first time in decades this year amid cooling economic growth and a biting trade war.Vehicle sales slumped by 11.6 percent to 2.39 million units last month, the third straight decline, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday. It cited a sluggish economy, deleveraging and a tough pollution crackdown as reasons for the steep fall.A stalling of China's giant auto sector will be a concern for the country's leaders in Beijing. It is a major driver of the economy and an important barometer of Chinese consumers' willingness to open their purse strings.""The automotive industry has been a driver of China's economic growth for years. Now it is pulling back,"" Xu Haidong, CAAM assistant secretary general, said at a briefing in Beijing.China's top auto industry body said its already meager forecast for full-year growth would be missed, though the market should avoid a sales decline. Analysts have predicted the market could contract this year for the first time since at least the early 1990s.The downtrend in sales underscores how international car makers, from General Motors (N:GM) to Toyota Motor (T:7203), are in for a tough ride at a time when they are increasingly looking towards China as a driver of growth.It also exemplifies the impact of the trade war, with autos being among the sectors hardest hit by tariffs. CAAM said last month sales were impacted by a sluggish economy and the knock-on effects of the trade war.China's economic malaise has seen the domestic stock markets plunge and the country's factory sector stall last month after over a year of expansion. The International Monetary Fund also cut China's growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent.Beijing, concerned about the slowdown, has already opened the taps to boost liquidity in the market.The slide in September auto sales follows a 3.8 percent fall in August and a 4.0 percent drop in July. Vehicle sales increased 4.8 percent in June.September's drop was the most since a 26.4 percent tumble in January 2012, which was in part due to the timing of the China New Year holiday that year.Sales for the first nine months of the year totaled 20.49 million vehicles, up 1.5 percent from the same period a year earlier.CAAM's Xu said that 2018 sales growth would miss the association's previous forecast of a 3 percent rise. Sales were also up 3 percent last year, but sharply down from a 13.7 percent gain in 2016.Amid the slowdown, an army of Chinese car dealers is feeling the squeeze and is pushing for government support to revitalize growth.Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said that if sales actually shrink this year it would be a ""watershed moment"" for the industry.""It's very alarming and is even causing panic among some automakers and suppliers. That's because the market has been growing non-stop every year for more than twenty years, and those companies make plans based on growth,"" he said.""They don't know what to do and worry about survival.""WINNERS AND LOSERSGM, one of the most successful global car makers in China for decades, said earlier this month that September sales were down a sharp 14.9 percent from a year earlier. German car maker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said earlier this week that China sales were down 10.5 percent last month. Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which has been struggling to turn around falling sales in the market, said on Friday that September sales in China were down 43 percent.China's broader economic woes have led to a particular slowdown in the demand for cars in smaller, lower-tier cities across China, some car makers have said, which until now were the engine of growth for the country's auto industry.Zhang of Automotive Foresight said that several factors had combined to cause this, including high gas prices this year which had stymied growth in lower-tier cities.The industry is also facing a shake-up as decades-old rules change to allow foreign car makers to own majority stakes in local joint ventures. Luxury German car maker BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Thursday it would take control of its main China venture in a $4.2 billion deal.The changing auto landscape is throwing up distinct winners and losers in the market, a major shift from the golden years of growth where most players were guaranteed decent returns.Among those struggling in China the most are  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and its sister brand Kia Motors (KS:000270), Ford and Japanese car maker Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267).Sales of new-energy vehicles – a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles – remained strong, up 54.8 percent in September, slightly faster than a month earlier.That took new-energy vehicle sales in the first nine months of this year to 721,000 vehicles, up 81.1 percent from the same period a year earlier."

53,"Oct 02, 2018 08:03AM ET",Carmakers step up warnings over disorderly Brexit,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Carmakers ratcheted up their Brexit warnings on Tuesday, with France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) both saying UK production would suffer if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.With less than six months before Britain is due to quit the EU on March 29, businesses are increasingly alarmed about the lack of agreement over future trading relations and the possibility of tariffs, delays at ports and extra red tape.The car industry, one of the few British manufacturing success stories of recent decades, is particularly at risk given the thousands of parts, engines and finished models that move between Britain and the continent every day.BMW boss Harald Krueger told the Paris Motor Show that he sees a ""50:50 chance"" of a disorderly, or 'hard', Brexit and that this would lead the company to shift more production of its Mini vehicles - currently focused on its Oxford plant in southern England - to the Netherlands.""I told (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May and the European Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We will no longer fulfill trade agreements and then we are forced to build the car in the Netherlands,"" Krueger told journalists.Carlos Tavares, the head of  Peugeot  and Opel maker PSA Group, which has two factories in Britain, also said a no-deal Brexit would be damaging.""My plan is to tell Mrs May and Mr Barnier (the EU's chief Brexit negotiator) that a no-deal (Brexit) is not acceptable,"" he told reporters.Such an outcome would have ""significant consequences"", he added without elaborating.Dieter Zetsche, head of German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), also told the Paris event that scenarios involving a disorderly Brexit were ""highly worrying"".The executives' comments come as the British prime minister said she was preparing to make a new offer to the EU in an effort to break the Brexit talks deadlock.The various Brexit complications come against the backdrop of a range of challenges facing automakers, including the rollout of costly electric vehicles, tougher emissions rules and potential disruption to trade from the rise of protectionism.Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which warned last month that the wrong kind of Brexit could cost tens of thousands of car jobs, told Reuters it had not made a decision whether to build electric cars in its home market because of uncertainty over future trading relations.Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance that has a large assembly plant in northeast England, also complained about the lack of clarity.""We are in a situation where everybody is frozen,"" he said.Graphic: Carmakers vs US equity benchmark - https://reut.rs/2OzRJ7v"
54,"Oct 02, 2018 07:36AM ET",German diesel deal runs into opposition from carmakers,nan,"By Holger HansenBERLIN (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in polluted German cities should be able to choose between trade-in incentives and a hardware upgrade for their vehicles, German coalition parties agreed but the car industry swiftly raised objections.After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of Tuesday that they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the worst affected cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans.In their initial responses, manufacturers appeared to favor encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles rather than carry out costly adjustments known as retrofits.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) had agreed to help with hardware retrofits but some details still need to be discussed while BMW (DE:BMWG) has refused such retrofits, German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said on Tuesday. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes cars, has said it could consider hardware retrofits but would concentrate on trade-in incentives of up to 5,000 euros ($5,755), Scheuer told a news conference.""We are talking about a significant billion (euro) contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,"" said Scheuer.Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.""We are creating the framework to avoid driving bans but we expect the car industry to offer possible retrofits and trade-ins,"" German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said.""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest in restoring the image of diesel.""""END OF ERA""Environmental group Greenpeace said the German government had failed to provide a solution for the diesel crisis and accused the industry of exploiting the situation.""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it said.The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6.France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said earlier on Tuesday it was offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight.""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4 standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5 million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from the German KBA transport authority.Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather than a trade-in.PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel unit rejected hardware retrofits, arguing they were economically not sensible and the technology not fully developed.The German courts have paved the way for city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed European safety levels.The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is due to take effect next February.($1 = 0.8684 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

56,"Oct 01, 2018 12:51PM ET",Electric cars cast growing shadow on profits,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers. Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.""What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of  Peugeot , Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (DE:BMWG), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.""Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.PRICED TO PUSHAfter declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.""Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.Volkswagen and Mercedes parent  Daimler , which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.COST GAPElectric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.Mass-market electrics such as the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe and Nissan (T:7201) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (O:TSLA) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify investment at all - it's all regulation.""Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot even though the market doesn't exist.""SCALE EFFECTSCarmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,"" Salvat said.German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""($1 = 0.7675 pounds) Shortfall of planned European battery supply for electric vehicles (EV) https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOXGlobal electric-battery vehicle sales. https://tmsnrt.rs/2oDPjG4^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

58,"Oct 01, 2018 10:00AM ET",Three new cars in Paris tell the story of an industry in flux,nan,"By Joseph WhitePARIS (Reuters) - Three new vehicles debuting at the Paris car show this week will show investors and consumers the challenges facing the global auto industry as it grapples with the biggest technological changes in a century.A new BMW 3-series sedan, the latest in a line of cars that defined the concept of a premium sports sedan, will aim to reinvigorate a range that has ceded ground to SUVs and electric drives, while the Mercedes GLE marks an attempt to take an SUV to a new level, with some autonomous driving features. And the  Peugeot  e-Legend concept stands for what automakers need to do next, and fast: design electrified vehicles that are both appealing and profitable.The new generation BMW (DE:BMWG) 3-series sedan will immediately fight for attention with a different car bearing the ""3"" designation - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) electric Model 3. Tesla's Model 3 is now out-selling the BMW model in the United States, although the BMW 3 remains the bigger seller by far worldwide. Tesla's all-electric car challenges BMW and other traditional premium brands for technological leadership with software that can be constantly upgraded to improve the car's performance and driver experience, and to add features.The new BMW 3-series will also fight for attention in Paris - as in the marketplace - with the worldwide shift to SUVs. That phenomenon will be represented by the new generation of the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) GLE sport utility, among other models.CONFLICTED RESPONSEThe new GLE, which goes on sale next year, will come with a new, 48-volt electronic suspension system that can vary the shock absorbing function at each wheel, individually. Inside the cabin, drivers and passengers can view information on two 12.3- inch screens. The GLE also takes another step toward automating the process of driving, with a system that can steer and vary the speed of the car within a marked lane up to 37 miles per hour. The GLE can effectively pilot itself in rush hour traffic jams.Mercedes will offer in the GLE a 48-volt electrical system that gives the vehicle an electric boost away from stops. That offers a modest reduction in fuel consumption at a time when regulators worldwide want automakers to eliminate their oil-burning, internal combustion technology and go all-electric. The GLE highlights the auto industry's conflicted response to the regulatory and consumer pressure to dump diesel technology and accelerate the shift to all-electric vehicles. Petroleum-fueled SUVs such as the Mercedes GLE generate the bulk of profits for global automakers. All-electric Tesla gets praise for its innovation, but is scrambling to show a profit in the third quarter after a tumultuous year.FANTASY CARThe challenge for established automakers is to design electric cars compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay a profitable premium to own them.Legacy automakers have tended to produce electric cars that are drab, small or strange. PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Peugeot e-Legend concept aims to break that pattern with a battery-powered homage to the 1968 Peugeot 504 that looks like it could have starred in a late 1960s French New Wave movie.While not destined for production, the e-Legend does reflect a dilemma facing automakers like PSA - and its track-racing boss Carlos Tavares - over how to reconcile connected, autonomous cars with more traditional product traits such as driving pleasure, where their expertise really lies.While the Peugeot fantasy car is self-driving, it can also be driven manually, or flipped into a ""sharp"" autonomous mode that accelerates and steers more aggressively - because, as the company said in promoting the concept, ""boredom is not part of our DNA"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Sep 21, 2018 06:50AM ET",Carmakers on the Trade-War Front Line as Europe Factories Suffer,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s factories saw export growth stagnate this month as the economy feels the pinch from the global trade war that’s continuing to ratchet up.The auto industry -- targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump -- is taking the brunt of the slowdown in demand, according to IHS Markit’s latest monthly survey. Overall manufacturing in the euro area grew the slowest pace in two years in September and new export orders failed to rise for the first time since 2013.Markit’s comments echoes concerns voiced by European car manufacturers, who are particularly vulnerable to sustaining collateral damage in the trade-war salvos between the U.S. and China. But there are broader effects, with the OECD saying this week that global growth may have hit a plateau.That warning came the same week that the U.S.-China trade war deepened, with Beijing saying it will retaliate against President Donald Trump’s order for more tariffs on imports from the Asian nation.Trade tensions are “a real and true concern for our business because we’re always thinking of long-term cycles,”  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) CEO for trucks Martin Daum said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “We depend on long-term stability.”Automakers are Europe’s worst performing sector over the past six months, down more than 10 percent, versus a 2 percent gain for the Stoxx 600 Index.In China, car sales dropped for a third straight month in August, as slowing economic growth are threatening to end the vehicle market’s almost three-decade expansion.“The problem in China is the sentiment,” Klaus Rosenfeld, chief executive officer at a German industrial and autoparts supplier Schaeffler Group, said Thursday. “There is negative sentiment, and I think the trade war, the tariff discussion fuels this.”Trade tensions are hanging over the whole industry, from trucks to luxury sports vehicles, with  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE) CEO Louis Camilleri telling analysts on an earnings call this week that he hopes that “rationality would prevail,” because a “tariff war between Europe and U.S. would be quite dramatic.”And weaker demand for cars will have a fallout on other manufacturers. In Markit’s survey for France -- home to  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) -- it said “anecdotal evidence suggested that many manufacturers saw a reduction in demand from the automotive sector.”In September, the weakness in the euro-area PMI was all due to manufacturing, with the measure for services rising to a three-month high. Markit said the combined index points to a quarterly expansion of about 0.5 percent.But, according to Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson, weaker readings for backlogs and exports means “the risks to future growth appear tilted to the downside.” There’s also the turmoil in emerging markets, which is affecting sentiment more broadly.“While the U.S.-EU dispute has been contained, uncertainty stemming from the global unrest continues to weigh on European manufacturers,” said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING. “Large emerging trade partners are struggling with depreciated currencies, limiting European export potential.”"

66,"Sep 05, 2018 07:01AM ET","PSA's Opel to shift 2,000 R&D jobs in Germany to French engineer Segula",nan,"By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel unit said it is working on plans to protect 2,000 research jobs in Ruesselsheim, Germany by transfering them to a new company run by French firm Segula Technologies.Research and development work in Ruesselsheim has dropped since French carmaker PSA's purchase of the Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors (NYSE:GM) for $2.6 billion last year.Ruesselsheim was once a global engineering hub for developing small and medium sized vehicles for various brands including Opel, Vauxhall and Buick and R&D work for GM accounted for 50 percent of the center's workload. ""The Segula Technologies proposal aims at creating a European engineering campus and Center of Excellence in Ruesselsheim enlarging the scope beyond the automotive industry and including fields such as rail and energy,"" PSA's Opel said.In addition to a lack of work from GM, Opel needs fewer engineers capable of developing vehicle platforms because new cars are now built on underpinnings provided by PSA.Segula Technologies will become a subcontractor for Opel if a deal is struck, but Opel will not retain a stake in the venture, Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said. Any deal is subject to agreement by Opel's works council and would include vehicle and propulsion engineering facilities together with up to 2,000 employees of the Ruesselsheim research and development being taken over by Segula, Opel said.Uncertainty over the future of Opel's engineering center has already led to a wave of departures among Opel's senior engineering staff and when rumors of a sale first surfaced in July, Opel's labor leaders were quick to condemn plans they said would ""threaten Opel's existence"".Segula technologies is offering to protect jobs until July 2023, Opel said. Lohscheller declined to say whether the transfer of jobs will have a positive financial impact for Opel.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

72,"Aug 20, 2018 09:30PM ET",U.S. Sanctions Bring Stress to Already Battered Emerging Markets,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the U.S. is using sanctions against its adversaries -- and even some friends -- like never before. The latest batch against Russia and Turkey sank emerging markets, with stocks poised for their worst month since January 2016.Here’s a refresher of the most recent restrictions imposed by the U.S., the outlook for further sanctions and how markets have reacted.TurkeyThe U.S. imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers on Aug. 1 in an extraordinary move for a NATO ally after negotiations failed to achieve the release of an American pastor arrested on charges of espionage and aiding terrorists. While largely symbolic, the sanctions were enough to send investors fleeing the lira.Then Trump upped the ante. On Aug. 10, he ordered the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs against Turkey. Trump announced the measure in an early morning tweet and by the end of the day the lira had completed its biggest weekly decline since 2008. On Aug. 16, the U.S. stepped up the rhetoric again, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying additional sanctions were ready if Turkey refused to release the pastor.Turkey is closely knitted to western credit markets. With an external debt volume similar to Russia’s, the slump in the currency threatens to push the country’s economy into recession.Investors had already been exiting Turkey due to accelerating inflation, a high current-account deficit and unpredictable monetary policy. The lira has now slumped 38 percent this year, the worst performance after Argentina.RussiaThe U.S. State Department announced this month new restrictions to punish Vladimir Putin’s government for the nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal. The measures, which take effect Aug. 22, will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds. More sweeping measures may follow 90 days later.At the same time, the U.S. Congress is weighing draft legislation proposing more sanctions that target Russia’s sovereign debt and its largest banks, in response to alleged election meddling.Russia has been a target of U.S. sanctions since Barack Obama’s administration. Starting in 2014, the U.S. government has imposed restrictions to protest Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its support for a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. More were added after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election, won by Trump.In April, another round of measures in response to Russia’s “malign activity around the globe” hit hardest Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal, limiting its access to the $140 billion global aluminum industry.Almost 700 Russian people and companies are now under U.S. sanctions.The ruble is down around 7 percent in August, heading toward its worst month since November 2016.IranTrump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal on May 8 despite opposition from China, Russia and NATO allies, reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic.The U.S. plans to hit Iran’s lifeline by targeting oil exports as it demands the Islamic Republic stops supporting terrorism and halts its ballistic missile program. Faced by a choice between doing business with Iran or the U.S., European companies including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) quickly halted activity or backtracked on investment plans in the Persian Gulf nation.Iranian hardliners increased pressure on President Hassan Rouhani -- a relative moderate -- after the sanctions resumed, while the rial went into free fall on Tehran’s unregulated market. A 50 percent rise in the price of some food items sparked street protests and led the central bank to impose capital controls.Rouhani has called for other partners in the nuclear agreement to stand by the accord and on Aug. 6 he indicated the U.S. needs to ease sanctions before he’d agree to any talks. Trump said he would meet with Rouhani without preconditions.Still, he also tweeted: “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!.”The rial has lost about 80 percent of its value since late April, and is currently trading at about 102,200 to the dollar.VenezuelaThe U.S. has imposed sanctions on Venezuela for human-rights abuses, political repression and graft, culminating in Aug. 2017, when the Trump administration barred trading of new debt issued by the Venezuelan government and its state oil company PDVSA in U.S. markets and blocked dealing in some existing bonds owned by the country’s public sector.The sanctions forced the government to announce a restructuring of all its debt in November. American investors were prohibited by U.S. authorities from engaging in that restructuring.Venezuela’s international bonds due in 2027 lost more than half of their value in 2017, reaching an all time low of 21.785 cents on the dollar in December. They currently trade around 28 cents.This year, Trump also prohibited the sale, transfer or pledging of collateral of any equity interest in which the Venezuelan government has a 50 percent or greater stake, further choking off funding to President Nicolas Maduro’s government.The sanctions, rampant inflation and lower oil prices have almost wiped out the value of Venezuela’s bolivar since Maduro was elected in 2013.This weekend, the government carried out one of the greatest currency devaluations in history -- a 95 percent plunge that will test the capacity of an already beleaguered population to stomach even more pain. The devaluation comes at the same time the government is redenominating the currency by lopping off five zeros and introducing new bills and a name change."
73,"Aug 20, 2018 07:12AM ET",Iran tells EU to speed up efforts to save nuclear deal,nan,"By Parisa HafeziANKARA (Reuters) - Iran urged Europe on Monday to speed up efforts to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers that U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in May, saying French oil group  Total  has formally pulled out a major gas project.Efforts by the remaining signatories - EU members Britain, France and Germany plus China and Russia - to avoid the agreement's collapse are struggling as Washington has said any firms dealing with Teheran will be barred from doing business in the United States.""Europeans and other signatories of the deal have been trying to save the deal ... but the process has been slow. It should be accelerated,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. ""Iran relies mainly on its own capabilities to overcome America's new sanctions,"" he told a news conference broadcast on state TV.European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal, which Trump said was ""deeply flawed"". Washington imposed new sanctions on Iran in August, targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals, purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry.The European powers, China and Russia say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran. But the threat of the U.S. sanctions has prompted many major companies to pull out of Iran.Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said France's Total (PA:TOTF) has formally left a contract to develop Iran's South Pars Gas project. ""The process to replace (Total) with another company is underway,"" he was quoted as saying by state TV.Total, which signed the deal in 2017 with an initial investment of $1 billion, did not have any immediate comment.Iranian officials had earlier suggested that China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the offshore project. CNPC, which already has a 30 percent stake in the deal, is an experienced onshore oil and gas producer, but is relatively new to offshore drilling. WARY INVESTORSMost of CNPC's experience lies in its subsidiary China Petroleum Offshore Engineering Company (CPOE), which has worked in shallow waters off north China.""Once Total quits, that will trigger CNPC to take over automatically, according to the contract,” a senior Chinese industry source with knowledge of the deal told Reuters.“But the question is not about if CNPC is going to take over as the operator, but if CNPC could deliver and advance the project without Total.”China also faces challenges supplying equipment such as large-scale compressors needed for developing the giant gas project, as leading manufacturers could be barred from supplying to Iran under U.S. sanctions.Carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are also among those to suspend or drop plans to invest in Iran along with Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE)Working to maintain financial channels with Tehran and facilitate Iran's oil exports, the European Union has taken steps to counter the renewed U.S. sanctions, including forbidding EU citizens from complying with them or related court rulings.Washington has said Iran’s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept Trump’s offer to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal. Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the offer.""We do not want to revisit that nuclear deal. We want the United States to implement that (2015) nuclear deal"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN on Sunday.The United States will impose tougher sanctions in November which will target Iran's oil sales and banking sector. Iran's rial currency has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions.Under the 2015 deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country's nuclear program.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

74,"Aug 12, 2018 07:31AM ET","Germany says Trump's tariffs, sanctions destroy jobs and growth",nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and sanctions policies, saying such measures were destroying jobs and growth and that Europe would not bow to U.S. pressure regarding Iran.The United States has triggered a bitter tit-for-tat trade dispute with import tariffs meant to protect American jobs against what Trump calls unfair trade practices from China, Europe and other countries.Trump's determination to push ahead with sanctions on Tehran which also target European companies doing business with Iran has opened another battle front.""This trade war is slowing down and destroying economic growth - and it creates new uncertainties,"" Altmaier told Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that consumers suffered the most because higher tariffs were driving up prices.Altmaier lauded the agreement reached by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during negotiations with Trump last month, saying the interim deal had saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe.The U.S. and the European Union are embroiled in a spat after Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and Brussels responded with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods.Trump had also threatened to impose tariffs on EU auto imports but reached an agreement to hold off on taking action after meeting with Juncker at the White House last month.""The agreement between the EU and U.S. can only be a first step. Our goal is a global trade order with lower tariffs, less protectionism and open markets,"" Altmaier said.Turning to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the minister said Germany and its EU allies would continue to support companies doing business with Iran despite U.S. pressure.""We won't let Washington dictate us with whom we can do business and we therefore stick to the Vienna Nuclear Agreement so that Iran cannot build atomic weapons,"" Altmaier said.German companies should be allowed to continue to invest in Iran as much as they want and the German government is looking for ways together with its European allies to ensure that financial transactions could still take place, he added.Several European companies have suspended plans to invest in Iran in light of the U.S. sanctions, including oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) as well as carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). [nL5N1UY39D] German business associations have warned that companies are increasingly suffering from Trump's sanctions policies - including those against Iran - as well as the tariffs he is imposing in the escalating trade conflict with China.The trade and sanctions disputes are clouding the growth outlook for Germany, Europe's largest economy, but Altmaier said he nonetheless expected strong growth this year due to vibrant domestic demand, record-high employment and rising wages.The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product figures for the second quarter on Tuesday, with analysts expecting the quarterly growth rate to pick up to 0.4 percent after 0.3 percent in the first quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"Aug 08, 2018 02:20PM ET","French cows herded out of Iran by U.S. sanctions, Senator says",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - A project to export cattle to Iran from Normandy in northern France has been halted due to the United States' renewed sanctions against Tehran, a French Senator said, as Washington's policy takes its toll on its European allies.The sanctions, following U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from an international accord on Iran's nuclear program, took effect on Tuesday. They have led many European companies to back out of investments in Iran, including French energy giant  Total  (PA:TOTF) and car maker  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP).The U.S. measures also blocked the development of live cattle exports after a successful trial last year with Iranian company Seamorgh, said Nathalie Goulet, a senator for the Orne region in Normandy where the cows were bred.While food and farming sectors are not directly targeted by Washington, the sanctions have made banks reluctant to finance deals, while companies with ties to the United States are afraid of incurring any penalties.The cattle project, established by several French agricultural groups with Seamorgh in 2016, was set to see a thousand cows of the Charolais beef-producing breed exported following an initial 300 animals in 2017 but is now on hold, Goulet, an active backer of the project, told Reuters.""On the one hand, the banks have a lot of concerns. The other reason is that intermediaries in the project have issues,"" she said, citing the withdrawal of cooperative Agrial, one of the French partners.Neither Agrial nor Seamorgh commented when contacted by Reuters.Goulet said the project was potentially worth several million euros. French cows were to be transported by air to Iran to be fattened before being slaughtered. Around 300 already reached the Middle Eastern country in last year's trial.""This all went very well and we were looking at extra volume, targeting 20,000 cows a year,"" Alexandre Wahl of Normandy's economic development agency said.The European Union has pledged to shield European companies in Iran from U.S. sanctions, with the EU's executive adopting a so-called blocking statute, but Goulet said its scope was unclear.""We need more from Europe and above all to find a response to American extra-territoriality,"" said Goulet.The cattle exports were part of a series of agricultural projects initiated by France and Iran after the 2015 nuclear accord that led to previous sanctions against Tehran being eased.As the EU's largest agricultural producer, France often promotes the sector in economic discussions. It has been particularly focused on boosting exports for its declining cattle sector.Iran, meanwhile, has been keen to overhaul its food and farming industries to meet demand from its 80 million population and adapt to dwindling water resources.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

77,"Aug 03, 2018 12:10PM ET",Scania says U.S. sanctions put entire Iran truck sales in 'jeopardy',nan,"By Esha VaishSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Scania's entire sales into Iran could be lost if the United States reinstates sanctions against the country, the Swedish truckmaker's head warned on Friday, a day after first-half results showed the company's Iranian order book was already being hit.CEO Henrik Henriksson said Scania, which was one of the first truck companies to return to Iran after the EU lifted sanctions in early 2016, had cancelled all orders that it could not deliver by mid August as anything after would have been hit by the new sanctions.""Looking at the information we have on hand today, of course if nothing is improving, then (our) whole volume will be in jeopardy,"" told Reuters.Among truckmakers, Scania, which is owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), has one of the larger presences in Iran, selling 5,000-6,000 trucks and buses annually, according to Henriksson. That represents about 5 percent of its global vehicle orders of 109,415 last year. Such a move would be another blow to the Iranian car industry, which unlike the energy and banking sectors, had managed to sign contracts with top European firms after the lifting of sanctions in 2016, attracting sizable foreign investment. French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) began to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran in June and Germany’s Daimler said it was closely monitoring any further developments and would then evaluate the potential impact on its business.Despite the efforts of European governments to salvage the nuclear deal and provide guarantees to European firms to protect them against secondary U.S. sanctions, many of them are leaving Iran anyway to avoid any possible U.S. penalties. America accounted for 13 percent of Scania's orders for trucks, buses and coaches in 2017. Scania declined to comment on how much of an impact the decline in orders from Iran, considered as one of their growth markets, had on first half results. The company's factories in Latin America and Europe are used to produce vehicles for Tehran and it distributes trucks and buses through local partners, which also own Scania's production and extensive servicing network in Iran. Henriksson said Scania was also pressing for faster payment as sanctions could potentially close financing networks by November.""As it is right now, it's a wind down window of getting orders out that were in before a certain date and getting payments in as much as you can,"" he said.However, Henriksson said Scania was working on a contingency plan so that it could continue to deliver spare parts needed to keep its trucks and buses on Iranian roads running, but that nothing was resolved yet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

83,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."

In particular, Washington wants to curtail the oil exports that are key to Iran's economic revival. Earlier this month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from its neighbors if Washington pressed ahead with trying to force countries to stop buying Iranian oil.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

86,"Jul 06, 2018 09:57AM ET",Ford slides deeper into China rut after worst ever first half vehicle sales,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor’s (N:F) China slump intensified, with vehicle sales tumbling 38 percent in June and the automaker recording its worst-ever first half, as buyers shunned its aging models that are awaiting overhauls and flocked to rivals.The U.S. automaker announced on Friday it sold 62,057 vehicles in China in June, taking its sales for the first half of the year to 400,443, down 25 percent compared with the year-ago period. According to consultancy LMC Automotive, it was Ford's biggest first-half percentage decline since starting operations in China in 2001.Ford, which undertook a big expansion in China earlier this decade, is paying the price for a lack of new models in its lineup. Last year, its sales fell 6 percent even as overall vehicle sales in China rose 3 percent.“We always knew it would be a challenging year for us given our position in the product cycle,” Peter Fleet, head of Ford’s Asia-Pacific operations, which include China, said in a statement.Fleet has previously said Ford's sales will not likely regain momentum in China, the world's biggest auto market, until next year when the first of new vehicle models arrive in showrooms in large enough numbers.LMC Automotive senior market analyst Alan Kang said one reason Ford is struggling in China is ""fiercer competition"" in the car market there, where luxury brands are suffering amid the rise of local Chinese brands. ""Weak global brands are squeezed like the meat in a sandwich, so this is why we can see not only Ford,"" but  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380),  KIA Motors  Corp (KS:000270), and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) have ""all suffered"" in the last two years, Kang said. The dim sales numbers come as the United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other's imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war"" ever in a sharp escalation of their months-long conflict.With automobiles subject to additional duties by China, Ford has much to lose. Last year, it shipped about 80,000 vehicles to China from North America, more than half of them its upper-end Lincolns – including the Lincoln Continental sedan and the Lincoln MKX crossover SUV.Ford said a day before it will not hike prices of imported Ford and Lincoln models in China, thus absorbing the additional cost of tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.Ford’s troubles in China, which include the absence of a country head following the abrupt departure of the previous chief in January after only five months at the helm, contrast with General Motors Co's (N:GM) steady performance there. Ford's Fleet has been overseeing the company's China operations, as it searches for a new country chief.GM sold 4.04 million vehicles in China last year, up 4.4 percent from a year earlier. Ford, in comparison, sold 1.19 million cars last year, down 6 percent. Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) also outsold Ford last year in China.In an effort to reverse the slump, Ford has said it is overhauling its product lineup for China. Redesigned Focus compact and Escort subcompact cars are due to hit showrooms in China later this year, along with the new Lincoln MKC and Nautilus sport utility vehicles.In June, sales of Ford’s premium Lincoln brand rose 12 percent to 4,350 vehicles, with sales volume for the first half totaling 24,314 vehicles, up 4 percent from a year earlier.Still other brands remained under pressure. Particularly poor performing was the Ford brand, whose sales collapsed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renault  (PA:RENA) announced plans on Wednesday to launch a ride-hailing and car-sharing scheme covering the French capital and its surrounding areas from September.Renault and Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP) are vying to offer a car sharing scheme in Paris to replace Autolib, the electric car sharing service run by French tycoon Vincent Bollore's group that was recently ditched by local authorities after a dispute.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

93,"Jun 21, 2018 05:33AM ET",European autos sink on Daimler tariff hit while markets wilt,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Autos stocks slammed the brakes on a relief bounce in European shares on Thursday, sinking after German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) warned profit would be hit by higher tariffs.The autos sector fell 2.3 percent to a nine-month low while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) eased down 0.2 percent as no new salvos were exchanged in an ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.Equity markets have been relatively resilient in the face of mounting trade concerns but fell broadly this week as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Daimler became one of the biggest global companies to cut its guidance on trade tensions, warning profits would be hit in part by Chinese tariffs on car imports from the United States.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) shares fell 4.4 percent to their lowest in nearly two years. Some analysts were skeptical of Daimler's timing, saying the profit warning may be more driven by internal pressures than the external trade environment. But UBS analysts said they expected consensus earnings estimate downgrades of 5 to 7 percent for the carmaker. BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 3 percent and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 2.3 percent. Tyre maker Continental (DE:CONG) declined 1.6 percent. France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) fell 1.3 percent, while auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) declined 0.5 percent. Italy's Fiat Chrysler  lost 1.8 percent. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) underperformed peers down 0.5 percent due to the carmakers' losses. Financials stocks were the biggest weight on the STOXX after two leading eurosceptics from the far-right League were named to head Italian parliamentary finance committees.Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) fell 1.3 percent, underperforming European peers as bank stocks (FTIT8300) tumbled, while Italian bond yields rose as the appointments reignited investors' fears around Italy's new populist government.University professor Alberto Bagnai, who was named head of the Finance Committee in the Senate, published “Il tramonto dell’euro” (“The sunset of the euro”) in 2012.Despite Daimler's comments, some investors saw trade war fears as a chance to buy stocks at slightly cheaper prices.""We're actually looking at it as an opportunity to add some risk back into portfolios and use some of the cash that we built up,"" said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management. ""It's really been consumer discretionary and autos in particular that have been hit so far by concerns about trade wars but actually the underlying drivers of the market - tech, energy, healthcare, have been really strong,"" he added. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had a record high close on Wall Street on Wednesday.Healthcare stocks were the top boost to European indices as  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) jumped 4.4 percent to the top of the STOXX after the pharma company announced PIONEER-4 and PIONEER-7 trial results for its experimental diabetes pill. ""Both trials delivered in terms of glucose control as well as weight loss regardless of the statistical analysis,"" said UBS analysts. Consumer staples stocks such as  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), ABInBev (BR:ABI) and Nestle (S:NESN) also provided support. The dollar earners have benefited from the recent strength in the dollar.To view a graphic on German auto stocks falling, click: https://reut.rs/2MJ0zff  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Free floating can be viable in Paris as there is a strong density of potential clients. We are in contact with the municipality. We could start rapidly,"" Brigitte Courtehoux, head of PSA's new mobility unit, told Les Echos.PSA already operates free floating car-sharing services in Madrid and Lisbon.""Free-floating is a flexible scheme. As there are no (specific) car stations, the perimeter can be easily extended depending on demand, even if in the end it must be profitable,"" Courtehoux added.The contract for the Paris Autolib car-sharing scheme, which was launched in 2011, expires in 2023.In 2015, PSA and the Bollore group signed a strategic cooperation agreement on developing car-sharing solutions using electric vehicles.($1 = 0.8499 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

98,"Jun 08, 2018 05:09AM ET",Volkswagen labour boss says will block sale of specialist assets,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan SchwartzWOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) powerful works council will continue to block the potential sale of specialist industrial assets and instead seek to work with the carmaker's new chief executive to develop them, its labour leader told Reuters.Under former CEO Matthias Mueller, attempts to slim down Europe's largest automotive group - which also includes the MAN (DE:MANG) Diesel & Turbo engineering business and transmissions maker Renk - foundered amid opposition from labour leaders and the controlling Porsche and Piech families. But Volkswagen's new boss Herbert Diess said last month that spinning off Diesel & Turbo, Renk or motorcycle brand Ducati was a possibility as the group's top management reviews options for ""non-core"" assets.""When taking over MAN, (former chairman) Ferdinand Piech and I promised the workforce of Renk and Diesel & Turbo that we will not sell these divisions. The executive board also gave its word,"" works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in an interview.Diess has pledged to speed up Volkswagen's drive to become more efficient in the wake of its 2015 diesel emissions scandal, as it seeks to fund a costly shift to electric and self-driving cars. Plans include preparing the group's trucks division for a separate listing. ""We will discuss how we can further develop the engineering operations,"" Osterloh said. ""The business must not stand still. We also agree with Dr. Diess on this.""The works council controls half of the 20-seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, which decides on investment, plant closures and executive appointments, and can usually also count on the support of representatives from the group's home region of Lower Saxony. Separately, Osterloh said the group's core VW brand was making good progress with cost cuts agreed in its ""future pact"" between management and labour, with 93 percent of planned full-year savings already identified.""The numbers show that we will achieve the planned efficiency gains from the future pact of slightly more than 2 billion euros for this year,"" said Osterloh, who sits on Volkswagen's supervisory board. Designed mainly to make cuts to high-cost operations in Germany, the future pact aims to make 3.7 billion euros in annual savings by 2020 and up to 23,000 job cuts without forced layoffs by 2025.The plan helped boost profitability at the VW brand last year, though margins continue to lag rivals including  Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203).Osterloh expects Diess, a proven cost-cutter, to increase synergies between the group's main car brands VW, Seat and Skoda. At VW, synergies should get a particular boost in 2019/2020 when the first electric models roll off a new MEB modular platform and the redesigned top-selling Golf hits dealerships, he said. Osterloh also said further steps would be needed to boost output at Skoda to help it keep up with booming demand, even though some production is being shifted to Germany to relieve its stretched Czech factories.Asked whether a decision in April to move some production of sport-utility vehicles to a VW plant in Osnabrueck had solved the bottlenecks at Skoda, Osterloh said: ""For the moment, yes, but certainly not in a lasting way.""""We will check overall utilisation across the group. Then we will look at the regions where demand is coming from and will take a decision,"" he said, pointing to the group's budget round in November.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

101,"Jun 01, 2018 03:18PM ET",Marchionne ramps up SUVs as prepares to hand over Fiat Chrysler wheel,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Valentina ZaBALOCCO, Italy (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) departing Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne delivered a plan on Friday to ramp up sport utility vehicles and invest 9 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in electric and hybrid cars in a bid to double operating profit by 2022.The 65-year-old, who hands over the wheel in early 2019, said the carmaker will phase out diesel engines in European passenger cars by 2021 as FCA (N:FCAU) introduce hybrids and electric cars across all regions to be fully compliant with emissions regulations.It also set out a roadmap for its Jeep, RAM, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, which together with the company's commercial vehicles unit are expected to make up four-fifths of sales by the end of the five-year plan.""These brands comprise the most significant portion of our revenues and our earnings,"" Marchionne said. Brands like Chrysler or Dodge will become more localized and focused on North America, while Jeep, Alfa and Maserati will be expanded to have global reach, as part of an overall spending plan of around 45 billion euros. The Fiat brand, once among Europe's top selling brands, will be reduced to a few models such as the iconic 500 and the popular Panda hatchback. The 500 family in particular will become a big part of the electrification drive in Europe. ""The space for Fiat in Europe is going to be redefined,"" Marchionne said, adding he needed to cut products that lacked pricing power.For graphic on total Fiat Chrysler shareholder return under CEO Marchionne click https://reut.rs/2JjkAKjFCA is on track to meet or exceed nearly all the financial targets it set in the last strategy plan to 2018, notably a goal to erase net debt. Marchionne, widely credited with rescuing both Fiat and Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy, sported a tie rather than his trademark sweater on Friday to celebrate the fact that the debt milestone will already be reached by the end of June. FCA expects to return to an investment grade rating by the end of next year and is targeting a dividend payout ratio of around 20 percent over the plan period. The world's seventh-largest carmaker said it sees adjusted earnings before interest and tax of between 13-16 billion euros in 2022, up from 6.6 billion euros last year, while margins are expected to rise to between 9-11 percent from 6.3 percent.FCA announced a plan to bring U.S. financial services in-house, as well as aggressive targets for expanding Jeep, whose roots date back to World War Two and which has become FCA's ticket to creating a high-margin brand with global appeal. It said it expects one in every 12 utility vehicle sold industry-wide by 2022 to be a Jeep. Marchionne's ""wild guess"" was that Jeep sales could double by then. Jeep will launch nine new products, enter three new segments including large sports utility vehicles, and offer four battery electric versions by 2022, FCA said. Jeep will also stop selling diesel vehicles in Europe.The RAM truck unit aims to grow global sales by up to 30 percent and in doing so to become the No. 2 commercial vehicle brand in North America. Meanwhile, Maserati will launch hybrid and fully electric vehicles and source engines from Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), seeking to take on both Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Porsche.FCA said it is targeting annual sales of 400,000 for the sporty Alfa Romeo brand in 2022, up from the 170,000 expected this year. The initial aim was to hit that target this year, but the revamp was affected by design and technological hiccups and the brand has yet to turn a profit.FCA's Milan-listed shares closed down 4.5 percent. FCA retooled some U.S. plants to boost output of lucrative SUVs and trucks, while ending production of unprofitable sedans.The move got FCA close to erasing the margin gap with its larger U.S. rivals GM (N:GM) and Ford (N:F). Marchionne said the new objective is to become the most profitable U.S. car company.""A similarly credible exercise for EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) will give investors confidence in targets for the region,"" said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI. FCA's operating margin in Europe recovered to 3.2 percent last year, which compares to Europe-centric PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) global automotive margin of 7.3 percent. FCA expects that margin to grow to between 5 and 7 percent by 2022 by converting Italian plants to churn out Alfas, Jeeps and Maseratis and limiting mass market products to certain markets, discontinuing them or moving them elsewhere. Beyond electrification, FCA will keep pursuing partnerships to develop autonomous cars, like the one it has with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) self-driving unit Waymo. Marchionne said FCA would keep its options open and work with experts in the field rather than develop all the technologies in-house as some competitors have done. ""The best way to deploy capital is to explore, it's way too early to make calls,"" he said. Marchionne poured cold water on the idea of a Maserati or Alfa spin-off under the new plan, although some investors believe it is just a matter of time. Asked whether the company would seek a merger deal in the post-Marchionne era, John Elkann, FCA chairman and scion of Fiat's founding family, said that while his clan has always been open to considering M&A to strengthen the company, with its future ""so bright"" there was no talk of selling.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

105,"May 17, 2018 09:41AM ET",Volkswagen's biggest brand to by-pass Paris auto show,nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will not display its core brand at the Paris motor show this year, the latest and most prominent carmaker to swerve the biennial industry gathering.Europe's largest automotive group has scaled back brand presentations at traditional car shows, including Detroit and Frankfurt, since the VW emissions scandal erupted in 2015.This has partly been seen as a cost-cutting measure for VW which has been reducing spending to counter the multi-billion dollar costs of dealing with the fallout of cheating diesel emissions tests, but it also mirrors a wider sector trend.Jean-Claude Girot, the head of the Paris show organizers told Reuters his department has an agreement with VW that the German brand will take a stand at the next exhibition in 2020.""This is a one-off decision rather than a permanent loss of interest on VW's part,"" Girot said. ""When a brand decides not to book a stand it's usually to reduce costs.""Many of the traditional industry gatherings have registered a drop in visitor numbers since 2000, forcing carmakers to rethink how they spend their marketing budgets.""The Volkswagen brand is continually reviewing its participation in international motor shows,"" it said on Thursday, adding it could instead host ""various communications activities"" in the French capital, including test drives.Whether or not VW will return to Paris in 2020 ""will be assessed in due course,"" it said.Other brands staying away from the Oct. 2-3 Paris show include Ford (N:F), PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel, Nissan Motor (T:7201), its premium brand Infiniti, Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Volvo Cars, owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group , according to Girot.VW's luxury division Audi (DE:NSUG) gave up its own pavilion in Frankfurt, which hosts Europe's largest auto show in alternate years, for the first time in many years in 2017. ""EXCESSIVE COSTS""Audi will also skip the 2019 Detroit show, which the VW group attended with a significantly reduced line-up this year, underlining the wider shift away from such gatherings.Besides shouldering costs for the ""Dieselgate"" scandal, VW's five main car brands are pushing cost savings to help fund a strategic shift to zero-emission and self-driving technology.""Excessive costs and very poor benefits for customer ties and image building simply don't justify the effort,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. ""Car shows are doomed unless they find a new approach.""Dudenhoeffer, a former marketing chief at Porsche, said VW group probably spends up to 50 million euros on its Paris show presence. VW declined comment. Among the reasons for the decline of the shows is the emergence of technology as the main battleground for connected, autonomous cars, which has drawn exhibitors to competing events such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. [nL8N1LL1U3]Girot said the duration of the Paris show has been reduced slightly after many exhibitors had asked for a shorter event to keep costs in check, adding that some first-time participants including Guangzhou Automobile Group (SS:601238) had been signed.But carmakers cannot afford to skip China's annual event, alternating between Beijing and Shanghai, as it showcases the latest tech and trends in the world's largest vehicle market which experts view as a leader in electric and self-driving cars, Stefan Bratzel, head of the Centre of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne, said.A spokesman for VW's French operations said other Volkswagen brands including Audi, sports car maker Porsche, Czech division Skoda and Spanish unit Seat are still due to attend Paris.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

107,"May 09, 2018 04:25PM ET","Europeans work to save Iran deal, and business, after Trump pulls out",nan,"By Yara Bayoumy and Brian LoveWASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Dismayed European allies sought to salvage the international nuclear pact and preserve their business with Iran on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran.""The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who helped engineered the 2015 deal to ease Iran's economically crippling isolation, told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that Europe had only a ""limited opportunity"" to preserve the pact, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported.""(Europe)...must, as quickly as possible, clarify its position and specify and announce its intentions with regard to its obligations,"" ISNA quoted Rouhani as saying to Macron.Macron, who like other European leaders had lobbied Trump to keep the agreement signed before he took office, urged Rouhani to keep respecting the deal and consider broader negotiations.Trump said on Tuesday he would revive U.S. economic sanctions, which would penalize foreign firms doing business with Tehran, to undermine what he called ""a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".On Wednesday, he said Iran would now either negotiate or ""something will happen."" It was not immediately clear what actions he was suggesting would take place.Iran has drafted a ""proportional"" plan to cope with the U.S. move, the official news agency IRNA quoted government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht as saying. He said budgets had been drawn up to deal with various scenarios, though did not elaborate.The fruit of more than a decade of diplomacy, the nuclear agreement was clinched in July 2015 by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran.It was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy, not least by Washington threatening to penalize businesses anywhere in the world that traded with Iran.Trump complained that the deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.His decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East, puts the United States at odds with European diplomatic and business interests, and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent touching a 3-1/2-year high. [O/R]The U.S. pullout could also strengthen the hand of hardliners in Iranian politics at the expense of moderates like Rouhani who had pinned their hopes on the deal to boost living standards in Iran, with limited success so far.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hardliner, said: ""Mr Trump, I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You've made a mistake ... I said many times from the first day: don't trust America."" ""REGION DESERVES BETTER"" France's Le Drian, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all said Iran was honoring its commitments under the accord.""The region deserves better than further destabilization provoked by American withdrawal,"" Le Drian said.Later on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to allay concerns that Washington had alienated itself from close allies with Trump's decision.""We will continue to work alongside our allies and partners to ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon, and will work with others to address the range of Iran's malign influence,"" Mattis told a U.S. Senate hearing.""The president could not affirm as required that this agreement was being lived up to,"" Mattis said. ""I think we now have the opportunity to move forward to address those shortcomings and make it more compelling.""The European Union said it would ensure sanctions on Iran remain lifted, as long as Tehran meets its commitments.The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""deeply concerned"" by the withdrawal, the RIA news agency said.Merkel said that, while the existing deal should not be called into question, there should be discussion of ""a broader deal that goes beyond it"".British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke of a ""follow-on agreement"" but said it was now up to Washington to come up with concrete proposals. Macron said he wanted a broader discussion with all relevant parties on the development of Iran's nuclear program after 2025, when key elements of the current deal expire, as well as Iran's ballistic missile program and wider Middle East issues.Iranian officials will next week meet counterparts from France, Britain and Germany. Khamenei appeared skeptical whether they could deliver: ""I don't trust these three countries.""The chances of saving the deal without Washington depend largely on whether international firms are willing and able to keep trading with Iran despite the threat of U.S. sanctions.In a sign of what may be in store, Trump's ambassador to Berlin tweeted, within hours of taking up his post, that German businesses should halt activities in Iran at once.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the United States should not consider itself the world's ""economic policeman"".Britain, France and Germany said they would do all they could to protect their business interests in Iran, yet it was unclear how far they would be able to shield firms from U.S. sanctions. Brussels has a ""blocking statute"" at its disposal that bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognize any court rulings that enforce American penalties.But the statute has never been used and is seen by European governments more as a political weapon than a regulation, because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce.British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman made the limits of potential action clear: ""UK businesses may wish to consider the implications for their business activities in Iran and, where necessary, seek appropriate legal advice.""European companies including carmaker PSA (PA:PEUP), plane manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) and engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) all said they were watching the situation.A senior French diplomat said businesses would ultimately be forced to choose between their Iranian economic interests and their potential U.S. interests, adding: ""Generally, that decision is quickly made in favor of the U.S.""""DEATH TO AMERICA!"" Hardline lawmakers in Iran's parliament burned a U.S. flag and a symbolic copy of the deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), chanting ""Death to America!"" Rouhani, whose position could be weakened by a blow to Iran's economy, struck a more conciliatory tone in a televised speech, saying Iran would negotiate with EU countries, China and Russia.""If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal will remain,"" he said.Trump's decision compounded strains on the transatlantic alliance since he took office 16 months ago. One by one, European leaders came to Washington and tried to meet his demands, while pleading with him to preserve the deal.The Trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal, but it is far from clear whether the Europeans would pursue that option or be able to win Iran over.Abandoning the pact was one of the most consequential decisions of Trump's ""America First"" policy, which has led him to quit the global Paris climate accord, come close to a trade war with China and pull out of an Asian-Pacific trade deal. It also appeared to reflect the growing influence within the administration of Iran hawks such as new National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday to prepare for a summit that Trump hopes will secure North Korea's denuclearization.COMPLYING WITH DEALIran denies longstanding Western suspicions that it tried in the past to develop atomic weapons and says its nuclear energy program has been for peaceful purposes.Senior U.S. officials themselves have said several times that Iran is in technical compliance with the nuclear pact.Renewing sanctions would make it much harder for Iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system. Iran is the third-largest member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping about 3.8 million barrels per day of crude, or just under 4 percent of global supply. China, India, Japan and South Korea buy most of its 2.5 million bpd of exports.Iran's rial currency plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar in the free market, after sliding for months because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who feared that renewed U.S. sanctions would hit Iranian exports hard.The U.S. Treasury says sanctions related to Iran's energy, auto and financial sectors will be reimposed in three and six months.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a license for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sell passenger jets to Iran will be revoked, scuttling a $38 billion deal. The ban will also hit Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), whose planes contain U.S.-made parts.Iran's growing military and political power in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq worries the United States, Israel and Washington's Gulf Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia.Among the few nations to welcome Trump's decision were Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch-foes in the Middle East, regarding it as a political victory.(Graphic showing Iran’s nuclear facilities https://tmsnrt.rs/2K9tVRX)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This was a very mixed picture from Siemens with PG taking the shine off what were actually very good results... with the core automation businesses doing especially well,"" they wrote.In the consumer sector, AB Inbev (BR:ABI) gained 2.3 percent after a reassuring quarterly update from the world's largest brewer, while Imperial Brands (L:IMB) advanced 4.3 percent after the tobacco company posted results that were slightly ahead of estimates.Equities in Europe have recently outperformed Wall Street, supported by a weakening euro against a surging dollar, while the earnings season has also been supportive. According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings beats on the MSCI EMU index outnumbered missed by nearly 6 to 3 so far, with first quarter growth seen at 3.2 percent in local currency. In M&A news,  Vodafone  (L:VOD) agreed to pay $21.8 billion to buy Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) assets in Germany and a number of other countries to take on rivals with a broader offer of superfast cable TV, broadband and mobile.""We see the move (if completed) as positive strategically in terms of creating a stronger, converged operator,"" said UBS analysts, adding that the absence of an equity issuance to fund the deal was a positive.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

GM said its board of directors last year set stricter performance targets for its top executives, in noting that performance awards generally were lower in 2017.

115,"Apr 27, 2018 08:04AM ET","From Disney to Dior, Norway wealth fund challenges CEO pay",nan,"By Gwladys FoucheOSLO (Reuters) - Executive pay is firmly in the crosshairs of Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund as it puts its votes to work at some of the more than 9,000 companies it is invested in.The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, built on Norway's oil revenues, has become a more active shareholder in recent years and since 2017 has called for changes including the scrapping of long-term incentive plans and simpler and more transparent packages.So far in this year's annual general meeting season, data shows the fund voted against a stock option plan for Tesla (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder.. It has also voted against the pay of  Disney  (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) CEO Sydney Toledano,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) CEO Carlos Tavares,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.The fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.""It is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,"" Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.""If you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.""The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The  Weir Group  (L:WEIR), which the fund praised this month for being willing to ""challenge conventional thinking on remuneration"" by being simple and transparent.""The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,"" said Slyngstad. ""We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching."" The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's  Alfa Laval  (ST:ALFA) and Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa).NEGATIVE RETURNThe fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund's equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.""Any changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,"" Slyngstad told reporters. Some 66.2 percent of the fund's assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate. The fund's return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.The most negative contributions were Nestle (S:NESN), Facebook (O:FB) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed. Investments in Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Netflix (O:NFLX) made the most positive contribution.The Norwegian government withdrew 11 billion crowns during the first quarter to pay for public expenses, compared with 61 billion crowns for the whole of 2017.

As investors sifted through the heaviest week of earnings season, JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka said: ""Based on the results so far, the earnings delivery looks encouraging in the US, while the numbers in Europe and Japan are somewhat softer, but still positive.""Bank earnings were a key focus. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares recovered after a 2.6 percent fall at the open, trading up 0.2 percent by 0833 GMT after the bank said it would scale back its bond and equities trading in a major overhaul of its investment bank, after reporting a 79 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter.""The strategy potentially resolves the capitalization concerns of the bank, but profitability remains an issue,"" said KBW analysts.

118,"Apr 25, 2018 09:28AM ET",GM banks on Chinese vehicle family to boost Brazil sales,nan,"By Nick Carey and Brad HaynesDETROIT/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is planning for long-term profitability in South America built on the back of draconian cost cutting during Brazil's recession and the same low-cost vehicles it is developing for Chinese consumers, which are due to hit dealerships in 2019.""We have been refreshing the vehicle family (in South America), building up market share and getting the cost point right, all in preparation for one vehicle family,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in a recent interview.That ""one family"" will consist of an expected 2 million units made annually for South America and China that will lower production costs.""That is an unprecedented level of scale,"" Ammann said.GM is doubling down in South America, where it is already the top-selling automaker, thanks largely to two Chevrolet models, the subcompact Onix and the Prisma sedan. It expects better margins from rising sales and new lower-cost production models, including SUVs and crossovers increasingly favored by consumers. The automaker's plan, which GM has not previously disclosed, is part of an overarching strategy focused on profitability instead of trying to compete in every market.The U.S. automaker has pulled out of unprofitable operations in Europe and countries such as India. But GM is still betting on Brazil, a country just starting to come out of its deepest recession in decades. Carlos Zarlenga, head of the automaker's operations in Brazil and Argentina, recalls that during the downturn executives scrutinized every purchase request over $10,000.GM cut its Brazilian labor force 35 percent, persuaded unions to agree to multiyear contracts with wages pegged to inflation, reworked its supply chain and ditched a slick Sao Paulo building for offices at a nearly 90-year-old auto plant. ""The whole purpose was to make sure we maximized every inch of expenditure,"" Zarlenga told Reuters in a recent interview.Ammann says the cost reductions lowered GM's breakeven point in Brazil by 40 percent. After hitting a record of 3.80 million units in 2012, auto sales in Brazil - the world's eighth largest market, accounting for a majority of South American sales - plunged 46 percent to 2.05 million in 2016.The economy began to gradually rebound in 2017, lifting auto sales by 9 percent. GM's South American operations posted a profit of $100 million in 2017, the first since 2013.""South America can become a meaningful contributor"" to GM's overall profits, Ammann said. GM also passed  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) last year to become Brazil's top-selling automaker for the first time since 2004, according to data from industry group Anfavea. Brazil auto sales rose 16 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, Anfavea reported. GM's Zarlenga said at an event in Sao Paulo this week that Brazil auto industry sales will hit 2.7 million units in 2018, 2.9 million in 2019 and 4 million by 2027. Rival Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has also invested in new plants in Brazil and is working to become more competitive in South America.In January, U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) hinted at possible significant changes for its money-losing South American business.""DIFFERENT FOUNDATION""Last year, GM halted car sales in India - where it had less than 1 percent market share - and pulled out of parts of Africa to focus on profitable operations.In 2017 it sold Opel, its struggling European arm, to France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP).In an April 20 client note,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said GM could ""follow a similar path"" in South America.""The precedent of GM exiting a region with little or no chance to generate positive returns for shareholders has been set,"" Jonas wrote.But exiting other markets has freed up capital for GM. In August, it said it plans to invest $1.4 billion at three plants in Brazil.GM was in a better starting position in South America than in markets like India, said Ammann. ""That's a foundation that's different than some of the other markets in the world where we've decided we don't see a path to long-term success,"" Ammann said.He said South American consumers tend to like similar vehicles to their counterparts in China, where the automaker is developing a new family of cheaper vehicles with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104). Some of those vehicles will join GM's South American lineup in 2019.""We can get a level of scale that we couldn't in Europe,"" said Ammann.Lower production costs mean GM can add features - safety, infotainment and connectivity - normally standard in more expensive models, he added. Guido Vildozo, IHS Markit's senior manager for the Americas, cautioned that South American drivers have decades more driving experience than Chinese consumers and higher expectations.""There is always a risk when you develop a vehicle for China where driving dynamics are not such a high priority and sell it in a market where they are priority,"" Vildozo said.

The group declined to comment on the job cuts target.PSA, which last year paid General Motors (N:GM) $2.6 billion for loss-making Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall, is also demanding pay curbs and other sacrifices from workers in an attempt to restore profitability by 2020.Tensions have mounted since Opel workers rejected demands that they waive a 4.3 percent pay increase negotiated nationwide in return for PSA's commitment to assign a new model to the Eisenach plant in central Germany, securing the plant's future.German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced concern this week over PSA's plans. Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had an ""open and constructive"" telephone conversation on Friday with the German economy and labor ministers, Peter Altmaier and Hubertus Heil, the company said.Force Ouvriere (FO), PSA's biggest French labor grouping, also weighed in on Friday, urging Germany's IG Metall union to ""take more responsibility"" for necessary cost cuts.""They seem prepared to make the rest of the group carry the burden,"" FO official Christian Lafaye said in an interview. ""The French unions will not allow their workers to take the weight of a third competitiveness plan.""Under Tavares, staff at PSA sites in France, Spain, Britain and several other countries have granted concessions on working hours, wage restraint and bonus cuts.A return to profit requires productivity measures far beyond the agreed buyouts, PSA executives maintain.""If only returning to competitive production was as simple as announcing voluntary job cuts - that would be too easy,"" a management source said.At Vauxhall, Opel's British arm, assembly workers in Luton have just signed off on a 1.5 percent pay increase and hours that can be modified at short notice to meet demand spikes.Gary Reay, an official with the Unite union, said Luton workers would also be dismayed if German colleagues avoided making a similar contribution to the recovery of the business.""Our members wouldn't be at all happy,"" Reay said.""We were unfortunate enough to not get the increase we initially wanted, which would have been above inflation. We had to do what we thought was right for our situation.""Following the breakdown on Opel pay, PSA suspended a plan to invest in production of a new SUV at Eisenach, which IG Metall said would have safeguarded only half of the plant's 1,800 jobs.Union negotiators furthermore accused PSA of ""blackmail"" by demanding wage restraint for its entire 19,000 German workforce as a precondition for investment at just one of its sites.""It's not just about the wage deal, it's about whether we can trust PSA with future agreements,"" Schaefer-Klug said on Friday. ""They are not offering to negotiate, they're dictating.""(Corrects spelling of Lafaye in paragraph 9)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

123,"Apr 19, 2018 01:10PM ET",Peugeot boss faces toughest adversary yet in IG Metall,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Ilona WissenbachPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Group (PA:PEUP) boss Carlos Tavares, whose career has seen him thrash out margin-boosting labor deals for two carmakers in several countries, is now taking on Germany's IG Metall union, which has been the undoing of many a cost cutter.Under Tavares, a former  Renault  (PA:RENA) executive, the  Peugeot  maker is demanding pay curbs and other concessions from workers at Opel, the loss-making German carmaker it bought from General Motors (N:GM) last year, in return for new investment.The standoff could quickly take a political turn, amid reports PSA is also looking to shed thousands of jobs. Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened publicly on Wednesday, saying PSA must honor commitments made prior to the acquisition - when Tavares told German leaders there were no plans for plant closures or compulsory layoffs.""We expect above all that the company sticks to everything it promised in connection with the takeover,"" Merkel said at a summit of German state premiers, adding her government was seeking talks with PSA management.Western carmakers typically use plants in low-cost countries as benchmarks, warning higher-wage workers that failure to narrow the productivity gap could endanger their jobs.Pressure on manufacturing costs has increased with investment demands for connected, autonomous and electrified car development. GM is now employing similar tactics to seek concessions from its South Korean workforce.The U.S. carmaker failed to end Opel losses over two decades, hemmed in by German ""codetermination"" laws granting workers board seats and by IG Metall - which has thwarted or altered the plans of companies ranging from Volkswagen to Tesla.BLUFF CALLEDTensions have mounted at Opel since German workers called Tavares' bluff last week, by rejecting demands they waive the 4.3 percent pay increase negotiated by IG Metall nationwide.In response, PSA put investment plans on hold for the Eisenach plant in central Germany, tabling no new proposals. Unions fear the group may now begin planning to wind the plant down, triggering an all-out confrontation.Eisenach, which will lose Opel Corsa subcompact production after the model is updated next year, would have built the new Grandland SUV under the paused investment, sources have said.That plan would sustain only about half of the plant's workforce of 1,800, union representative Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug said after a works council meeting on Thursday.Opel could also cut 2,700-3,700 of the 7,700 jobs at its Ruesselsheim research center under scenarios discussed at the meeting, business magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported.PSA human resources chief Xavier Chereau had warned of ""consequences"" if IG Metall rebuffed management proposals, after other unions in Spain and Britain agreed concessions, according to a union source with knowledge of the talks.""We told him IG Metall is not like other unions,"" he said.FRENCH SQUEEZEIn Europe, French carmakers have led the squeeze on labor, extracting pay freezes and working time flexibility as investment recovered from the last major financial crisis.Renault, with Tavares as second-in-command, struck a deal with Spanish workers in November 2012. That in turn helped cajole French unions into signing a similar pact three months later. PSA, under then CEO Philippe Varin, followed suit.Such deals are part of the reason why PSA and Renault now regularly post automotive operating profit margins above 6 percent, compared with their 2-3 percent pre-crisis norms. By contrast, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) namesake volume brand raised its margin to 4.1 percent last year from 1.8 percent.Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall lost 179 million euros ($221 million) for a negative 2.5 percent margin in the last five months of 2017, after PSA took control.The French carmaker has said it discovered the full extent of Opel's problems only once it had closed the acquisition - and months after giving assurances that no closures were necessary.""IG Metall wants to apply the same methods it always has, which cost Opel 20 years of losses and 50,000 jobs,"" said a source close to the French carmaker.The French group referred Reuters questions to Opel, which said it remained hopeful that ""codetermination-based dialogue"" would achieve a deal.""We want to pave the way for a sustainable future by unleashing investments based on the right level of competitiveness,"" a company spokesman said, adding it aimed to avoid ""forced redundancies"".IG Metall has a history of humbling foreign managers.Tesla (O:TSLA) became enmeshed in a German labor dispute soon after its 2016 acquisition of robotics specialist Grohmann, before eventually granting a 30 percent wage hike.In one of its earlier failed attempts to halt Opel losses, GM negotiated the closure of its Bochum plant, north of Cologne - but only at the price of job guarantees for remaining workers of the kind Tavares is now seeking to unpick.NO GUARANTEESStaying competitive offers the ""only guarantee"" of future sustainability for PSA workers and sites, the PSA boss is fond of saying.The group is so far refusing to renew the multi-year job and plant guarantees that typically accompany new production investments, according to sources on both sides of the talks, who asked not to be named. Current guarantees on jobs begin expiring this year, while Opel's plants are covered until 2020.""New guarantees are not on the table,"" said one. Management is now insisting the unions come back with proposed cuts to Christmas and holiday bonuses and other supplementary pay, to offset the basic wage increase they refused to suspend.Any PSA concessions on Eisenach would have likely repercussions for Opel's Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern plants and the rest of its 19,000 German workforce. It could also undermine labor agreement across the broader group.""We too have been through tough times and made considerable sacrifices for a competitiveness deal,"" said Franck Don, a French official with PSA's centrist CFTC union.""French workers wouldn't understand it if their Opel peers were not asked to make the same concessions they had to make. It would definitely create tensions in France.""During investor pitches, however, Tavares has placed heavy emphasis on Opel's German identity as a source of export growth potential - a stance that could be undermined by major cuts. IG Metall is confident he will give ground, rather than face prolonged German strikes that could further damage Opel's standing and performance, one union official said.""The brand can't afford to take any more scratches.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shop stewards earlier this week rejected wage concessions demanded by PSA in exchange for a commitment to invest in a production line for a new model there.Lohscheller told a town hall meeting at Opel's headquarters in Ruesselsheim, western Germany, that profitability was improving but added: ""In part, our factories were twice as expensive as PSA factories.""His comments were first reported by German weekly Wirtschafts Woche and were confirmed on Thursday by a source familiar with what he said.European carmaker Opel, which PSA bought from General Motors (N:GM) for $2.6 billion, has made losses for almost 20 years, and CEO Carlos Tavares has been frustrated in his bid to cut high production costs.Opel's German sites have so far been excluded from PSA's sweeping investment plans, and management has demanded that workers in Germany forego a Christmas bonus and other benefits to help increase efficiency.Powerful German labor union IG Metall union has said however that PSA's cost targets per vehicle cannot not be met without management's making concessions on pay, and have demanded that Opel's management fulfil its pledge of allocating more production to the Eisenach plant.Spiegel magazine, citing IG Metall sources, reported that Opel would need to cut the workforce at Eisenach to 1,000 from 1,800 if existing production plans were implemented and no new models were added to the production line.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Production will rise to 100,000 vehicles from 60,000 in 2017.The French group, which is locked in labor talks with Opel's German workers, said the Luton investment was helped by ""responsible social dialogue with the Unite union guaranteeing production flexibility"", as well as UK government support.The union said 350-400 jobs would be created as a result of the investment, which PSA said would amount to about 100 million euros ($123 million). Around 1,400 people are currently employed at the site, which is Britain's only van plant.The announcement is a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of talks to decide Britain's long-term trading relationship with the European Union, although PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares underscored the need for free trade.""I take on board the assurances that the UK government have provided us on seeking tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU going forward,"" he said at the plant on Wednesday.""There is still work to do to ensure frictionless trade.""The Vivaro, which currently shares underpinnings with  Renault 's (PA:RENA) Trafic van, will in future be assembled on PSA's EMP2 vehicle platform.That will allow production of the Peugeot Expert and Citroen Jumpy to be introduced in Luton, the group said, confirming an earlier Reuters report.After rescuing PSA from near-bankruptcy in 2013, Tavares is negotiating new union deals for Opel/Vauxhall as he pursues an ambitious restructuring plan designed to restore the division's profitability by 2020.Raising pressure on Germany's IG Metall union, the division's German CEO Michael Lohscheller underlined that new deals had now been struck with workers in Britain, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Poland, allowing investment in their sites.The latest UK investment safeguards the Luton plant's future for ""many years to come"", Lohscheller said on Wednesday.PSA said it needed to boost van output to meet growing demand but could wait until 2020 to decide on future car production at its Ellesmere Port factory in northwest England, where the run of its current Astra Sports model does not end until the next decade.The British government is contributing 9 million pounds to the van investment as part of its push to support the UK automotive industry, which employs over 800,000 people and generates revenue of 77.5 billion pounds ($110 billion)."

Starting with a stellar rally in global equities in January, this quarter developed into a challenging one for stock markets with investors navigating a sharp spike in volatility, rumbling trade tensions and anxiety over the tech sector.In Europe, slowing macroeconomic indicators have been taken as a ""sell"" signal for the region's equities, which had enjoyed a lift most of last year as a narrative of stronger economic growth took hold. ""Support from attractive valuations and fading FX headwinds is not enough to override the signal from relative macro surprises,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) equity analysts, reaffirming their underweight position on European equities versus the U.S.M&A news was the main driver on Thursday.Besides Renault,  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) was also a top gainer, up 2.3 percent after a report that Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which has been in deal talks with the reinsurance firm, is looking to buy a 25 percent stake. [L8N1RB1CB]Meanwhile services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) sank 15 percent after cutting its full-year sales and profit margin outlook, reporting a weaker than expected second quarter.""Given management guidance, we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share price pressures, near term,"" said UBS analysts.Peers  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) and  Compass Group  (L:CPG) also declined 2.2 to 2.4 percent, making the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) the worst-performing. While cyclicals were ruling the roost on Thursday, defensive sectors have enjoyed something of a revival in recent weeks as investors rushed to the areas of the market traditionally seen as safer, with stable earnings and high dividends.""Should concerns about a trade war escalate, defensive stocks would likely outperform ... We would be wary of cyclicals, in particular international ones,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.Positioning on cyclicals is elevated,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts found. Both European and global funds have increased their cyclicals exposure to near the highest levels in the last decade, adding especially to financials, tech and industrials.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

134,"Mar 28, 2018 07:30PM ET",UK car output falls in February as domestic demand slumps,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car production fell 4.4 percent in February, dragged down by the seventh consecutive monthly decline in domestic demand as sales in Europe's second biggest car market continue to slump, an industry body said on Thursday. Factories churned out 145,475 vehicles last month, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). ""Another month of double-digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week's Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.London and Brussels agreed a deal which will see Britain retain free and unfettered trade with the European Union until at least the end of 2020 - 21 months after it formally leaves the EU - although trading arrangements after that date are subject to future talks.The SMMT has called on Prime Minister Theresa May to secure a long-term agreement that maintains Britain's competitiveness, since several investment decisions loom in the next 12 months. Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) will decide whether to keep open its Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant with new model investment, while Britain's biggest automaker Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) is due to choose whether to build electric cars in its home market.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renault, at the heart of a power struggle over its ownership, topped the list, with 56 percent in favour of the state selling at least some of its 15 percent stake.The survey showed, however, that a majority oppose the selling of state assets in mail operator La Poste and electricity provider EDF (PA:EDF).

137,"Mar 06, 2018 08:21AM ET",Diesel collapse gives automakers carbon headache,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Andreas CremerGENEVA (Reuters) - The accelerating demise of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining their plans to meet looming European Union CO2 goals and avoid big annual fines.Executives gathered on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices: re-engineer existing vehicles at huge expense, restrict sales of some profitable models; or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.Others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest Euro 6 diesels may yet be rehabilitated, and their fortunes restored.""I am worried,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in a Reuters Television interview.""But it's our job to solve these problems,"" he said. ""I'm firmly convinced that diesel will experience a revival.""But a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin.While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. As consumers shun diesels, more carmakers are on track to miss tougher EU carbon dioxide goals taking effect in 2020-21.SALES RESTRICTIONSSome industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the EU's 95 grammes/kilometer CO2 target.Ford (N:F) is reviewing its European line-up in light of diesel's slide and is likely to ""restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit"", a company source said.Steven Armstrong, the carmaker's head of European operations, played down that prospect.""We're not having to rethink the model line-up,"" he said. ""Of course we'll have to fine-tune the volume by powertrain by vehicle, but it's not going to be a fundamental shift for us.""VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told Reuters his business would have to consider price increases for larger models and/or restricting sales. ""We are required to be compliant (with EU targets) - which steps are necessary will become clear in 1-1.5 years. A significantly lower mix of diesels is not helpful,"" he said. Initially sparked by VW's 2015 emissions test-cheating scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of NOx emissions, the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilizing, as Mueller and others had hoped it would.Sales of diesel cars fell 8 percent in Europe last year, reducing their market share to 44 percent from a 55 percent peak in 2011. Partly as a result, average CO2 emissions increased in Europe in 2017 for the first time in a decade, according to researchers JATO Dynamics.That was before the latest PR setbacks, in which VW admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas, and a court ruled that German cities were free to ban older diesel cars - joining Paris, London and a host of other urban centers that have vowed to run them off the road.Diesel sales were down another 19 percent in Germany last month, and a whopping 24 percent in Britain, amid concern that the decline in second-hand values would give way to collapse.'TOO LATE'French carmakers, which have relied heavily on diesels to meet CO2 goals, are now scrambling for alternatives.  Renault  (PA:RENA) has stepped up development of a low-cost hybrid known as ""Locobox"", but the powertrain won't even begin rolling out until 2021.PSA Group (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares insisted last week the  Peugeot  maker remained on track. In a newspaper interview the same day, however, he urged governments to suspend penalties for non-compliance until electric car charging networks are better developed.Tavares said on Tuesday he would seek backing for his demands from Europe’s ACEA car industry lobby group, which he currently chairs.Fuel-saving 48-volt hybrids being rushed out across the Peugeot, Citroen and newly acquired Opel line-ups are not expected to arrive before 2022 under current plans.""It's not just at PSA that it's happening too late – it's happening too late everywhere,"" said Philippe Houchois, a London-based automotive analyst with investment bank Jefferies.""The cost of CO2 compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession,"" Houchois said. ""Manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets, and that's going to hit sales overall.""Already last October, investment research house MSCI was warning that ""all carmakers apart from Toyota (T:7203) are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in 2021"".The Japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its European fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in petrol-electric hybrids.  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is expected to announce a diesel phase-out in its mid-term plan, due in June.German premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock, by ramping up sales of plug-in hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out 48-volt technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups - including the two-year-old Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) E-Class.But the strategy of leaning on costly plug-ins for CO2 compliance has limits, as well as profitability perils.BMW (DE:BMWG) admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its X5 SUV, priced 600 euros below the diesel version at 72,500 euros ($89,500), despite its higher cost.""The profitability of plug-in hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines,"" a company spokesman said.That spells bigger trouble for volume brands, which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset ""compliance cars"" sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet CO2 goals.""If everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles, the prices are going to collapse,"" said one PSA Group engineer.""And since it's a market that's already quite unprofitable, people are just going to lose their shirts.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

142,"Feb 06, 2018 11:27AM ET","After profit beat, GM looks to trucks, SUVs to rev up margins",nan,"By Nick Carey and Paul LienertDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday a richer mix of full-size pickups and mid-size SUVs in North America should help it offset higher commodity costs in 2018 and maintain pretax margins above 10 percent.The automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly results as cost cutting and higher vehicle prices offset a double-digit decline in U.S. sales volume, and it predicted 2018 would be a strong year globally and in North America. GM shares rose 3.8 percent to $41.03 in late morning trade.Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts that GM expects its financial performance to ""accelerate further in 2019,"" when the company launches redesigned heavy-duty pickups and full-size SUVs in North America, as well as a new family of low-priced compacts in emerging markets.Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said GM's capital spending will remain at about $8.5 billion through 2019, then should start to ease. He said GM expects to generate free cash flow of $5 billion in 2018, with as much as $2.8 billion available for additional share repurchases.Stevens said despite recent stock market volatility over concerns the U.S. economy may be overheating, the No. 1 U.S. automaker is ""not overly concerned about inflation.""""Our forecast is premised on continued growth in the U.S. economy,"" Stevens said. He said GM expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 75 basis points in 2018.Detroit-based GM's global pre-tax margin rose to 8.2 percent in the quarter versus 6.5 percent in the same quarter in 2016. Its North American pre-tax margin was 10.7 percent.GM said results improved across all segments and its South American business had returned to profitability in the second half of 2017.The solid performance from GM underscores the current struggles of cross-town rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) to boost its own profitability. Ford's fourth-quarter automotive operating margin fell to 3.7 percent, from 5.7 percent a year earlier.Another GM rival, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Japan's biggest automaker, said on Tuesday it expects a weaker yen to lift net profit to a record high this year, offsetting sluggishness in the United States where it has grappled with lower sales and steeper discounting.GM's results came despite an 11 percent decline in wholesale vehicle sales in North America in 2017. The automaker cut its inventory of unsold vehicles during 2017 with production halts, addressing a concern for the industry. Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said ""GM has done a very nice job,"" but added he will be watching ""to make sure they keep their vehicle mix and maintain pricing."" Another thing to keep an eye on with GM is its plans to roll out electric vehicles and self-driving cars, ""which will require quite a bit of investment,"" Windau said.EXIT FROM SOME MARKETSGM also exited some markets in 2017, pulling out of India and parts of Africa, and selling its Opel/Vauxhall unit in Europe to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP).In a call with analysts, Stevens said GM's struggling operations in Korea may require ""additional restructuring.""The automaker's results come as overall U.S. auto industry new vehicle sales are in decline. Sales fell around 2 percent in 2017 after hitting an all-time record in 2016. Sales are expected to fall around another 2 percent in 2018.GM reported a fourth-quarter loss of $4.9 billion or $3.46 per share, compared with a profit of $2.1 billion or $1.36 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM posted earnings per share of $1.65. On that basis analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.38. The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will record a $7.3 billion non-cash charge for its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings related to deferred tax assets that will lose their value because of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.GM said last month it expects 2018 earnings will be largely flat compared with 2017 and forecast higher profits in 2019. For the full-year 2017, GM reported earnings per share of $6.62, above its forecasted range of $6 to $6.50.GM said as part of its profit-sharing agreement with the United Auto Workers union, its roughly 50,000 hourly workers would receive up to $11,750 for 2017, a bonus that will be paid out on Feb. 23.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He plans to use the 2017 acquisition of GM's European Opel and Vauxhall operations as the springboard for global expansion.Tavares said in his speech that by 2025 ""the PSA Group will be 100 percent electrified,"" which can mean all electric or hybrid. Tavares and a company spokesman clarified that electrification will be an option on all the automaker's vehicles by that time. Global automakers have announced $90 billion in investments to electrify future vehicles to comply with regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions.By 2030, Tavares said, 80 percent of the automaker's vehicles will offer the ability to pilot themselves under limited conditions, and 10 percent will be capable of autonomous driving.Peugeot exited the U.S. market more than 20 years ago, run out by Japanese competition and shifting customer tastes. Tavares, the former Renault-Nissan executive who took over the company in 2014, has previously outlined plans to slowly re-enter the U.S. market, starting with ride services.Last year, Tavares acquired GM's European Opel operation after GM decided to divest the money-losing operation.Tavares on Wednesday outlined a three-step process for re-establishing Peugeot in the U.S. market, the world's second largest, and compete on GM's home turf.Peugeot already is beginning to offer ride services in the United States through its Free2Move brand, using other companies' cars. ""Mobility…is at the heart of our strategic plan,"" Tavares said.Next, Tavares said, will come ride services using Peugeot cars. The third step will be to sell Peugeot vehicles in the United States designed by Opel engineers who worked for GM.Opel engineers can ""ensure the future products for this market will be fully U.S. compliant"" not just from a regulatory standpoint, but also with consumer tastes, Tavares said.Peugeot has ""people working on cars now"" for the U.S. market, Tavares said.In addition, Tavares said Peugeot will announce soon a deal to establish additional manufacturing capacity in Southeast Asia. He did not elaborate during a question and answer session.Tavares also sidestepped a question from Crain Communications group publisher KC Crain about whether he would be interested in acquiring brands from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. Tavares joked that Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne should call him, but then said that he has enough on his plate ""for the time being.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There was no year-on-year comparison for Iran, but sales in Latin America jumped 12 percent from 2016.Sales in China fell sharply, though PSA said sales have shown signs of stabilising in recent months. Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato told BFM TV that he was far more confident on China than a year ago.PSA said it increased market share in all of its main European countries apart from the United Kingdom, where the company is grappling with difficulties at the Opel-Vauxhall business acquired last year.The group also reported solid sales for Peugeot and Citroen light commercial vehicles (LCV) in overseas markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.In 2016 the company unveiled a strategic plan that built on a previous two-year recovery that hauled the company back from near-bankruptcy to its highest profitability in 14 years, helped by a government-led bailout.""We currently hold Peugeot shares in our portfolio,"" said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Meriem Mokdad.

A buoyant auto sector, fresh dealmaking activity and a better-than-expected update from chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor also buoyed sentiment, lifting the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up as much as 0.4 percent to levels last seen in August 2015. The pan-European index pared some of the opening gains and was up 0.2 percent by 1000 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) added 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE (FTSE) was flat.The European auto index (SXAP) led sectoral gainers, up 1 percent to its highest since May 2015, extending last week's strong rally on upbeat prospects for the sector this year.Italian-American automaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) rose as much as 3 percent to a new all-time high after a note from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) highlighting the potential of a spin-off of its Jeep brand. ""2018 is an extremely important year for Jeep from a product and strategic perspective, which we believe can gain investor attention and continue to unlock the discount on the stock,"" analysts at the U.S. brokerage said.Elsewhere in the sector France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) was up 1.2 percent, while Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose between 0.3 and 1.7 percent.

The chipmaker reported preliminary sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter, above the upper end of its outlook range announced in November.""While the higher sales level is positive news, key for the investment case will be the business volume with Apple over the coming years,"" said Baader Helvea analysts. Micro Focus  (L:MCRO) however plummeted 14.5 percent, leading losers on the STOXX following its half year results, which missed some analyst expectations.

154,"Jan 05, 2018 09:01AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan sets up $200 million fund to tap startups: sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is pooling $200 million in a new mobility tech fund, three sources said, in the latest move by major carmakers to adapt to rapid industry change by investing in startups through their own venture capital arms.The fund, due to be unveiled by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn at the CES tech industry show in Las Vegas next Tuesday, will be 40 percent financed by  Renault  (PA:RENA), 40 percent by Nissan (T:7201) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi (T:7211).""It will allow us to move faster on acquisitions ahead of our competition,"" one of the alliance sources told Reuters.Frederique Le Greves, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, declined to comment. The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.Wary carmakers are struggling to embrace changes and technologies that some of their executives are only beginning to grasp. To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds.BMW (DE:BMWG) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker.Among others that have been increasingly active are General Motors' (N:GM) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) 100 million-euro investment arm.CVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups.The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition.It represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France's Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three.The fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans.Despite Nissan's ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. (T:2432)Renault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault's RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership.Most or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture's portfolio, the sources said.($1 = 0.8286 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index dipped 0.3 percent in early deals, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) fell 0.4 percent.Autos stocks (SXAP) sank 2 percent, set for their biggest daily fall since July last year, dented by weaker car registrations data. New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.A trader also pointed to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales. Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were all among top fallers, down 2.4 to 2.8 percent.Basic resources stocks also fell back, with the sector index (SXPP) down 0.8 percent.

The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to ""buy"" from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) up 2.4 percent after the company secured several new orders. The Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We are all aware of the challenges that lie ahead of us.""The maker of VW's top-selling Golf hatchback expects to significantly improve underlying earnings this year from the 1.9 billion euros in 2016, which would mark the brand's first profit gain year-on-year since 2011, Diess said at a news conference.Profit will be driven by a growing number of more lucrative sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), whose share of overall brand sales may triple to about 40 percent by 2020 from currently 14 percent, the CEO said, citing the redesigned Touareg and an all-new T-Cross due to hit dealerships in 2018.""With SUVs, we are earnings the money we need to fund the shift towards electric mobility,"" Diess said, referring to the brand's accelerating push into zero-emission vehicles.The VW brand, which has been undergoing heavy restructuring for about a year, said it has kept fixed costs broadly stable this year despite growing spending on model launches.The carmaker said it will achieve 3,800 job cuts in Germany by the end of 2017, a year after it agreed with unions to slash 23,000 positions via natural attrition by 2020."

163,"Nov 29, 2017 11:39AM ET",Exclusive: PSA seeks Opel refund from GM over CO2 emissions,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Peugeot  maker PSA Group, which paid General Motors 1.3 billion euros for Opel, now wants about half of the money back after discovering the full extent of its CO2 emissions challenges and exposure to European fines, sources told Reuters.PSA (PA:PEUP), which completed the acquisition in late July, said earlier this month it will need to move Opel models onto its own more fuel-efficient technology faster than planned, in order to cut carbon dioxide emissions before new EU limits are phased in from 2020-21, backed by hefty penalties.The French carmaker has told GM (N:GM) it believes it is owed more than half a billion euros and intends to pursue a legal claim on the grounds that it was misled about Opel's emissions strategy, two people familiar with the matter said.PSA is seeking 600-800 million euros, according to one.The companies have discussed the grievances raised by PSA, which has yet to initiate a formal claim, sources close to both manufacturers said.""We are not aware of any claim submitted by PSA regarding future CO2 targets and we cannot speculate on issues that have not been raised with us,"" GM spokesman David Caldwell said. He declined to say whether Opel emissions had been discussed.""PSA undertook a robust due diligence process including their employees and many experts and lawyers,"" Caldwell said. ""We provided them with substantial information.""PSA spokesman Bertrand Blaise declined to comment. The group's shares fell 3.3 percent to 17.41 euros by 1600 GMT.Carmakers are scrambling to reduce carbon emissions by the 2021 deadline, when their individual EU-imposed limits will fall to an average 95 grammes per kilometer from 130 grammes today. A decline in diesel sales is complicating their task, as consumers switch to less fuel-efficient gasoline cars.The challenge is sparking big investments in smaller engines and new powertrain technologies, from battery-powered cars to rechargeable hybrids. For those who miss their targets, fines of 95 euros per vehicle, per excess gramme of CO2, could add up to hundreds of millions of euros annually.PSA believes GM misrepresented Opel's CO2 challenges and emissions trajectory during negotiations and due diligence prior to the March acquisition deal and its formal closing on July 31.Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has publicly hinted as much.""We became aware a few weeks after we finalised the closing that the company was going to the wall on CO2 emissions,"" the PSA boss told reporters on Nov. 9, after presenting a heavily revised turnaround plan at Opel headquarters near Frankfurt. PSA shares have since fallen 13.5 percent, underperforming peers.""We put our teams to work to completely rebuild the product and technology strategies,"" Tavares said. ""If you fail to comply (with EU rules) the weight of fines you are hit with can threaten the company's existence.""'ENORMOUS LOSSES'Among the unpleasant surprises was a CO2 compliance plan that relied on significant sales of the Opel Ampera-e electric car, a U.S. import based on GM's Chevrolet Bolt, at a loss approaching 10,000 euros per vehicle, two sources said.""Their technical solution was economically unviable and would have led to enormous losses,"" said one. ""So the first thing you do is drop that (product) line, but then the fleet emissions explode.""Under PSA, Opel has already suspended Norwegian sales of the Ampera-e - which account for most of the model's 1,500 deliveries to date - and increased European pricing by as much as 5,700 euros.Paris-based PSA may struggle to convince GM's lawyers - and ultimately an arbitration panel - that it was not already well aware of Opel's weak emissions track record and outlook.Presenting the deal alongside Tavares almost five months before it closed, GM boss Mary Barra cited ""increasing regulatory and compliance costs"" as a key reason to offload Opel and its Vauxhall sister brand. ""The Opel/Vauxhall business model has become more difficult,"" she said. Prior to the sale, Opel was on course to miss its CO2 target by 3.7 grammes, according to a PA Consulting study published in November 2016. Stripping out the Ampera-e, then projected to reach 20,000 annual sales, the overshoot rose to 6 grammes.""We've been reporting for years that Opel/Vauxhall would have significant problems meeting the CO2 targets as GM brands in Europe,"" said Thomas Goettle, the firm's head of automotive.""Opel is five to seven years behind with their engine lineup,"" Goettle said. ""We haven't seen any big GM investments in Opel to develop plug-in hybrids or zero-emissions cars.""'UNDER THE RUG' But Opel's real situation turned out to be even worse, PSA sources said, with the company on course to miss its CO2 goal by more than 10 grammes - a multiple of the ""slight overshoot"" discussed in deal negotiations. A margin that large would incur EU fines approaching 1 billion euros.The gap partly reflects GM's unrealistically high diesel sales assumptions and reliance on the Ampera-e, they said. ""People who had worked on the closing realized quite quickly that there were these big discrepancies,"" said one. ""They had been swept under the rug.""PSA is now rushing out electric or plug-in hybrid versions of Opel's Corsa, Grandland X and Crossland X models that were not part of the original plan it presented in March.The entire Opel lineup will be redeveloped with the French carmaker's vehicle architectures and engines by 2024, three years earlier than initially planned, Tavares said on Nov. 9.""Given comments about the need to accelerate the transition of Opel vehicles to PSA technology, we assume PSA will write down the value of its investment in Opel,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said afterwards, predicting more than 1 billion euros in writedowns over the next five years.The company paid for Opel with 650 million euros in cash and another 670 million in warrants that later convert to PSA stock. PSA and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) also bought Opel's sales financing arm in a separate 900 million-euro transaction.The acquisition deal, published in GM regulatory filings, provides for compensation payments if either party has been misled. Claims not settled by negotiation are referred for arbitration. For tax purposes, a GM payment to PSA would be treated as a deduction from the purchase price. It would also add to a European exit bill already exceeding $6 billion for GM, net of sale proceeds. That reflects a $5.5 billion charge and 3 billion euro contribution to Opel pensions, while excluding billions more in pension liabilities it kept.During the deal negotiations, GM barred Opel staff from talking to PSA and insisted the French carmaker's due diligence requests be handled by its Detroit headquarters, sources said.""One question that was asked was whether Opel could meet its 2021 emissions target,"" said one French participant. ""And the answer was 'yes'.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

164,"Nov 27, 2017 01:20AM ET","Uzbekistan opens the door, a crack",nan,"By Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov and Mariya GordeyevaTASHKENT/ALMATY (Reuters) - Sensing change in his native Uzbekistan, Hikmat Abdurahmonov plans to build a 10-storey office block and open a consultancy firm oriented towards foreign trade. In neighboring Kazakhstan, banker Umut Shayakhmetova is considering an Uzbek subsidiary.""There is hope in the air,"" she says.Their plans, commonplace in many countries, are striking because Uzbekistan, as Shayakhmetova puts it, is ""starting from zero"".Until the death last year of former president Islam Karimov, it was one of the world's most isolated states. Karimov, who came to power in communist times, kept an iron grip on the economy and politics and mistrusted both Russia and the West.Since then, foreign delegations have been beating a path to the capital Tashkent, drawn by the potential of the Central Asian country's oil and gas and vast cotton crop as well as areas such as car and food production, machinery and chemicals.They also have political concerns: Uzbeks from a long-oppressed Muslim population have been arrested for attacks on civilians in New York, Istanbul, Stockholm and St Petersburg this year that killed at least 65 people and wounded many more.Karimov's successor, his longtime prime minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has maintained the top-down political system while starting tentative reforms to an economy that had failed to create jobs, fuelling discontent.In August, the country said it would abolish, in 2019, the exit visa system that prevented Uzbeks leaving without official permission, easing the path of millions of migrant workers whose remittances, mostly from Russia, are a vital source of income.A month later it stopped sending students, teachers and medical workers to harvest cotton after a global boycott campaign, and scrapped most of the capital controls that had bolstered state reserves but stifled trade and investment.For Abdurahmonov, 36, who has run property, trade, finance and other businesses and lived in the United States, Britain, China and Singapore, the currency reform means he can focus on making money instead of tracking it down in an opaque system.""I think you can feel it in the air how the atmosphere is really changing,"" he said in an interview at his three-storey, loft-style office building on the eastern outskirts of Tashkent.""People are planning new businesses, you can see a lot of start-ups coming (to us).""'SERIOUS'While Abdurahmonov's company leases out office space, arranges foreign trade deals and provides other services for local entrepreneurs, Shayakhmetova is chief executive of Halyk Bank, Kazakhstan’s biggest lender by assets.""I have had meetings with high-level officials and I have the impression they are serious (about reforms),"" she said in the Kazakh capital Almaty. ""We are studying the market and talking to the regulator to see what their plans are.""Shayakhmetova said the bank, which has assets of $26 billion and units in Russia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, could set up a subsidiary in Tashkent in a year and a half.The World Bank named Uzbekistan one of its top 10 improvers this year for ease of doing business, citing reforms in starting a business, construction permits, protection for minority investors, tax payments and electricity supplies.Ranked 74 out of 190 countries, it was slightly ahead of China and Ukraine but well below Russia, which is 35th.""Our next target is quite ambitious – we want to be in the top 20 by 2025,"" Azim Akhmedkhodjaev, head of the state investments committee, said, citing a draft ""Investment Code"" to replace more than a hundred separate laws and regulations.The country has not tackled the more complex and potentially painful restructuring of large state enterprises, however, or joined the World Trade Organisation, and is among states perceived as most corrupt, according to watchdog Transparency International, which ranks it 156 of 176.Ordinary Uzbeks have yet to feel the full benefits of the foreign exchange liberalization, still unable to buy foreign currency in cash except on the illegal black market.GLOBAL OUTREACH, RUSSIAN FOCUSSo far this decade, Russia, China and South Korea accounted for around two-thirds of investment, with most, last year, going into oil and gas, followed by chemicals and logistics.Akhmedkhodjaev said the country had attracted $4.2 billion so far this year, including $3.7 billion in direct investment or FDI, compared with $1.9 billion in FDI in the whole of 2016.According to World Bank data issued before Akhmedkhodjaev spoke to reporters this month, FDI inflows fell to $67 million in 2016. He did not comment on the discrepancy. http://reut.rs/2A4bDjyThe drop followed high-profile disputes with investors such as Britain's Oxus Gold and Russian mobile phone operator MTS and a drop off in Chinese investment once a gas pipeline was built.This year, France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) announced a joint venture and Turkish firm Gentes Yapi ve Endustry Tesisleri Ltd Sti signed a deal to build a large logistics facility.That marked an easing of ties strained by Turkey granting asylum to a leading Uzbek opposition figure, although he and others have yet to return because, while some critics have been freed from jail, others have been detained.Akhmedkhodjaev listed United States, Germany and Japan among investors this year, a reflection of the president's global outreach, while the main inflow, almost a billion dollars, was expected to come from Russian energy giant LUKOIL (MM:LKOH).Mirziyoyev has described Russia as a strategic partner, and Russian central bank data shows $2.7 billion in money transfers from Russia to Uzbekistan last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

170,"Nov 09, 2017 09:58AM ET",Honda says it could not absorb 10 percent tariff after Brexit,nan,"By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Honda (T:7267) cannot afford the 10 percent export tariff that would be imposed on its British-built cars if Britain had to return to World Trade Organization rules after Brexit, it said on Thursday.The warning is the latest from a car industry worried Britain might lose access to the European Union's single market and customs union when it leaves the bloc in 2019. The auto industry has been a rare manufacturing success story for Britain, with production reaching a 17-year high in 2016. But with Brexit talks at an impasse, several of its mostly foreign-owned manufacturers have warned they might have to move work elsewhere if favorable trading terms are not maintained.""A 10 percent tariff would make our vehicles uncompetitive, and would impose costs we cannot afford to absorb,"" Honda said in a submission to parliament's business committee.The Japanese carmaker builds around 8 percent of Britain's 1.7 million cars at its southern English plant in Swindon.Ministers have repeatedly said they will seek a deal which guarantees the freest possible trade with the EU, the car industry's biggest export market. Honda, which has been less vocal on Brexit than its peers over recent months, also said any work on customs could divert funds from rolling out greener vehicles. ""Tying up capital in mitigating customs risk would reduce the amount of resource we could dedicate to introducing new hybrid and electric vehicles into the UK marketplace,"" it said. In submissions to the committee, Honda, Ford and Vauxhall - the British arm of Peugeot-owned (PA:PEUP) carmaker Opel - called for a transitional deal that would come into force after Britain formally leaves the EU in March 2019. Vauxhall warned that without clarity on trading arrangements after that date, the firm would have to stockpile components to mitigate against any customs checks that would slow the movement of goods between Britain and the continent.""To protect our ‘Just-in-Time’ operations we would have to invest in warehousing to enable stocking of parts to accommodate any delay at the border,"" the company said in its submission. Ford, which operates two engine plants in Britain, also warned that any additional customs checks, excise duties and procedures as a result of Brexit could ""have a serious and negative impact on cash-flow.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

176,"Oct 24, 2017 11:58AM ET","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",nan,"By Nick Carey and Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) posted stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit for the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by cost-cutting and a shift to higher-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, and its shares jumped to a record high.GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker's operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year's record performance. The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days' supply by the end of the year. GM, rival  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), and heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America. In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks. GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). Some of GM's share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company's profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, ""and we expect that in 2018 as well,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market. GM's share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report. GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. GM had 76 days' supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company's wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The spokesman said the 400 job cuts - which amount to about a quarter of the facility's staff - would be carried out via a voluntary redundancy plan.This and a move towards a single-shift operation will be discussed with employees representatives over a 45-day period.PSA is committed to the Opel Astra plant at Ellesmere Port, the spokesman added, while pointing that current manufacturing costs there were ""significantly higher"" than those of the benchmark plants of the PSA Group in France.PSA's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had said last month that it was hard to decide upon the group's strategy for Vauxhall given lack of clarity over Britain's plans to leave the European Union.The spokesman on Friday said PSA would be in a position to consider future investments once it has visibility on Britain's future trading relationship with the EU and once the plant's competitiveness has been addressed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Brazil is seen by Peugeot, a Groupe PSA company, as one of five priority markets in the world, said Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato to reporters in Sao Paulo on Wednesday.""Sales volumes are not our outright target. I prefer to boost our brand image,"" he said.""We are not going to fall again in the temptation of developing a small car specifically for Brazil, we are not going to sell at any price,"" he added, detailing the plan for the Brazilian market to converge to the same set of models Peugeot offers in Europe in five years' time.France, Iran and China are currently the largest markets for Peugeot. He declined to cite a target for Brazil or Latin America, but said the fact the firm has defined the country as a priority underscores the potential it sees for future brand development.According to Brazilian car dealers association Fenabrave, Peugeot sold 19,128 vehicles in the country this year, accounting for a market share of 1.22 percent. Its French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) has 7.79 percent share while the leader General Motors (NYSE:GM), 17.9 percent.Peugeot is also looking to offer high-end models such as premium SUVs. In June it launched its 3008 model in Brazil and said there was a four-month wait for interested buyers to get the car.Imparato said the situation was a problem, due to higher than expected demand, but also an opportunity.The company will next year sell the 5008 version of the car in Brazil.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The new company will be led by Barry Engle, currently GM executive vice president and president of GM South America.Engle will be based in Detroit and report to GM President Dan Ammann. Engle joined GM in September 2015.GM's Latin American and Asia/Pacific operations both lost money in 2016, excluding profits from GM's operations in China.“Our strategy (is) to refocus our traditional business operations to free up the resources and financial power needed to really step into the next chapter of the automotive industry,” Stefan Jacoby, executive vice president of GM's International Operations told Reuters. Jacoby will retire at the end of this year.On Monday GM outlined plans to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China.Under Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, GM has shrunk its international operations over the past five years, ceasing manufacturing in Australia and Indonesia, and significantly restructuring its Thai operations. The automaker is winding down efforts to sell cars in India and turning its manufacturing facilities there into an export hub. GM also exited Europe by selling those operations, essentially its German unit Opel, to French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). Barra's strategy is starting to win over investors.

188,"Sep 12, 2017 05:52AM ET",Carmakers face electric reality as combustion engine outlook dims,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) - European car bosses gathering for the Frankfurt auto show are beginning to address the realities of mass vehicle electrification, and its consequences for jobs and profit, their minds focused by government pledges to outlaw the combustion engine.As the latest such announcement by China added momentum to a push for zero-emissions motoring,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and PSA Group (PA:PEUP) gave details about their electric programs that could give policymakers some pause.Planned electric Mercedes models will initially be just half as profitable as conventional alternatives, Daimler warned - forcing the group to find savings by outsourcing more component manufacturing, which may in turn threaten German jobs.""In-house production is almost irrelevant to the consumer,"" Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche told reporters on the eve of the Frankfurt auto show, in the midst of a German election campaign in which automotive jobs have loomed large.The company set a target of saving 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) by 2025 to help fund the cost of its electric cars.""Daimler is the first company to state explicitly how much electric vehicles are going to hurt margins,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. ""It was brave to go first - but of course it won't be the last.""Volkswagen (VW), for its part, said it was seeking new global supplier contracts to source 50 billion euros ($60 billion) of electric car content including batteries, which are not yet manufactured competitively in Europe.""A company like Volkswagen must lead, not follow,"" Chief Executive Matthias Mueller told reporters. VW diesel emissions-cheating exposed by U.S. regulators in 2015 triggered global public outrage, dozens more investigations into test-rigging by the wider industry and a push by some lawmakers to ban diesel and eventually all engines.TIGHTENING NOOSETesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares jumped nearly 6 percent on Monday after a Chinese minister said it was a question of when, not if, Beijing bans fossil-fuel cars, tightening the noose around the combustion engine. France and Britain have promised its outright abolition by 2040.But PSA, the maker of Peugeots and Citroens, said it was concerned about the risks if consumers were left behind in the rush, and a new generation of battery cars does not sell.""If it doesn't gain acceptance in the market, then everybody - industry, employees and politicians - has a big problem,"" PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a pre-show interview with German weekly Bild am Sonntag.While Tesla has carved itself a successful premium niche, electric vehicles have yet to penetrate mass markets, with the heavily subsidized exception of Norway, and still account for less than 1 percent of global car sales.Automakers have sought to adapt to the changing tide - and in some cases distance themselves from ""dieselgate"" - by announcing multibillion-euro investments in electric cars, underpinned by plans to sell millions within a decade.A year into the scandal, VW unveiled plans to develop 30 new electric cars and sell 2-3 million annually by 2025. On Monday it upped the goal to 80 models and said it would need four times the capacity of Tesla's ""gigafactory"" to supply their batteries.JOBS FLIGHTSince the battery is the single biggest-value item in an electric car, however, experts point out that mass adoption would shift business and jobs from European suppliers to China, which already dominates the automotive power-pack market.According to consulting firm AlixPartners, electric drivetrains including batteries require 40 percent less manufacturing labor than mechanical ones. That would hit 112,000 jobs at European suppliers, even before any outsourcing.A phase-out of combustion engines by 2030 could cost 600,000 jobs in Germany alone, the country's Ifo economic institute has warned. Chancellor Angela Merkel, on course for re-election on Sept. 24, said she was ""no friend of bans"", in a Berliner Zeitung interview published on Tuesday.Speaking to a television audience of voters on Monday evening, Merkel said the industry would need support in its transformation. ""The government still has to do more to set incentives,"" she said, without giving details. Any deepening of the doubts surrounding mass electric car uptake could vindicate  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) CEO Sergio Marchionne - one of the few car bosses who has largely resisted the plug-in vogue.""My aversion to electrification was based on pure cost issues,"" Marchionne told analysts recently, predicting that stubbornly high battery costs would combine with tightening combustion-engine regulation to choke off overall sales.Independent analyst Richard Windsor warned that far from boosting the industry, the shift to electric cars - which are expected to last longer than combustion-engined equivalents and require less maintenance - could inflict long-term damage on it.""Vehicle makers are queuing up to announce their commitment to electric vehicles but at the same time they may be cheering for their own demise,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

194,"Sep 07, 2017 08:20AM ET",The death of the car show?,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Edward TaylorPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Frankfurt's vast auto show, which opens next week, is already getting attention of the wrong kind - for its impressive list of no-shows.Besides the glaring absence of Tesla (O:TSLA) and its electric Model 3, the roster of big names staying away has grown this year to include such venerable brands as Nissan (T:7201),  Peugeot  ,  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Volvo, Jeep, Mitsubishi and Infiniti.The uncertain fortunes of the traditional car show mirror those of an industry in flux, its incumbents threatened by emissions regulation, tech giants and the sharing economy.""Car shows need a new approach,"" said Patrick Koller, chief executive of Faurecia, a parts supplier with 19 billion euros ($23 billion) in global sales. ""Otherwise they will disappear.""Frankfurt and Paris host two of the world's biggest shows in alternate years, punctuated by the Detroit show in January and other events in China, Japan, the U.S. and Switzerland.But many of the traditional gatherings have seen visitor numbers fall since the turn of this century, when most new cars were still unveiled under their lights, framed by show girls.The decline may be accelerating. Paris attendance was down 14 percent last year - with fear of attacks also weighing on tourism - and January's Detroit show drew 9,000 fewer visitors.The sense of upheaval is acute in Germany, as Frankfurt prepares for its first car show opening since the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions scandal blew up. Days before the event, Chancellor Angela Merkel was urging local officials not to ban diesels, as her re-election campaign drew opposition fire over perceived government cosiness with the industry.TECH BATTLEGROUNDBut diesel scandals are just one of the problems challenging automakers and the legendary largesse of their trade shows.The emergence of tech as the main battleground for the connected, autonomous cars of the future has drawn exhibitors to competing events such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Footfall is becoming less important anyhow. Thanks to social media,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) reckons its Mercedes-Benz innovations reach the same global audience of 1 billion whether unveiled in Frankfurt or at CES - a trade-only show closed to the public, with less than a fifth of the German event's attendance numbers.""Daimler's media strategy has changed with the rising significance of tech,"" spokeswoman Bettina Fetzer said.Although Mercedes will be out in force on Frankfurt's 200,000-square meter show floor, it is ""getting more complex"" to decide how and where to showcase new products, Fetzer said.To counter the drift, show organizers and exhibitors are rethinking formats and scrambling to associate with events and brands outside the staid universe of the combustion engine.Next week's show will debut a New Mobility World forum with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as partners, while Mercedes hosts a conference under the banner of South by Southwest, the eclectic cultural gathering held in Texas. Rival BMW's (DE:BMWG) program includes TED Talks-branded presentations.Anxious not to be outdone, Paris show managers traveled to Las Vegas in January to discuss collaboration with CES, but came away empty-handed. ""There are no discussions at this time for event expansion into Europe,"" a CES spokeswoman said.""These are attempts to stay relevant in the public domain,"" said analyst Arndt Ellinghorst of Evercore ISI, a brokerage.""The way people consume products and brands is changing,"" he said. ""The days when it was enough to lure consumers to shows with half-dressed girls on car bonnets are long gone.""POP-UPSThe modernization efforts have not prevented Tesla, Nissan or another half-dozen brands from quitting the car-show circuit.For several years, Tesla attended the main European shows before opting out of both Geneva and Frankfurt this year - just as the North American launch of its $35,000 Model 3 makes waves.""We look for events where automobiles might be less expected,"" a Tesla spokesman said, citing golf and boat shows as well as a European summer road trip with pop-up Tesla displays along the route. ""We can reach a lot of people that way.""Nissan's decision to skip Frankfurt followed a ""full review at global level of our event and show strategy to facilitate maximum brand visibility"", the company said.Reports of the car show's inevitable demise have been exaggerated, however.As networking events up to CEO level they remain unmatched, while suppliers and new entrants are already filling gaps left by the patchier presence of some carmakers.German industrial group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is returning after a decade's absence. ""If the sector is going to change so dramatically we want to be there and show what we can do,"" said Karsten Kroos, head of the company's auto parts division.Others skipping this show will be back. Instead of turning up every year, many carmakers simply want to opt in when they have something to announce.""A car show is a marketing tool like any other, so it has to provide a return on investment,"" Peugeot (PA:PEUP) brand chief Jean-Philippe Imparato told Reuters earlier this year. ""But that doesn't mean we won't be in Frankfurt again before too long.""($1 = 0.8376 euros)"

202,"Jul 25, 2017 10:20AM ET",No more low cost: East Europe goes up in the world,nan,"By Jan LopatkaBRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Central and Eastern Europe faces the end of an economic era. With employment rates at record highs, and workers demanding wages closer to western levels, the cheap-labor model that has driven growth since the fall of communism is on the way out.The challenge that faces governments and companies in the region over the coming years is to find new avenues to growth. A walkout at the Volkswagen factory in Bratislava last month, the first strike at a major Slovak car plant, led to a staggered 14 percent pay hike in what has become the latest and starkest sign of the shifting economic landscape. VW was one of dozens of big Western manufacturers beating a path to Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary after the fall of communism in search of cheap labor.The rush eastwards marked the birth of an economic model that transformed the region. But a quarter of a century down the line, the regional labor market is running dry, with record low unemployment rates of around 3-7 percent across the region. As a result wages are rising faster than in the West - led by Hungary with a 12.8 percent year-on-year leap in March. For graphic on wages and productivity in Central and Eastern Europe click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2vX7kB3Zoroslav Smolinsky, the VW Slovakia union leader who engineered the strike, had joined the production line in 1992, when the plant had just been taken over by Germany's VW (DE:VOWG_p). He was paid the equivalent of 75 euros a month at the time. ""We could live on it,"" he said. ""We had to.""Today Volkswagen's 12,300 workers in Bratislava earn an average of 1,804 euros a month. Such rates, however, remain less than half the average Volkswagen pay packet in Germany, and Smolinsky says such huge disparity can no longer be justified. ""Times have changed,"" the 48-year-old said. ""We're in the EU and have to keep up with trends and gradually narrow the gap.""The strike was resolved with the wage increase phased over more than two years, as well as a 500 euro one-off bonus for each employee and an extra day of holiday. VW is not alone in facing rising labor costs and strife. French carmaker  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and South Korea's Kia (KS:000270) have both raised pay this year in Slovakia, while Audi and Mercedes have faced strike threats in Hungary. The moves by the car makers are particularly significant because the auto industry represents the lion's share of foreign investment in Central and Eastern Europe. Volkswagen units, for example, are the biggest companies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, while Slovakia has become the world's top carmaker per capita, producing more than 1 million a year.Moscow-based investment banking group Renaissance Capital said foreign investors would not abandon existing projects in the region, but new investments were likely to go elsewhere.""Never again is Central Europe likely to offer what it did in the 1990s,"" it said in a note to investors. TURKEY, NORTH AFRICACompanies are taking steps to improve productivity via methods like increased automation in order to offset rising costs, say executives, policymakers and analysts. In the longer-term some could go to other countries instead in search of cheaper labor.Volkswagen signaled it could steer clear of Slovakia for future investments if faced with another costly showdown with workers.Another sharp rise in wages would ""threaten the stability of jobs"", Lucia Kovarovic Makayova, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen Slovakia, told Reuters. ""It could happen that the group gives preference to a factory with lower personnel costs when deciding on sourcing production of the next product."" Renaissance Capital said investors in search of cheap labor would ultimately look further south and east.""When European business confidence is high again, we think the next wave of investment expansion will lap the shores of Turkey and the southern Mediterranean,"" it added, also singling out Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and possibly Ukraine and Iran.Filip Eisenreich, CEO of Czech ventilation and cooling system producer Janka Engineering, a unit of India-based Lloyd Group, said his company was raising wages by 7-8 percent this year and was ""pretty much on the edge"" in terms of labor costs.""Further growth (in wages) without concurrent growth in productivity would not be sustainable for us,"" he told Reuters.While labor productivity has long been lower than in Western Europe, ""this difference has so far been compensated for by lower wage costs, but those rise faster every year than in western European countries"", he added. Radek Spicar, vice-president of the Czech Confederation of Industry, said intensifying wage pressures were forcing firms to automate more, something his organization trains. Seminars ""have been packed to the roof"", he said.SECOND-CLASS EUROPEANSThe issue of wage disparity is a highly charged one that is pervading society and politics across the region.It is at the heart of a perception among Poles, Slovaks, Czechs and Hungarians that they are seen by Western Europe as second-class Europeans. Politicians have seized on such grievances and have taken up the call for better pay. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico backed the Volkswagen strikers, while in the Czech Republic the ruling Social Democrats have erected billboards ahead of an October election declaring ""The End of Cheap Labour"". However political and labor leaders aiming to bring wages in line with the West must find alternative paths to economic success. Crucial to this, most agree, is to move industries up the value chain into higher-margin areas.Big manufacturers share less of their income with employees in Central and Eastern Europe than they do in Western Europe. In the EU, wages on average accounts for 47.5 percent of economic output, according to Eurostat - but while that figure reaches 50.9 in Germany it drops to just 40.4 in the Czech Republic.But workers in Central and Eastern Europe are less financially productive. According to OECD data, an hour of work in Germany produces 52.7 euros of German economic output, but just 19.4 euros in the Czech Republic.Part of the reason is that many Czech firms produce lower-margin components for global chains rather than the finished products that deliver higher margins and profits. ""We are not just cheaper-labor economy but also a low-cost economy,"" said Spicar. ""We are also a supplier economy, part of global production chains, with low share of final products.""Policymakers are looking to invest in higher-margin sectors.""We have to get ourselves away from the economic model based on being a low-cost economy and switch to production with higher added-value,"" said Michal Picl, head of analysis in the Czech prime minister's office.There are already examples, such as Czech government support for a plan by U.S. aircraft engine supplier GE Aviation, part of  General Electric  (N:GE), to build a 350-million-euro development and production plant for turboprop engines in Prague. Peter Stracar, General Electric's CEO for Central and Eastern Europe, said the region's future industrial success hinged on moving into higher-margin businesses. ""We must find ways to create more value-added technology in CEE and GE is at the forefront in doing so,"" he told Reuters. He said his company had hired over 2,500 highly qualified employees in Hungary in engineering, finance and software development over the past three years. The region had much to offer beyond low wages, he added, citing factors including the stability of its legal systems and its geographical proximity to the markets of Western Europe. ""It is not just a question of low cost,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

203,"Jul 25, 2017 10:10AM ET","GM profit beats expectations, promises to cut high inventory",nan,"By Nick Carey and Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit, helped by cost cuts, and promised to cut production in the second half to curtail its burgeoning U.S. inventory of unsold vehicles.The No. 1 U.S. automaker also maintained its earnings outlook for 2017 despite falling revenue.The results excluded losses from the company's European operations, consisting of its German Opel brand and Britain's Vauxhall, which are being sold to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP). GM reported second-quarter net income of $2.4 billion or $1.60 per share, down from $2.8 billion or $1.74 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, it reported earnings per share of $1.89. On that basis, analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.69.Revenue for the quarter was $37 billion, down from $37.4 billion a year earlier and below the $40.1 billion expected by analysts.Wall Street is concerned the U.S. auto industry is entering a downturn after several years of strong sales. Automakers have reported declining sales for the past four months. GM sold 30,000 fewer cars in the quarter, with much of the decline driven by lower sales to rental car agencies. GM's inventory of unsold vehicles, reflecting decisions to stockpile pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles ahead of planned factory shutdowns to retool for new models, has also stoked fears the company may have misjudged the state of the market. At the end of June, it had a 105-day supply of cars, above the 90-day supply it told investors to expect back in April. The company said second-quarter U.S. dealer inventories jumped 273,000 versus the same period in 2016.GM plans to cut North American production by 150,000 vehicles in the second half of 2017 from the first, Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters. Stevens said GM is on track to hit its North American inventories target to about 70 days' supply, and predicted sales in the second half of the year would rise to help achieve that goal. GM's CFO also said earnings would be lower in the second half but the company said it still expected to earn between $6 and $6.50 per share in 2017.""That guidance could be difficult to achieve given lower production volume, high levels of inventory and pricing concerns,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note. GM shares were down 0.5 percent at $35.66.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

205,"Jul 24, 2017 09:59AM ET",Brakes on European auto shares as cartel probe overshadows earnings,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Another wobble for European autos shares on Monday has put the regional sector on track for its worst two-day run in more than a year pointing to heightened investor caution ahead of results due over the coming week. Shares of Europe's leading carmakers fell on Monday following news that EU anti-trust regulators were investigating possible cartel action amongst them, in the latest probe of a sector whose reputation has been sullied by emissions cheating.While analysts do not see more massive fines emerging from these investigations and still expect the coming quarter's earnings reports to be relatively solid, investors appear to be steering clear of the sector.Broadly, earnings expectations for the coming quarter are upbeat and valuations, at less than eight times forward earnings, remain well below their long-term averages, according to Thomson Reuters data. But this has not been enough to tempt investors concerned about the investigations amid a widespread consumer backlash against diesel.""In my numbers and from what I’ve seen in consensus, we are going to see very decent numbers. I am afraid that this will be completely overshadowed by the negative news flow,"" said Georges Dieng, an autos analyst at Natixis.""Frankly who would have thought of a cartel? It’s the kind of risk you simply can’t quantify, so you think you’d be better off moving to another sector with more visibility and when the dust settles you can come back.""A strengthening euro <EUR=>, which has dented appetite for export-oriented sectors in recent weeks, has put the brakes on earnings forecast upgrades for autos, which have enjoyed a stellar run over the past year on the back of rebounding sales in China and as a European economic recovery gained traction.European autos' shares are down 1.6 percent in 2017, putting them among the worst performing sectors across the market. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares are the biggest laggards, down more than 7 percent with rival BMW (DE:BMWG) flirting with losses for the year after Monday's slide.""With the allegations as yet far from nefarious, we do not see justification for a new record EU cartel fine,"" said Exane's Stuart  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a top-ranked analyst on Daimler according to Thomson Reuters data, in a note to clients.""However, more ugly details could yet emerge, leaving German OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) - and the EU auto sector - still firmly in the sin bin for now,"" Pearson warned.EMISSIONS SCANDALSentiment around auto makers that have invested heavily in diesel has suffered since the first allegations of emissions cheating at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015.""The emissions scandal popped up with Volkswagen and now we have investigations into all the European OEMs,"" said Michael Punzet, autos analyst at DZ Bank.Investigations into carmakers multiplied from early this year when French and German prosecutors began probing  Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) over suspected diesel-emissions cheating. The companies deny any wrongdoing. In May, the U.S. government filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Italian carmaker of illegal use of software to bypass emission controls. Jefferies analysts estimated the maximum possible fines, capped under EU rules at 10 percent of group annual turnover: BMW could be made to pay a maximum of 9 billion euros, Daimler 16 billion and Volkswagen 24 billion.Some analysts, however, still see the valuation argument as compelling enough to stick with autos.Bernstein equity strategists pointed out the sector trades at more than one standard deviation below its historical average on price-to-book, and large valuation discounts have in the past been linked with strong future outperformance.Earlier on Monday analysts at the brokerage upped their allocation to autos in their regional portfolio.Daimler is scheduled to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, followed by Volkswagen on Thursday and BMW next week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

GMD plans to restructure the site and keep ""at least 120"" jobs.PSA had resisted the grant demand and on Tuesday circulated a letter in which GMD boss Alain Martineau assured the carmaker's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares that his existing offer was enough to safeguard GM&S operations.The stand-off was resolved after PSA agreed to extend its purchasing commitment to five years averaging 10 million euros annually from three years at 12 million euros, a spokesman for the carmaker said on Wednesday.The figures clarified earlier comments in which the carmaker had referred to a higher purchasing commitment totaling 60 million euros.Government officials played down the retreat. ""They have come up with more cash,"" said a finance ministry source. ""It's not important to us whether it's financed by orders or not.""A spokesman for Renault, which had separately agreed to inject a 5 million euro grant in addition to its own purchasing commitment, said the company had no immediate comment.($1 = 0.8681 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

209,"Jul 12, 2017 07:52AM ET",Trump and Macron may not be an odd couple after all,nan,"By John Irish and Ayesha RascoePARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's relationship with Emmanuel Macron got off to an awkward start, with a jaw-clenching handshake at a summit in Brussels before the French president rebuked the U.S. leader for his stance on climate change. The two men would appear to have little in common. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to ""make America great again"" who is unpredictable on foreign policy. Macron, 39, is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations.Trump's visit to Paris this week, to celebrate 100 years since U.S. troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain, follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world's major economies at a G20 summit last weekend.In Paris, Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors. Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport, and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship.Trump could use a friend overseas. His preference for a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U.S. president appearing isolated among world leaders. ""Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don't like, such as on climate, but we can deal with it in two ways: we can say, 'We are not going to talk to you,' or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,"" government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI. ""Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand.""POLITICAL OUTSIDERSTrump and Macron are political outsiders, the American a real estate mogul, his French counterpart a former investment banker. Both love a good deal, demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions, and have a penchant for showmanship.Like Macron, Trump will be looking for common ground.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Trump and Macron enjoyed a ""great"" relationship.""You know, Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same,"" Cohn said.Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy. Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy. He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as ""a long bilateral meeting between the two men"".Having reshaped their countries' political landscapes, both now have certain shared objectives, making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority.It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran, possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress that might derail a 9.5 billion euro ($10.9 billion) gas pipe project in which France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) has a stake.The United States and France hold differing views on Iran.On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. During the U.S. presidential race, he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, branding it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"".So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and automobile manufacturers  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to sign initial deals.'A WIN-WIN FOR BOTH'Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France's former monarchy, Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees.For Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction.""The visit is a win-win for both,"" said one French diplomat. ""Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys. Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no-fuss picture with the leader of the 'free world'"".Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner, French diplomats said. Moreover, he senses an opportunity to sway U.S. thinking and elevate the role of France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East, they added.France is the second-biggest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State.It is one reason, the diplomats say, that in his first two months as president, Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin, just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him.""The Russians are pleased to have a grown-up to talk to in Europe,"" a second French diplomat said.Daniel Fried, an expert on U.S.-European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself. ""By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Demand for it is continuing to grow significantly,"" the CEO said, predicting double-digit percentage sales rise.With the mild-hybrid RS5, which went on sale this month in Germany and in France next week, Audi becomes the first German premium brand to use the technology on its current vehicle lineup.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Pricing is more challenging."" U.S. new vehicle sales hit a record of 17.55 million units in 2016 after a boom that began in 2010. A glut of nearly-new used vehicles is expected to undermine sales this year. Major automakers have reported sales declines for the past three months.GM had previously announced it expected 2017 new vehicle sales in the ""mid-17 million"" unit range. Stevens told analysts that sales could fall by 200,000 to 300,000 units this year but that the automaker had ""somewhat insulated"" itself from a downturn by reducing fleet sales, which lower vehicles' residual values.""We are going to remain disciplined from a go-to market perspective,"" Stevens said. He reiterated the company's target to bring U.S. inventories of its vehicles down to 70 days' supply by December from 110 days in June.GM also expects a higher-than-expected charge for its sale of Opel to  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) (PSA)  to reach $5.5 billion versus its previous estimate of $4.5 billion due to additional costs associated with the deal.The company plans to issue $3 billion in short-term debt to cover pension liabilities that PSA will assume in order to finalize the transaction quickly, GM's CFO said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

220,"Jun 20, 2017 07:28AM ET","VW's Slovak workers strike over pay, halt production lines",nan,"By Tatiana JancarikovaBRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was hit by its first ever strike in Slovakia on Tuesday as workers began a walkout to demand a higher pay increase which could hurt the central European country's manufacturing output.About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees at its three factory facilities joined the protest, union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said, adding that production would be hit.VW said the Bratislava plant halted production lines that make Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii, Skoda Citigo and bodies for the Porsche Cayenne. More than 99 percent of the plant's output is exported. It said VW parts and machinery factories in towns of Stupava and Martin were working normally on Tuesday.The first strike at a major Slovak plant since the 1989 end of communist rule comes as economies across central Europe outpace western Europe, leading to a labor shortage that many companies worry will limit growth.On Monday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the strike action, which began as labor office data on Tuesday showed Slovakia's unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent in May, the lowest since the global financial crisis hit central Europe in 2008.""Why should a company making one of highest quality and most luxurious cars with a high labor productivity pay its Slovak workers half or one third of the amount it pays to the same workers in western Europe?"" Fico said to reporters.But VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a bigger pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability.The VW workers are seeking a 16 percent pay hike and have refused management's offer of a 4.5 percent raise this year and 4.2 percent raise next year, plus bonuses.""We deserve at least a double-digit raise,"" Smolinsky said.VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016. The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros ($2,008) a month, double the national average.That figure is also higher than the average salary of 37,000 crowns ($1,577) that VW pays at its Czech carmaker Skoda Auto.Slovakia's Finance Ministry has calculated 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage points off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, makes more than a 1 million vehicles a year making it the biggest per capita auto producer in the world.Besides VW, Kia (KS:000270) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) have plants in Slovakia and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] is building a plant due to open next year.Peugeot and Kia have raised wages at their Slovak plants by 6.3 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively.($1 = 0.8963 euros)($1 = 23.4600 Czech crowns)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

221,"Jun 16, 2017 08:42AM ET",VW brand CEO sees new models driving profit and sales,nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is making headway with efforts to raise profitability at its troubled core brand and expects strong business next year thanks to a raft of new models, the division's top executive said. The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies.More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday.""We are making good progress,"" Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo. ""2018 will be a strong year for VW,"" he said, adding a new product always helped margins.VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent.Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.""The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months,"" Diess said.Wolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars.The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017.A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed.The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford (N:F) Fiesta and an upgraded Renault (PA:RENA) Clio, all vying for the top spot.Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily.European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS.Registrations of the Peugeot (PA:PEUP) 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

222,"Jun 16, 2017 02:10AM ET","European car sales rise 7.7 percent in May, nearing pre-crisis levels",nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - European car sales rose 7.7 percent in May from the same month a year ago, industry data showed on Friday, returning to growth after a dip in April and with nearly all auto manufacturers recording sales increases. New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA). ""In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,"" the industry group said in a statement.European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms.The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain.May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki (T:7269) and Toyota (T:7203), up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), up 14 percent. Sales from the  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand. France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group (PA:PEUP), whose sales increased 4.8 percent.Sales at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent.The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent.All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent. In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

VW and Opel declined to comment.Audi CEO Rupert Stadler has come under fire for how he has handled the fallout from VW's diesel emissions scandal.He only received a five-year contract extension last month because of an agreement among supervisory board members that he would not serve out his full term, two sources have told Reuters.Pressure has built on Stadler after Munich prosecutors widened an investigation into the premium carmaker, and after Germany's transport ministry accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests.In an interview with trade publication Automobilwoche, Stadler over the weekend defended his record: ""The diesel crisis has consumed and is still consuming resources. I'm still convinced that we have initiated the right strategic steps.""Neumann, 56, planned to inform Opel's supervisory board about his decision at its next meeting on June 22, FAS said, adding he wanted to stay on only until GM completed the sale of Opel to PSA, owner of the  Peugeot , Citroen and DS brands.Opel this week said the 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) deal could be completed as early as July 31, pending regulatory approval from antitrust authorities.Neumann joined GM in 2013 to lead the U.S. carmaker's European operations, which include the Vauxhall brand, after losing out in a management reshuffle at VW.

The world's largest automaker needs higher-margin models to help fund a strategic shift to electric and self-driving cars as it grapples with billions of euros in costs for its emissions scandal.The Arteon, featuring adaptive cruise control and enhanced emergency braking and steering functions, resembles VW luxury brand Audi's A5 Sportback with its long wheelbase, extended hood and lowered roofline.""Cars like this have until now been the domain of premium carmakers,"" VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told reporters. ""With the Arteon we are trying to gain a foothold in this business.""It's not the first time the VW brand has pushed upmarket. In 2002, it launched the executive Phaeton saloon which was axed last March after never meeting VW's original sales target of 20,000 cars per year.VW aims to sell up to 40,000 Arteons a year worldwide, Diess said, about the same as the predecessor CC saloon which ceased production last October. The Arteon is the latest example of a post-dieselgate product overhaul at the VW brand to revive profitability which has been lagging rivals such as PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and Toyota (T:7203).VW will present redesigned versions of the Polo subcompact, one of its all-time bestsellers, in June and the flagship Touareg SUV in September, after it launched an overhauled Tiguan compact SUV last year.Research firm IHS Markit expects the German brand's new top-of-the-line model to beat sales expectations easily.Deliveries of Arteons in core markets of Europe, China and North America may more than double to 81,172 cars by 2025 from 39,265 next year, IHS said.By comparison, IHS expects sales of BMW's 4-Series Gran Coupe to plunge 16 percent to 40,562 models by 2025 while it sees sales of the Mercedes CLS jumping 10 percent to 23,856 cars.IHS says China will account for about half of global sales of the Arteon, which will be built in VW's biggest market and at a factory in Emden, Germany.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

228,"May 25, 2017 03:27PM ET",GM is accused in lawsuit of cheating on diesel truck emissions,nan,"By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) was accused in a lawsuit on Thursday of rigging hundreds of thousands of diesel trucks with devices similar to those used by Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), to ensure they pass emissions tests.The proposed class-action lawsuit covers people who own or lease more than 705,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups fitted with ""Duramax"" engines from the 2011 to 2016 model years.It said GM used at least three ""defeat devices"" to ensure that the trucks met federal and state emission standards, even if they generated more pollution in real-world driving. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Detroit.""These claims are baseless and we will vigorously defend ourselves,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said.He added that the trucks comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards and California's own tough emissions standards.The lawsuit alleges violations of racketeering and consumer protection laws, and seeks remedies including possible refunds, restitution for lost resale value, and punitive damages.It adds to legal problems for Detroit-based GM, which has already paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths.GM joins VW, which has admitted to cheating, and at least four other automakers whose diesel emissions have been scrutinized by regulators or consumers.They include Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA),  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA)GM shares were down 74 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $32.46 in afternoon trading, after earlier falling as much as 3.8 percent.RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimated that one-eighth of GM's full-sized pickups have diesel engines, and said ""negative publicity"" from the lawsuit could steer prospective buyers to  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) or Fiat Chrysler's Ram division.EXCESS POLLUTANTSAccording to the lawsuit, ""on-road"" emissions testing conducted for the plaintiffs found that Duramax-engined trucks produced nitrogen oxide pollutants two to five times higher than allowed, and ""many times"" higher than gasoline-engined trucks.Modifying the engines to meet emissions standards would reduce performance, horsepower and fuel economy, the 184-page complaint said.Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] was also named as a defendant for having allegedly helped develop the defeat devices, in an ""unusually close"" collaboration with GM.Bosch spokeswoman Alissa Cleland said that company will not discuss matters being investigated or litigated.The named plaintiffs are Andrei Fenner of Mountain View, California and Joshua Herman of Sulphur, Louisiana.They said they would not have bought, or would have paid less for, their respective 2011 Sierra and 2016 Silverado trucks had they known about the alleged rigging.Their law firms include Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, which helped reach multibillion-dollar settlements for VW owners and dealers and has brought similar claims over GM's diesel-equipped Chevrolet Cruze.Hilliard Munoz Gonzales, which handles many GM ignition switch lawsuits, also represents the plaintiffs.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit accusing Fiat Chrysler of using software on 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014 to evade emission standards.Fiat Chrysler has denied wrongdoing. It also faces a separate Justice Department criminal probe on emissions.The case is Fenner et al v General Motors LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, No. 17-11661.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

230,"May 24, 2017 03:00PM ET",GM to cut jobs in international HQ in Singapore: source,nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) will slash headcount in its international headquarters in Singapore as part of its efforts to reduce exposure to unprofitable and unpromising markets.GM International - which oversees markets such as India, Southeast Asia, and South Korea, among others - will reduce its staff to about 50 from 180 by the year end, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. About 90 employees will leave the company by the end of June and 40 by the end of 2017.Last week, the Detroit-based automaker said it would take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore.The company plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles in India by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export.Since Mary Barra took over as GM's chief executive in 2014, the company has doubled down on a bet that it can win by being less global but more profitable in an auto industry increasingly dependent on software and services.The automaker has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus on China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services. In March, the one-time largest automaker in the world also reached a deal with France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) to sell its European operations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

231,"May 22, 2017 04:41PM ET","Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley",nan,"By David Shepardson and Joseph WhiteWASHINGTON/DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) abruptly named James Hackett as chief executive on Monday, responding to investors' growing unease about the U.S. automaker's slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime rivals and Silicon Valley.Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., whose family effectively controls the U.S. No. 2 automaker, said he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and cut costs, but did not offer specifics on how the new CEO should change operations.""The clock speed at which our competitors are working …requires us to make decisions at a faster pace,"" said Ford Jr., who plans to take a more active role at the company, according to a person briefed on the matter. Ford, which announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions last week, is expected to look at further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months, according to company officials, speaking on condition of anonymity as the plans have not been finalized. Hackett, 62, known as a turnaround expert who for the past year has led the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related projects, replaces Mark Fields, 56, who spent less than three years as CEO. Fields' abrupt dismissal caught nearly all at Ford by surprise, but concerns about the company's direction have been brewing for some time. Ford, once the most financially secure of the 'Big Three' Detroit automakers, and the only one not to take U.S. government money in the U.S. auto industry bailout a decade ago, reported record profit in 2015, but now finds itself under pressure on all sides as overall U.S. auto sales fall. Rival General Motors Co (N:GM) is aggressively targeting Ford's share of the lucrative North American truck and sport utility business, the source of 90 percent of Ford's profit.Meanwhile, investors see Ford as a laggard in the shift toward electric vehicles, self-driving technology and ride-sharing. Ford's $44 billion market value is below electric car pioneer Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) $51 billion. Bill Ford and other descendants of company founder Henry Ford effectively control the automaker through a special class of shares, but many investors share his concern that the company is running out of time.Ford shares closed up 2.1 percent at $11.10. At Friday's close, they had fallen 37 percent since Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the U.S. auto industry's recovery from the crisis last decade.The automaker has tangled with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spent more than a year criticizing the company on the campaign trail for expanding operations in Mexico and exporting U.S. jobs. A Ford spokeswoman said Trump was not a factor in Fields' departure. NO SMOKING GUN Overall U.S. auto sales are slipping after a long boom. But GM has moved faster than Ford to slash unprofitable operations, and Tesla has been quicker to deploy new technology.Bill Ford indicated the company would take more aggressive action to cut costs. ""We have to modernize the business"" and move ""decisively to address underperforming areas,"" he said. Hackett, who overhauled furniture maker  Steelcase Inc  (N:SCS) and then turned around the ailing University of Michigan football program, becomes the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry's oldest institutions.That task has frustrated many of his predecessors, including Bill Ford, who had been CEO before replacing himself in 2006 with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) executive Alan Mulally. The decision to replace Fields did not result from a single event, Bill Ford told Reuters. ""There is no smoking gun here,"" he said. ""It's more the way we are organized, the way Jim is going to streamline the organization.""As CEO of Steelcase, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Hackett slashed thousands of jobs and refocused the company on innovation.A former Ford director and interim athletic director at the University of Michigan, Hackett was tapped in March 2016 to run Ford Smart Mobility, a unit established to oversee and coordinate forays into autonomous driving, ride sharing and other ventures.In that role, he helped oversee Ford's acquisition of San Francisco ride-sharing company Chariot and its $1 billion investment in Argo AI, a self-driving startup focused on robotics and artificial intelligence.PRESSURE IN DETROITThe upheaval at Ford underlines pressure on all three major Detroit automakers to prove they can avoid losses as the U.S. market begins to slow from last year's record sales.GM CEO Mary Barra is fending off attacks from hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which wants to install new directors and split the company's stock. In March, GM sold its money-losing Opel division to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP), effectively exiting Europe in a move Barra promised would free cash for share buybacks.The shake-up at Ford may bring scrutiny to its own plans in the region. The company posted a record $1.2 billion profit in Europe last year but warned that the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union would put a dent in 2017 earnings.Under a broader shake-up announced on Monday, former Ford of Europe chief Jim Farley will become president of a new ""Global Markets"" group that will include Ford's regional sales and marketing operations around the world as well as its Lincoln luxury brand.The company is also putting government relations and corporate communications under Ford Jr., and Hackett said the great-grandson of Henry Ford would have a higher public profile. Fields, who earned $22.1 million in 2016 and had a 28-year-career at Ford, also faced a clamor for share repurchases at the company's annual meeting earlier this month. Fields declined to comment when reached on Monday.Ford said last week it would cut 1,400 staff positions in North America and Asia, a small fraction of the 20,000 job reductions some news outlets had reported were imminent.The company reported a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, but investors were concerned by a weak first quarter and lower profit forecast for 2017, as well as higher costs for investments in ""emerging opportunities.""

232,"May 22, 2017 03:58PM ET",Rouhani says hopeful Europe won't follow Trump's lead on Iran,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Iran welcomes cooperation at all levels to bring stability to the Middle East, President Hassan Rouhani told his French counterpart on Monday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump lambasted Tehran again as he tours the region.In a telephone call, Rouhani told France's new president Emmanuel Macron he was hopeful that Europe would not copy Trump's stance against the Islamic Republic.Visiting Iran's arch-foe Saudi Arabia on Sunday, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups in the Middle East, sending a tough message to Tehran the day after Rouhani won a second presidential term.He said on Monday in Jerusalem that shared concern about Iran was driving Israel and many Arab states closer, calling Tehran a real threat in the region.""The Islamic Republic is ready for cooperation in all levels with other countries, including France, to fight against terrorism and to resolve the Syrian crisis,"" Rouhani was quoted saying to Macron by Iran's state news agency IRNA. The French leader had called to congratulate him on being re-elected in Friday’s presidential vote.""We should bring peace and stability back to the region. We hope Europe does not fall into the trap of countries that promote their wrong interpretations of the region,"" Rouhani was also quoted as saying.Paris, which is at odds with Iran over the crisis in Syria, took one of the hardest lines against Tehran during negotiations between Iran and major powers in 2015, but has been quick to restore trade ties.French carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are taking advantage of their lack of U.S. operations by piling into a resurgent Iranian market that is still off-limits to rivals fearful that Trump's administration will impose sanctions.France has said it backs Trump's call to strengthen the monitoring of the deal, but that it is committed to implementing it, including the lifting of sanctions. Asked earlier on Monday whether Paris agreed with Trump's call to isolate Iran, the French foreign ministry said it would ""work toward developing political dialogue that should be part of a constructive approach with regard solving regional crises"". Rouhani said at a news conference on Monday that stability could not be achieved in the Middle East without Tehran's help.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

234,"May 18, 2017 03:40AM ET","GM will cut operations in India, South Africa",nan,"By Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets.The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India. About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said.GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a ""product onslaught coming.""GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.""What are we spending our time doing?” Ammann said. “Are we spending time pursuing opportunities … or all of our time fixing problems?”GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year. Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there. GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.PULLING BACK IN SOUTH AFRICAThe $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said. ""The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow,"" he said.In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan’s Isuzu Motors Ltd, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya.GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said.Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles.Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP), GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42.Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company’s potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM’s management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

235,"May 17, 2017 10:45AM ET",Exclusive: Opel bears fruit for Peugeot maker PSA in Aisin gearbox talks,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - PSA Group (PA:PEUP) is in talks to build Toyota-owned (T:7203) supplier Aisin's (T:7259) automatic gearboxes at one of its own plants, company sources told Reuters, in what would be an early reward for the  Peugeot  maker's purchase of Opel (N:GM).The combined scale of PSA and Opel has added impetus to negotiations with Aisin, the three sources said, helping to overcome the Japanese company's reservations.The Opel acquisition announced in March, which valued the General Motors business at 2.2 billion euros ($2.44 billion), brings ""a larger sales volume and therefore more profitability for an investment"", one source said.PSA currently buys six- and eight-speed Aisin gearboxes made in Japan and China for its Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands. Assembling the six-speed in France would secure a competitive supply, reduce currency risk and help fill its own plants.For Aisin, 34 percent-owned by Toyota and affiliates, it would establish a first European production base amid growing demand for automatic gearboxes, which currently equip about one in five PSA cars sold.Automatics are less popular in Europe than in the United States, but their growth is set to accelerate with tighter emissions rules and demand for electric, hybrid and increasingly automated cars, to which manual gearboxes are unsuited.PSA and Aisin both declined to comment, but Aisin has previously signaled an openness to partnerships.""We're absolutely not averse to joint programs with non-Toyota companies,"" President Yasumori Ihara said in January, the same month that PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares told workers at his company's Metz transmissions plant that an unspecified production deal was under consideration.But the proposal had made little headway until the tie-up with Opel, the sources said. An agreement could now be finalised within months, subject to successful closing of the Opel acquisition later in the year, and PSA managers may discuss the plans with unions in works council meetings next month. PSA plans to redevelop future Opels with its own technology - as three models already have been under an earlier partnership - boosting purchasing clout and economies of scale.Bringing production of automatic gearboxes in-house underlines their importance. Under Tavares, PSA has been outsourcing activities including some research and development to prioritize core profitability and future growth areas.One option would be for PSA and Aisin to invest jointly in a new production line at a French site.But PSA-owned production under license is more likely, reflecting the Japanese supplier's wariness over investing, sources said. That could evolve into a joint venture or outright sale once the plan had proved its worth.Either way, the production investment would pit PSA's Tremery factory near Metz, eastern France, against the northern Valenciennes plant. While Valenciennes has more automatic gearbox expertise, Metz has more spare capacity.""There's easily enough room on the Metz site,"" said Christian Lafaye, an official with the Force Ouvriere union. ""They can come and install their tooling tomorrow if they want.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

236,"May 16, 2017 05:59AM ET","Absent from America, French cars drive into Iran election",nan,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Laurence Frost and Edward TaylorLONDON/PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are turning their U.S. absence into an Iranian advantage by piling into a resurgent market still off-limits to foreign rivals fearful of sanctions under Donald Trump's administration.The French investment has been seized upon by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is seeking re-election this week, as evidence that his pursuit of a nuclear detente and attempts to attract foreign money will pay off for the economy. PSA - the maker of Peugeots and Citroens - and Renault have pushed hard into Iran since its 2015 deal with world powers that saw international sanctions lifted in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear activities. PSA has signed production deals worth 700 million euros ($768 million), while Renault has announced a new plant investment to increase its production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year.The French companies, unlike their German, American and Japanese competitors, do not have manufacturing or sales operations in the United States. This makes them less vulnerable to penalties for any violation of U.S. sanctions still in force which ban financial transactions with Iran. The prospect of a hardened U.S. stance under President Trump - a consistent critic of the nuclear deal - has deepened the caution of carmakers with large American exposures. Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) are among those that have put Iranian ambitions on hold, industry sources told Reuters.""We're well aware of the market potential in Iran but we can't afford to take any risks,"" said a source close to VW. The company declined to comment on specific investment discussions. PSA and Renault declined to comment on their Iranian operations in detail. Earlier this year, PSA's Middle East chief Jean-Christophe Quemard acknowledged that the renewed U.S. pressure under Trump was helping his company stay ahead of foreign rivals who were holding back.""This is our opportunity to accelerate,"" Quemard said. ""We've opened up a lead and we plan to hold on to it.""Early movers to establish Iranian operations could win big in a market deprived for years of affordable state-of-the-art vehicles and where sizeable import duties hand a major advantage to locally built cars.Iranian car sales jumped 50 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to data provider IHS Automotive, with models from  Peugeot , Renault and Iran's SAIPA showing solid gains.Tehran car salesman Mehdi Monfared, whose dealership mostly sells domestic manufacturer Iran Khodro's namesake brand, said he had witnessed an ""explosion"" in demand in recent months.""People are being less careful with their money and are spending their savings on cars,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""And the banks are lending."" PRESIDENTIAL PEUGEOTRouhani pushed the French investment to the forefront of his election campaign when he attended a ceremony this month to mark the production launch of the Peugeot 2008, the first product of post-sanctions manufacturing deals with foreign carmakers. ""When we signed the nuclear deal, critics said it was just a piece of paper that would never be implemented,"" the president, whose main challenger is a hardline cleric opposed to opening up Iranian markets, said in an Instagram post picturing him behind the wheel of the mini-SUV at the event in Tehran. ""But now we can see that auto industry sanctions have been lifted, joint venture agreements concluded and a new car is being built.""PSA and Renault have moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships with Iran Khodro and SAIPA. PSA plans to add more Peugeot and Citroen models in coming months, while Renault has introduced its Sandero compact alongside the Tondar sedan.By contrast VW, which had been considering a production tie-up with Iran's Mammut Khodro, has put the talks on the backburner because of the uncertainty, according to the source close to the group.""Any company operating in Iran or planning to enter the market needs to ask itself what could happen if there is a fundamental change of course by the U.S.,"" the person said.BMW has also studied production, import and distribution opportunities in Iran but concluded that the time was not right, according to a source familiar with the matter.""Once we see General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford set up shop our plans may be revived, but not before,"" the person said.A BMW spokesman said the company's future entry into Iran ""will depend on political and economic developments"", adding: ""There are currently no concrete plans."" Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) had announced undated plans for Iranian heavy truck production before Trump's November election victory, but now plays them down. ""There is hardly any economic growth in Iran, so demand for commercial vehicles is generally low,"" the company said.U.S. carmakers withdrew before the 1979 Iranian revolution as ties between the countries broke down. Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota (T:7203) have not signaled any Iranian investment plans since the nuclear deal. PRODUCTION REBOUNDNuclear-related sanctions were lifted after the 2015 agreement, but Washington has maintained its own pre-existing ban on financial transactions with Iran, making it harder for companies with a large U.S. presence to do business with Tehran.The Trump administration has also ordered a review of sanctions relief granted under the nuclear deal, despite acknowledging Tehran's compliance.But the U.S. pressure has not halted a steady recovery in car production in Iran, from 796,000 cars in 2013 to 1.23 million last year. IHS expects output to keep climbing to 1.34 million cars this year and 1.49 million in 2018, nearing the 1.65 million peak recorded in 2011.""Locally built vehicles are the bestsellers by some margin,"" said IHS analyst Michel Jacinto, an Iran specialist.South Korea's Hyundai (KS:005380) is building its Accent compact, to be followed by the i20 mini, as Chinese brands including Chery move to defend the small but growing footholds they gained while sanctions kept their European rivals out.Affordability may be an issue for some new models. The Peugeot 2008 is expected to be priced at around $24,000 when it arrives in showrooms - more than three times the average annual urban household income in Iran.Until such market realities are tested, however, the new products are being greeted with optimism.""The 2008 launch is the result of Rouhani's policy since the signing of the nuclear deal, so it was symbolic,"" PSA's Quemard told Reuters last week.Project lead times of two years or more mean the 2008 is the international agreement's first tangible result, Quemard said. ""So it's a good example - and it's being used as such.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

241,"Apr 28, 2017 12:56PM ET","Rising U.S. truck, crossover sales drive GM to record profit",nan,"By Nick CareyDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Friday reported a record quarterly first-quarter profit on robust sales of its large pickup trucks and crossovers in the United States, as uncertainty surrounds the overall pace of domestic auto sales for the industry.The results also underscore a shift where U.S. consumers are favoring larger SUVs, crossovers and trucks, instead of cars.The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it recorded the highest ever profit for a first quarter, including pre-bankruptcy which it emerged from in 2009. The stellar quarter bodes well for an industry that had disappointing sales in March.New vehicle sales hit a record of 17.55 million units in 2016, and analysts expect a slight sales decline in 2017.The results demonstrate that GM will ""continue to strengthen the core business, generate the best possible return for our owners and then continue to execute with a huge sense of urgency on the transformative technologies that are really going to allow us to have a leadership position,"" Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call.GM shares were slightly down at $34.51.U.S. sales of Chevrolet trucks and crossovers rose 3.5 percent and 12 percent, respectively, during the quarter, while GMC truck and crossover sales jumped almost 10 percent.Pretax margin profit was 8.2 percent, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier.U.S. sales of less profitable cars, however, fell compared to the first quarter of 2016. Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) reported a higher operating profit this week due to soaring SUV sales.No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford on Thursday reported lower quarterly net profit due to higher commodity, engineering and recall costs, and a drop in vehicle sales.THE THREAT OF LOWER SALES Ratings agencies have warned of worsening credit and there are concerns millions of nearly-new leased vehicles will flood the market, depressing used-car values and reducing U.S. automakers' sales. Some analysts worry automakers are relying too much on consumer discounts to push sales.Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said while consumer discounts have risen, so have average vehicle prices, which he said matters more. ""Clearly it's a more competitive market out there,"" he said. ""But that's not a surprise given that the industry is plateauing.""GM said first-quarter vehicle sales rose slightly in Europe, where it has agreed to sell its European Opel and Vauxhall operations to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP). Sales dropped more than 6 percent in the company's International Operations unit, which is dominated by China.Overall, almost all of the company's pretax earnings came from the U.S. market. ""We believe that pricing in North America, coupled with a deterioration in earnings in International Operations, will compromise earnings going forward,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.The company was hit last week when the Venezuelan government seized its plant in the industrial hub of Valencia.Stevens said GM would try to regain access to its assets via legal means. He said the automaker had not been operating normally in Venezuela for 12 to 18 months. ""We don't want to necessarily exit the country,"" he said. ""But certainly it's not an environment you can invest in or run a normal business at this point.""GM also faces an ensuing proxy fight with Greenlight Capital. Billionaire investor David Einhorn, who runs the hedge fund, has proposed creating two classes of stock at GM, one that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth.GM has rejected the plan. Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings say such a structure could hurt GM's credit rating.Einhorn has nominated three directors to GM's board.The company's net profit rose 33 percent in the first quarter to $2.6 billion, or $1.70 per share, from $1.95 billion, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share of $1.48.The company forecast 2017 full-year adjusted earnings per share of $6 to $6.50. Analysts expect earnings of $5.95.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

245,"Apr 18, 2017 09:00AM ET","Peugeot needs deeper cuts, SUVs to halt Chinese sales slide: CEO",nan,"By Joseph WhiteSHANGHAI (Reuters) - PSA Group (PA:PEUP), the maker of  Peugeot , Citroen and DS cars, needs more drastic cost cuts and new SUVs to reverse a slump in sales in China, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Tuesday.The Paris-based group must find ""a new business model"" and bigger purchasing, logistics and manufacturing savings to offset falling prices, Tavares said at the Shanghai auto show.His comments highlight the pressures felt by mid-market global carmakers as Chinese consumers turn to increasingly competitive offerings from domestic brands such as Geely (HK:0175), Guangzhou (SS:601238) and Baojun, jointly owned by General Motors (N:GM) and SAIC (SS:600104).The French carmaker builds Peugeots and Citroens in China with 13.7 percent shareholder Dongfeng (HK:0489) and assembles its premium DS models with another partner, Changan Automobile.Shares in PSA, which agreed last month to acquire rival Opel from GM, were down 2 percent at 17.22 euros at 1200 GMT, while the Stoxx Europe 600 autos index <0#.SXAP> was down 1.1 percent.Competition has intensified in China as rival western brands and their local manufacturing partners slash prices, Tavares told reporters. ""The joint ventures panicked.""The Chinese auto market expanded 15 percent overall in 2016, and growth is expected to be slower but positive this year.But PSA's sales fell 16 percent in the region last year and the decline has accelerated since. Deliveries were down by almost half in the first two months of 2017, when the Citroen brand achieved little more than one-third of its tally for the same period last year.Demand has also shifted from the saloons and hatchbacks that account for most of PSA's line-up to higher-riding models and Citroen will soon begin Chinese sales of the new C5 Aircross compact SUV, unveiled at the Shanghai show.""More SUVs in the Chinese market is a must,"" Tavares said, adding that the group needs ""much more cost reductions"".But Tavares declined to give a progress report on PSA's earlier pledge to reduce China production costs by 10 percent annually. The cuts were ""hard to achieve"", he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

247,"Apr 04, 2017 06:10PM ET",GM's German-made Buick highlights risks from trade policy,nan,"By Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Tuesday unveiled a German-made Buick crossover wagon it plans to sell in the United States, and in so doing highlighted the U.S. auto industry's vulnerability to shifting trade politics.The Buick Regal TourX, scheduled to launch later this year in the United States, is aimed at imported all-wheel drive vehicles such as those offered by Subaru and Zhejiang Geely Holding's [GEELY.UL] Volvo Cars.In a plan mapped out long before the Trump administration and Congress began talking about taxing imported goods, GM planned to build the TourX at a factory in Ruesselsheim, Germany, near Frankfurt.Asked how a potential ""border tax"" on imported goods could affect the TourX, GM product development chief Mark Reuss told reporters that such a levy might hurt, but added: ""I don't know what the border tax is.""How can you make a product plan based on something you don't know?"" he asked.Reuss said GM is making plans to deal with a border tax, which could affect not just the Regal TourX. GM imports a Buick sport utility vehicle called the Envision from China, and has electric vehicles it needs for the Chinese market that it currently builds only in the United States. China levies steep tariffs and taxes on imported vehicles.In a separate interview, the head of GM's North American operations said he is encouraged that President Donald Trump and administration officials are listening as auto industry executives explain the complex, global supply chains behind their model lineups.""It's too early to speculate, but we believe the new administration is more aligned with us than different,"" said Alan Batey, who runs GM's North American auto business and the Chevrolet brand globally. There is ""a very open and constant dialogue"" with administration officials, he said.GM's chief executive, Mary Barra, is a member of an advisory council to President Trump. The TourX was one of two new Buick models the brand unveiled at GM's design center in suburban Detroit. The other, the Regal Sportback, offered an unusual hatch opening designed to give a car that looks like a sporty coupe the functional utility of a sport utility vehicle. The hatch allows a driver to load cargo onto folded rear seats.Some engineering and production of the Regal and the TourX relied on GM's Opel operations, which are on track to be sold to France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). Reuss said that sale does not necessarily mean the end of collaboration between Buick and the German Opel operations.""Opel is still doing some of our future models,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

249,"Mar 28, 2017 04:07PM ET",GM rebuffs two-class share plan from Einhorn's Greenlight Capital,nan,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Nick Carey(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Tuesday rejected a proposal by billionaire investor David Einhorn to split its common stock into two classes to help boost its share price.In a regulatory filing, the country's largest automaker said that the proposal ""would not help GM sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow.""Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, wants management to split its common stock into two classes: one that would receive the current dividends and one that would participate in all earnings and future growth of the company.The move would lower the company's cost of capital, improve its financial flexibility and boost its market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said.To add more pressure on the company, Einhorn has said he wants to nominate directors but would not identify them.Moody's and S&P both declared shortly after Einhorn's advances became public that such a structure could negatively impact the automaker's credit rating.""Moody's believes that the Greenlight proposal would reduce financial flexibility and increase credit risk,"" Moody's Investors Service wrote in a note. ""The creation of a perpetual, cumulative dividend in excess of $2.2 billion would saddle GM with a sizable and largely inflexible cash outflow burden."" GM considered the plan too risky after mulling Einhorn's ideas for some seven months, while it was also negotiating the sale of German Opel brand and Britain’s Vauxhall to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP). It has hired two banks to help fight the plan, a person familiar with the matter said.Warren Buffett, one of GM's biggest shareholders, has not weighed in on the plan and was not immediately available for comment.Einhorn said GM's stock price has languished for years since emerging from the government-backed bankruptcy and is currently trading at the lowest valuation in the S&P 500 stock index. But its dividend yield ranks among the top 25 in the index.Under Chief Executive Mary Barra, GM has been overhauling and pruning operations outside the United States and China, shrinking sales volume while pushing to improve return on invested capital and profitability. The company has shuttered or scaled back operations in Russia, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. In February the company sold its East African unit to Isuzu Motors Ltd (T:7202). Barra has promised investors returns of 20 percent or more. GM announced earlier this month it would sell its European operations – consisting of Opel and Vauxhall - to PSA Group.But GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers. Ford Motor Co's (N:F) stock, for instance, is trading at nearly 10 times earnings, while GM is at just under 5.8 times. GM stock has also lagged the broader S&P 500 since its November 2010 IPO. Because of its poor share performance, GM could face continued pressure to return more cash to shareholders rather than holding it as insurance against a potential industry downturn.Its stock was last up 2.7 percent at $35.64.PROXY FIGHT For GM, this marks the second proxy fight in two years. In 2015, the company announced a $5-billion share buyback to end a proxy contest where investor Harry Wilson, who led the government's bailout of the automaker, was pushing for a board seat on behalf of investors. Einhorn's hedge fund owns a 0.9-percent stake in GM, making it the 17th-biggest owner. The firm has been involved with GM for some time, buying the stock in 2011, selling it when the company faced problems with an ignition switch recall, and then buying back in about a year later.GM is a cash-rich target for any activist investor. Once its Opel sale is complete, the company will target a cash balance of $18 billion, a large sum for a company with a market capitalization of just over $50 billion.""Without the dividend, the (other class of) shares would be significantly less expensive to short, potentially pressuring shares further,"" Joseph Amaturo of the Buckingham Research Group wrote in a client note. He added that GM's response was ""well-reasoned, and as such, (we) believe the likelihood of Greenlight's proposal receiving board approval is relatively low.""Einhorn has a history of pushing unique capital plans at big U.S. companies and in 2013 urged Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to issue preferred stock with a perpetual 4-percent dividend.On Tuesday, as he launched his public campaign for change at GM, he also held some things back, refusing to say who may be on his slate of directors. ""We have sent them a notice of nomination for the directors,"" Einhorn said on CNBC. ""We have not yet determined how many or which directors we will run ... We’re going to wait a little while for GM to file their proxy and so forth."" Einhorn said he supports GM management, including CEO Mary Barra, regardless of what the company decides. To be successful, Greenlight's plan will have to get the support of some large institutional shareholders, including Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), which owns 3.34 percent of GM.Some analysts say it would be a sensible move. “There is nothing radical about Einhorn's proposal. It is essentially a call for the creation of a preferred stock that will have a priority for dividends. Investors will benefit from having a choice,” said Anthony Sabino, a professor at St. John’s University’s Peter J. Tobin College of Business.GM has hired Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to push back against Einhorn's proposal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The banks declined to comment.GM said it expects to return about $7 billion in cash to shareholders in 2017, bringing total cash returns to about $25 billion since 2012.

""I haven't seen Marchionne for months,"" he had added. Marchionne has long advocated car industry mergers to share the costs of making cleaner and more technologically advanced vehicles and has repeatedly relayed his desire via the media.""It would be very helpful if Mr. Marchionne were to communicate his considerations to me too and not just to you,"" Mueller said.The purchase of General Motors' (N:GM) Opel division by PSA Group (PA:PEUP) leaves FCA in an increasingly difficult position in Europe.The indebted group has a European market share of only about 7 percent, and its operating margin of 2.5 percent lags most rivals, as does its spending on cleaner and more autonomous cars.Mueller declined to discuss whether the PSA-Opel deal could reinforce consolidation among carmakers in Europe and said VW would in any case press on with its strategic shift to embrace electric cars and automated driving.""I am pretty confident about the future of Volkswagen, with or without Marchionne,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

254,"Mar 08, 2017 07:59AM ET",Fiat Chrysler's merger options dwindle as Volkswagen rejects overtures,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Agnieszka Flak GENEVA (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) boss Sergio Marchionne's attempts to find a partner were frustrated for a second time in as many days on Wednesday, as Volkswagen (VW) joined General Motors (GM) in dismissing any interest in talks with their smaller rival. Marchionne said on Tuesday that European market leader VW (DE:VOWG_p) would be hardest hit by PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) purchase of Opel, which will create a stronger European No. 2, and the pressure could prompt VW to sit down with FCA. But VW chief Matthias Mueller was quick to rebuff the overtures, saying his company had enough on its plate already as it battles to recover from a diesel emissions scandal. ""We are not ready for talks about anything ... we have other problems,"" he told Reuters on the fringes of the Geneva auto show on Wednesday. ""I haven't seen Marchionne for months.""Marchionne has long advocated car industry mergers to share the costs of making cleaner and more technologically advanced vehicles and on Tuesday stressed deals were as vital as ever. ""You need to achieve scale or we will end up delivering an incredibly poor return and margins on this business. We need to fix this,"" he said, referring to the wider auto industry.The PSA-Opel deal leaves FCA in an increasingly difficult position in Europe. The indebted group has a European market share of only about 7 percent, its operating margin of 2.5 percent lags most rivals, as does its spending on cleaner and more autonomous cars.Mueller's rejection follows a similar snub from GM (N:GM), after Marchionne said the U.S. company remained his favorite merger candidate despite its decision to exit Europe by selling Opel and having rebuffed FCA's approaches several times already.""We weren't interested before and we're even less interested now,"" GM President Dan Ammann told reporters in Geneva.A combination of VW and FCA could in theory create a European market leader with a share of around 30 percent, give VW a strong foothold in North America through FCA's Chrysler operations and fix FCA's lack of scale in Asia. But the combination could also mean thousands of job losses that unions and politicians from Italy to Germany would strongly oppose. Mueller also stressed scale was not a priority for VW. ""In my opinion, size does not matter,"" he said. ""I have always said volume is not our sole goal. We want to be a successful manufacturer in every way.""DIESELGATE WOESMarchionne is courting VW at the worst possible time. The German company is at the start of a multi-billion-euro transformation to embrace electric cars and automated driving as it struggles to overcome its emissions scandal. While grappling with billions of costs for fines, buy-backs and other charges in the United States, VW is also facing a mounting challenges from consumer groups seeking compensation.The group is battling with its powerful labor unions too about cost cuts to fund its new strategy. Since being rejected by GM, Marchionne has focused on eliminating debt and shifting production towards higher-margin vehicles, including SUVs, to become a more attractive merger partner in future. But his options appear to be dwindling. ""In western countries we believe that Volkswagen remains the main candidate for M&A, but after dieselgate, which likely stopped everything for a while, the top candidates for an FCA deal moved to the East (Koreans or Chinese), with all the risks on timing and political consequences that they would bring,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM. Some analysts also question why anyone would buy FCA now when the price could be set to fall, given the North American market - where it makes most of its profits - may be peaking.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

255,"Mar 07, 2017 01:52PM ET",VW brand to lift profitability as cost cuts work: CEO,nan,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) core brand will improve profitability and gain market share this year after posting stable operating results in 2016 thanks to cost cuts, brand chief executive Herbert Diess said.The namesake brand, the group's largest by sales, is cutting thousands of jobs via natural attrition, streamlining development processes and reducing the number of parts to revive profitability which has been lagging rivals such as Toyota (T:7203) and PSA Group (PA:PEUP).The Volkswagen (VW) brand last year cut fixed costs by about 300 million euros ($320 million) in Germany alone, destination of over 9 percent of global deliveries of 6 million cars, Diess said at a press conference on Monday at the Geneva auto show.""Our work is already paying off. We have put ourselves in an excellent starting position for 2017,"" said Diess, who was known as a cost-cutter at BMW (DE:BMWG) before he joined VW in 2015.Despite progress on cost cuts, brand management and the carmaker's unions have been struggling to implement a cost-cutting plan dubbed future pact, designed to lift profitability. The brand accounts for nearly half of group sales but no more than 11 percent of its underlying earnings.VW group swung back to record operating profit before special items last year, powered by record deliveries of high-margin Audi and Porsche models.

256,"Mar 07, 2017 09:03AM ET",Autos bosses focus on technology rather than PSA-Opel,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Andreas CremerGENEVA (Reuters) - The auto industry is facing seismic changes with the rise of electric vehicles, automated driving and car sharing set to eclipse even big mergers such as PSA's purchase of Opel, executives at the Geneva auto show said. Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) said on Monday it had agreed to buy loss-making Opel from General Motors (N:GM), creating Europe's second-biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and sparking speculation of more consolidation. However, some auto executives gathering in Geneva said the deal was unlikely to alter the landscape on its own, with changing consumer habits and new rivals in Silicon Valley and China all likely to have a much bigger impact on carmakers.""My feeling is that the industry as a whole and brand positioning will change in the next 10 or 15 years, and that comes in addition to traditional consolidation,"" said Herbert Diess, head of Volkswagen's (VW) passenger car division.""We are really in a transitionary phase for the industry. There are new competitors on the horizon like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Chinese ventures,"" Diess told reporters, adding that he did not expect a wave of Opel-style mergers.Volkswagen (VW) is investing billions of euros in electric vehicles, automated driving and new mobility services, in part as it tries to recover from a costly emissions test cheating scandal that has hit demand for diesel vehicles. The company, which is also cutting costs, is unveiling a fully self-driving concept car at the Geneva show.Karl Schlicht, head of European sales at Japan's Toyota (T:7203), also played down the impact of the PSA-Opel deal, which brings together carmakers with a heavy focus on diesel and low-margin fleet vehicles.""We ran a counter strategy in Europe which may not look as successful for some past years because our volumes were a bit lower, but in terms of where we want to end up, it's turning out to be a good strategy,"" he said, referring to Toyota's investment in hybrid vehicles. Toyota forecasts its European sales will rise 5 percent this year while the market is expected to grow just 1 percent amid uncertainty over German and French elections and Britain's departure from the European Union.BMW (DE:BMWG) boss Harald Krueger, however, said the cost of investments in new technologies could spur deals among smaller carmakers.'NO SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST'Some industry analysts also say an enlarged PSA could actually ease the pressure on rivals if CEO Carlos Tavares uses similar methods to turn a profit at Opel that worked at PSA. In the three years since Tavares took the helm at PSA, its existing brands - Peugeot, Citroen and DS - have significantly increased pricing relative to benchmarked rivals, sometimes at the expense of sales.A similar approach at Opel, which has been among the region's most aggressive discounters, could give the entire European mass-market car industry some breathing space.""The deal could then ease price pressures, lead to a stabilization, or even a recovery,"" said Michele Pedroni, fund manager at SYZ Asset Management in Geneva.GM and PSA have shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms for years, and the Opel Crossland X and the Citroen C-Aircross concept SUV on show in Geneva are a sign of the new projects and synergies they hope to achieve as one company. Stefan Bratzel of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany said the potential improvement in profitability at PSA-Opel posed a bigger challenge to rivals than its sheer size.""There is no survival of the fattest,"" he said. ""Just because you're big, you do not win the game."" Some analysts say  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA), which has less than 7 percent of the European market compared with PSA-Opel's more than 16 percent, could be among the most pressured, with its high debts and costly plants in Italy. ""Being a mid-sized player in Europe and not particularly profitable in the region leaves them quite vulnerable,"" said Felipe Munoz, an automotive analyst at JATO. ""They are too expensive to be bought by one of the big guys, and they are not in a position to grow unless they find a partner.""FCA boss Sergio Marchionne has long advocated mergers to share the cost of cleaner and more technologically advanced cars, but his attempt to woo GM was rebuffed and with the U.S. firm now leaving Europe that option seems even less likely.Marchionne said on Tuesday that FCA did not need a merger, but he wouldn't rule one out and said he could approach GM again if it was the right thing to do. He also said the PSA-Opel deal might over time encourage VW to consider a tie-up with his own company, although one industry investment banker told Reuters that was unlikely as VW focuses on its transformation following the dieselgate scandal.Ford (N:F), another mid-sized player in Europe, highlighted the importance of keeping costs down.European boss Jim Farley told Reuters it was ""really, really important"" for the future of its more than 14,000 workers in Britain that the country strikes a tariff-free trade deal when it leaves the European Union.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

258,"Mar 06, 2017 02:30PM ET","GM will lay off 1,100 in Michigan after domestic production shift",nan,"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Monday it will lay off 1,100 workers in May at its Lansing Delta Township assembly plant in Michigan as it shifts production of a vehicle to Tennessee.The largest U.S. automaker last year added 800 jobs at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant to build a new version of the GMC Acadia SUV. The Lansing plant will continue building the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse after it retools for a month, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said in an emailed statement. GM has announced other U.S. factory cuts even after it said in January it would invest another $1 billion in U.S. factories.U.S. President Donald Trump has urged GM and other automakers to build more cars in the country as part of his pledge to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs and discourage the industry from investing in Mexico.GM has said the $1 billion investment would allow it to create or retain 1,500 U.S. jobs, but has not specified what jobs are impacted.GM has also said it will begin work on bringing axle production for its next generation of full-size pickup trucks, including work previously done in Mexico, to operations in Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs. The part was previously built by American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc (N:AXL).GM said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ended the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing Grand River plants in January. In December, it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.Those job cuts were sparked by lower demand for cars as Americans buy more SUVs and other larger vehicles.Trump has repeatedly praised GM's January investment announcement. GM ""committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left,"" Trump said at a news conference in February.GM has been adding a significant number of U.S. jobs in recent years. It had 105,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2016, up from 97,000 at the end of 2015, according to a company filing in February. GM on Monday declined to provide its current U.S. employment figure. In a deal announced on Monday, GM will sell its European operations to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) in a move that doubles down on the U.S. company's aim of being less global but more profitable.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

261,"Mar 06, 2017 07:40AM ET","GM shifts from bigger is better to less global, more profitable",nan,"By Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s (N:GM) decision to sell its European operations doubles down on a bet that the company can win by being less global, but more profitable, in an auto industry increasingly driven by software. Without the German Opel and British Vauxhall brands, GM last year would have sold about 8.8 million vehicles -- well behind Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) in the race to be the world's largest automaker by vehicle sales.Opel and Vauxhall combined sold nearly 1.2 million vehicles in 2016, and generated $18.7 billion in revenue, about 11 percent of GM's total. However, all of GM's activity in Europe - the investments in new model designs and cleaner engines, the efforts to make factories more efficient and the wages paid to 38,000 employees - has generated nothing but losses since 1999. Meanwhile, GM's business in North America has boomed. GM's home market operations were reborn as a smaller company due in part to the U.S. government led bankruptcy in 2009, with fewer brands, fewer dealers, fewer employees and far less money owed to creditors and retirees. Since 2009, cheap gasoline has powered a boom in sales of high-profit pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, lifting GM's North American pre-tax profit margins to just over 10 percent in 2016. To keep its North American profit machine revved up, GM will have to invest in new SUVs and trucks, as well as expensive technology to enable those trucks to meet rising federal fuel economy targets.Europe is demanding cleaner cars, too. But far less of the technology GM would buy to clean up European diesels and tiny gasoline engines would be useful in the United States, where larger gasoline engines – including eight cylinder motors used in pickup trucks – dominate the market. GM has concluded that it cannot achieve significant economies of scale in emissions technology for Europe on its own, company executives said.  Peugeot  Chief Executive Carlos Tavares is wagering that he now can gain an advantage against rivals such as  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen AG with the help of the added revenue and sales volume provided by Opel.France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP), the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, announced a deal to buy GM's Opel division on Monday.GM's decision to walk away from Western Europe highlights two other profound shifts since 2009, when GM's board scuttled a deal to sell Opel and Vauxhall to a group led by auto supplier Magna International (TO:MG) and Russia's Sberbank.The first is China, now the world's largest auto market with roughly 28 million vehicles sold in 2016, and more growth forecast to come.As China grows, GM will need to shift more vehicle engineering money and capital investment to feed that market - which could eventually replace much of the global sales volume sacrificed by the sale of Opel to Peugeot SA (PA:PEUP). GM's Buick brand, its primary brand in China, and the Wuling brand of small commercial vehicles GM builds with partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, each outsold Opel and Vauxhall in 2016. The second factor is the race to transform cars into electrified, intelligent devices that are paid for by the mile instead of purchased on installment plans.Asked last month whether GM needed more radical restructuring to lift its share price, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra pointed to ""the way that we are investing in the future, which I think is a huge opportunity, with transportation-as-a-service,"" and to ""the opportunity that technology has to transform this industry"" as factors that could change how the company is valued. However, investors have not changed their views yet. Gary Silberg, head of KPMG's [KPMG.UL] Americas automotive practice, said that when it comes to the digital systems and the people required to collect, analyze and manipulate the terabytes of data required to make a car drive itself, Silicon Valley companies such as Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and ride services leader Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] have the edge.""The war for talent is absolutely essential to winning in the market place,"" Silberg said. And those adept in artificial intelligence systems ""are not going to work for the auto industry."" GM demonstrated the new economics of the industry last year when it agreed to pay $500 million - and potentially more - to buy a tiny San Francisco robotic driving technology startup, Cruise Automation.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) followed suit with a $1 billion deal to bring aboard and fund the future work of robotic vehicle startup Argo AI.GM's Barra has told investors that GM would deliver 20 percent or better returns on invested capital, and hold capital spending roughly flat with current levels of $9 billion a year, putting extra cash into share buybacks.Those constraints on capital force tough decisions, Barra and other senior GM executives have said. The decision to abandon Opel after nearly 80 years is the most momentous yet, and the success or failure of the bet could define Barra's legacy.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The target for the world’s second largest economy in 2016 had been a larger 6.5% to 7%, with China achieving a 6.7% expansion last year.Also in headlines overseas, investors were keeping a close eye on the French presidential race and its implications for the euro. Former prime minister Alain Juppe said Monday that he had decided ""once and for all"" not to run in France's presidential election.The development dashed the hopes of many in his conservative party whose existing, scandal-hit candidate, Francois Fillon, faces almost certain defeat.A poor showing from Fillon would leave favorite and centrist Emmanuel Macron to fight out the second round on May 7 with far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Polls have shown that Juppe as a candidate would have made the second round comfortably."
263,"Mar 06, 2017 05:51AM ET",PSA targets Opel turnaround as GM exits Europe,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Edward TaylorPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) has agreed to buy Opel from General Motors (N:GM) in a deal valuing the business at 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), creating a new European car giant to challenge market leader Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).The maker of  Peugeot  and Citroen cars vowed to return Opel and its British Vauxhall brand to profit, targeting an operating margin of 2 percent within three years and 6 percent by 2026 underpinned by 1.7 billion euros in joint cost savings.PSA shares jumped as much as 5.2 percent after Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said GM's European arm could be turned around using lessons from the French group's own recovery. Opel recently recorded its 16th consecutive full-year loss.""We're confident that the Opel-Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support,"" he said.By acquiring Opel, PSA leapfrogs French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) to become Europe's second-ranked carmaker by sales, with a 16 percent market share to VW's 24 percent.The disposal seals GM's exit from Europe and ends a relationship dating back to the 1920s.Eight years after coming close to a sale to Canada's Magna (TO:MG), the Detroit car giant has faced renewed investor pressure to offload the business to raise profitability, rather than chase the global sales crown currently held by VW.Last year, PSA and GM Europe recorded a combined 72 billion euros in revenue and 4.3 million vehicle deliveries.GM will receive 1.32 billion euros for the Opel manufacturing business in the form of 650 million euros in cash and 670 million in PSA share warrants.An additional 900 million euros will be paid by the Paris-based carmaker and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) for Opel's financing arm, to be operated jointly and consolidated by the French bank.'PROUD NOT RELIEVED'After fending off 2015 merger overtures by  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) with support from her board, GM boss Mary Barra agreed to target a 20 percent return on invested capital and pay out more cash to shareholders.""The way I look at this is positioning Opel-Vauxhall to be incredibly successful in the future,"" Barra said on Monday when asked by a reporter whether she was relieved.""General Motors doesn't have to be relieved,"" PSA's Tavares interjected. ""They can be proud of giving Opel-Vauxhall a better future.""PSA shares were up 2.2 percent at 19.49 euros as of 0939 GMT, after reaching 20.06 euros earlier in the session. GM shares closed 1.2 percent higher on Friday after Reuters reported a deal had been struck.The two carmakers, which already share some production in an existing European alliance, confirmed last month they were negotiating PSA's outright acquisition of Opel, sparking concern over possible job cuts.Tavares said on Monday the targeted savings would come from purchasing and research and development - avoiding plant closures - as the Opel lineup is redeveloped with PSA technology and vehicle architectures.An ambitious technical convergence push will begin with the Opel Corsa, the CEO indicated, as earlier reported by Reuters.The next version of the popular subcompact will be delayed by a year to 2020 as it goes back to the drawing board, according to presentation slides shown to analysts.""Our planning teams are already working on that,"" Tavares said when questioned about the model. Another five PSA-based Opel vehicles will follow by 2023.LABOR COSTSThe Opel deal caps a stellar two-year recovery for PSA, which avoided bankruptcy in 2014 by selling 14 percent stakes to the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489), matching the Peugeot family's diluted holding.Tavares has since cut about 3,000 French assembly line jobs each year through voluntary departures to trim the wage bill to 11 percent of revenue from the 15 percent level he inherited - which is roughly where Opel's labor costs stand today. PSA reiterated pledges to run Opel as a distinct German subsidiary and honor existing job guarantees, which tend to cover production plans for existing models. Beyond those horizons, however, the outlook for Opel plants may be less certain.""Tavares wants to create healthy competition between the plants,"" said one person involved in the tie-up talks. ""They will be competing for workload.""With Europe's auto market near a peak, some analysts expect the new group to close two or three plants within five years. Britain's European Union exit adds to the uncertainty over Vauxhall's UK plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.But Tavares said exports could help fill Opel plants, adding that UK manufacturing brought opportunities as well as risks in the event of a ""hard Brexit"" in which Britain leaves the EU without a free-trade deal.""This may look to you a little bit romantic,"" he conceded.The transaction also sees GM retain most of Opel's pensions deficit, estimated by analysts at $10 billion. Earlier in the talks, the U.S. carmaker had sought to offload a larger share of the liabilities, sources said.Some smaller pension funds will be transferred to PSA, along with a 3 billion euro payment to cover their full settlement, the companies said on Monday.Existing Opel models will be barred from entering new overseas markets under ""non-compete"" agreements that had also complicated negotiations - while GM will be similarly excluded from marketing the same underlying technologies in Europe.The PSA warrants, exercisable in five years and maturing in nine, provide a financial incentive for GM to continue cooperating. The U.S. carmaker has agreed to sell the shares received upon exercise, keeping no stake in PSA.The Opel sale cuts GM's cash balance requirement by $2 billion, the company said, allowing it to accelerate share repurchases. GM will also take a charge of $4 billion to $4.5 billion on the deal, expected to close in late 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We've done a lot to improve the business but we're exploring opportunities to see if we can accelerate that even more because scale does matter in this business,"" she said. ""We're continuing the dialogue.""Barra also said that the automaker backs corporate tax reform, but raised concerns about a Republican ""border adjustment"" tax proposal. ""If not done very thoughtfully it could be problematic,"" she said, saying tax reform needs to avoid ""unintended consequences.""The planned border adjustment tax would impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods while providing write-offs for goods that are exported.

277,"Feb 23, 2017 10:42AM ET",Peugeot-Opel deal promises Big Bang in small cars: sources,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) is planning an engineering blitz to redevelop Opel's core models with its own technology if it succeeds in buying General Motors' (N:GM) European arm, company sources and advisers told Reuters.The  Peugeot  maker, which is in talks with GM on an Opel deal, wants to build the next Corsa mini on the same architecture as its Peugeot 208 and Citroen C3 models, several sources said.This presents a tough challenge as the new GM model is due for an update in two years, leaving little time for a major reworking of its design. PSA's alternative, however, would be to wait until around 2025 - the end of its next model cycle - to tap cost savings in the best-selling vehicle category.Chief Executive Carlos Tavares outlined the plan at a PSA board meeting on Wednesday, one source said. The aim would be to fuse the small car categories that PSA and GM failed to combine under a looser 2012 alliance that missed key targets. Tavares refused on Thursday to comment on the details of possible PSA-Opel vehicle programs as he presented record PSA earnings to reporters and analysts, stressing that the acquisition had yet to be agreed with GM.But he said the combined company would aim to sell more than 5 million vehicles annually within ""a few years"", confirming an earlier Reuters report. PSA and GM Europe delivered 4.3 million vehicles between them last year.""When you look at the product plan you see that you can, in a quite speedy way, implement significant synergies,"" Tavares said.The next Corsa and related Mokka X mini-SUV are among a wave of small Opel cars already in development for launch in 2019. The two models represent 40 percent of GM's European sales, according to LMC Automotive data. PSA wants the Opel deal to yield cost synergies of between 1.5 billion and 2 billion euros ($1.6-2.1 billion), sources close to the talks have said. PSA and GM have tried before to combine their small cars - the failed centerpiece of a ""global strategic alliance"" unveiled in 2012 and rapidly scaled back to three shared projects from 40 initially considered.Gilles Le Borgne, the PSA engineering chief, told Reuters the earlier small car plans had foundered because GM chose instead to develop the Corsa on its own architecture, pursuing economies of scale between its Opel and Chevrolet brands.""It's completely different now,"" Le Borgne said on Thursday, adding that engineering teams were ready to move fast. ""It would be stupid to miss another cycle,"" he said, adding that it normally takes more than three years to develop a new model.JOB CONCERNSA swift convergence of small car design and production may deepen concern over possible job losses, especially in Germany - home to about half the 38,000-strong GM Europe workforce.The competing PSA and Opel small car and SUV line-ups are currently spread among no fewer than five European plants: Opel Eisenach, Germany, and Zaragoza, Spain; and PSA Poissy and Mulhouse, France, and Trnava, Slovakia.Tavares has promised to honor existing GM plant and job guarantees, but many of those expire in 2018-2020 - around the time the first jointly-developed products would be arriving.""Given the massive overlap of the two businesses, there should be no illusion as to what will need to happen,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a recent note.""It's about hard restructuring in Germany, the UK and Spain resulting in at least 5,000 manufacturing job cuts,"" he predicted. Evercore expects three plants to close by 2021.While PSA will honor past deals, the company insists no new plant or job commitments are on the table. ""We'd discuss those at a later stage,"" a spokesman said, declining further comment.The proposed deal would create a ""European champion"" and offer lifeline to Opel after 16 consecutive years of losses, CEO Tavares said on Thursday. ""This company needs help.""It would also tap future technologies such as PSA electric and plug-in hybrid transmissions due in two years, he said.Joint engineering teams are already working well on vehicles developed under the 2012 cooperation deal, Tavares added, a point of view shared by one of that agreement's architects.""Opel's been losing money for ever, it's sub-critical mass and there's no interesting technology,"" said the executive, who helped draw up the original alliance plan.

A PSA spokesman declined to comment on the deal talks or the French carmaker's objectives.The sales goal of 5 million vehicles, to be reached between 2020 and 2022, represents a 16 percent increase on last year's combined 4.3 million deliveries by PSA and Opel. It may be viewed as ambitious, with the European auto market now approaching a peak. The future of Opel's sales financing arm and 7 billion euro pension deficit is still under discussion, two sources said.Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Dominic O'Brien earlier said that savings of 2 billion euros could be achieved with 1.2 billion euros from joint purchasing, 400 million euros from R&D and a 400 million euros from the eventual elimination of 6,000 jobs.""The most obvious starting point for any restructuring, of course, lies with labour,"" O'Brien said in a note to clients, adding that layoffs would be more likely ""via attrition and voluntary rather than compulsory"".PSA said its Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had a ""constructive discussion"" with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday, repeating assurances given to German Chancellor Angela Merkel a day earlier that any existing GM commitments to unions would be honored.GM's current German job guarantees run to the end of next year and plant commitments until around 2019-20, unions say.The new group would have 75 billion euros in revenue and a 16 percent combined European market share, which shrank last year as both groups lost ground to rivals including VW and  Renault  (PA:RENA).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Europe's car industry has been dogged by overcapacity for years, and analysts have said the planned sale of GM's loss making European business to France's PSA is likely to result in some cutbacks. Two sources close to PSA told Reuters last week that job and plant cuts were part of the tie-up talks, with the two Vauxhall sites in Britain in the front line. Britain's decision to leave the European Union, which could lead to trade tariffs, could be a factor in the decision, although the country's politicians and unions are lobbying hard.Of GM Europe's roughly 38,000 staff, around half are in Germany and about 4,500 in Britain.German Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said on Monday GM and PSA had so far not given any binding guarantees on German jobs, but that there had been some encouraging signs. ""This is why speculation is premature at this point,"" Machnig told German television station ARD. He expressed hope that a combination with France's PSA could form the basis of a better future for Opel.German newspaper Bild am Sonntag had reported that PSA had pledged to continue operating all four of Opel's German production sites.That sent alarm bells ringing in Britain.

The FT reported on Saturday, citing a person with knowledge of the meeting, that Clark had also made commitments similar to those he gave Nissan (T:7201) last year before it announced it would build two new models in Britain.Clark promised Nissan that he would ensure more car part suppliers were based in Britain, support training and research into electric and low-emission vehicles, and push for ""free and unencumbered"" access to European Union markets for carmakers after Britain leaves the EU.The government has declined to give exact details of its promises to Nissan, citing commercial confidentiality, though government auditors who saw the letter said it did not make the government liable for Brexit-related costs incurred by Nissan.Britain's business ministry declined to comment on Saturday on whether Clark had made similar commitments to PSA.The FT quoted Clark as saying that he and PSA executives had ""talked generally about our commitments and enthusiasm for research in electric vehicles and batteries"", but added that the minister did not give further detail.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The structure of any deal has yet to be decided and it is unclear whether GM might have a stake in the combined business.Following a meeting with GM president Dan Ammann on Thursday, British business minister Greg Clark said he had been reassured GM did not intend to ""rationalize"" its Vauxhall operations in Britain. ""There is some way to go in discussions between GM and PSA but I was reassured by GM's intention, communicated to me, to build on the success of these operations rather than rationalise them,"" Clark said in a statement. ""We will continue to be in close contact with GM and PSA in the days and weeks ahead.""  However, Britain's Unite trade union, which met with Ammann and Clark, said it had not received the guarantees it wanted. ""There’s no assurances at the moment, this is a story that’s unfolding and we’ll wait to see what the next installment is,"" Unite leader Len McCluskey told Sky News. ""My immediate priority now is to understand where Peugeot is now in this process, which is why I am contacting the CEO of the company, Carlos Tavares, to request urgent talks,"" he said in a statement. UK JOBS AT RISK""It's much easier to cut jobs in Britain than Germany,"" one source with knowledge of the discussions between PSA and GM told Reuters, adding that Britain's move to leave the European Union was also a factor in the talks. ""Restructuring is very likely to happen at the Vauxhall plants,"" that source added.PSA declined to comment.Separately on Thursday, the regional government of Rhineland-Palatinate, which is home to Opel's Kaiserslautern plant, welcomed the prospect of a deal with the French as an opportunity to create a ""European champion.""Local politicians too had been reassured by GM executives following a briefing about the deal.""Politicians in France and Germany have the aim of preventing job losses. There are signals that through the takeover, no plants in Germany will be closed,"" Malu Dreyer, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate said in a statement. Analysts have said the rationale for combining PSA and GM's European brands would be both increased scale and cost savings.Ratings agency Moody's said on Thursday acquiring Opel and Vauxhall should eventually help PSA's credit rating - providing the French carmaker pulls off the kind of turnaround that has eluded GM for years.Doing so would require ""substantial restructuring expenses weighing on future cash flow generation"", analyst Falk Frey said in a note.""The largest obstacle (to) this transaction is the ability of PSA to achieve a turnaround within a reasonable time frame.""Of GM Europe's roughly 38,000 staff, about 19,000 are in Germany and 4,500 in Britain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Britain also said it had contacted GM President Dan Ammann to express concern over the future of Opel's UK plants.Paris-based PSA said it would despatch CEO Carlos Tavares to meet German labor and political leaders likely to include Chancellor Angela Merkel, as his GM counterpart Mary Barra visited Opel headquarters near Frankfurt. Tavares, expected to head the combined company if the deal goes through, ""wants to meet Opel's German stakeholders"", a PSA spokesman said, adding no date had yet been set for those talks. The French carmaker had no further comment.PSA and GM have declined to say what cuts they would make to jobs, plants, production capacity or research and development under the deal being discussed. Of GM Europe's roughly 38,000 staff, about 19,000 are in Germany and 4,500 in Britain. While little is known about its financial or operational terms, the prospects for a combined PSA-Opel have so far drawn only lukewarm investor enthusiasm.PSA shares fell almost 1 percent, reversing part of Tuesday's 4.3 percent gain after some analysts cautioned that significant cost savings would be needed to offset the combined company's dependence on Europe's competitive, mature market. GM shares were 1.5 percent lower at 1730 GMT.Key savings in production and research and development could prove elusive if the companies are forced to guarantee jobs and industrial sites to secure government and union acceptance.""There are too many unknown factors to get excited about a potential transaction,"" Berenberg analyst Alexander Haissl said.Critical questions include ""how quickly PSA can achieve potential savings and reduce GM Europe's cash burn"", he told clients in a note. ""Restructuring of German and UK plants could turn out to be difficult given the political pressure involved.""German unions can veto strategic decisions under the country's co-determination laws. After news of the secret deal talks broke, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said it was ""totally unacceptable"" the companies had not included labor or local government representatives.Berlin somewhat tempered its stance on Wednesday. The government has a ""strong interest in a successful future"" for Opel and will engage constructively with the discussions, a government spokesman said.Both companies are privately making the case that Opel would face sharper cuts under continued GM ownership than under PSA's, sources close to the matter said. GM last week pledged ""renewed actions"" to restore European profitability.'IN FLUX'Germany and France both hold elections later this year. The electoral hypersensitivity of job cuts is further heightened by Merkel's precarious standing in opinion polls.An adviser to one of the carmakers, who declined to be identified, told Reuters on Wednesday that important aspects of the tie-up were ""very much in flux"" and vulnerable to pressure.""It's unclear whether GM will keep an Opel stake, who pays what and if anything will go through at all, given the political backlash,"" he said.Another person briefed on the talks said Tavares would pledge to ""maintain Opel as a German company in full compliance with German labor law"" when he meets government and union officials. He will present the deal as ""an alliance between a French carmaker and a German carmaker,"" the source said.France, which had initially welcomed a PSA-Opel deal providing French jobs were safeguarded, said on Wednesday it understood Berlin's concerns. The subject came up in conversation between Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and Merkel, a German government spokesman said.Barra did not speak to workers during her visit to Opel's Ruesselsheim headquarters but sought instead to soothe their apprehension with an internal statement.The tie-up would put Opel and PSA ""in a position to improve their standing in the fast-changing European market"", the GM boss wrote, according to media reports later confirmed by staff.The deal proposal emerged last year from regular talks between GM and PSA, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The carmakers share three vehicle programmes as a legacy of their last attempt to forge a deeper alliance. That earlier effort foundered before PSA's 2013-14 near-bankruptcy and bailout, in which the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489) took 14 percent stakes to match the Peugeot family's diluted holding. GM sold a 7 percent PSA stake ahead of the rescue.But the joint development and production of SUVs and commercial vans at three different PSA and Opel plants has prepared engineering teams to do more, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the plan.""They're already working together,"" he said. ""They would hit the ground running.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Britain's Department for Business said the government remained in close contact with GM and was monitoring the situation after the two companies said on Tuesday that they were in talks over a possible deal.The talks have raised fears from unions in Britain and Europe that a deal could lead to job cuts or plant closures within GM's loss-making European business. Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has thrived in recent years, shipping more than half of its exports to the other 27 countries of the EU, but Britain's vote to leave the European Union has put the industry in jeopardy. Prime Minister Theresa May's government struck a deal last year to keep Nissan (T:7201) investing in Britain after it promised to provide extra support to counter any loss of competitiveness caused by the Brexit vote.If the GM-PSA deal is successful, PSA, owner of the  Peugeot , Citroen and DS brands, would acquire GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands to give it a 16.3 percent share of the European passenger car market.The Unite workers' union said the president of GM had given a private assurance last year that there would be no surprises in terms of its plants in Britain, and that these commitments had not been upheld.

292,"Feb 14, 2017 06:20PM ET",Barra's move to sell Opel signals a deeper change at GM,nan,"By Joseph White(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra’s decision to put the company’s European operations on the block marks a turning point for the automaker that once prided itself on being the No. 1 vehicle maker in the world.If Barra succeeds in concluding a deal with French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) – and people familiar with the discussions cautioned on Tuesday that many details are yet to be settled – she will have delivered in an unexpected way on her promise to have GM “disrupt ourselves” rather than wait to be jolted by outside forces.Selling Opel will mean GM no longer seeks to be a key player in all the major auto markets, but rather is focusing on cash flow and profitability instead of sales volume. There are risks to abandoning markets, especially one as large as Western Europe. GM faces a continuing fight to stop losing share in its core markets. At the same time, Barra faces pressure to do even more, with GM's share price - even after Tuesday’s nearly 5 percent gain - below the $41 level it had just before she took over the company. “We believe (GM) investors are willing to accept more radical measures to optimize capital allocation,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note.Shedding GM Europe isn’t the technology-driven disruption Barra usually refers to in presentations to investors. But it is a major course change for the company. GM executives long argued that owning Germany's Opel provided the company with the engineering know-how to develop small and medium sized cars it needed for U.S. and Asian markets. That's one reason why GM in 2009 pulled the plug on a plan to sell its European business to supplier Magna. But small cars are now losing ground in the United States, China and elsewhere to sport utility vehicles. At the same time, tougher emissions and safety regulations are making European vehicles more expensive, and harder to sell in other markets, analysts said. What's also changed since 2009 is GM's relations with its Chinese partners, which give it an alternative to developing small cars in Europe. GM is engineering a new low-cost vehicle lineup for Asia and Latin America with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, a sign of how far Chinese automakers have progressed. Bob Lutz, former GM Vice Chairman and head of product development, said on Tuesday GM could structure a deal with PSA that would still allow for joint product development, and could leave open the possibility of exporting certain Cadillac or Chevrolet models to Europe. “The proceeds from the sale (which would do wonders for the stock price) would permit acceleration of the business in North America and China; a far better use of resources,” Lutz emailed, adding he had not been in contact with anyone at GM. Analysts cautioned on Tuesday the price of the deal could be low. The final price will depend on how GM and PSA would share – or not share – intellectual property, pension liabilities, debts and restructuring costs, analysts said. GM'S CULTURAL SHIFT Even after its traumatic 2009 bankruptcy, GM fought to remain a significant player in all the major world auto markets, and to be competitive with rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG for the title of world’s largest automaker by vehicle sales. Selling Opel would mean GM is setting aside those traditional measures of success to be a smaller company focused on the United States truck market, China and some - but not all - the large, growth markets in Latin America and Asia. Under Barra’s leadership, GM has exited Russia and Indonesia after concluding it couldn’t earn acceptable returns on investment.Barra has made return on invested capital, cash flow available for share buybacks and profitability the key measures of GM’s success, not sales volume. GM Europe fails those tests, despite more than $1 billion spent on restructuring efforts since 2012. “The decision to exit is Business Strategy 101 – move resources away from unattractive markets with weak competitive positions, toward attractive markets with strong positions – especially areas that are likely more crucial for GM's long term success,” wrote  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson in a note Tuesday. GM declined to make Barra or other top executives available for comment Tuesday   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

297,"Feb 13, 2017 12:20PM ET",Peugeot sees Trump's Iran stance boosting market lead,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) is pushing ahead with an Iranian plant investment and production ramp-up in the face of a hardened U.S. stance against Tehran under President Donald Trump that could play to the carmaker's advantage, a senior executive said.The group's  Peugeot  brand is about to begin production with local partner Iran Khodro, while PSA is also preparing to invest more than 100 million euros ($106 million) in a new Citroen plant with partner SAIPA, PSA Middle East chief Jean-Christophe Quemard told a press call on Monday.Peugeot returned to Iran last year after an international deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear activities, and has reclaimed its place as the country's top-selling car brand with a 32 percent market share last year, according to IHS Automotive data.The carmaker inked a 400 million euro ($424 million) Peugeot production agreement last June and a 300 million deal for Citroen four months later.The renewed pressure from Washington will probably extend PSA's lead as rivals hold back from re-entering Iran, Quemard told the press call from a Tehran automotive conference.""This is our opportunity to accelerate,"" he said. ""It will become even harder for American companies to operate, that's for sure. We've opened up a lead and we plan to hold on to it.""Within two weeks of his inauguration, Trump responded to an Iranian missile test with fresh U.S. sanctions, warning that Tehran was ""playing with fire"".General Motors (N:GM) and other American-owned brands last had a significant Iranian presence before the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Other western and Japanese carmakers that had avoided Iran under recent sanctions are now eyeing its potential. IHS expects the market to grow 8 percent to 1.35 million vehicles this year and to 1.8 million by 2024.German brands may be treading carefully because - unlike French rivals - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) have extensive U.S. sales and production.Daimler and VW's Scania have unveiled Iranian deals in trucks and buses but have been slower to commit to new car production investments.Mansour Moazami, Iran's deputy industry minister, told the Tehran conference that VW may soon finalize a production deal with an Iranian company. VW had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA's larger domestic rival, is also adding production and new models with Iranian partners and may overtake Peugeot's sales by 2019 thanks to its low-cost vehicle architectures, IHS predicts.($1 = 0.9433 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

298,"Feb 13, 2017 07:15AM ET","VW talks with union break down, leaving costs deal in limbo",nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) talks with unions over the implementation of its turnaround plan were broken off on Monday, both sides said, leaving in limbo a deal on cost-cutting following the carmaker's damaging diesel emissions scandal.Labour bosses at Volkswagen (VW) halted cooperation with management on issues including overtime work, efficiency gains and apprenticeships last week, saying executives were trying to squeeze greater savings than agreed in November.And on Monday VW's works council indicated that tensions between its head Bernd Osterloh and VW brand chief Herbert Diess, who have clashed over how to achieve greater savings, had not eased and called for VW group Chief Executive Matthias Mueller to play a greater role in resolving the dispute.Unions say Diess, who established a reputation for cutting costs at BMW (DE:BMWG), wants to cut temporary workers more quickly and deeply than agreed. VW has said it cannot keep a large number of temporary staff on its books because of shrinking demand for models such as the Golf hatchback and Passat saloon.""We would welcome if the group's management would more strongly deal with the implementation of the future pact and the compliance with agreements,"" a works council spokesman said in an emailed statement.A spokesman for the VW brand confirmed that talks have been postponed, but declined further comment.But Mueller, in a letter to staff on Monday which was seen by Reuters, indicated he may get more directly involved.""We as group management and I personally will continue to do everything, so that conflicts are resolved in a constructive manner and VW will be protected from harm,"" he said. The so-called future pact will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and foresees 30,000 job cuts at the VW brand without forcing layoffs until 2025.This plan is seen by analysts as critical to raising profitability at VW's core division, which is lagging rivals including  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Toyota (T:7203). Apart from VW, Volkswagen also owns the Audi, Skoda, SEAT, and Porsche marques.Europe's largest automaker is having to make cuts to its high-cost operations in Germany to fund a strategic shift and shed costs following the diesel emissions affair, which is costing it billions of dollars in settlements.($1 = 0.9401 euros)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

299,"Feb 09, 2017 01:40PM ET",PSA Group referred to French prosecutors over diesel emissions,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) has been referred to prosecutors over suspected diesel emissions-cheating, the company said on Thursday.The decision is a blow for the Paris-based manufacturer of  Peugeot , Citroen and DS cars, whose diesel technology had until now escaped serious criticism in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions-cheating scandal. ""We are extremely surprised, even shocked by this decision,"" PSA engineering chief Gilles Le Borgne told reporters at the company's headquarters. The company denies using banned engine software cheats, he added.PSA is the fourth carmaker to be referred for possible prosecution by France's consumer fraud agency, after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).Following VW's exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programs.They found on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits - for some GM (N:GM), Renault (PA:RENA) and Fiat (MI:FCHA) models - and widespread use of devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.Carmakers have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow such software only when it is necessary for safety or engine protection.PSA diesels under the current Euro 6 standard have cleaner emissions than many mass-market rivals, thanks to their deployment of costly selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as standard.But in a government-backed testing program last year, five PSA vehicles of the last Euro 5 diesel generation emitted significantly higher NOx in motorway driving conditions when engine temperatures were increased.By design, the cars' so-called EGR emissions treatment is deliberately reduced at higher temperatures to improve fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in out-of-town driving, where NOx and particle output is less critical, Le Borgne said.The company last year began an independently certified real-world CO2 emissions-testing program and began publishing results measured for all its vehicles on the road. ""We don't know what more we could have done,"" Le Borgne said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

308,"Nov 22, 2016 08:40AM ET",VW puts conquering Americas at heart of turnaround plan,nan,"By Andreas CremerWOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will need to conquer the Americas, the region at the center of its emissions scandal, to deliver a turnaround at its core VW brand, Europe's largest carmaker said on Tuesday.VW said it would launch a series of higher-margin SUVs, limousines and electric cars to try to win back customers in markets where it has long lagged competitors. VW brand chief Herbert Diess conceded it would take a decade to catch up with rivals in the United States, where the company has faced billions of dollars in fines and compensation payouts since admitting last year to fixing diesel engine tests. But he said success was vital to reviving the core brand that accounted for 59 percent of the German group's auto sales in 2015 but only 16 percent of group underlying operating profit. ""We not only want to be profitable in Europe and China but are determined to generate positive results in all major markets by 2020,"" he told reporters. Volkswagen last week announced a cost-cutting deal with labor unions that will allow it to axe 30,000 jobs at the VW brand by 2020.On Tuesday, Diess set out a recovery strategy to 2025 and beyond, spanning a wide range of initiatives including SUVs, electric cars, digital services and plans to launch a budget car in China and India by about 2019-2020. The long-term goal, he said, was to lift the VW brand's operating profit margin to 6 percent by 2025, compared with just 2 percent forecast for this year. That would still lag some rivals such as PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), which is aiming to hit 6 percent in 2021.""It’s good and necessary that VW is tackling those issues, but it will be a long road,"" said M.M. Warburg analyst Marc-Rene Tonn, referring to the plans to fix underperforming markets and lift margins. He has a ""hold"" rating on Volkswagen shares. BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESSThe VW brand has long struggled in North America and some emerging markets, with analysts blaming its reluctance to adapt to local tastes and delays in launching new models. ""For years we have been lacking a blueprint for success in the U.S., while we are losing ground to rivals in markets like Brazil or India. In part we have also missed market trends, above all the SUV boom,"" said Diess, a former BMW executive who joined VW in July 2015.The brand now plans to have 19 SUV models globally by 2020, up from just 2 now, and including some electric ones. In total, it aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2025. Diess said investment in the VW brand would remain at around 4.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) a year, with savings of around 2.5 billion euros from scrapping unidentified unprofitable models to help pay for new ones.The brand is also building a new digital platform for a range of services such as ride hailing and car sharing which it expects to have 80 million users worldwide by 2025 and generate annual revenue of around 1 billion euros. Shares in Volkswagen, whose 12 brands range from upmarket Audi and Porsche to the cheaper SEAT and Skoda, were up 0.2 percent to 120.35 euros by 1335 GMT. The stock is still down around a quarter in value from before the emissions scandal.($1 = 0.9403 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

309,"Nov 18, 2016 10:14AM ET","Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs",nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan SchwartzWOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and its labor unions agreed to cut 30,000 jobs at the core VW brand in exchange for a commitment to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025, a compromise which leaves the carmaker's profitability still lagging rivals.The turnaround plan announced on Friday will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and lift the Volkswagen (VW) brand's operating margin to 4 percent that year, from an expected 2 percent in 2016.That target still remains below rival European carmakers such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), which is targeting an operating margin of 6 percent in 2021.VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements.The cuts came with a management pledge to create 9,000 new jobs in the area of battery production and mobility services at factories in Germany as part of efforts to shift toward electric and self-driving cars.""We have to invest billions of euros in new cars and services while new rivals will attack us - the transformation will surely be more radical than everything we have experienced to date,"" VW brand CEO Herbert Diess said at a press conference.DEEP ENOUGH?Some experts argued the cost cuts were not deep enough.Spending on R&D and staff across VW's automotive operations has been growing for years with the need to overhaul the cost base dating back to before the diesel emissions scandal broke 14 months ago.""The deal may be the best the company could negotiate with labor but it's not a victory for either side,"" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor.""The cuts are too small to make VW cost competitive with Toyota (T:7203) and other global rivals.""With 610,000 workers globally, VW last year built slightly fewer vehicles than Toyota which has 350,000 staff. The German company has also been slow to cease production of unprofitable vehicles in its 340-model range.VW's labor leaders said management had agreed to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025, a step which clears the way to cutting 23,000 jobs via the more palatable methods of buyouts, early retirements and reducing part-time staff.Jobs will also be cut in North America, Brazil and Argentina, VW said, without being more specific. Around 120,000 employees work for VW brand in Germany including 6,000 temporary staff.UNIONS PLEASEDMany analysts and investors nonetheless welcomed the deal, sending the shares more than 2 percent higher to the top of the blue-chip DAX (GDAXI) index in early Frankfurt trading. At 1324 GMT (8:24 a.m. ET), the stock was still trading up 0.8 percent at 118.5 euros.Activist hedge fund TCI, which has been critical of Volkswagen management, said it looked like a good deal all round provided it could be made to stick.""As long as they are net savings – the savings are not given back by increased costs elsewhere in the organization,"" said TCI partner Ben Walker.""They've just to deliver now. It's easy to talk. They now have to deliver and execute,"" he added. Labor leaders were pleased with the outcome.""The most important message is the jobs of the core workforce is secure,"" VW's works council chief Bernd Osterloh said at the news conference in Wolfsburg, where the company has its headquarters.Management and labor agreed to outsource production of plastic parts from the German Braunschweig plant but will compensate workers by assigning more orders for chassis and steering assembly needed with rising investment in self-drive cars.In a further sign of its shifting focus, VW said it will build electric cars at its German factories in Zwickau and Wolfsburg. Electric motors will be built in Kassel, and VW will start battery cell production and development in Salzgitter. Volkswagen will also build battery packs for electric and hybrid cars in Braunschweig, it said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

311,"Nov 16, 2016 11:40AM ET","Exclusive: VW seeks cost-cutting deal by Friday, devil is in the detail",nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is pushing for a cost-cutting deal with workers at its core brand by Friday to help fund investment in electric and self-drive cars, but accounts of discussions in just one area show how difficult it is.The need for a turnaround plan at the VW brand has been amplified by the billions of costs it is facing for its diesel emissions scandal but union leaders do not want workers to carry the can for what they see as the mistakes of managers.The main sticking point of the talks is how to ensure the future of its German factories as it seeks to cut some traditional roles making combustion engines in favor of new positions producing batteries and electric engines.Neither VW nor its powerful labor unions would comment on the progress of the talks but details from three company sources of discussions over the assembly of plastic parts shed light on their complexity.VW brand chief Herbert Diess, a former executive at BMW (DE:BMWG), which is less vertically integrated than VW, has sought to end production of some plastic parts including fuel tanks and bumpers at the Wolfsburg base, the three sources said.In a sign of the scale of the challenge, a new 1,500-square meter hall with blow-molding technology to make more plastic tanks went on stream only in September, the sources said.Unions have so far blocked Diess's plan, which would involve cutting several hundred of the 3,000 jobs involved in making plastic parts, an area competitors have long since outsourced.Management and labor are also discussing the outsourcing of some production of plastic parts at Braunschweig near Wolfsburg, one of the sources said. Those talks involve compensating staff by assigning more orders for chassis and steering assembly which will become more relevant with self-driving cars.Two VW factories in particular are hoping to benefit from the post-dieselgate expansion into zero-emission technology: Salzgitter, which now makes combustion engines and Kassel, VW’s biggest component plant making gearboxes, engines and emission systems.One company source indicated an overarching deal could be reached by Friday, but others did not confirm the prediction.BOARD MEETINGThe supervisory board of VW, part owned by the state of Lower Saxony and Qatari Investment Authority, is due to meet on Friday to approve spending on plants, equipment and models across the multi-brand group until the end of the decade, but needs prior agreement with the works council on restructuring and jobs.Managers want to cut annual costs at the core brand by 3.7 billion euros ($3.99 billion) through 2021 to help fund VW's transformation while facing billions of euros in costs from its emissions scandal.But labor leaders, who occupy almost half the seats on the group's 20 member supervisory board, have said they will not approve any cutbacks without management committing to fixed targets and quotas for product, output and investment.That could have an impact on the share price.""They urgently need to bring about change and not settle for a shaky compromise,"" said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper who last week lowered his recommendation on the stock to ""Hold"" from ""Buy"" because of the reported discovery of cheat software at luxury brand Audi.Toyota (T:7203) built slightly more vehicles than VW last year with 40 percent fewer workers, the Center of Automotive Research said. First-half earnings per car were 395 euros at VW brand, 715 euros at  Renault  (PA:RENA) and 844 euros at PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP).Pieper argued that the group should be able to shed a third of its global 610,000-workforce and shut about 10 of its 120 plants. VW has ruled out forced layoffs but may cut up to 25,000 staff by waiting for people to retire.Sources have said it plans to double this year's expected operating of 2 percent by 2020 and lift it to 6 percent by 2025. That is below current profitability benchmarks at rivals Ford (N:F), PSA and Toyota.Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst who has a ""Buy"" recommendation on VW, said that may not last. ""It goes without saying that a 4 percent target by 2020 would jeopardize what we believe could be a credible turnaround story,"" he said.          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

315,"Nov 01, 2016 01:59PM ET",Frustrated Europe hopes Clinton win can spur elusive Iran deals,nan,"By Noah Barkin BERLIN (Reuters) - After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy.While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8, a win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May.""If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now,"" said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group.""This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for,"" he said.Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, the excitement in Europe's business community was palpable.With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union.European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Iran's isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors.But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides.BIGGEST OBSTACLEThe biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continent's largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line.The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran.But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried.This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners.""Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties,"" said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI).Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign.Trump, by contrast, has called it ""one of the worst deals ever made"" and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe.Recently however, there have been signs of movement.Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services.""Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively,"" said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB). ""We can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's still quite far away.""ENORMOUS POTENTIALIn June, the German government began offering export credit guarantees via insurance group Euler Hermes for firms wanting to trade with Iran.Edna Schoene, head of German government business at Euler Hermes, said about 30 formal applications had been received since then with a total value of about 2.5 billion euros. Nine of them have been approved.Add to that roughly 70 non-binding letters of interest (LOIs) that have been issued and the volumes push up into the double-digit billions of euros, Schoene said.""The potential in Iran is enormous and the demand for export credit guarantees is high, both in terms of formal applications and expressions of interest,"" Schoene said. ""I expect that we will see the first large-scale, credit-financed deals in 2017.""Some European firms are already benefiting from the opening of the Iranian economy. Last week French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP), once the market leader, announced it had produced 105,000 cars in Iran under the  Peugeot  license in the third quarter, 15 percent of its total sales volume.Etourneau of MEDEF International is also optimistic that Iran's order of 118 jets from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and a recent joint venture deal between carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Iranian investment fund IDRO will prove a boon for smaller European suppliers. MEDEF International announced last month it was opening an office in Tehran, its first outside France, to support small and medium sized French firms seeking to enter the Iranian market.""We expect that 20-30 billion euros in public contracts to be attributed by the Iranians before the end of their fiscal year in March,"" Etourneau said. ""What we are telling companies is that they need a 5-10 year strategy. The market will open up progressively.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

316,"Oct 20, 2016 07:10AM ET",VW brand chief eyes 3.7 billion euros of cost cuts by 2021: sources,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Ilona WissenbachBERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is targeting about 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of cost cuts at its core car brand by 2021 as it wrestles with labour leaders over a turnaround plan, sources said.Europe's biggest carmaker needs to come up with savings at high-cost operations in Germany to help fund a shift to electric cars and self-driving vehicles while facing billions of euros in costs from its emissions scandal.About 3 billion euros of the cutbacks would affect operations in Germany where VW is based and has some of its biggest plants, two sources familiar with the negotiations between labour and management told Reuters on Thursday.The targeted savings would follow a 5 billion euro efficiency programme announced by Volkswagen (VW) in 2014, of which about 2.5 billion euros has already been realised, the sources said.The cuts would help VW to lift the operating margin at its troubled core brand to 4 percent by 2020 from an expected 2 percent this year, the sources said.That's less than a previous 6 percent target and below profitability benchmarks at rivals  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), Ford (N:F) and General Motors (N:GM).VW declined to comment. The works council did not return calls seeking comment. Talks between brand management and labour leaders are faltering at the moment with investment pledges and cost savings proving stumbling blocks, the sources said.Raising the pressure on management ahead of a staff gathering at the company's Wolfsburg headquarters on Thursday, labour bosses warned that the pact -- viewed by analysts as key to VW's longer-term future -- could still fail if executives withhold commitments to fixed targets and quotas for products, output and investment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Peugeot, the biggest-selling European automaker in pre-sanctions Iran, suspended sales in 2012 when an international boycott due to Iran's nuclear program was extended to cars. Most sanctions were lifted in January.The French carmaker's sales peaked at 458,000 vehicles before its withdrawal, nearly 30 percent of the Iranian market, but it now faces stiff competition from Chinese carmakers that have grabbed more business during the sanction years, as well as from western rivals such as  Renault  (PA:RENA), who are also flocking back with newer models.Iran's Minister for Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh will visit PSA's Velizy research center near Paris on Thursday to discuss cooperation with the carmaker, CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters at the Paris autoshow.""This is the kick-off for the implementation of the deals we have signed,"" said Tavares, who will travel to Iran next week. Tavares wants to sell 300,000 Peugeot vehicles in Iran in 2017.The Paris-based carmaker in July struck a framework deal with Iranian counterpart SAIPA to invest 300 million euros ($337 million) in the development and production of three Citroen models through a new joint venture.The deal with SAIPA, Citroen's partner since 1966, follows a joint venture deal inked in June between stablemate Peugeot and state-owned Iran Khodro. PSA's smaller DS premium badge has also clinched a distribution agreement in the country.($1 = 0.8913 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

329,"Sep 06, 2016 10:42AM ET",Exclusive: Renault sees diesel disappearing from most of its European cars,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) expects diesel engines to disappear from most of its European cars, company sources told Reuters, after the French automaker reviewed the costs of meeting tighter emissions standards following the Volkswagen scandal.The sober reassessment was delivered at an internal meeting before the summer break. It shows how, a year after VW (DE:VOWG_p) admitted engineering software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests, the repercussions are forcing major European car makers to rewrite strategic plans that will shape their futures for years to come.Renault and domestic rival  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), both heavily invested in diesel technology, initially scrambled to defend its future viability after the VW crisis erupted.But in the July meeting, Renault's Chief Competitiveness Officer Thierry Bollore said the diesel investment outlook had dimmed significantly, according to two people who were present.""He said we were now wondering whether diesel would survive, and that he wouldn't have voiced such doubts even at the start of this year,"" said one of the people.""Tougher standards and testing methods will increase technology costs to the point where diesel is forced out of the market,"" the source summarized Bollore as saying.A Renault spokesman declined to comment.Diesel engines, pricier but more efficient than gasoline, had already vanished from the smallest 'A'-segment vehicles like Renault's Twingo well before VW's so-called 'dieselgate', as their extra expense outstripped savings on fuel.By 2020, Renault now predicts that the toughening of Euro 6 emissions rules will push diesel out of cars in the next 'B'-segment size category, including its Clio sub compact, as well as some 'C' models such as the Megane hatchback, the sources said.Models in those first three size categories accounted for most of the group's 1.6 million European deliveries last year, and more than 60 percent were diesels.""Everybody is backtracking on diesel because after 2017-18 it becomes more and more expensive,"" said Pavan Potluri, a power train analyst with consulting firm IHS Automotive.ELECTRIC CARSWhile the VW scandal centered on the German carmaker's cheat software, it also focused public attention on an industry-wide disparity between nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions on the road and those recorded in regulatory tests.Mass-market diesels that meet legal NOx limits in approval tests commonly emit five times as much or more in everyday use. The gases contribute to acid rain and respiratory illnesses blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths globally each year.Starting in 2019, however, vehicle approvals will be based on emissions performance during real driving. This is forcing manufacturers to install costlier emissions treatment systems.The business case for diesel can only deteriorate further, industry leaders realize, as targets become stricter, while electric and hybrid car batteries get cheaper and more powerful.""Beyond 2025 there may be some manufacturers that completely drop diesel, because the cost of electrification will have come down significantly,"" Potluri said.Diesel car sales will plummet to 9 percent of the European market in 2030 from 52 percent today, management consultant AlixPartners - regarded as an authority on the auto industry - predicted in June, with the decline accelerating after 2020. Renault and alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) assume the next wave of emissions rules, Euro 7, could halve NOx output limits again to 40 milligrams per kilometer, senior powertrain engineer Alain Raposo told a technical conference this summer.Renault is not alone in predicting a bleak future for diesel, though its projections go further than the doubts expressed by other car makers about the technology.VW now wonders ""whether it still makes sense to invest a lot of money in further developing diesel"", Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in June. The German carmaker's final bill for the scandal will likely far exceed the $15 billion settlement agreed so far in U.S. fines and vehicle buy backs.Wolfsburg-based VW is the only carmaker to have admitted using illegal software cheats. Similar allegations have been leveled by German officials against  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), and by South Korean authorities against Nissan vehicles equipped with Renault engines - and in both cases denied.SKY-HIGH NOXRenault, however, has been forced to concede that its real-world NOx emissions are far worse than the industry average, and the carmaker remains under investigation by French consumer fraud authorities.That has deepened Renault's engineering headache and tarnished the green image it cultivated with electric car launches and lower-than-average emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant focus of regulators prior to dieselgate.In road tests on almost 100 vehicles, ordered by a French commission on diesel emissions, Renault and Nissan cars produced more than eight times the regulatory NOx limit on average, with most of their Euro 6 models closer to 10 times the limit.Renault engineering chief Gaspar Gascon Abellan told the commission that the NOx-cutting exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in its top-selling diesel engines had been found to cause serious turbo clogging problems.Engineers had responded by programming the EGR to shut down outside a narrow range of air intake temperatures, 17-35 degrees Celsius (63-95 degrees Fahrenheit). While passing regulatory tests carried out near room temperature, the protocol sends NOx emissions sky-high on the road.Renault, Opel (N:GM), Fiat and others have said such ""defeat devices"" are legal because they are designed to protect their engines rather than cheat tests. But the French commission said their technical justifications ""remained to be proven"".Gascon Abellan agreed during hearings that Renault's EGR restrictions ""could be considered conservative"" and would now be relaxed by software tweaks to existing models, with no significant engine changes. ""I recognize that we could have done this earlier,"" he said.In common with Ford (N:F), VW and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), Renault is scrambling to catch up with Peugeot by rolling out costlier selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to rein in NOx emissions in real-world driving.Bollore, the competitiveness chief, blamed ""diesel consequences"" in part for a 115 million euro ($128 million) research and development overspend that weakened first-half earnings.Renault's electric car program and CO2 performance remain important assets in a world of ever-tightening emissions laws, Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Stuart  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said.""But they're going to have to address the diesel issue and add more SCR content than others,"" Pearson said. ""It might be one reason why Renault's earnings could be handicapped relative to Peugeot over the next few years.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

339,"Jul 28, 2016 07:02AM ET",Fall in Volkswagen brand profit shows lasting effects of scandal,nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) reported a 12 percent drop in quarterly profit at its main passenger car division on Thursday, a big improvement on the quarter before but showing the challenges it still faces to overcome its emissions scandal.Europe's largest automaker is struggling to rebuild its reputation and meet billions of dollars of costs after admitting in September to installing illegal software to mask toxic emissions on about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. The German company published headline first-half numbers last week, saying underlying operating profit of 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) beat analysts' expectations largely due to improvements at its mass-market VW brand.The brand, Volkswagen's largest by revenues, saw profits plunge 86 percent in the first quarter.However, some analysts said the drop in the division's second-quarter earnings showed there was still much work to do.""Some of the details are mediocre, especially the VW brand result,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Sascha Gommel of the company's full first-half earnings release. ""The numbers are slightly disappointing, the brand's earnings quality is still not good,"" he added, noting higher plant utilization at the brand in the second quarter had not translated into improved profits. Commerzbank has a ""hold"" rating on Volkswagen shares, which were down 2 percent at 1020 GMT. LAGGING MARGINSThe company said operating profit at the VW brand fell to 808 million euros in April-June, down from 914 million a year earlier, as expenses related to the emissions scandal and lower sales outweighed cost cutting. That gave the brand a quarterly profit margin of 2.9 percent, up from 0.3 percent in the first quarter, but down from 3.3 percent in the same period last year and still well short of the levels achieved by rivals such as Toyota (T:7203), PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA).In a bid to catch up, Volkswagen is speeding up model development, slashing costs and ceding more power to regional operations to target markets more effectively. The company said exchange rate moves and higher sales of cheaper cars compared with the same period last year were also factors behind the fall in VW brand earnings. At 1.5 billion euros, the brand also bore the brunt of 2.2 billion euros of additional provisions made in January-June to cover the costs of the emissions scandal, VW said.Analysts have said lasting progress in raising the VW brand's profitability will depend on ongoing talks between management and labor over strategy and the future of Germany's high-cost factories.VW's powerful unions are seeking fixed targets for production and investment in the talks with brand chief Herbert Diess, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive hired a year ago to turn around the business.""Mass-market carmakers are all very profitable at the moment,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst who recommends buying VW stock. ""The VW brand margin has to improve considerably.""Volkswagen has pledged greater investment in electric cars and on-demand transport services as it reshapes its business.The group stuck to its 2016 guidance, predicting revenues would fall by as much as 5 percent amid weak demand in South America and Russia as well as volatile exchange rates. It forecast a group operating margin of 5 to 6 percent, versus 6 percent in 2015, adjusted for special items.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

357,"Jun 06, 2016 02:10AM ET",Spain's auto-pilot economy flies high above political turmoil,nan,"By Blanca RodríguezJABUGO, Spain (Reuters) - In Spain's cured ham capital, the small southern village of Jabugo, uncertainty over who will govern next in Madrid is a remote concern for investors keen to produce more of the Andalusian delicacy.Drawn by the export potential for premium ham, family-owned meat producer ElPozo is pouring 70 million euros ($78.38 million) into building a new processing plant in the area even as Spain enters its sixth month without a new government and gears up for a repeat election on June 26.It is far from alone.In part thanks to Spain taking Germany-inspired austerity medicine and dealing with its banking crisis earlier than many European peers, company investments have chugged along since an inconclusive December ballot.Even now, with opinion polls projecting a similarly fragmented result and raising fears of a paralysis that could jeopardise Spain's recovery from a painful double-dip recession, local and foreign firms are finding reasons to expand, from the country's relatively low wages to recovering household spending.French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) separately confirmed in May they would be ploughing a combined 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) into their Spanish plants over the next four years and the two will produce new models there.The economy grew 0.8 percent between January and March for the third straight quarter, one of the fastest rates in the euro zone, as both consumers and businesses shrugged off politicians' failure to strike a coalition deal.In ElPozo's case, surging Chinese demand for Spanish pork and high-quality cured ham is an opportunity it is loathe to pass on. Spain's meat exports are thriving, having jumped 16 percent last year to nearly 2 million tonnes.""We want to inundate the world with Iberian ham,"" said Rafael Fuertes, one of the senior managers at ElPozo.The firm already derives about 15 percent of its revenue from exports and is seeking to make a push in Latin America as well as Asia.Its plant in Jabugo, first mooted in 2011, aims to produce 2.5 million sausages, hams and other types of cold cuts a year, after the firm more than trebled its early production targets and increased by 50 percent its investment budget last year.Premium products will include cured legs of Iberico ham, produced from pigs fed on acorns from oak trees and hung out to dry in traditional ventilated cellars for months.LOCAL SAFETY NETFor ElPozo and many other firms, support from local authorities has provided an extra safety net as parties on the left and right jostle for power in Madrid.Spain's 17 highly-devolved regions, whose stretched finances drew international concern at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, argue they are now a source of institutional stability.They boast of their own parliaments, budgets and local subsidy schemes, while even small municipalities can help get projects moving.ElPozo's plant in Jabugo is due to start taking shape later this year and should create about 70 permanent jobs in this village of some 2,400 people.""Here nobody is worried about whether there is a national government or not,"" said Jabugo Mayor Jose Luis Ramos of the Socialist party, who has been in the job for the past 15 years.DEALBREAKERS?The economy has plenty of momentum, with companies going through with investment plans hatched before the last election, but it cannot continue on auto-pilot indefinitely and there are already signs that the momentum has begun to slow.If the next election fails to quickly break the political impasse, and ushers in another round of inconclusive negotiations, the uncertainty could yet have a more marked impact on companies' ambitions.Spain's trade tailwinds could also fade.""Higher oil prices could now start working in the other direction,"" said Gizem Kara, senior euro zone economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). ""Exports are also not doing so well, due to a slowdown in emerging markets, compounded by the impact of the stronger euro. This is likely to weigh on investment growth.""Industrial spending on equipment and machinery slowed slightly in the first three months of the year, growing 1.3 percent on a quarterly basis compared to 1.9 percent previously, while the construction sector registered a contraction as a result of infrastructure tenders drying up.Already in May, surveys pointed to waning growth in Spanish factory orders, while the latest consumer and business sentiment indicators are mixed, at a time when uncertainty over the direction of policies still lingers.Parties such as the left-wing Socialists or anti-austerity Podemos (""We can"") - which placed second and third in the December vote, behind the centre-right People's Party (PP) - have for instance called for a rollback of labour laws introduced in 2012 which lessened firms' firing costs and made it easier for them to lower salaries.Yet even changes such as these may not be dealbreakers as long as domestic demand holds up or firms succeed in finding new export avenues.For ElPozo, Jabugo also had its own peculiar allure, even if it will be joining more than 20 other producers there.Nestled in the hills of the Huelva province, where extensive oak woods provide an ideal feeding ground for pigs, the village is famed for a micro-climate that creates the optimal conditions for curing meat.""We have a long term vision, we're not risk capital investors,"" ElPozo's Fuertes said.(Additional reporting and writing by Sarah White; Editing by Julien Toyer)"

361,"May 18, 2016 09:16AM ET",Suzuki says it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan,nan,"By Minami FunakoshiTOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) used the wrong methods to test the fuel economy of its cars in Japan, it said on Wednesday, widening a testing scandal that has already rocked smaller rival Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).Japan's transport ministry ordered widespread checks to industry methods after Mitsubishi Motors admitted last month it manipulated fuel economy data for at least four mini-vehicle models, overstating their efficiency.Mitsubishi Motors' president, Tetsuro Aikawa, said on Wednesday he would step down over that scandal, becoming the first senior departure since it broke, battering the company's reputation and wiping billions off its market value.Worries over similar damage for Suzuki sent shares in Japan's fourth-largest carmaker down as much as 15 percent during the day. Suzuki said it would continue selling its mini-cars and saw no impact on its earnings. The correct readings, it said, were not significantly different to those it submitted.Japanese authorities, however, have asked for further details from Suzuki before May 31, calling its use of non-compliant tests ""outrageous"".""The company apologizes for the fact that we did not follow rules set by the country,"" CEO Osamu Suzuki told reporters, adding 2.1 million vehicles were affected.The company denied using the tests to make its fuel economy data look better. It blamed the decision to cobble together readings from individual car parts - rather than a single reading - on its windy testing location on a coastal hill that made readings erratic. The individual parts were tested indoors, it said.Suzuki specializes in mini-vehicles, which have engines of up to 660cc and get preferential tax treatment under Japanese law. It has roughly a third of the country's mini-vehicle market. It also has a successful Indian subsidiary, Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI).MITSUBISHI'S WOESThe transport ministry, which had asked all automakers operating in Japan to re-submit fuel economy readings on all models by Wednesday, said no other carmakers had manipulated data or used improper tests.It is still awaiting further detail, however, from Suzuki. It said it has yet to decide whether to penalize Mitsubishi Motors and, if so, by how much.Mitsubishi Motors' admission that it cheated on the fuel economy tests is its third major scandal in under two decades, and has prompted the automaker to agree to sell a one-third controlling stake to Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).At a press conference on Wednesday, Mitsubishi Motors blamed excessive pressure, less time spent on research and development and high expectations for fuel efficiency. ""There was no direct order from top management,"" CEO Osamu Masuko said. ""But top management did not have a firm grasp on the proceedings at the R&D department."" He said there were several chances for the company to stop its workers - but it did not.Masuko, who has been at the helm of Mitsubishi Motors since 2005, has been named by Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn as Mitsubishi Motors' ""pilot"". UNDER SCRUTINYEmissions and fuel economy have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators globally after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted last year it used ""defeat devices"" on 11 million diesel vehicles to lower emissions during tests.France, which ordered tests on a random sample of about 100 diesel cars last year, has said some vehicles made by  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), VW, PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), Nissan, Opel (N:GM) and Ford (N:F) failed to comply fully with its emissions regulations.South Korea, which has tested 20 diesel vehicle models, said on Monday it would punish Nissan with a fine and a recall of its Qashqai diesel sport utility vehicles, accusing it of manipulating emissions. Nissan denied the allegation.In the United States, the Justice Department is investigating  Daimler , the maker of Mercedes vehicles, over emissions testing.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

367,"Apr 22, 2016 08:19AM ET",Yen tumbles on renewed rate cut talk  ,nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Speculation that the Bank of Japan could effectively start paying banks to borrow its cash caused the yen to tumble on Friday and gave government bonds a lift after a second bruising week in a row.Disappointing earnings reports from some of the world's biggest tech companies and fresh emission-test troubles for Europe's auto makers meant a low-key day at the end of a positive week for the world's main stock markets.Wall Street (ESc1), which is back near record highs, was set to reopen virtually flat. Traders were looking over  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell earnings and waiting on manufacturing data, after lackluster numbers from Google's parent wiped $32 billion off its value on Thursday (N).Euro zone business data earlier had showed an unexpected slowdown in April. Meanwhile, the bloc's finance chiefs met in Amsterdam to discuss whether Greece was making the necessary progress. The head of the International Monetary Fund said it wasn't. The big market move come from Japan though. A Bloomberg report that the central bank might go further with negative interest rates caused the yen to fall more than 1 percent, to 110.34 yen per dollar  and 124.93 to the euro (EURJPY=). [FRX/] The Bank of Japan, which meets next week, has two lending facilities. One offers banks zero-interest funding for loans to companies in high-growth industries and one provides zero-interest long-term funds to banks that increase lending more generally.The BOJ would consider applying negative rates on both facilities, Bloomberg reported - paying commercial banks to accept funding.""That puts a different light on the BOJ meeting and suggests they might be more creative than the markets had given them credit for,"" said Rabobank FX strategist Jane Foley. ""Clearly we have seen the yen suffer on the back of that.""The Federal Reserve also meets next week. Healthy markets and reassuring data over the past month have left many investors wondering whether they might have been too quick in pricing out an increase in U.S. rates this year.Manufacturing purchasing manager data in the U.S. due at 1345 GMT will provide the latest fodder for that debate after a rebound in ISM figures this week.German Bund (DE10YT=RR) and U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) were on course for weekly gains, although they slipped on Friday in reaction to the BOJ talk . The bond market has also been tracking oil prices because of their impact on inflation, and crude is up by more than two-thirds from its $27 a barrel low in January.[EUR/GVD][US/]CAR PROBLEMSEuropean shares were down 0.3 percent ahead of the U.S. open. Car stocks fell as  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said it was investigating its U.S. emissions and PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) said it had been raided by French anti-fraud investigators over its emissions. (EU)In Asia, the BOJ speculation helped Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) end the day up 1.2 percent at an 11 1/2-week high.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) dropped 0.8 percent, mostly as traders cashed in on the 5 1/2-month high reached on Thursday.Commodity markets were also taking a breather from their recent hot streak.Brent crude futures (LCOc1) hovered at just under $45 a barrel after gains of just over 4 percent this week. U.S. crude (CLC1) rose 1 percent to $43.58, up 8 percent on the week. Among commodity currencies, the Australian dollar advanced 0.2 percent to $0.7754 , off its 10-month high of $0.7836 touched the previous day.Gold slipped and silver pared gains as the dollar strengthened, but both were still headed for weekly gains. Silver rose to an 11 1/2-month high earlier this week, while industrial metal copper was set for a 4 percent weekly gain. [MET/L][GOL/]  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

368,"Apr 22, 2016 06:40AM ET",Risk and reward: Toyota's close ties to home,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor's (T:7203) close ties to its ""keiretsu"" - or family of affiliates and suppliers - have helped it become the world's top automaker. But two major production stoppages this year highlight the risks, too.The car maker's reliance on Aisin Seiki Co (T:7259), an affiliate, for door and engine parts forced Toyota to halt much of its production at virtually all its plants in Japan this week after an earthquake damaged Aisin plants in the south.The stoppage follows another week-long production halt in February after a fire at another affiliate, Aichi Steel (T:5482) and could initially cost Toyota up to 90,000 vehicles and 30 billion yen ($275 million) in profit, by some estimates.Toyota says it will restart production at most of its assembly plants in Japan next week. Nonetheless, the two incidents at the two affiliates illustrate the delicate balance for manufacturers like Toyota to disaster-proof the supply chain - a crucial part of the 'Just in Time' production system it pioneered over half a century ago to improve efficiency and reduce wastage.""Just in Time works when everything's running smoothly,"" said CLSA analyst Christopher Richter. ""But if you balance the cost (of holding more inventory) for however long you have between these disruptive events, it would probably be worth sticking with the system.""And that's what Toyota is doing.""The Just in Time system is to ensure we receive supply as we need and only in amounts required at the time. We have no plans to change this policy,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.""It takes time to procure the 30,000 parts we need to produce each vehicle. Bringing all these parts together is a massive process, so we're always looking to strengthen our supply chain, but we're not considering changing the inventories we hold (because of the recent earthquake).""RIPPLE EFFECTToyota says it needs to produce at least 3 million vehicles domestically each year to keep its plants, and those of its suppliers, operating efficiently, while also making its product development arm competitive.""If this base were to crumble because we shifted too many operations overseas, we would lose our domestic manufacturing expertise,"" the Toyota spokesman said.Toyota has, though, pushed some of its core suppliers to find more customers so they don't over-rely on the 'keiretsu' at times of disruption. Around 62 percent of Aisin's sales now go to Toyota, down from 68 percent before the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Big, non-Toyota customers now include Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Audi (DE:NSUG),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Volvo.But the sheer size of orders from Toyota - which gobbles up 90 percent of Aisin's Japan-made door check straps - means any disruption at just one supplier can have a disproportionate ripple-on effect across the automaker's production lines.'MADE IN JAPAN'Also, Toyota's 'Made-in-Japan' ethos carries risk when disaster strikes. Investors will have noted that while Toyota shut down in Japan because of quake damage to its supply chain, rival automaker Nissan Motor (T:7201) remained operational.Nissan, and third-ranked Honda Motor (T:7267), make less than a fifth of their vehicles in Japan, having shifted more production overseas after 2011. Toyota produces 40 percent of its global output at home.But for Toyota, which with its group companies employs well over 150,000 people in Japan, its status as the country's flagship company also carries a high responsibility and can come before maximizing profits in the short term.Nissan, and others, though, are changing tack to minimize the disruption from a seismically active domestic production base.""We have implemented measures since 2011 so we are better equipped to deal with natural disasters,"" said Masahide Amada, Nissan's chief product specialist. ""These include diversifying production capabilities and supply chains.""Analysts said Nissan's plant in southern Japan avoided serious impact from the recent earthquake because it sources parts both in Japan and from South Korea and China.""Nissan sources more parts from overseas than Toyota. This gives it a longer supply chain to avoid possible disruptions,"" said Koichi Sugimoto, auto analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.Nissan declined to comment in detail on its supply chain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

369,"Apr 22, 2016 05:20AM ET",Daimler shares slide on U.S. emissions investigation,nan,"By Edward Taylor and David ShepardsonFRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares fell more than five percent on Friday, hit by news that the United States Department of Justice had asked the carmaker to investigate its emissions certification process for vehicles including its Mercedes brand.The investigation comes six months after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would review diesel vehicles following an admission from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) that it installed software in cars allowing them to emit up to 40 times legally permissible level of pollution.Daimler Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber declined to elaborate on what prompted the investigation when the company published earnings for the first three months of the year on Friday.""We cannot go into details,"" Uebber told reporters as Daimler said first-quarter operating profit fell 9 percent as launch costs for its new E-Class and currency effects weighed down results.Daimler had said on Thursday that it was cooperating with the U.S. authorities.""Daimler will consequently investigate possible indications of irregularities and of course take all necessary actions,"" the company said.Analysts said they were surprised that the Department of Justice (DOJ) appears to be acting alone. In the Volkswagen case, the DOJ worked together with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). ""There might have been an issue in the US certification process but again, surprising to us that the DOJ is stepping ahead without mentioning the EPA or CARB in our view,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note on Friday. Daimler had previously told analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) that it had suffered delays in getting emissions certification for some variants of the GLS and GLC sports utility vehicles, a function of additional scrutiny in the aftermath of the VW scandal.It was not immediately clear what had triggered the DOJ intervention at this stage. The EPA said in February it had requested information from Daimler in light of a lawsuit filed by U.S. Mercedes owners but had not opened an official investigation.Daimler on Friday reiterated that it considered the class action suits to be without merit, adding the company will defend itself with all available legal means.Rival VW has been plunged into deep crisis by the diesel emissions scandal. Seeking to move on, it has proposed fixing or buying back about half a million polluting cars in the United States at a likely cost of more than $10 billion.France's  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) was raided by anti-fraud investigators on Thursday as part of investigations into pollutants in the industry.CLASS ACTIONIn early April, owners of U.S. Mercedes diesel cars filed a new class action saying the vehicles likely contained a ""defeat device"" used to cheat emissions testing, an accusation that Daimler, which owns the carmaker, denied.U.S. law firm Hagens Berman, which had already filed a complaint in February, said new tests had shown that Mercedes BlueTEC cars produced nitrogen oxide emissions in virtually all road tests that were far higher than in controlled lab tests.""The fact that Mercedes passed the dynamometer test in all tests, but failed the real world test, is suggestive that like VW, Mercedes is implementing a 'defeat device',"" it said in its complaint filed in New Jersey.The Mercedes BlueTEC system uses urea to help rid exhaust fumes of health-threatening nitric oxides. It is fairly costly and used mainly in heavier cars like Daimler's large limousines or sports utility vehicles, which are equipped with powerful diesel engines.A complaint previously filed by U.S. based lawfirm Hagens Berman alleges that Daimler knowingly programmed its so-called clean diesel vehicles to emit illegal levels of nitrogen oxide in low temperatures.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We're learning, just as they are learning,"" he said. ""And the solution will be a shared solution and developed together with them, not developed by us alone.""Marchionne, who has long-touted the need for further consolidation in the traditional auto sector, reiterated reasons for not linking up with French carmaker PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), which has said it is open to strategic opportunities.""We ... realized that even though there was a certain advantage in an association with PSA, it was an advantage that was too little and that in effect would limit the choices open to FCA going forward,"" he said on Wednesday.Marchionne indicated that any partner for FCA would have to be strong where FCA is weakest, in China, the world's biggest auto market.""The great advantage of FCA as potential partner"", said Marchionne, is that the company has a strong presence in Latin America where the market is weak at the moment, and in North America and Europe, but added, ""we're much weaker than the others in China.

376,"Mar 17, 2016 08:10AM ET",European cars to use more aluminum to meet CO2 targets,nan,"By Wendell RoelfCAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The amount of light, recyclable aluminum in European cars will rise to 180 kg on average by 2020 as automakers look to cut harmful carbon emissions, a senior metals industry official said.Global targets to curb greenhouse gases are prompting a shift to aluminum away from other, heavier metals such as steel. Aluminum use is expected to rise to 180 kg per car on average from 140 kg in 2012, with long-term growth coming from rolling sheet and extrusion components, said Gerd Gotz, director general of industry body European Aluminium, citing a new study confirming forecasts it made in 2012. ""This will be the growth engine of the aluminum downstream industry,” Gotz told Reuters at an aluminum conference in Cape Town.Under 2015 European Commission mandatory targets, manufacturers were to ensure the cars they produce emit no more than 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer on average.By 2021, that fleet average is to fall to 95 grams per km, with emission limits based on the mass of a car. Carmakers, including Mercedes Benz (DE:DAIGn), Audi, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), are expected to use more aluminum in parts ranging from doors to engines.Heavier, luxury car models are driving the trend in Europe at the moment, Gotz said, although this is expected to filter down to smaller models.""The cars will not land in a landfill anymore and you will be able to re-use the aluminum again and again,"" he said.The United States uses a footprint model that considers a car's size and engine efficiency while in Europe emission profiles are based only on a vehicle's mass.""Mass-based regulations in Europe is not giving the same incentive for light weighting as in the U.S.,"" Gotz noted.""When you come to a footprint-based regulation you really bring down the CO2 curve in both weight and engine efficiency,” he said, adding that the industry body wants the footprint model adopted in Europe.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

377,"Mar 01, 2016 01:32PM ET",Fiat Chrysler CEO says not in tie-up talks at present,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak GENEVA (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is not in tie-up talks with anyone at present, and a potential partner would need to have the same multi-brand strategy as FCA for a merger to work, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Tuesday. FCA shares got a lift last week after France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) said it was open to strategic opportunities in the auto sector, sparking speculation the two companies could enter merger discussions, but Marchionne said there were no talks with Peugeot. Speaking on the sidelines of the Geneva auto show, Marchionne added that since the failure of his bid to tie up with U.S. rival GM (N:GM), the world's seventh-largest carmaker had decided to carry on solo and was certain of reaching its ambitious targets for the years to 2018 even without a partner. In January, FCA raised the financial targets of its five-year turnaround plan following a better-than-expected performance in North America and Europe and strong sales of its Jeep SUVs, but some analysts wondered whether the indebted carmaker would be able to execute it on its own.Marchionne later said that GM, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and to some extent Renault-Nissan had a similar strategy to FCA, while it was difficult to imagine how a combination with Ford (N:F) could work given its one-brand focus. ""When it comes to consolidation, we have always focused our efforts on companies that have the same DNA...you cannot merge with someone that does not understand you,"" Marchionne said. ""Volkswagen, GM are companies that understand this reality well, they continue to be points of reference ... and to some extent Renault-Nissan ... they have experience of multi-brands,"" he said. ""It's difficult to imagine other alliances."" Marchionne said FCA had been approached by other auto makers but the options were not sufficiently attractive. Marchionne also said that while he believed the U.S. market had peaked, he expected industry-wide car sales in Europe to grow 3 percent this year. Among several products FCA launched in Geneva was Maserati's long-awaited Levante sport-utility vehicle, meant to reverse a fall in sales the luxury brand had suffered in recent quarters. The vehicle, whose price starts at around 72,000 euros ($78,156) in Italy, will go on sale in Europe in May, in July in Asia and in September in North America. Asked about whether some follow-up products for the brand would be delayed as is the case with sister-brand Alfa Romeo, Marchionne said there was no decision on the matter yet.He said the sales start of the Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan had been delayed given technical hiccups, but would kick-off soon. Marchionne did not confirm an earlier promise of bringing all workers in Italy that are currently on temporary layoffs back to work by 2018, but said the company would ""do its best"". He added discussions were ongoing to find a contract manufacturer to build its small- and medium-sized cars in the United States, but declined comment on a possible timeframe.

Construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) are set to build an extension for Tehran airport, while  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), another building firm, is lined up to design, build and operate new terminals for the Mashhad and Ispahan airports.French oil company Total said it would buy some 200,000 barrels of Iranian crude from the OPEC producer. There were also deals in shipping, health, agriculture and water provision, all signed despite continued diplomatic tensions.DEALS UNFINISHED, BANKS WARYThe Airbus deal alone is worth $27 billion at list prices and French government sources put a 15 billion euro ($16 billion) overall tag on the agreements.But most have yet to be finalised or are subject to conditions. Senior French bankers have expressed wariness.Iran's industry minister Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said an agreement between French export-credit group  Coface  (PA:COFA) and the Iranian central bank signed this week was an important step in the right direction.But he said French banks must support a corporate push into post-sanctions Iran. ""If they don't get active, there will be no increase in business,"" he warned. For Peugeot, the Iranian factory tie up is critical. When it suspended sales in Iran in 2012 it lost nearly 10 percent of global deliveries and interrupted a relationship dating back more than 50 years.Under Thursday's deal, set to be finalised in the middle of this year, Peugeot and Iran Khodro plan to modernize a factory near Tehran and be producing cars by mid 2017.They target an initial 200,000 vehicles a year making Peugeot 208, 2008 and 301 models with a Peugeot investment of 400 million euros ($436 million) over five years.Away from the signing ceremonies and speeches, an estimated 3,000 people marched through Paris seeking to raise awareness about human rights.

Using it as a standard for projecting navigation or music streaming apps from a driver's smartphone could help Ford and Toyota reduce dependence on Apple or Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), company officials said.It could also keep tighter control of customer data and the brand-defining look and feel of dashboard infotainment systems, they added.Adopting a connectivity standard not linked to Apple or Google may help automakers in China, the world's largest auto market, where homegrown companies such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA) Group Holding Ltd are major players in mobile mapping and services. Google has a limited presence in China, although the company has signaled it could expand there.Ford said France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co , Subaru and Mazda Motor Corp are also investigating adopting SDL as a standard. QNX Software Systems and UIEvolution, developers of automotive connectivity technology, are also adopting SDL, Ford said. QNX, a unit of Canada's Blackberry (TO:BB) Ltd, designs infotainment system software used by 40 automakers. The Ford-Toyota tie-in follows the purchase late last year by a consortium of German automakers of HERE, a mobile mapping business formerly owned by Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA).  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW AG and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's Audi brand say they will use HERE as a foundation for new connectivity services and features. Mapping is critical to autonomous driving systems, which the German luxury car makers intend to roll out over the next few years.Apple and Google bring formidable weapons to the rapidly evolving battle for control of connected cars. The Silicon Valley giants have armies of programmers, bulging cash reserves and deep experience in managing and profiting from consumer data. Even as they maneuver to avoid becoming beholden to them, many automakers are adopting Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto systems to respond to customer demands for better connections between cars and smartphones.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In March for instance China National Chemical Corp agreed to buy into tyre maker Pirelli & C SpA (MI:PECIn) in a 7.3 billion euro deal.Under the agreement announced on Monday, automaker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (NS:MAHM), together with its IT outsourcing arm  Tech Mahindra  Ltd (NS:TEML), will buy 76.06 percent of Turin-based Pininfarina from holding company Pincar at 1.1 euros per share for 25.3 million euros ($28 million).It will then make an open offer for the remaining 23.94 percent at the same price.Pininfarina shares, which closed on Friday at 4.2 euros, slumped 69 percent to 1.31 euros. The stock had traded as high as 6.29 euros as recently as April.""You have to bear in mind that under this deal the company will be recapitalised and will have better growth opportunities,"" Pininfarina CEO Silvio Angori told reporters.The Italian company has been loss-making for years, partly because carmakers have brought design in-house rather than hire independent design firms. Mahindra will also inject 20 million euros into the designer through a rights issue of new stock, and will provide a guarantee worth up to 114.5 million euros to its lenders, creditors and lessors, the company said.Pininfarina, which owes its name to the nickname of its founder Battista Farina, known as ""Pinin"" Farina, had net debt of 47.4 million euros at the end of September.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2016.Mahindra first approached Pininfarina at the beginning of this year, but has links with its target going back to 2013, when the Indian company hired Hubert Tassin, a former Pininfarina designer.Mahindra has a reputation for buying undervalued companies. In 2010, it bought troubled South Korean automaker Ssangyong Motor, and last year it acquired a majority of France-based Peugeot's (PA:PEUP) loss-making scooters business.($1 = 0.9079 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The company, which is rapidly expanding its model line-up and volumes, had said in August it aimed to build a plant at the western Slovak town of Nitra with an annual output of up to 300,000 cars. On Friday, JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO), said it will begin constructing the site next spring with around 2,800 jobs created as production ramps up. ""The new factory will complement our existing facilities in the UK, China, India and Brazil and marks the next step in our strategy to become a truly global business,"" JLR CEO Ralf Speth told reporters after signing the deal with the Slovak government in Bratislava.JLR's new plant will operate alongside its British plants at Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the English midlands, and Halewood in the northwest, turning out models such as the Jaguar XE sports saloon and the Range Rover Evoque. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Kia (KS:000270) and  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) already build hundreds of thousands of models in Slovakia, which said its membership of the euro zone helped encourage JLR pick it over neighboring countries. The Slovak government said it approved 130 million euros in state aid for the project, which helps Prime Minster Robert Fico project an image of strong economic management ahead of elections in March.The car industry represents 43 percent of Slovakia's industrial output and a quarter of its exports, according to the Automotive Industry Association, which expects the country of 5.4 million to make almost 1 million cars this year. Economy Minister Vazil Hudak said the JLR factory would create 12,000 jobs in supplier industries in addition to those at the factory. The central bank expects it may add 0.3 percentage points to economic growth next year, and 0.8 percent once production launches.Hudak said JLR would invest 1.4 billion euros through 2021, when capacity should reach 150,000 cars. A further 500 million would raise capacity to the maximum 300,000.JLR has grown rapidly since it was bought by Tata in 2008 but has suffered in recent months due to a blast at China's Tianjin port, which destroyed thousands of its cars, and a sharp decline in sales in China earlier in the year.Speth said targets were unchanged by the setbacks.

The vehicle met the statutory 80 milligram cap only with a cold engine after ""specific pre-conditioning"".Renault did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment. GM (N:GM) last month rejected similar DUH findings on its Opel Zafira model, after running its own tests monitored by Germany's TUV certification body.The VW diesel scandal has drawn attention to a wider pattern of legal test manipulation that stops short of outright cheating. The EU rules themselves are now acknowledged to be inadequate even by carmakers such as PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP).Carmakers routinely strip out standard equipment to reduce test vehicles' mass, tape up door joints and fit bald tyres that would be illegal on the road. Tuesday's DUH findings may shed light on the real-world impact of optimizing engines to pass tests only when cold - which would be another tactic allowed by the current regime.The DUH study was published in cooperation with the Washington-based International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which commissioned the original investigation that led eventually to the outing of VW.""It's unbelievable that so-called modern diesel vehicles that damage the air we breathe in this way are on the road today,"" ICCT co-founder Axel Friedrich said in a statement.Europe needs a ""comprehensive reorganization of the system in which mandatory regular controls on the street are integrated"", he said.EU moves to phase in real-world emissions measurements were watered down in committee last month under sustained German-led lobbying.Volkswagen admitted in September to rigging U.S. diesel emissions tests, unleashing a scandal that forced out longstanding CEO Martin Winterkorn and may cost the group as much as 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in recall costs, fines and compensation, some analysts estimate.($1 = 0.9397 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Labor unions have long wielded a greater influence at VW than at other German companies, dating back to the 1930s when the Nazi regime used expropriated union funds to build the massive plant at its home town of Wolfsburg.But the company's admission in September that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests has triggered a crisis which is allowing the ruling Porsche-Piech clan to tighten its grip.With a new chairman and CEO in place who are loyal to the family, some analysts think a power shift is underway that could weaken the position of unions and their local government allies who have often put investment and jobs ahead of profits. ""The way VW functioned in the past twenty years does no longer work,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst of banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, who has a 'buy' rating on VW shares on expectation the crisis could become a turning point for productivity.""VW has its back to the wall and it will be management calling the shots ... not the works council,"" he added. There were signs at the last supervisory board meeting on Nov. 9 that management is gaining the upper hand.Works council chief Bernd Osterloh, who leads the nine labor representatives on the 20-strong board, launched into a criticism of VW brand chief Herbert Diess for cutting costs without consulting workers, sources close to the matter said.But Osterloh, who can normally rely on the support of two board members from VW's home region of Lower Saxony, was forced to back down after a representative from Qatar, VW's No. 3 stakeholder, said his view was not shared by the majority.The Qatari intervention was unusual because its two board members rarely speak at the meetings, the sources said.Lower Saxony declined comment, while VW's works council and authorities in Qatar didn't return calls seeking comment.A fund manager, who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the subject, said Osterloh would be better advised to cooperate with cutbacks. ""Diess' strategy is totally appropriate,"" he said. ""If they (labor leaders) support the coming wave of cost reductions, they may be able to avoid even deeper cuts in future.""NO RED FLAGS While VW has grown rapidly in recent years, briefly overtaking Toyota to become the world's biggest-selling carmaker in the first half of this year, the profitability of its core VW brand has lagged its major rivals. The brand made a net profit of 540 euros per car last year, compared with 631 euros at Ford (N:F), 783 euros at General Motors (N:GM) and 1,647 euros at Toyota (T:7203), according to the Center of Automotive Research. Analysts have put this down in part to the strength of its unions, which have headed off retrenchments in the past. When sales were tumbling in the early 1990s, for example, VW averted job cuts by introducing the four-day workweek. During the 2008-9 financial crisis, the company also used a flood of profits from its expansion in China to avoid the cutbacks made in Europe by rivals such as Ford, Opel and PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP).One source close to VW's executive board said management had been forced in the past to seek ""maverick technical solutions"" to offset huge staff costs because cutting jobs was impossible.The emissions scandal, however, is a greater threat than the company has faced before, with its preference shares down 35 percent since the crisis began and analysts saying the cost of fines, lawsuits and vehicle refits could top 40 billion euros. VW has set aside 8.7 billion euros to help cope with its initial costs for falsifying both diesel and carbon dioxide emissions tests, and is seeking as much as 20 billion euros in funding from banks before the end of the year, sources said.New CEO Matthias Mueller has said the company needs to overhaul its strategy and decentralize product planning as well as sales operations -- steps that will remove key decision-making from the IG Metall union's stronghold of Wolfsburg, where it represents more than 95 percent of VW workers.New Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch has also put workers on notice of cutbacks by saying the emissions scandal poses an existential threat to VW.Other carmakers have invoked a state of emergency to wring concessions from unions. Peugeot, for example, closed a French plant last year, laid off thousands of staff and introduced a pay freeze as well as widespread outsourcing. The steps helped boost first-half profitability to 5 percent, almost double the VW brand's 2.7 percent.VW unions will no doubt put up a fight, but Osterloh appeared to concede in a Nov. 13 interview with Deutsche Presse-Agentur that his negotiating position had weakened. ""In this situation we have other problems and no time to fight for our rights by waving red flags or calling a demonstration,"" he said.($1 = 0.9331 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

395,"Oct 15, 2015 12:49PM ET",VW says can bounce back as recalls 8.5 million EU cars,nan,"By Jan Schwartz and Andreas CremerHAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) can bounce back from the scandal over its rigging of diesel emissions tests in two to three years, its new CEO predicted on Thursday, as the carmaker outlined plans to recall 8.5 million affected vehicles in the European Union.Matthias Mueller, who took the helm last month after Europe's biggest automaker admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, said the German company needed to give more power to its brands and regional operations while working to get to the bottom of the biggest business scandal in its history. ""We have a good chance of shining again in two to three years,"" he said in a speech to Volkswagen managers in Leipzig.Volkswagen has said up to 11 million vehicles worldwide could contain banned software that allows them to know when they are being tested and temporarily reduce toxic emissions. The German company said on Thursday it would recall around 8.5 million vehicles affected in the European Union following an order from Germany's KBA automotive watchdog, which is taking the lead for other national EU regulators.Volkswagen had said previously there were around 8 million vehicles affected in the EU. A spokesman said it was recalling a further 500,000 ""voluntarily,"" but did not know whether they might also contain the cheat software. The KBA said the recall, involving 2.4 million vehicles in Germany, should start at the beginning of next year and would be mandatory, meaning drivers do not get to chose whether or not to bring in their cars and vans for servicing. A recall of all 11 million vehicles would be among the biggest in history by a single automaker, similar in scale to Toyota's 2009-2010 recall of more than 10 million vehicles over acceleration problems, though dwarfed by the number recalled by multiple carmakers due to faulty Takata air bags.Some analysts have said the scandal could cost Volkswagen as much as 35 billion euros ($40 billion) to cover vehicle refits, regulatory fines and lawsuits. Prosecutors in Italy said on Thursday they were investigating local managers at Volkswagen and its Lamborghini sports car business for alleged fraud.Nearly four weeks after it publicly admitted to rigging U.S. emissions tests, Volkswagen is under pressure to identify those responsible. It has been criticized by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.Two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday the company had suspended Falko Rudolph, who oversaw the development of diesel engines between 2006 and 2010, as part of its investigation into the wrongdoing, which has already seen three top engineers suspended. FUTURE OF DIESELThe scandal has wiped around a quarter off Volkswagen's stock market value, forced out its long-time CEO and rocked the global auto industry and German establishment. ""We will significantly streamline structures, processes and (decision-making) bodies. We must become leaner and take decisions more rapidly,"" Mueller said of his recovery plan.""Our competitors are only waiting for us to fall behind on technology matters because we are so preoccupied with ourselves. But we won't let that happen,"" he added. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said on Thursday the government should think about ending tax breaks for diesel cars and promoting electric ones, though she later said higher taxes for diesel vehicles were not on the agenda.Tax breaks have given a big boost to diesel vehicles in Europe, where they account for about a half of sales compared with just a small fraction in the United States. Abolishing them could have business implications for European carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), as well as Volkswagen. France said on Wednesday it planned to reduce a tax break on diesel fuel.German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the KBA had given Volkswagen until the end of the month to come up with a plan for a software fix needed for 2.0 liter vehicles affected by the recall.The carmaker has until the end of November to come up with a technical solution for 1.6 and 1.2 liter vehicles, he added.Volkswagen has said it aims to complete a refit of all affected vehicles by the end of 2016, with some requiring more complex and expensive changes to hardware. Germany had previously said 2.8 million Volkswagen vehicles were affected by the scandal in the country. Dobrindt said only 2.4 million needed to be recalled because the other 400,000 were no longer on the roads. He reiterated the affected vehicles were safe and could be driven as normal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

396,"Oct 14, 2015 09:29PM ET",Exclusive: Canada's Linamar in talks to buy French auto-parts maker Montupet,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Arno SchuetzeLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts manufacturer  Linamar Corp  (TO:LNR) is in talks to buy French peer  Montupet  (PA:MNTP) in a deal that values the company at roughly 800 million euros ($914.96 million), two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Montupet is working with U.S. investment bank Jefferies to negotiate a deal, the sources said, cautioning that no transaction was certain and talks could still fall through. Linamar and Jefferies declined to comment while Montupet, the supplier of aluminum products to  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), was not immediately available for comment.If the deal goes ahead, it would be the latest transaction carried out by a Canadian firm in Europe after Magna International Inc bought Germany's car parts maker Getrag for 1.75 million euros in July. It would also show that the scandal over Volkswagen cheating pollution emissions tests has not eroded confidence among industry players seeking to expand in Europe.Montupet said in September that it had not been affected by the problems faced by Volkswagen, since it supplies Audi-brand V6 cylinder heads to Volkswagen, which are not linked to antipollution standards. Based in Clichy, on the outskirts of Paris, Montupet serves a number of international carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), BMW (DE:BMWG), General Motors (N:GM) and Ford (N:F).It employs more than 3,200 people and has a market capitalization of 668 million euros.Earlier this year its management team, who owns around 37 percent of the company, expressed interest in selling their stake to an industrial partner active in the automotive industry and familiar with light-metal casting.Analysts at Hamburg-based investment bank Berenberg said Montupet, led by the 64-year old CEO and chairman Stephane Magnan, was seeking a tie-up with an industry player as a way to expand into China.Magnan has 11.69 percent of the company while executive managing directors Marc Majus and Didier Crozet, aged 67 and 66, respectively, own a combined 20.49 percent of the company.Linamar, with a market cap of about $3.7 billion, has often used mergers and acquisitions to boost its international footprint.Last year, it acquired a majority stake in Germany's auto-parts supplier Seissenschmidt.A tie-up with Montupet would help it compete with larger industry rivals including Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen which swallowed U.S. rival TRW Automotive Holdings in 2014 to create the world's second-largest automotive supplier by sales. In addition to France, Montupet is present in other European countries including Belgium and Spain, as well as the United States, India and Mexico. In 2014, Montupet had revenues of 451.8 million euros and core earnings of 91.8 million euros.($1 = 0.8744 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

404,"Sep 22, 2015 05:31PM ET","Volkswagen says 11 million cars hit by scandal, probes multiply",nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said a scandal over falsified U.S. vehicle emission tests could affect 11 million of its cars worldwide as investigations of its diesel models multiplied, heaping fresh pressure on CEO Martin Winterkorn. Volkswagen said it would set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) in its third-quarter accounts to help cover the costs of the biggest scandal in its 78-year-history, blowing a hole in analysts' profit forecasts.It also warned that amount could rise, saying diesel cars with so-called Type EA 189 engines built into Volkswagen models worldwide had shown a ""noticeable deviation"" in emission levels between testing and road use.The crisis has sent shockwaves through Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for ""complete transparency"" from a company long seen as a symbol of the country's engineering excellence. Winterkorn was due to have his contract extended at a supervisory board meeting on Friday but is now facing questions about whether he knew about the automaker's use of software that deceived U.S. regulators measuring toxic emissions in some of its diesel cars.""Winterkorn either knew of proceedings in the U.S. or it was not reported to him,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. ""In the first instance, he must step down immediately. In the second, one needs to ask why such a far-reaching violation was not reported to the top and then things will get tough too.""Sources close to Volkswagen's supervisory board denied a newspaper report that the world's largest carmaker by sales had brought forward a supervisory board meeting to Tuesday evening from Wednesday. Volkswagen's executive committee plans to meet on Wednesday to discuss the emissions test scandal and the agenda of a full board meeting long scheduled for Friday, the sources said.An earlier story in the Tagesspiegel newspaper - denied by Volkswagen - said the board would replace the 68-year-old Winterkorn with Matthias Mueller, the head of the automaker's Porsche sports car business.Winterkorn did not mention his future in a video message posted on the company's website in which he repeated his apology for the scandal, which involves one fifth of the light vehicles Volkswagen produced worldwide since 2009, according to auto industry consultant LMC Automotive.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday Volkswagen could face penalties of up to $18 billion for cheating emissions tests. The carmaker also faces lawsuits and damage to its reputation that could hit sales, and media reports have said the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal inquiry into the matter. In addition, New York and other state attorneys general are forming a group to probe the scandal, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.""No company should be allowed to evade our environmental laws or promise consumers a fake bill of goods,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.Volkswagen stock tumbled another 20 percent to a four-year low on Tuesday after some countries in Europe and Asia said they would launch investigations themselves. Preference shares were down 19.7 percent at 106.1 euros at 1500 GMT (1100 EDT).At the lowest point, the declines in the preference and ordinary shares wiped more than $30 billion off the company's market value.Volkswagen was challenged by authorities as far back as 2014 over tests showing emissions exceeded California state and U.S. federal limits but held off on admitting wrongdoing until regulators threatened to withhold certification for its 2016 diesel models that Volkswagen in early September.Volkswagen has spent $77 million so far this year on U.S. TV commercials lauding its ""clean diesel"" cars, out of $164 million budgeted for advertising thus far overall, according to iSpot.tv, a Bellevue, Washington-based company that tracks TV ads.Volkswagen has not made a decision on whether or not to pull its ads, a spokeswoman said. 'TOTALLY SCREWED UP'Winterkorn has built Volkswagen into one of the world's top-selling brands since he took the helm in 2007, with brands ranging from budget Seats and Skodas to premium Audis and top-end Lamborghinis and Bugattis.But he has also faced criticism for a centralized management style which some analysts say has hampered the company's efforts to address long-standing underperformance in North America. Workers in Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen employs over 50,000 people, were dismayed by the damage to the company's image. ""If Winterkorn knew of the manipulation, then he must go,"" said one staffer who works in human resources at the plant.There have been no suggestions so far that other carmakers have engaged in the same practices as Volkswagen. Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have said the accusations against Volkswagen did not apply to them. But shares in those companies as well as rivals including  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) fell on Tuesday amid signs regulators across the world will step up scrutiny of vehicle tests, which environmentalists have long criticized for exaggerating fuel-saving and emissions results.The EPA said on Monday it would widen its investigation to other automakers, and French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Tuesday an EU-wide inquiry was needed too. Germany's Transport Ministry said it would send an investigative commission to study whether cars built at Volkswagen's headquarters complied with German and European emissions guidelines. Italy asked VW to prove the cars sold in that country do not contain the ""defeat devices"" at the center of the scandal, while Switzerland also said it would investigate Volkswagen's diesel vehicle emissions tests.The European Commission said it was in contact with Volkswagen and U.S. authorities, and it was premature to say whether specific checks on the carmaker's vehicles were needed. In Asia, South Korea's environment ministry said it would investigate 4,000 to 5,000 of Volkswagen's Jetta, Golf and Audi A3 vehicles produced in 2014 and 2015, and it could expand its probe to all German diesel cars if it found problems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

409,"Sep 15, 2015 05:42AM ET",Carmakers curb China output as sales growth stalls,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Norihiko ShirouzuFRANKFURT/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG) and other major carmakers have begun reining in Chinese output, wages and other costs, industry sources told Reuters, as executives at the Frankfurt auto show put a brave face on a sharp slowdown in the world's biggest vehicle market.The German car giant's Chinese joint venture, FAW-VW, is cancelling staff bonuses and cutting shifts at its plants near Changchun, northeastern China, people with knowledge of the matter said. The bonuses being scrapped typically account for more than half of the assembly-line workers' take-home pay.Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) high-end Audi brand also said it had cut output at its Chinese plants, trimming the working week to five days from seven in response to lower demand for models such as the A6 saloon.And German rival BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Tuesday it had reduced output of its locally produced 3 and 5 series models. ""We reacted relatively fast,"" Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner told journalists. ""We are not stockpiling."" Car sales in China, until recently the profit engine for automakers around the world, have been hit by a cooling economy and a plunging stock market. Demand was flat in the first eight months of the year and could drop in 2015 for the first time since the market took off in the late 1990s.At the opening day of the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday, industry executives expressed confidence about the long-term growth potential of the Chinese market, and said any short-term hit could be offset by a strengthening recovery in Europe.Industry data showed European car sales jumped 11.5 percent year-on-year in August.But some analysts said the Chinese slowdown was coming at a time when carmakers are still opening factories in the country -- creating an excess of capacity that could weigh on profits. Leading research group IHS Automotive expects carmakers' capacity utilization rates in China to drop to 65 percent from last year's 70 percent, a key profitability threshold.""VERY DEPRESSED""""The mood is very depressed at VW, BMW or GM,"" said Clemens Wasner of Austrian automotive consultancy EFS, which advises several German carmakers in Asia.China has accounted for more than half of VW's profit in recent years and about 40 percent at GM, which is pursuing a $14 billion expansion in China with its Chinese partners.Both VW and GM have already begun trimming local production -- by around 5 percent in July -- according to one China-based consultant. A GM spokesman said the company's business model in China was ""fundamentally different"" from most of the other major multinationals, with large investments in a wide array of brands including local ones in segments where sales were still rising.GM China chief Matt Tsien said in May that GM was determined to keep operating margins as high as 9-10 percent by selling more SUVs and higher-end cars. It ruled out a significant review of its China plans as recently as July. The U.S. automaker could nonetheless put the brakes on planned capacity increases, a person close to the company said, and has room to trim costs at existing facilities by halting production for longer breaks, reducing shifts and cutting workers' bonuses. ""They can immediately reduce extra months of salary payments which are very common in the good times,"" the source said. VW CEO Martin Winterkorn told Reuters TV in Frankfurt he remained upbeat about prospects in China, but noted a shift in demand there.""‎The eastern part of China is rather stagnating, while the west is growing,"" he said. ""Many people live in the west and we just built a factory there. We are looking to China with confidence and expect to keep growing.""Audi chief Rupert Stadler, meanwhile, told Reuters TV the brand expected ""further growth in China over the medium term ... and will not change our investment plans.""BMW, the world's biggest luxury carmaker, warned last month its forecasts for this year could be at risk from any further deterioration in the Chinese market, where its sales are falling for the first time in a decade.Eichiner said on Tuesday he saw no reason for BMW to change its full-year targets, though it was too early to talk of a recovery in Chinese demand. PSA  Peugeot  Citroen's (PA:PEUP) premium DS brand said it was helping its Chinese dealers to refinance and expected to fall short of its full-year sales network expansion target.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

413,"Aug 28, 2015 01:17PM ET",Carmakers scramble to adapt to slowing Chinese demand,nan,"By Joseph White and Nick CareyNEW YORK (Reuters) - China's demand for luxury cars used to move in one direction - up. Now, the prospect of a sustained slump in Chinese demand, prompted by sharp declines in Chinese equity markets and a devaluation of the yuan, has global auto manufacturers scrambling to find new markets to sell goods.German car makers are reviewing how many vehicles to send to China or the U.S., and U.S. dealers say they expect to get more Mercedes, Audi and BMW sport utility vehicles to sell as a result. A longer term slump could prompt automakers to export more vehicles from Chinese factories or absorb the short-term cost of production cuts, analysts said.Most global automakers have significant manufacturing operations in China they want to keep running. Industry executives say China is still a growth market over the long haul, even if the pace of growth slows.To offset the sharp slowdown in the growth of overall sales, vehicle manufacturers in China are pushing sales of sport utility vehicles that typically generate more profit per vehicle.""The real winners in the first half are the Chinese manufacturers, in that very small cheap SUV-type segment. We need to understand that and adapt,"" said Linda Jackson, head of  Peugeot  SA's (PA:PEUP) Citroen brand.Before the market declines and the currency devaluation, demand for SUVs was strong in both China and the U.S., creating a tug of war over vehicles between U.S. and Chinese dealers for  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz brand, BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG) AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand. As Chinese demand weakens, that should mean more German-brand SUVs will be shipped to the U.S.""Competitive pressure in the U.S. has intensified,"" BMW's Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner said earlier this month. ""Because of the stronger dollar, many manufacturers are allocating units from China or other emerging markets, to the United States.""BMW expects to sell more redesigned X3 compact sport utility vehicles in both China and the U.S. during the remainder of this year, as production ramps up at its factory in Spartanburg, S.C., BMW's global sales and marketing chief, Ian Robertson, told Reuters in an interview Wednesday. Robertson said BMW sales in China are still growing, but at a 2 percent rate, about half the rate anticipated earlier this year. ""We're still tracking at very high monthly numbers compared to every other market,"" he said.Daimler said ""reallocations due to market fluctuations are, to a certain degree, a normal process,"" and added in a statement Friday that the company ""will closely monitor the developments of the Chinese market and the stock exchange in order to react quickly if necessary.""A prolonged slowdown in vehicle demand could lead more manufacturers to export vehicles from China, said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific managing director at industry consultant IHS Automotive. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is considering exporting Buicks from China. Other Chinese producers, such as steel makers, are already moving to step up exports to take advantage of the cheaper yuan. Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd, BMW's joint venture partner in China, said in a recent filing that exports of vehicles is currently under review, UBS analyst Philippe Houchois noted in a report last week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

423,"Jul 29, 2015 04:56AM ET",Upbeat earnings lift European stocks ahead of Fed ,nan,"By Emelia Sithole-MatariseLONDON (Reuters) - European equities advanced on Wednesday, spurred by strong corporate earnings and gains in U.S. and Asian markets on hopes that Beijing could stem the rout in its markets without damage to the world's second biggest economy.The euro, the dollar and the yen held steady as caution reigned before a policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.Pledges from Chinese regulators to buy shares to stabilize stocks if needed and hints of more policy easing from the central bank helped soothe sentiment, prompting a bounce in some commodities such as copper. Against the calmer backdrop in financial markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) rose 0.8 percent after carmaker  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) reported first-half net income for the first time in four years. Oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) posted higher-than-expected second-quarter profits.""The results from European companies have been reasonably reassuring so far, although China is impacting a few of them,"" Mirabaud Securities' senior equity sales trader John Plassard said.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.4 percent.Investors are also focused on the outcome of the Fed's two-day policy meeting with markets divided on whether it will take a hawkish or dovish stance, while some suspect it might chose to do neither. No move on rates is expected this week.In recent congressional testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen neither ruled out a September interest rate hike nor guided the market toward thinking it was a done deal.European and U.S. government bond yields were broadly steady. [GVD/EUR] In currency markets, investors seemed to decide it was safer not to be actively short of the U.S. dollar ahead of the policy statement due at 1800 GMT. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the euro at $1.1040 and up 0.1 percent at 123.71 yen. The moves were well within recent ranges in low trading volumes.""In the near term there is caution caused by investor wariness in chasing any trends given we have the FOMC meeting ending today,""  Societe Generale  (PARIS:SOGN) FX strategist Alvin Tan said.""If the Fed continues to be relatively neutral in its tone by not dropping any hints of an imminent rate hike probably markets will continue to stabilize,"" he said. In energy markets, oil prices fell as concerns over global oversupply outweighed the impact of a what is likely to be a larger-than-expected draw on U.S. crude stocks. [O/R]Brent futures  were down 66 cents at $52.66 a barrel and near their lowest since February. U.S. crude for September delivery  slipped 42 cents to $47.56 a barrel.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

426,"Jul 21, 2015 12:38PM ET",U.S. 'disturbed' by Iranian leader's criticism after deal ,nan,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin NouriDUBAI (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it was disturbed by anti-U.S. hostility voiced by Iran's top leader after a nuclear deal, as both countries' top diplomats sought to calm opposition to the accord from hardliners at home.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said a speech by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Saturday vowing to defy American policies in the region despite a deal with world powers over Tehran's nuclear program was ""very troubling"".""I don't know how to interpret it at this point in time, except to take it at face value, that that's his policy,"" he said in the interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.""But I do know that often comments are made publicly and things can evolve that are different. If it is the policy, it's very disturbing, it's very troubling,"" he added.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, told supporters on Saturday that U.S. policies in the region were ""180 degrees"" opposed to Iran's, in a Tehran speech punctuated by chants of ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"".Under the accord reached in Vienna last week, Iran will be subjected to long-term curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The deal was signed by the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the EU.It was a major policy achievement for both U.S. President Barack Obama and Iran's pragmatic elected President Hassan Rouhani. But both leaders have to sell it at home to powerful hardliners in countries that have been enemies for decades, referring to each other as the ""Great Satan"" and a member of the ""Axis of Evil"".In the case of Iran, the deal must win final acceptance from the National Security Council and ultimately Khamenei, who has so far withheld final judgment, thanking the negotiators while saying the text must still be scrutinized and approved.In the United States, Republicans who control Congress have lined up against the deal, but Obama says he will veto any attempt to block it.Kerry also has the task of selling the agreement to skeptical U.S. allies in the region. Israel is implacably opposed, and Arab allies of the United States such as Saudi Arabia, ruled by Sunni Muslims, are suspicious of an arrangement that would benefit their Shi'ite, non-Arab rival Iran, which they accuse of fomenting sectarian conflict.The Secretary General of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council of regional Arab states, Abdullatif al-Zayani, said Khamenei's speech demonstrated ""Iran's continued interference in the internal affairs of some Arab countries"".""Those statements don't help to build confidence for cooperative relations based on the principles of good neighborliness (and) non-interference in internal affairs,"" Zayani, a Bahraini general, was quoted as saying by Saudi news agency SPA.Dore Gold, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, described Israel's opposition to the accord as a ""major disagreement"" with Washington over ""a central pillar of foreign policy"", but nonetheless sought to play down the rift with Israel's closest ally.""All you can do in these situations is just tell your story, tell the truth,"" he said, adding that the rift should be handled ""in a very careful way"" and with ""mutual respect"".ZARIF DEFENDS DEALHatred of the United States has been one of the underlying tenets of the Iranian ruling system since the 1979 Islamic revolution. But Iran's nearly 80 million people voted overwhelmingly for Rouhani in 2013 on a promise to end the country's diplomatic isolation.Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister who developed a warm rapport with Kerry during weeks of unprecedented face-to-face talks, defended the deal in Iran's hardliner-dominated parliament. He said most of Iran's conditions had been met, including so-called ""red lines"" set by Khamenei.""We don't say the deal is totally in favor of Iran. Any negotiation is a give and take. We have definitely shown some flexibility,"" the foreign minister said. ""I tell you as I told the Supreme Leader, we did our best to preserve most of the red lines, if not all.""Iran's Revolutionary Guards and other hardliners have started to attack the deal directly, criticizing a U.N. Security Council resolution passed on Monday endorsing it.They may be trying to persuade Khamenei to block the deal by presenting it as having violated the ""red lines"" he set, particularly by leaving in place for several years a U.N. arms embargo and restrictions on Iran's missile program.Zarif told lawmakers the U.N. resolution restricted only missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads, which would not affect Iran's conventional missile program.Revolutionary Guard chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Monday, according to Tasnim news agency: ""Some parts of the (resolution) draft have clearly crossed the Islamic republic's red lines, especially towards Iran's military capabilities.""Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to Khamenei on foreign affairs, broke a long silence on Tuesday and said the deal was ""not without flaws"", although he did not reject it outright.""No one can tell us which weapons we can have.... Except nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, Iran will continue making all the missiles, fighter jets, anti-missile defense systems, tanks and other armored equipment it needs,"" he was quoted as saying on the Supreme Leader's website.BUSINESS AS USUAL?The prospect that sanctions will be lifted is spurring businesses to make plans to return to Iran.In Paris, Laurent Fabius, who next week will make the first trip to Iran by a French foreign minister in 12 years, said having taken a hard line towards Tehran at the nuclear talks would not hurt France's businesses once sanctions are lifted.""It's true that France was very firm,"" Fabius told France Inter radio. ""Will French firms be penalized? My answer is no because in the past we had an important presence in Iran... You know, in foreign policy, I think you lose nothing in being respected.""French firms such as carmaker Puegeot (PA:PEUP) and oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) had leading positions in the Iranian market before the United States and European Union imposed tighter sanctions in 2011.Fabius will travel without an entourage of business leaders, unlike Germany's economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who took a large commercial delegation to Iran on Sunday as the first senior Western official to visit after the deal was agreed.Gabriel's haste drew some domestic criticism: ""Our economy minister wanting to explore business opportunities for German companies a few days after the nuclear deal is a dangerous signal to the region,"" said Paul Ziemiak, head of the youth wing of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc, during a visit to Israel.""Our Israeli partners are irritated at how easily the crises and the problematic role of Iran in the region is overlooked.""(This version of the story adds EU as signatory in paragraph 6.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

451,"May 08, 2015 12:22PM ET",German carmakers may need help to bid for Nokia's high-tech maps,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Andreas CremerFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German car companies may need help to compete with a wealthy field of bidders for Nokia (HEL:NOK1V)'s (HDE:NOK1V) high-tech mapping unit HERE, as the entry of technology company Uber into the fray signals interest from deep-pocketed Silicon Valley players, bankers and executives close to the deal said.German auto makers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), owner of Mercedes-Benz, BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG)'s (DE:VOWG_p) premium car division Audi have clubbed together to submit an indicative bid as a consortium, two sources close to the auto companies told Reuters.The German carmakers can probably justify stumping up around 700 million euros ($785 million) each to match HERE's book value, but could be easily outbid by technology companies who enjoy higher valuation multiples and have more cash.Some investment bankers said they hoped private equity could join up with the automotive companies to create an industrial consortium which would not be dominated by one particular company.Taxi service Uber has submitted a bid, worth $3 billion, the New York Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the offer.At such a price, Nokia could afford to keep a stake in the business it bought for $8.1 billion in 2007 and now values at 2 billion euros in its books and still realize a gain, one banker told Reuters.The companies declined to comment. High-definition mapping has emerged as a key feature for autonomous driving and connected car services which could evolve into a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) say.HERE's high-quality maps enable automakers to offer premium services that Google (O:GOOG) maps cannot match.For example, their maps can be linked to a mobile phone signal in a way that allows parents to see exactly on which side of the school their children are waiting to be picked up - and the car can route the navigation system accordingly. They could also combine with real-time traffic information in a self-driving car to help customers get to work faster or spend more time writing emails on the way to the office.Daimler's Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber told German daily Handelsblatt in comments published on Friday: ""We are watching the situation closely. High-definition maps are a prerequisite for autonomous driving.""THIRD PARTY?While HERE has become increasingly distant from Nokia's core operations as it prepares to integrate its giant acquisition of telecom networks rival Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA), the Finnish company may still have an interest in retaining a stake.Nokia has hired advisors from Evercore to test the market for potential buyers and solicited a second round of indicative bids, a person familiar with the matter said.Although it remains unclear how many parties are competing, bankers say there is a rivalry between two categories of bidders: the industrials and tech companies. The auto companies cannot afford for HERE to fall into the hands of a player such as taxi app company Uber or Apple (O:AAPL), who may block their access to it.

452,"Apr 30, 2015 02:22PM ET","Renault vote puts ball in Ghosn's court, exposing rival visions",nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The French government's move to tighten its hold on  Renault  (PA:RENA), crowned by a rare public defeat for CEO Carlos Ghosn on Thursday, has exposed competing visions for the carmaker and its alliance with Nissan (T:7201).Ghosn must now decide whether to fight or negotiate for closer Renault-Nissan integration, those close to him say, in the face of French determination to keep Renault in control of the alliance - and its own hand on the wheel.""I don't think he's going down without throwing a punch,"" one alliance executive who knows the CEO well said.Ghosn has long favored giving Nissan more clout to match its superior sales and profit, according to Renault-Nissan veterans who say he has tried before and may do so again.Seeking to increase its influence at Renault and other French companies in which it holds stakes, Socialist President Francois Hollande's government has introduced a law that doubles the voting rights on shares held for more than two years.Companies can opt out of the rule, but a resolution to this effect proposed by Ghosn failed at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, falling short of the required two-thirds majority with 60.5 percent support.The result was no surprise. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron announced three weeks ago a 1.2 billion euro ($1.34 billion) share purchase to raise France's Renault stake to 19.7 percent from 15 percent, in order to block the opt-out.While the government has promised to pare the stake back to 15 percent, the ""Florange law"" still raises its voting weight to 28 percent, all but guaranteeing a veto on strategic decisions.Renault and Nissan both warned that the move would endanger their 16-year-old alliance just as global carmakers are increasingly competing on scale.At Renault's April 16 board meeting, Nissan also said any lasting increase in French government influence would prompt countermeasures, two sources have told Reuters.Macron, a 37-year-old former investment banker, has played down the power grab, repeating his ""full confidence"" in Ghosn. ""We're no interventionists,"" he said on Tuesday, citing his approval earlier this month for the sale of Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) to Finland's Nokia (HE:NOK1V).According to company insiders and French officials, however, the government acted partly because it feared Renault's ""Nissanisation"" under a new convergence push by Ghosn.On paper, Renault controls Nissan through a 43.4 percent stake, mostly acquired in 1999 when it rescued the Japanese firm from bankruptcy. Nissan has no voting rights on its 15 percent cross-holding in Renault.But Ghosn, 61, who heads both companies, has always given them decision-making autonomy, even at the price of missed cooperation opportunities such as their separately developed and loss-making electric cars. Nissan has meanwhile outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of combined vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit.FORCING THE PACEGhosn is now forcing the pace of integration by fusing production, purchasing and research and development under new alliance chiefs, all three of them Nissan managers. A Renault executive took a fourth post in human resources.""The Renault guys are worried that Nissan's engineering is taking over and we're about to be eaten alive,"" said Bruno Mathiez, an official with Renault's CFE-CGC union. The same anxieties have percolated through the finance ministry.Some observers now expect Ghosn to counter the government by restoring Nissan's voting rights in Renault. ""Many investors are focused on the risk of increased government involvement,"" said  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) analyst Kristina Church. ""We believe this may provide a trigger for Renault and Nissan management to review the current structure of their cross-shareholdings.""If Renault's holding is cut below 40 percent - through its sale of existing Nissan shares or the issue of new ones in a capital increase - the Japanese carmaker's voting rights could be restored under French rules.""It's hard to see why the government would want an entrenched conflict, or what there is to prevent Nissan from carrying out a capital increase,"" said another executive close to Ghosn, who expects a ""well prepared"" riposte.Ghosn has tried before to reduce Renault's Nissan stake, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, notably during the global financial crisis in late 2008. ""Renault was short of cash and planned to sell some of its Nissan shares,"" one of the people said. ""Everybody agreed and it was all going ahead until someone in the Treasury remembered the 40 percent rule, just a few days before the sale.""The placement was stopped under ""friendly pressure"", and within weeks the government had announced 3 billion euro emergency loans to Renault as well as  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP).The source believes Ghosn will negotiate before acting unilaterally. ""A company like Renault needs to have normal relations with the state,"" he said.The room for compromise looks limited, after Macron said he saw no reason to let Nissan reactivate its voting rights and vowed to hold firm ""to the end"".But the clearest explanation of the government's stance came from Louis Schweitzer, Ghosn's former boss. ""I built the Renault-Nissan alliance according to a logic in which Renault controlled Nissan,"" said the top civil servant, who oversaw Renault's 1996 privatization.The government must ""ensure Renault keeps its roots and center in France and that the alliance maintains its original balance, with Renault in the driving seat,"" he said in a radio interview this week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

457,"Apr 23, 2015 06:42AM ET",PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO open to expand mini-car collaboration beyond Toyota,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuSHANGHAI (Reuters) - French automaker PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) is open to bringing in more partners to its existing collaboration with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) to share the cost of designing and manufacturing mini-cars, according to its chief executive. Carlos Tavares, PSA Peugeot Citroen's chief since last year, said the company's current cooperation with Toyota is ""moving very smoothly, very collaboratively,"" but he is also inclined to expand the collaboration to include more automakers to spread costs further. Taraves said he wishes to keep PSA Peugeot Citroen's cost-sharing effort with Toyota in mini-cars sustained. ""Our intention is to continue with Toyota,"" he told a small group of reporters earlier this week on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show that opened on Monday. ""Now if there are other (automakers) who want to join, of course I would have to discuss it with my partner Toyota...but PSA's position is, yes, we're open to bringing in other partners who would like to share (costs).""A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo did not respond to calls requesting comment. ""To make A-segment cars, it's better to have the kind of grouping of several (automakers) that are going to share a given investment and then make derivatives out of the common investment,"" Tavares said. Toyota and PSA Peugeot Citroen designed mini-cars mostly for markets within Europe and have been producing them at a jointly-run plant in the Czech Republic since 2005. The plant currently has capacity to manufacture 340,000 cars a year for all three brands: Toyota, Peugeot and Citroen, according to Toyota. Toyota markets a derivative of the jointly developed car as the Aygo, Peugeot as the 108, and Citroen as the C1. Toyota sold about 71,000 Aygo cars in 2014. ""Nowadays, of course, business conditions are so tough that getting together to share investments and share manufacturing capacity to make sure that you can make business plans that fly makes sense for everyone,"" Taraves told reporters. ""We are very pragmatic, and we're very open.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

462,"Mar 27, 2015 03:11AM ET",Peugeot French production increase earns presidential visit ,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) said on Friday it had chosen a French factory over a rival Spanish plant to expand engine production, prompting a visit by President Francois Hollande to highlight a bright spot in France's gloomy labor market.The troubled carmaker said it will upgrade the Trémery site to produce the turbo version of a staple three-cylinder engine already manufactured there, safeguarding local jobs. The eastern French plant beat out Peugeot's factory in Vigo, Spain, for the additional 200,000 engines per year.Manufacturing boss Yann Vincent said Peugeot's decision reflected ""work done by the Trémery site to meet competitiveness targets"", including productivity concessions by unions.The new production will bring no net increase in jobs, Vincent said, and the plant's 3,700-strong workforce is still expected to decline through attrition.The investment will nonetheless be seized upon as a vindication of Peugeot's 3 billion euro ($3.26 billion) bailout, in which the government acquired a 14 percent stake last year. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron publicly backed Trémery for the new investment after hosting a workers' delegation on March 19.It also provides an important photo opportunity for Hollande, two days before the second round of local elections in which his Socialists are suffering big losses to center- and far-right parties, with unemployment stuck at 10 percent.Peugeot said the final plant decision was taken by its executive committee on Thursday, but government officials had already announced Hollande's visit before that meeting.""It was some time ago that we'd decided to decide on March 26,"" the Peugeot manufacturing chief said afterwards.The domestic production increase was decided on strictly economic grounds, Vincent said, and will have ""no impact"" on moves to double parts purchasing from lower-wage countries under a recovery plan drawn up by Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares.Despite lower Spanish wage costs, he added, it made more financial sense to use the French plant's existing engine production capacity and component supply logistics. Vigo currently assembles only vehicles.""Of course we're happy that it's in France,"" Vincent said, ""but what motivated our decision was the superior economic performance.""($1 = 0.9193 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

468,"Jan 12, 2015 04:50PM ET",Fiat Chrysler wants to collaborate with others on new vehicles: CEO,nan,"By Bernie WoodallDETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said his company is in talks with other automakers to share the costs of developing new vehicles and technology, particularly to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and called on the United States to ease fuel economy targets for 2025.""I think (automakers') costs ... (are) well in excess of what I consider a mature industry to be able to afford,"" Marchionne told reporters at the Detroit auto show on Monday. The U.S. government wants automakers to average 54.5 miles per gallon of gasoline for their lineup of vehicles by 2025. Marchionne said that with gasoline prices sliding to $2 a gallon or less, consumers have less incentive to pay extra for advanced fuel-saving technology. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will review the targets by 2018, and Marchionne said he expects other automakers to lobby the EPA to extend the timetable for achieving the 54.5 mpg target and the corresponding target for carbon dioxide emissions.Marchionne deflected questions on whether FCA was in merger talks, but said that automakers' relatively low stock values reflect investor perceptions that car companies are wasting capital producing their own versions of commoditized technologies, such as the hardware for four-cylinder engines.Recently, separate media reports suggested that the Italian carmaker was talking to PSA Peugeot Citroen (PA:PEUP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) about a potential tie-up. Both reports were denied by Fiat and the French and German companies. FCA's October announcement that it would spin off luxury unit Ferrari prompted speculation that the automaker would seek another merger partner, possibly to plug a hole in Asia.Marchionne said Ferrari will always stick to its policy of keeping production levels below market demand, and dismissed speculation that the luxury group could significantly increase sales after the spin-off. ""To cite Enzo Ferrari, we will always sell one less Ferrari than the market wants,"" said Marchionne, who also serves as Ferrari chairman. ""That's a policy that will never change."" FCA plans to sell 10 percent of Ferrari via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake to its shareholders. A bond issue may accompany Ferrari's IPO in the second quarter, Marchionne added on Monday. He said he expects the car markets in Europe, Brazil and the United States to post single-digit growth in 2015.He said FCA would sell more than 5 million vehicles this year, up from an expected 4.7 million in 2014. The carmaker also expects to report 2014 results in line with guidance, he added. The group said earlier on Monday it would add more than 1,000 workers at its Melfi plant in southern Italy thanks to ""extremely positive"" sales for its new Jeep Renegade and Fiat 500X models, allowing it to fully utilize the plant's production capacity. Marchionne said the new positions were a ""big step forward and a positive sign for the country."" FCA will also end a state-backed temporary layoff scheme at the plant, allowing 5,418 employees to return to work full-time.The positive results at Melfi are just a first step in FCA's bid to make its European operations profitable by 2016. They are part of a bigger goal to invest 48 billion euros ($56.73 billion) over five years to 2018 to boost sales by 60 percent to 7 million cars and increase net profit five-fold. Analysts have called those targets highly ambitious, but Marchionne reiterated on Monday that those targets still stood.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A company spokesman declined further comment.The Paris-based company emerged from a prolonged European auto-market slump in need of a 3 billion euro ($3.76 billion) bailout, which saw the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489) each take 14 percent stakes earlier this year.Under the terms of its labor accord, Peugeot has committed to balance job cuts with new temporary training contracts for young workers. The company has said it plans to create 2,000 of the apprenticeships in 2015.The 3,450 job eliminations amount to 6 percent of the 60,000-strong domestic workforce to be affected by the cuts.Peugeot recently told workers that 29 percent of its domestic jobs were vulnerable to further cutbacks, while hard-to-fill vacancies could account for about half that number, according to CFDT union official Xavier Lelasseux.""Ultimately that leaves about 9,000 people that I'm worried about,"" Lelasseux said.(1 US dollar = 0.7980 euro)(Writing by Laurence Frost; Editing by Leigh Thomas)"

Paris-based Altran, an engineering services specialist, said there was ""no new contract"" with Peugeot, declining to respond to further questions.Peugeot shares rose following the Reuters report and were up 1.8 percent at 9.42 euros as of 1605 GMT (11:05 a.m. EST), valuing the company at 7.2 billion euros.The Moroccan R&D move is an important step for Peugeot as it seeks to regain competitiveness, and a symbolic win for the North African kingdom reflecting its growing industrial sophistication in sectors such as cars and aerospace.But any impact on jobs in France, where Peugeot is already reducing its engineering workforce, would be unpopular with unions and sensitive for the government.Heavily reliant on Europe for sales and production, Peugeot survived the region's six-year market slump only after a 3 billion euro ($3.75 billion) share issue that saw the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489) take 14 percent stakes.MID-MARKETThe battering was worsened by Peugeot's dependence on the mid-market, where pricing and demand collapsed, while premium rivals and no-frills brands like Renault's Dacia fared better.The Peugeot 301 and Citroen C-Elysee are the closest thing the company currently has to a budget offering, built in Spain on the stripped-down architectures of pricier models.Its new Spanish-built C4 Cactus also signals a move by the core Citroen lineup into lower price points that may ultimately call for a similar shift on costs.""We can't sell cars in Turkey or North Africa that have been made in France or the euro zone,"" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in February, adding that the bailout would help ""build capacity to serve regions such as the periphery of Europe"".Soon afterwards, CEO Tavares pledged to double component sourcing from low-cost countries to 40 percent while maintaining 75 percent of the group's R&D activities in France, where they employed 14,500 workers last year.Before the capital increase announcement, the French government had approved a new low-cost plant as part of the pitch to investors, an official source said.While the low-cost plan remains live, its timeframe has receded as Peugeot focuses on immediate restructuring challenges at home as well as a possible reopening of the Iranian market, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.With the French economy struggling and unemployment stuck above 10 percent, government sensitivities have been heightened by production plans that appear to leave Peugeot plants in Rennes and Poissy exposed to future cuts, sources said.A new low-cost production investment ""is not one of the levers in our recovery plan,"" Tavares told Reuters last month, refusing to be drawn further.

474,"Oct 02, 2014 07:40AM ET",Daimler cuts car market forecast as Europe wobbles,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - German luxury automaker Daimler (DE:DAIGn) has cut its growth forecast for the global car market, blaming cooler demand in emerging markets and a plunge in Russian sales which has put a fledgling European industry recovery in jeopardy.Speaking as the Paris auto show opened to the media on Thursday, Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said he now expected the global car market to grow by 3-4 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4-5 percent.Other executives shared his caution, particularly over Europe where a six-year sales slump has left demand around 20 percent below pre-crisis levels and sluggish economies have put a question mark over whether the gap will close anytime soon.""Perhaps we will arrive at 13 million or 13.5 million (overall vehicle sales in Europe). But the market won't return to (the pre-crisis level of) 15.5 million, I'm sure of it,"" Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said on the eve of the show.Europe's car market has returned to growth this year, although widespread incentives for buyers and government subsidy schemes in some countries have made it difficult to gauge the strength of underlying demand.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that car sales in Germany rose by more than 5 percent in September, bouncing back from a decline in August and giving a year-to-date increase of 2.9 percent.But demand has been erratic and executives are particularly concerned about Russia -- once tipped to overtake Germany as Europe's largest auto market -- where new car sales tumbled 26 percent year-on-year in August due to a slowing economy hit by Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.""Earlier this year, momentum was at the upper end of expectations but it's flattening out a bit,"" Ford Europe (N:F) Chief Executive Stephen Odell told reporters, referring to the broader European market.BMW (DE:BMWG) Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer, meanwhile, said price levels in Europe had improved, but not by as much as the German carmaker's managers would have liked.He forecast it would take more than three years for the European market to return to pre-crisis levels.LONG-TERM VIEWDespite their concerns, some executives said they were keeping faith with the Russian market, and in some cases sticking to sales forecasts.""The Russian market will come back. One has to think in longer terms,"" Volkswagen's Winterkorn said. ""It's right, we cut production (temporarily in September at the Kaluga plant) but Russia will come back, I'm convinced of that.""Toyota (T:7203) also said it expected to ride out the worst of the slump in Russia's car market, and stuck to its goal of increasing sales to a million vehicles in Europe next year.Didier Leroy, the Japanese carmaker's head of European operations, said that while sales of entry-level cars in Russia were down 25-30 percent, hurting many of its competitors, demand for premium vehicles was down a more modest 8 percent.Vehicles such as its Camry and Lexus have helped Toyota to boost its share of the declining Russian market by about 1 percent this year, he added.With carmakers scrapping for market share across Europe, the Paris show is packed with new fuel-efficient small cars and compact SUVs designed to tap into stronger performing segments of the market.Among the new models in Paris is Renault's (PA:RENA) revamp of the elderly Espace people carrier as a crossover sport utility vehicle. It was launched on Thursday 30 years after the first model was unleashed on European consumers who hadn't yet realized they wanted one.Once the European market leader, the Espace is now one of the laggards of its category, far behind the Ford (N:F) S-Max, which struck out in a sportier direction from its 2006 introduction and is unveiling another timely update in Paris.""It's a global shift affecting even family vehicles, and it is here to stay,"" Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier said. ""Designers are having to compromise as people look for something sportier.""Daimler's Zetsche said growth was also slowing in emerging markets such as Brazil and Argentina. But he played down fears of a sharp slowdown in China, the world's biggest car market.""Growth has slowed, but from a much broader base,"" he said. ""We must not forget that it is the second largest economy. We see double-digit growth this year.""(Additional reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Andreas Cremer; Writing by David Goodman and Mark Potter; Editing by Keith Weir)"
475,"Oct 02, 2014 05:50AM ET",Fiat needs more than the 500 to turn core brand around,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak PARIS (Reuters) - While rivals roll out new models and concept cars, Fiat has little to show at the Paris auto show besides another variant of its retro-styled 500 compact car, in what is starting to look like a worrying trend for the carmaker's namesake brand.Following the full takeover of U.S. unit Chrysler, the newly-named Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has set out an ambitious growth plan focused on its upmarket Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep brands.Analysts say it makes sense to concentrate on higher-margin premium vehicles that are selling strongly in the United States and emerging markets, but are concerned the group is neglecting a Fiat brand which still accounts for a large chunk of sales.FCA sold 1.5 million Fiats last year, with deliveries of the mass-market brand accounting for 34 percent of the group total.The 500X debuting in Paris should help lift sales by adding to the popular mini-SUV category. But the crossover car is unlikely to significantly change the face of Fiat's core brand, starved of models and stuck with an aging line-up.""The 500 is getting older and older, the success of its variants has been limited and they lack a competitive offering at a time when Volkswagen, Peugeot and Renault continue to launch new cars,"" said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at Commerzbank. ""Even if the European recovery was gaining momentum, Fiat would definitely lose out.""BUMPS IN THE ROADChief Executive Sergio Marchionne struck gold in 2007 when he chose the 500 hatchback to revive the flagging Fiat marque, selling more than a million in the six years after relaunch.Sold in more than 100 countries the Fiat 500 -- as Italian as a cup of espresso or actress Sophia Loren -- was meant to be Marchionne's answer to BMW's Mini and help drive sales of other models within the Fiat family.But a strategy that got off to a promising start hit a few bumps in the road, not least an economic crisis that pushed car sales in Europe into a six-year slump, from which the sector is only gradually recovering.European sales of the 500 are still high but have come down from their 2008-9 peaks, despite customized features and electric and cabriolet versions. A rise in buyer incentives in the United States and Europe to boost sales also hints at problems and risks devaluing the product, analysts say.Meanwhile, Fiat dealers say the 500 revamp has failed to rub off on other cars within the brand, some of which are looking tired. Fiat's Punto hatchback is already nine years old.""Mini did the classic rollout of keeping sales steady over the years by slowly and steadily introducing product variations, but Fiat is not that disciplined,"" said Jane Nakagawa, managing director at Portia Consulting. ""To the average consumer, the variations they have come out with were relatively invisible.""Fiat's global market share in the B-segment of small sub-compact cars has fallen from 9.3 percent in 2007 to 6.2 percent last year and is expected to dip below that level to 5.7 percent by 2018, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.In the city car A-segment, under which Fiat's popular 500 and Panda models fall, Fiat's market share is seen falling from around 7 percent to just under 5 percent between 2007-18.MOVING ONFiat needed half the time it took Mini or Kia to breach the 40,000 sales mark in the U.S. market, but deliveries there peaked in 2012, and fell 18 percent last year.The larger five-door 500L was hit by two recalls and the Serbian factory which produces the model was temporarily suspended last month due to ""market conditions"".""The 500L recall was a bump in the road and we are ready to move on,"" said Jason Stoicevich, head of the Fiat brand for North America. He said Fiat was on track to have its best sales year in the United States this year since the brand was brought back there in 2011, with sales through September up 8 percent. Stoicevich is betting on the 500X to speak to U.S. consumers who like sport utility vehicles (SUVs), are looking for something larger than a city car, and want a sturdier car with all-wheel drive capability to withstand harsher weather.""This is going to be a real game-changer,"" he said. ""It is the first vehicle we will put on the road here where there really is no reason for rejection in terms of either size or capability."" A TALL ORDERAs a group, FCA plans to invest 48 billion euros ($61 billion) over five years to boost sales by 60 percent to 7 million cars.Its ambitions for Fiat are more modest in comparison: sales are seen growing by nearly 30 percent to 1.9 vehicles by 2018, with the brand focusing growth on the Americas and Asia, while aiming to keep deliveries flat in a struggling European market.But some analysts think that will be a tall order, especially if Fiat has to compete with Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep for the heavily indebted group's stretched finances.They also say Fiat's five-year product pipeline of 27 new entries includes few surprises besides remakes of its popular 500, Panda, or Punto models. By 2017, the brand will only feature two or three models in the fast-growing compact SUV segment, they add.FCA said during its strategy announcement it recognized the need to purify the DNA of the Fiat brand, and that it would develop products that are either ""functional"" or ""aspirational"".It also said it would leverage the 500 family to expand in the upper segment of the mainstream market.""That entire brand has lots of magic sprinkled on their product,"" said Portia's Nakagawa, referring to the 500's past successes and the new Panda, which has been selling well. ""But they also need to make some hard choices about which models fit the idea of functional or aspirational, and which need to go.""(1 US dollar = 0.7925 euro)(Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit and Laurence Frost in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter)"
476,"Oct 02, 2014 05:00AM ET",Europe's carmakers walk tightrope between low cost and high spec,nan,"By Edward Taylor PARIS (Reuters) - Carmakers are betting on style and recycling in the battle for Europe's burgeoning small car market, adding hi-tech safety and entertainment features while often using older vehicle underpinnings as a way to keep prices down.Several new cars on display at this month's Paris auto show from Opel, Citroen, Skoda and Kia are based largely on modified components used in a previous generation vehicle, or taken from another model already on the road, as a way to save cash.Analysts say the move makes sense, as austerity-scarred Europeans are in no mood to splash out on expensive, big cars.While the region's auto sales are growing again after a six-year slump, they are still down around 20 percent from their 2007 peak and a full recovery looks years away.The market for small, fuel-efficient cars, or so-called A-segment subcompacts, has been a rare bright spot. It has grown by 32 percent in the past 10 years to reach 1.12 million vehicles in 2013, at a time when the market for slightly larger B-segment cars, such as the Ford Fiesta, has slumped 33 percent to 2.89 million, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.They predict further growth in the A-segment of 15 percent to 2020.But competition is heating up, and so the pressure on carmakers to lower manufacturing costs by sharing ever more parts among their models is intensifying.""The winners in the auto industry will be those who can attain economies of scale,"" said Wolfgang Bernhart, a partner at Roland Berger strategy consultants.Volkswagen currently leads the European car market with its namesake brand accounting for just over 12 percent of new registrations in the first seven months of 2014. It is in the midst of introducing a new production platform aimed at sharing more parts between cars.But the VW brand is closely followed by PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, with the latter growing at three times the rate of the market thanks in part to its budget brand Dacia. And others are fighting hard with their own strategies to keep manufacturing costs down.Opel's fifth generation Corsa for example, a 10,500 euros ($13,200) compact runabout, is based on a rehashed version of Opel's old Fiat-GM underpinnings, used in the current Corsa, which has been on the market since 2006.HIGH SPECMany of the savings in manufacturing are being put into new features previously only available in more expensive models as automakers strive to stand out from the crowd.Citroen's Cactus Airflow 2L concept car, for instance, is a no-frills compact family car with a hybrid drivetrain, based on underpinnings from the Peugeot 208, according to Rémi Cornubert, partner at the Automotive Practice at Oliver Wyman in Paris.""It's an example of cleverly combining elements from value brands with some upmarket features,"" he said.Though the Cactus has two digital flatscreens as the dashboard, it has manual rather than electric rear passenger windows, does with a small engine and relatively simple and inexpensive suspension.The focus on features over significant improvements in engine performance appears to chime with the priorities of European drivers. Currently 50 to 60 percent of all cars in the European Union are only equipped with the cheapest engine, according to consultants Roland Berger.Skoda, owned by Volkswagen, is due to unveil an all new version of its Fabia compact at the Paris show which borrows extensively from the group's parts bin.It offers an emergency braking function, intervening when necessary to prevent a collision. And yet, like most of the new subcompacts, it will cost almost the same as the model it replaces -- around 11,600 euros.Even value brand Hyundai, which is unveiling its new i20 in Paris, will offer a rear-view camera integrated into the seven inch ""infotainment"" screen and a smartphone docking station in addition to high-end security features such as a lane-departure warning system.(1 US dollar = 0.7934 euro)(Editing by Mark Potter)"
477,"Sep 30, 2014 09:20AM ET",Auto recovery wobbles in Paris show spotlight ,nan,"By Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's anemic car market rebound could be over before it has really begun. That is the fear of executives as they gather for the Paris auto show opening on Thursday, the biggest industry event in the regional calendar.While U.S. and Japanese car sales are back at pre-crisis levels, Europe is still 20 percent below its 2007 peak.Carmakers are rolling out new models in anticipation of closing the gap -- the Paris show floor will be bristling with fuel-efficient small cars and compact SUVs.But a tentative recovery following a six-year slump is looking increasingly fragile. And this time there is little relief to be had elsewhere, with Chinese demand cooling, Russian sales in freefall and other emerging markets in sharp decline.""Few plants have been closed, headcount levels remain high, and R&D budgets have largely been left intact to ensure a future product pipeline,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said. ""The industry is just sitting tight hoping for a brighter future.""It may have to wait a while.At the end of this decade, European demand will still be 1 million vehicles short of its pre-2008 average, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.""This recovery has always had shaky foundations,"" said IHS analyst Ian Fletcher, who sees European market growth slowing to 3 percent next year after a 4.6 percent spurt in 2014.""It's about whether customers on the front line feel secure in their jobs and how heavily indebted they are from previous years,"" he said.Carmakers that were too optimistic about the pace of this year's upturn have already been forced to cut back.Ford, which is showing a new S-Max minivan in Paris, will stop building its top-selling Fiesta subcompact in Germany for 11 days in October and November.Production of PSA Peugeot Citroen models has also outpaced sales, prompting a two-week halt to assembly of the 208 and C3 small cars in Slovakia as well as 300 job cuts at its main domestic plant in eastern France.Low-cost cars offer a notable bright spot but are largely imported, leaving the region's factories with excess capacity estimated at 2-3 million vehicles a year, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.Renault's budget Dacia range, the fastest-growing brand in Europe with a 2.9 percent market share, will be unveiling crossover versions of its Moroccan-built Lodgy and Dokker vans.Besides the no-frills range, Renault has been cushioned from the crisis by its 43.4 percent stake in Japan's Nissan, and Fiat is similarly shielded by Chrysler after taking full control of the U.S. carmaker early this year.It is Peugeot, showing small concept cars using a compressed-air hybrid drivetrain developed with Bosch [ROBG.UL], that is most exposed to Europe. Some 60 percent of its sales are still generated in the region and almost a third of its global production in high-cost France.DARKENING SKIESRegional demand is ""a contributor to the recovery of Peugeot, which is heavily implanted in Europe,"" Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Tuesday.""We are placing our hopes in the continuation of this growth, although its weakness makes us rather cautious about whether it will last.""European auto stocks have tumbled 14 percent since June 6, based on the 14-member Stoxx Europe 600 Autos & Parts index, after doubling in value over the course of a two-year rally driven by recovery hopes.""The momentum has turned from positive in early summer to very negative right now,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with ISI Group.The outlook has worsened as consumer and business confidence are ""dragged down because of the whole Russian situation"", Ellinghorst added.Russian car sales were down 26 percent in August, with the rouble tumbling as the United States and Europe stepped up sanctions over Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.China's auto-market growth is also slowing to a forecast 7.9 percent next year from 11.2 percent expected in 2014, according to IHS. That threatens to curb the bumper profits that have allowed premium carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi to ride out the crisis at home.The German big three are challenged by the pricing fallout from their intense sales rivalry, as well as new competition from the likes of Tata's Jaguar Land Rover, whose Jaguar XE sedan makes its public debut in Paris.European market leader Volkswagen also looks vulnerable to demand weakness at home, as it struggles to rein in cost overruns at the heartland Wolfsburg plant.But a real rebound must happen sometime, and Bernstein's Warburton sees Europe's average vehicle age -- 9 years, compared with a pre-crisis 7.9 -- among reasons to be cheerful.""There must be some form of pent-up demand building in Europe,"" he said in a recent note. ""There is clear upside for vehicle demand, if only a proper recovery gets underway.""(Editing by Mark Potter)"
478,"Aug 14, 2014 02:00PM ET",Fiat Chrysler growth plan challenged by possible merger delay,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Sergio Marchionne has shown he is determined to let nothing stand in the way of Fiat's merger with Chrysler, but a share price slide may yet force the CEO to hit the brakes on plans to turn the world's No. 7 carmaker into a top player.Fiat bought out Chrysler at the start of 2014 and both operate as one firm. Marchionne now plans to merge them into a single legal entity Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to boost the firm's global clout and pave the way for a U.S. listing he says is key to help fund a 48-billion euro ($64 billion) growth plan.However, his plan looks to be on shaky ground. The merger cannot go ahead if too many shareholders who disagree with it take up his formal offer to buy their stock at a set price - a legal requirement triggered by Fiat moving its registered offices from Italy to the Netherlands - and recent events make that a possibility.On top of concerns that Marchionne may be overreaching with his investment plan - to grow net profit five-fold and sales by 60 percent by 2018 - Fiat's recent poor results and weak markets prompted a slide in its shares to their lowest this year and below the 7.727 euro price that Marchionne is offering investors who want to depart when the merger occurs.Should investors holding around 9 percent of eligible shares decide to sell, that would breach a 500 million-euro payout limit that Fiat has set - and throw the merger into doubt. Fiat would have an opportunity to place the tendered stock to other shareholders and later to the public at the same exit price, an unlikely prospect while the market value remains lower.""With the share price where it is today, a delay is a possibility,"" said Andrea Giuricin, a transport analyst at Milan's Bicocca university. ""If there is a delay, it would impact Fiat's plans to lure foreign investors and ease its access to cash. Marchionne's attempts to convince the market to the contrary shows he is getting a bit nervous.""Fiat said itself in a July SEC filing that a delay could ""negatively affect Fiat's business plans and operations"". But as the fall in Fiat shares heightened that risk, so its CEO has downplayed it.""I'm absolutely unfazed by all this,"" Marchionne said last week. ""Even if the merger were not to happen as described... none of our plans presented in May are going to be impacted.""BUMPS AND WORRIESOn the approach to the merger Marchionne hit bumps in the road he did not expect: His core North American market is weakening, Italy slid back to recession in the second quarter, and conflicts from the Middle East to Russia have dampened investors' appetite for risk in equity markets.In addition two proxy advisory firms, offering independent voting recommendations as a service to institutional investors, recommended a vote against the merger on the grounds that it decreased investor rights and tightened the grip on the company by the Agnelli family through a loyalty scheme put in place as part of the merger to reward long-term investors.The merger was approved by 84 percent of shares represented at the meeting, but some institutional investors, including Norway's sovereign wealth fund and the People's Bank of China, voted against, according to the minutes. Neither would comment on the vote.Some individual shareholders expressed their concerns over Fiat moving its registered offices away from Italy, its home for the past 115 years, and also raised worries that the share price would suffer once the stock's primary listing moved to New York.In the end the hold-up may simply be down to a technicality. Against the price Fiat had to set to pay off dissenting investors - the 7.727 euros a share is based on the stock's six-month average - its Thursday closing price of 7.33 euros makes that offer still a generous one.Eligible investors have until Aug. 20 to tell Fiat whether they plan to cash in on their exit rights. The carmaker will announce the number of shares for which exit rights have been exercised in the week of Sept. 1.WARNINGSIf a critical mass of investors breaches the cap Marchionne has set, he has said he will start the merger process again - effectively meaning a delay of several months.However, with the stock's recent fall, a new merger attempt would lead to a lower exit price, making it easier to keep the outlay below the payout cap the second time around.Marchionne has warned that investors would be taking ""an enormous risk"" by exercising the exit rights, because their shares could be locked up for as long as six months before the outcome is known – and then left in their possession if the cap is breached.Marchionne is counting on the merger and the U.S. listing to help pay for a relaunch of its Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, export Jeeps globally, and take all three to fast growing Asian markets, where the group is currently weak.That investment plan's targets and timelines look ambitious to even the most optimistic of analysts, most of whom say capital raising of some sort is needed to make it affordable.Fiat had 18.5 billion euros of cash at end-June, but nearly 32 billion in debt. Its financing costs are high and margins are weakening - operating margin stood at 2.7 percent in the first half of this year.It is also valued below its European peers, trading at 2.6 times enterprise value to forecast core earnings (EV/EBITDA) compared to the median of 4.3 times for the sector in Europe.Fiat has ruled out asset sales and a share issue for now, but may go for a mandatory convertible bond. However, Marchionne said any decision on financing would only be taken after FCA was created and with a delay, this would be pushed out as well.A delay to the planned October New York listing could also complicate an already challenging U.S. offensive. Marchionne believes a Wall Street ticker is necessary to set up Fiat as a player able to rival the likes of Germany's Volkswagen and BMW, but after a lukewarm response to last year's U.S. debut of sister company CNH Industrial, he expects it will take time for Fiat to lure U.S. investors.Meanwhile the U.S. car industry growth cycle is about to peak, say analysts.""If they had listed earlier, they would have had a longer runway of growth and in growth times people forget about any company shortcomings,"" said Sanjeev Varma, managing director at investment bank Teneo Capital.Fiat has repeatedly missed sales targets, seen its European business lose share and plunged into losses during a six-year market slump. But those who have concerns about the company's ability to hit its growth targets also acknowledge that Marchionne has surprised in the past.The carmaker ""is embarking on massive investments and will not generate any cash"" in the near future, said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. ""But with Fiat, the consensus seems to be that Marchionne was born to fix stuff and will do so. He'd be bored if it was easy.""(1 US dollar = 0.7483 euro)(Additional reporting by Laurence Frost in Paris; Editing by Sophie Walker)"

""The market component could have been larger.""Asked for his views of the French government's role, Thierry Peugeot replied: ""I'm a liberal, moral capitalist and a defender of free enterprise.

Iran doesn’t want to reduce its nuclear infrastructure to the levels demanded. In response, the U.S., United Nations and European Union have strangled the Iranian economy with sanctions—cutting the country’s oil revenues in half for example-- for what they see as Iran’s ambitions to develop an atomic bomb. Iran denies it is building up nuclear arms.An agreement in November unfroze about $4 billion of Iran’s oil assets and eased some sanctions, and an agreement in July could lift more sanctions on Iran’s central bank and loosen restrictions on the finance, energy and technology sectors. That would free Western companies to pursue investments in potentially high-growth industries that have been off-limits for nearly a decade, though some U.S. sanctions regarding Iran’s alleged support for international terrorism and human rights abuses would likely remain.The drop in foreign investment from the West has been more-than-filled by China, Turkey and Russia. According to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, direct foreign investment in Iran has risen over the past decade, reaching $5 billion in 2012. However, that's still short the $7 billion Iran had projected for that year, and as the country grows, it will need more foreign cash.Since taking office in August, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sent business diplomats into Europe and Asia to attract investment, particularly in oil, to Iran. Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has said that Iran could quickly boost output by 700,000 barrels a day if sanctions are lifted, the Times of Oman reported.The round of nuclear talks begins July 16 in Vienna.

 By Blaise Robinson	 PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - European shares trimmed gains on
Thursday afternoon after the European Central Bank left interest
rates unchanged, but market hopes of a dovish tone at ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet's press briefing and fresh
measures to help banks kept the rally alive.	 Trichet was expected to prepare the ground for a cut before
the end of the year and offer banks further protection against
the euro zone debt problems. 	 ""Disappointment is likely, unless the press conference gives
clear signals of soon-to-come steps to ease the monetary policy
stance, such as liquidity injection on a longer-term horizon,
restart of the covered bond purchase programme, etc.,"" a
Paris-based trader said.	 The Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 0.5
percent on Thursday and said it will expand its asset purchase
programme to a total of 275 billion pounds, highlighting the
precarious state of Britain's economy. 	 At 1217 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares was up 1.4 percent at 929.54 points. It was up
1.9 percent shortly before the ECB decision.	 The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index
was up 1.5 percent at 2,213.32 points, after rising to a
five-week high of 2,232.94 points earlier in the session.	 The benchmark index, which has rallied about 15 percent
since hitting a 2-1/2 year low on Sept. 23, was testing its
50-day moving average on Thursday, a strong resistance level.	   Banks rallied sharply, with Natixis up 12 percent,
BNP Paribas up 7.7 percent and UniCredit up
2.4 percent.	 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on
Thursday the EU's executive has proposed coordinated
recapitalisation of the banks, the most explicit statement yet
from a top EU official on action to help restore confidence in
the bruised banking sector. 	 Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 1.7
percent, Germany's DAX index up 1 percent and France's
CAC 40 up 2 percent.	 Cyclical shares also rallied, with miner Antofagasta
 up 8.6 percent and automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen
 up 4.3 percent.	 Shares in troubled Franco-Belgian lender Dexia 
sank 14 percent, extending this week's losses to 36 percent, on
news that the bank could sell its Luxembourg arm, seen as one of
its few healthy units.

 By Atul Prakash	 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - European shares fell on
Wednesday as a deadlock over raising the U.S. debt limit raised
concerns about a possible default and a downgrade of the
country's top-notch credit rating, prompting investors to cut
their exposure to riskier assets.	 The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index , one of Europe's 	
main barometers of sentiment, rose 6.5 percent, indicating a 	
decline in investors' desire to buy equities.	 Banks were among the top losers, with UniCredit 
falling 5.1 percent and the STOXX Europe 600 banking index
 down 2.4 percent. The index has fallen about 7 percent
in less than a week and is down more than 10 percent this year.	 Goldman Sachs downgraded European banks to ""neutral"" from
""overweight"" after last week's bounce, saying doubts over the
latest rescue package for Greece have started to emerge after
initial optimism.	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
fell for a third straight session. At 0817 GMT the index was
down 0.5 percent at 1,094.92 points after falling 0.3 percent in
the previous session. It is down 2.2 percent this year.	 ""Nervousness and volatility will probably be our companion
for the second half of the summer,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head
of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.	 ""Our base scenario is still that some sort of eleventh hour
deal will be reached. However, there is always a risk that they
do not come to a compromise. The impact would be formidable and
the U.S. economy may not be strong enough to take this,"" he
said, referring to the U.S. debt talks.	 Deeply divided Republican and Democrat leaders are
scrambling to find common ground with less than a week before
the government hits its borrowing limit approved by Congress. A
downgrade of U.S. credit rating would raise its borrowing costs
and hurt economic recovery. 	 The chances of a quick resolution narrowed after a vote on a
deficit plan from the top Republican in Congress was pushed back
to Thursday from Wednesday.	 ""There is a very simple logic that higher bond yields are
bad for economic growth and yet all the politicians are refusing
to budge on this issue. The politicians are underestimating the
fire that they are playing with,"" said Richard Greenwood, fund
manager at Bedlam Asset Management, which manages $700 million.	 ""I see equities moderately attractive in the medium term,
with a lot of interesting opportunities within the market. I
expect more upward pressure on gold prices, so gold miners would
be a favoured sector,"" he said, adding the fund company raised
its exposure to the precious metals sector about two weeks ago.	 Gold prices , generally seen as a safe-haven asset, 
hit a record high on Wednesday for the sixth time in two weeks. 	  EURO ZONE CRISIS	 Investors also remained cautious following persistent
worries about the euro zone debt crisis. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said Berlin was against a carte blanche for
the euro zone's rescue fund to purchase bonds on the secondary
market.	 In reaction, Spanish and Italian government bond yields
rose. Schaeuble's remarks added to investor worries about
whether a new Greek bailout plan agreed last week would be
enough to stop the spread of contagion to bigger euro zone
economies. .	 Spains' IBEX 35 index fell 1.8 percent, while
Italy's FTSE MIB lost 2.6 percent and regional banks 
lost ground, with the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Banks
index down 4.1 percent and the FTSE Greek
banks index down 2.4 percent.	 The Euro STOXX 50 , the euro zone's blue-chip 
index, fell 1.1 percent to 2,710.44 points. The index had formed
a bullish pattern on the weekly candlestick chart last week,
indicating some potential for recovery.	 However, the gap at 2,790 proved to be a strong resistance
and needed to be closed in order to confirm the bullish view.   
 The index is trading below its 20-day moving average and found
some support around 2,711.	 ""If broken, the next support levels will be at 2,682 and
2,636. It is likely that the index will suffer more losses to
either of these levels before forming a short-term bottom and
closing the gap,"" RBS technical analyst Dmytro Bondar said.	 Meanwhile the Stoxx 600 Europe auto sector index 
fell 1.4 percent on worries about vehicle demand. Daimler
 was down 0.7 percent after second-quarter revenues
came in below analysts' expectations but PSA Peugeot Citroen
 dropped over 8 percent after it warned that
profitability would be hit by raw material costs and the impact
of the Japan disaster.	 Miners, however, were in demand as copper rose on supply
worries following a strike at the world's larget copper mine in
Chile. The sector index rose 0.6 percent.	 Among individual movers, ArcelorMittal gained 1.9
percent after the world's largest steelmaker beat second-quarter
profit expectations.

611,"Apr 20, 2011 12:44PM ET","Auto, tech shares propel European stocks to highs",nan,"   * FTSEurofirst 300 up 1.9 pct; highest close since Apr 11 * Technology, automobile shares feature among top gainers * Strong earnings boost equities; market outlook positive   By Atul Prakash  LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - European shares hit a one-week
closing high on Wednesday as strong earnings boosted auto and
tech shares, with analysts saying stocks were set to post more
gains on attractive valuations and improving economic picture. A sharp fall in the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index ,
Europe's main barometer of anxiety, to a 40-month low signalled
risk appetite had improved, but experts said the euro zone debt
crisis stayed in the background and could limit gains. Greek shares  fell 2.6 percent, while the country's
banking stocks  slipped 4.6 percent, with traders
citing market talk that a debt restructuring could be imminent.  A strong majority of economists polled by Reuters said
Greece will have to restructure its debt in the next two years.
Greek and Portuguese bond yields have hit new highs in recent
sessions. [ID:nLDE73J0J0] But the broader market stayed strong, with the FTSEurofirst
300  index of top European shares ending 1.9 percent
firmer at 1,137.81 points, the highest close since April 11 and
the biggest one-day percentage gain in nearly five months. ""The underlying economic cycle is still conducive to
corporate earnings growth and the results season is showing that
up,"" said Ian Richards, European equity strategist at RBS. ""For now, investors want to focus on that central scenario
of robust global growth, further corporate earnings progression,
cheap valuations and the asset allocation story.""
According to Thomson Reuters Datastream, Europe's STOXX 600
index  trades at 10.7 times one-year forecast earnings,
below a 10-year average of 13.6. Automobile shares topped the gainers' list, with PSA Peugeot
Citroen  jumping 4.7 percent after quarterly revenue
beat forecasts. The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts 
index rose 4 percent, while Fiat  climbed 4.6 percent
after saying it had cut its debts. [ID:nLDE73J0MN]  Technology stocks were also in demand, with forecast-beating
revenue from U.S. bellwether Intel  boosting chipmakers.
The European tech sector index  rose 2.7 percent, ASML
 advanced 5.3 percent and ARM Holdings  was up
5.7 percent. [ID:nN19291560] ""There is a push and pull between fear and the positive
earnings that companies are delivering. Long-term we are bullish
on Europe, we think there are a lot of positive opportunities,""
said Randeep Grewal, director of European equities at F&C Asset
Management, which manages 105 billion pounds ($171.6 billion).   US earnings revisions graphic:  http://r.reuters.com/tuc29r ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> EARNINGS OUTLOOK  Strong earnings have underpinned the market. According to
Thomson Reuters StarMine, 83 percent of the 70 S&P 500 
companies that have reported first-quarter results have either
beaten or met expectations. Some fund managers stayed cautious on the stock market's
outlook, but ruled out any sharp decline in share prices. ""The largest part of recovery in earnings since 2009 is
behind us and progress, although positive, will be less easy
from here,"" said Don Fitzgerald, fund manager of European
equities at Tocqueville Finance, which manages $2.2 billion. ""There are valid concerns regarding sustainability of
margins, commodity price pressures, government finances and the
start of the tightening cycle. Nevertheless, interest rates
remain very low worldwide, particularly in the U.S., and
valuations are not yet stretched. So a severe market correction
is not likely.""  Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC,
said equities looked relatively cheap versus credit, but were
highly exposed to earnings downgrades. ""Sell-side analysts are still looking for significant
improvements in margins and I don't like that,"" he said, citing
a potential margin squeeze from high oil prices, rising wages in
Asia and waning productivity gains. All of which pointed to a
contraction of forward-looking margin assumptions, he added.

from companies including chipmaker Intel lifted global stocks
and renewed risk appetite on Wednesday, driving commodities
higher and the Australian dollar to a post-float high. Solid corporate earnings in the U.S. and Europe bolstered
optimism about the economy and offset concerns of sovereign

Wednesday, with technology stocks buoyed by strong results from
U.S. chip maker Intel ahead of Nokia's earnings on Thursday. By 1051 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 1.7 percent at 1,135.75 points, after rising 0.4
percent in the previous session. Concerns about Standard & Poor's revising the United States
credit outlook to negative on Monday and worries about the euro
zone peripheral debt situation has prompted some weakness in
stocks of late. ""There are still attractive opportunities, but market
volatility remains, all the underlying issues at a structural
and macro level are still unsolved business and that uncertainty
is leading to oversensitivity,"" said Randeep Grewal, director of
European equities at F&C Asset Management, which has 105 billion
pounds ($171.6 billion) in assets under management. ""There is a push and pull between fear and the positive
earnings that companies are delivering. Long-term we are bullish
on Europe, we think there are a lot of positive opportunities."" Technology stocks were in demand, with European chipmakers
boosted by forecast-beating revenue from U.S. bellwether Intel.
 Dutch chip equipment maker ASML, French firm
STMicroelectronics, British chip designer ARM Holdings, German
group Infineon gained 4.1 to 7.1 percent. Fund managers said the next focus would be on Nokia's
results on Thursday, expected to show a 29 percent fall in
earnings per share as the company loses market share to more
expensive smartphones.    ""The European market will be focused
on what Nokia does as that is considered a bellwether for a lot
of European hardware and semiconductor names, there is
considerable uncertainty about the company,"" Grewal said. Carmakers also featured among the top performers following
earnings news. PSA Peugeot Citroen rose 4.7 percent after
quarterly revenue beat forecasts. Fiat gained 4.3 percent after results. Also helping the sector was a research note by Santander
which said it expects a strong set of first-quarter numbers from
Daimler and BMW, after both companies reported double-digit
percentage volume growth year-on-year. Daimler was up 4.2 percent and BMW rose 3.1 percent.  TECHNICALS POSITIVE  On the technical front, the picture looked positive. The
euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 broke through a key
resistance level at 2,887 points, which represents the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement of the index's rally from
mid-March to April 7. The index was up 2.1 percent at 2917.14 and the next
resistance level is at 2927.44, which is the 23.6 percent
retracement of the latest rally. Meanwhile, Spain saw solid demand for its bonds, though talk
surrounding Greek debt pushed Spanish benchmark bond yields to
near euro lifetime highs and cast doubt on whether the country
can avoid the same fate as its smaller, troubled members. The Peripheral Eurozone Countries Index rose 2.4 percent. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 2 percent,
Germany's DAX was 2.5 percent higher and France's CAC 40 gained
2.2 percent.

on Wednesday, tracking gains on Wall Street and in Asia, after
strong sales at tech bellwether Intel and other U.S. firms
boosted optimism for European companies' results.  At 0903 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European

decline on Monday when Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook for
U.S. debt to negative.
 ""While S&P grabbed some headlines earlier in the week, on a
future event that may or may not happen, it seems things on the
ground are coming up pretty good,"" said Philip Isherwood,
European equities strategist at Evolution Securities. ""The economic and corporate message is good. There is
nothing to fear but fear itself."" L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics group, rose 3.1
percent after saying on Tuesday it was well-positioned to
outperform its markets in 2011, while posting higher sales in
the first quarter, helped by North America.  Intel Corp forecast quarterly revenues well above Wall
Street's estimates, defying fears the world's top chip maker is
struggling to find its footing as personal computer sales growth
wanes. European techs rose, including STMicroelectronics,
Alcatel-Lucent and Infineon, up between 3.8 and 5 percent. Peugeot gained 3.3 percent, bouncing back from a recent
sharp retreat, after the French car maker reported
forecast-beating quarterly revenues as strong demand in emerging
markets helps it offset supply chain problems in Japan. Other autos to rise included Daimler, up 2.4 percent.  MINERS GAIN Spot gold prices breached $1,500 for the first time and
silver hit a 31-year high on Wednesday, supported by a weak
dollar and concerns over a sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone. With base metal prices also rising, miners were among the
biggest gainers. Heavyweights Anglo American and Rio Tinto rose 2.8 and 2.6
percent, respectively. Kazakhmys and Xstrata rose 1.9 and 2.7  percent
respectively, even as they went ex-dividend.  Oils gained, tracking crude prices. BP was up 2.5 percent,
but down nearly 30 percent on a year ago, when it suffered a
major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 Isherwood said he favoured the oil and mining sectors.
""They're going to offer topline growth, earnings growth,
upgrades, and protection against the major risk, inflation.""
 Equity valuations, remain attractive, despite the benchmark
having risen more than 75 percent from its low of March, 2009.  The STOXX Europe 600 carries a one-year forward
price-to-earnings of about 10.7 against a 10-year average of
13.5, Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.  But the technical picture is less rosy. The FTSEurofirst
300 remains below its 50-day average, and analysts say further
progress may be limited.  ""It's also broken down through its long-term uptrend, and
it's started looking like the trend has gone from providing

 (Adds quotes, details from unveiling)	 By Helen Massy-Beresford	 SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - China's car market will
continue to grow by about 10 percent a year for several years,
the chief executive of PSA Peugeot Citroen said as the
French car maker unveiled its new DS5 in Shanghai.	 ""The decade to come will be a decade in which the Asian
market will be the major engine of growth for the automobile
sector,"" CEO Philippe Varin told a joint news conference with
Changan, its second Chinese partner.	 In a move that illustrates the importance of China, the
world's largest auto market, Citroen took the wraps off its new
DS5 premium five-seater car in Shanghai in a ceremony the day
before the Shanghai auto show opens to the media on Tuesday.	 As part of a futuristic show that saw the DS5 driven on to a
sloping stage against a backdrop of flashing coloured lights and
thumping music, Citroen's managing director, Frederic Banzet,
said China would account for 30 percent of the Citroen brand's
sales by 2020, compared with the current 16 percent.	 Citroen hopes the DS5 will lure younger customers in China,
Varin said, adding that the premium sector was particularly
important in the Chinese market.	 The DS5 is the third in the DS range that revives the name
of the iconic Citroen DS cars produced from the 1950s to 1970s
without replicating the look of its predecessors.	 Referring to the Chinese market in general, Varin told
journalists ahead of the show that ""10 percent growth will last
for several years.""	 At the beginning of the year PSA said it expected the
Chinese market to maintain double-digit growth in 2011.	 He later told guests at the DS5 ceremony that China was a
""cornerstone"" of its strategy to become more international,
which it shares with other European carmakers facing stagnating
sales closer to home.	 Gregoire Olivier, chief executive of PSA's Asia operations,
said that about 5 percent of Chinese people own a car compared
with about 55 percent of Europeans, a disparity he said showed
how much room there is for the Chinese market to grow.	 Car ownership is not evenly spread in the country, with
Beijing and Shanghai having to impose limits on car
registrations even as smaller towns and cities with lower car
ownership numbers emerge and carmakers rush in to scoop up
sales.	 ""Smaller towns are getting into the market and carmakers are
starting to be able to set up there,"" said Varin.	 PSA will produce DS5s, the latest model in its DS range, in
China with its new partner Changan Automobile, China's No.4
automaker and in Europe at its Sochaux factory in France.	 The China facility will have an initial capacity of 200,000
units, Varin said.	 PSA and Changan, the state parent of Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co , signed a deal for a 50-50
manufacturing joint venture in July 2010, saying at the time the
venture would have an initial investment of 8.4 billion yuan.
[ID:nTOE66804B]	 The partners are waiting for the final approval from the
Chinese government, but today ""everything suggests that the
joint venture approval is following its normal course,"" Varin
said.	 PSA already has a long-standing joint venture in place with
China's No.3 carmaker, Dongfeng Motor , with which it
makes Peugeot 408 and Citroen C5 sedans. It is trailing General
Motors and Volkswagen , which are performing
strongly in China.	 PSA plans to set up a dedicated network of DS dealerships in
China to underscore the exclusivity of the range, which revives
the name of the iconic Citroen DS of the 1950s-1970s, as the
company seeks to tap into the growing premium market in China.	 About 60 percent of the DS5's sales should come from Europe
and the rest from China, Olivier said.	 As required by Chinese legislation, PSA and Changan will
also launch a dedicated brand as part of their joint venture,
starting with commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles to
follow two to three years later.	 Olivier said the new brand could be launched within a year.	 ""China is objective No.1 for the brand, but we can't rule
out exporting it,"" he added.

622,"Apr 15, 2011 07:40AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Interest rates back to fixate investors,nan," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Financial markets have swung
back into a new but familiar phase -- worrying about interest
rates -- and, not coincidently, the euro zone debt crisis is
also bubbling after a brief hiatus. It all points to a couple of weeks ahead that are likely to
be volatile -- risk-on, risk-off -- with a particular focus on
the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting on April 26. The interest rate issue is at its most obvious on the
foreign exchange market, where carry trading has returned.
Investors are borrowing in low-yielding currencies to invest in
higher-yielding ones. The euro, for example, is at its highest in 15 months
against the dollar. This is being driven by yield differentials now available
after the European Central Bank raised interest rates (with more
likely to come) while Japan keeps monetary conditions
ultra-loose following its devastating earthquake and tsunami. A sort of middle ground is being held by the Fed, which is
not likely to raise rates until next year, but which has to
decide on the future of its asset-buying quantative easing (QE)
programme, due to end in June. It is at this point that equity investors come into the
picture. QE has produced a flood of liquidity into markets that
has essentially driven investors into stocks, in part because it
has made a lot of fixed income unattractive. Equity markets have been remarkably resilient, shrugging off
just about everything that is being thrown at them, from
rocketing oil prices, wobbly euro zone debt, a big blow to
Japan's economy, and a revolt in the Arab world. Gary Baker, head of European equity strategy for Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch, says equity investors are actually
""reluctant bulls"" who can't fight Fed-driven liquidity. ""They see very little alternative to equities,"" he said. It all makes markets highly vulnerable to sudden, surprising
change. So any comments from the various factions in the U.S.
central bank hierarchy over the next few weeks may be even more
market-moving than usual. Flash PMIs from across the euro zone may also be signposts
to the ECB's next move.  SPILLOVER Interest rate speculation is also playing into the euro zone
debt crisis, with the tighter ECB policy and strong euro doing
few favours for the struggling peripheral economies. This is most evident in Greece, where the spread between
10-year bonds and German equivalents is now more than 1,000
basis points and talk is rife of restructuring being needed. Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday that Greece
would present details of fresh austerity and privatisation plans
after Easter. They are an attempt to convince markets it can
tidy up its finances and avoid restructuring. Investors, however, continue to pressure peripheral debt,
despite various plans to draw a line under the problem.
Papandreou's announcement that details would come later did
little to ease concerns. Differing interest rate prospects, in the meantime, have
been a major catalyst behind the recent shift of investment
flows into emerging markets. Fears of tightening in red-hot emerging economies put some
investors off at the beginning of the year, but a belief that
the rate cycle was peaking opened the door to aggressive new
flows. Again, this makes markets particularly vulnerable to
surprises, epitomised by the risk-averse reaction to China's
increasing growth and higher consumer price inflation reported
in the past week. India also reported higher than expected inflation. The coming week brings central bank meetings in a number of
major emerging markets, notably Hungary, Brazil, Turkey, Israel
and Thailand. Turkey may be the most interesting as it will feature a
newly appointed central bank governor, Erdem Basci, widely seen
as the main architect of the country's unorthodox monetary
policy, which twins rate cuts with rises in bank reserve ratios
in order to tighten policy.  MORE EARNINGS The remarkable performance of world equities, meanwhile,
will be tested in the coming week by the latest earnings season,
this time with Europe joining in with Wall Street. The U.S. reports will be dominated by banks, including
Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Europe will hear from
the likes of Novartis, LVMH and Peugeot. Europe may disappoint. Thomson Reuters StarMine data
suggests STOXX Europe 600 companies may post first-quarter
figures that will be on average 1 percent below expectations. Sentiment on the equity market nonetheless remains
constructive as seen in commodity trader Glencore's planned $12
billion initial public offering next month.

 will invest 130 million euros ($188 million) at its Slovak
assembly plant to add a new model, the company's chief executive
officer said on Monday. PSA Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive Philippe Varin said the
car maker would also add around 900 new jobs to the 3,000-strong
workforce at the factory, located in the western Slovak town of
Trnava. Company officials, however, did not give any details about
the new model, which is expected to go into mass production next
year. PSA, which is among the Slovakia's top exporters and major
employers, made 187,000 cars last year, compared with 203,800 in
2009. The assembly plant's annual production capacity is 300,000
cars, but has not been running at full speed. The Slovak site currently makes some Peugeot 207s as well as
the Citroen C3 Picasso. PSA Peugeot Citroen reduced production last month at some
European sites due to cuts in supplies from its key Japanese
partner Hitachi. Varin said production at the French car group's factories
was returning to normal, but it could face further disruptions
in the future. ""Situation is getting back to normal, but there is still
some uncertainty. It is possible there will be further
disruptions in supplies, but it is hard to foresee them today,""
Varin told reporters. (Reporting by Martin Santa. Editing by Jane Merriman)

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Antoni Slodkowski	 TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - A strong performance from major
retailers pushed up Tokyo stocks by nearly 1 percent on Friday
after April options prices were seen settling higher than
expected, offsetting the impact of a major earthquake which
rocked northeast Japan the night before.	 A decisive break above 9,612.51 -- the level where options
settled -- and a 10 percent jump by Tokyo Electric Co ,
after no further damage was reported at its crippled nuclear
plant after last night's aftershock, spurred buying, with
players adjusted their positions ahead of the start of the
earnings season in the U.S. and Japan.	 But low volumes suggested the move was temporary and that
investors still see a lot of downside in the coming months.	 The market was bolstered by Fast Retailing , with
almost a 5 percent weighting in the market, which jumped 6.7
percent to 11,880 yen in heavy trade after the operator of the
Uniqlo casual-clothing chain raised its annual
outlook.[ID:nL3E7F801W]	 ""People are buying shares for now, but it's not going to
last long,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management.	 ""Fundamentals remain unclear and extreme uncertainty
surrounding earnings, with many firms set not to provide annual
forecasts will keep a lid on the market's gains.""	 By the midday break, the benchmark Nikkei index was
0.9 percent higher at 9,678.68, while the broader Topix index 	
 was up 0.7 percent at 846.59	 Volume hovered at 1.3 billion shares on the Tokyo bourse's
main board despite the options settlement which would normally
push it higher, suggesting it would come only slightly above
Thursday's volume which was the lowest since the March 11 quake.	 Tokyo shares have regained more than half of the losses
posted since the disasters, but power shortages, lost production
and lack of progress in bringing the stricken nuclear plant
under full control could send the Nikkei to 9,200-9,300 levels
around mid-May, some analysts said.	 In the long run, Barclays Capital has said it expects
companies listed on the TSE's main board to post on average a
fall of 12 percent in net profit for this financial year
compared with its pre-quake forecast of a rise of 14 percent.	 The closely watched settlement price, known in Japan as the
special quotation or ""SQ"", is calculated from the opening prices
of the 225 shares on the Nikkei average on the second
Friday of the month.       	 ""Once the SQ price was confirmed, we saw the market go back
up to 9,600. What's going to be really interesting is to see if
9,612 will become resistance, or if the market can clear this
level today and then it will become support,"" said Sunil
Sadhwani, CEO of Hamabay Capital LLC.	 Sadhwani added he was looking at the 9,300-9,200 level as an
""absolute bottom"" and said that if the benchmark index was to
fall below that line, another free-fall would be triggered.	  RETAILERS GAIN	 Apart from Fast Retailing, which replaced Tokyo Electric as
the most actively traded share by turnover on the TSE's main
board for the first time since the quake, Japan's biggest
retailer, Seven & I Holdings Co also jumped 2.6
percent.	 It forecast a 1.9 percent gain in operating profit to 248
billion yen ($2.9 billion) for the financial year that began in
March. During the final quarter of its last business year,
operating profit jumped 21 percent to 67.6 billion yen.
[ID:nL3E7F70L1]	 GS Yuasa Corp jumped 5.1 percent to 556 yen after
the Nikkei business daily said it plans to supply lithium ion
batteries for electric vehicles to French automaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen SA. [ID:nL3E7F801W]	 Nippon Steel , the world's No.4 steelmaker, rose 1.2
percent to 256 yen after news that it is in talks with Tatt Giap
 to boost its stake in their Malaysian joint
venture.[ID:nTOE736006]	 The steel company and other resource-related shares also
benefited from higher commodity prices, with oil hitting a 2-1/2
year high and copper reaching its highest in two weeks. The
19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index climbed 0.3
percent, finishing higher for a sixth straight session.	 Underscoring worries related to summer power cuts, the Tokyo
Stock Exchange said it will delay a plan to extend trading hours
so as to reduce power consumption, as Japan seeks to save
electricity in Tokyo and northern prefectures in anticipation of
peak summer demand.

percent * No major impact on French industry from Japan seen so far  
 (Adds more on Renault supply problems) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, April 1 (Reuters) - French new passenger car sales
rose 6.1 percent in March, auto makers' association CCFA said on
Friday, as the market benefitted from an expiring programme
allowing car owners to trade in their old models for new. March was the last month expected to show the incentive
scheme's effects, as cars bought before the programme expired in
December could be registered until the end of March. The scrappage scheme, like similar ones launched in many
other markets, boosted car sales after the industry was hit by a
savage downturn. Blain said he expected the French auto market to perform
better than expected in 2011 after a ""very satisfying"" first
quarter, adding that he saw the market declining 8 percent for
the year compared with a previous forecast for a 10 percent dip. Blain said he saw no major impact on the French car industry
in March or April from the wider supply chain problems that have
roiled the industry after the Japan earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis. A spokeswoman for Renault said its production had not yet
been impacted, apart from at a Renault Samsung facility in South
Korea, but that the company was analysing the situation closely. PSA Peugeot Citroen's March sales rose 13.5 percent while
group sales at Renault, where supply problems have hit some
models since the beginning of the year, fell 12.4 percent. Renault brand sales fell 8 percent in March, while low-cost
Dacia brand sales which have boomed in recent months plunged
26.5 percent. CCFA President Patrick Blain told a news conference supply
problems were to blame for the dip. The Renault spokeswoman said some suppliers who cut capacity
because of the industry crisis had not anticipated such a speedy
recovery in demand and were not able to ramp up production
accordingly. The Twingo, Clio Campus, Modus, Megane and Dacia's Sandero
models were affected, and Renault would be compensating 3,000
customers who had not been eligible for the scrappage scheme
because of the delay, the spokeswoman said. Low stocks of vehicles also contributed to the problems in
delivering vehicles, she said. Car makers moved to slash their
inventories of vehicles when the crisis hit, leaving them
overloaded with cars they could not sell. 257,631 new passenger cars were registered overall in France
last month, the CCFA said in a statement. In the first three months of the year, passenger car sales
rose 8.9 percent. Sales of light commercial vehicles rose 4.7 percent last
month, and 8.6 percent in January to March, the CCFA said.

 (Adds details from statement, background) PARIS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Renault said positive trends
carried over into the third quarter from the second and sales
declined less sharply than earlier in the year. The French carmaker said it would increase production by
more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the
same period last year, when carmakers were forced to drastically
slash production in the face of plunging demand. The group confirmed its full-year target of generating
positive free cash flow.  In February, Renault dropped an ambitious full year
operating margin goal it had in place before the crisis, when --
like other carmakers -- its sales slumped towards the end of
last year. Renault said it was ""well-positioned"" to meet its target of
a reduction in stocks of about 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
for the year as a whole.
 The group's third quarter sales fell 11.3 percent
year-on-year to 8.102 billion euros. Six analysts polled by
Reuters journalists had expected an average of 8.363 billion
euros for the sales. Renault said the sales decline was more moderate than in
previous quarters -- in the first quarter sales had fallen 30.8
percent year, and in the second quarter by 16.9 percent.  Rival French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen last week posted
third quarter sales of 11.782 billion euros, as scrapping
schemes boosted sales in major markets, meaning that the
year-on-year decline of 7.7 percent was less sharp than in
previous quarters.  (Reporting by Helen Massy-Beresford; Additional Reporting by

Wednesday, with oils gaining as crude rose to more than $80 a
barrel, and as U.S. companies continued to beat forecasts for
third-quarter earnings. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.5
percent to close at 1,025.88 points, recouping almost all the
loss from the previous session, and taking it to near its
highest close since Oct. 3, 2008. The index is up nearly 59 percent from its lifetime low on
March 9, as investors have become more confident on the
prospects of economic recovery. ""The general theme continues to be that the significant
improvement we have seen in economic indicators also shows up in
Q3 earnings,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at
UniCredit Group. ""All the fundamental factors in the equity
market are still intact, and the upward strength will continue,
though a breather is overdue."" Crude oil prices rose above $80 a barrel to one-year highs

up by the close. Natixis surged 11.4 percent after Credit Suisse
upped its price target to 5.7 euros, from 4.2, on the

rating. Index heavyweights Banco Santander and HSBC ended the day up
1.8 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. But Deutsche Bank dropped 2.4 percent after Germany's
biggest bank said tax credits had flattered net profit in the
third quarter. Among other individual shares, British supermarket operator
Tesco rose 2.3 percent after Nomura raised its target price to
526 pence, from 405 pence.  Tesco's British margin is likely to step change to 7.2
percent from 6.2 percent, said Nomura, as it pointed to the
potential for the company's banking, telecoms and online
businesses. French peer Carrefour rose 1.6 percent. French carmaker Peugeot fell 4.8 percent after it said

 (Adds share price, analyst comment) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen said third-quarter revenues slowed less sharply than in
previous quarters as it boosted market share in Europe, where
governments launched car buying incentives. Peugeot Citroen shares fell over 7 percent in early trading
as the revenues fell short of analyst expectations buoyed by
forecast-beating earnings from German rival Daimler on Monday. European car makers have cut production and reduced costs
after auto sales dropped by their biggest fall for 15 years in
2008 and government incentive schemes have helped attracting
clients to showrooms again, and order new cars. This has especialy boosted smaller models, such as a large
part of the Peugeot and Citroen line-up, but not the bigger cars
such as the C6 or Peugeot 607. ""What we have today is a revenue disappointment and no
obvious sign of the large production re-ramp that many have
anticipated,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. ""We would expect a dose of profit-taking today.""
Third-quarter revenue at the group fell 7.7 percent,
compared with a 24.9 percent year-on-year fall in the first
quarter and an 18.9 percent drop in the second, Peugeot said in
a statement on Wednesday. The carmaker said it felt the benefit of scrapping schemes,
whereby drivers get a discount on new models when they scrap
their old vehicle. This applied in France, Italy and the UK, but
especially in Germany, Europe's biggest car market. European markets were mixed in the third quarter, however,
with a negative impact from central and eastern European
markets, the company said. The overall European car market decreased just 0.3 percent
in the third quarter, compared with a 14.4 percent decline in
the first six months of the year, Peugeot said. Chief Executive Philippe Varin said last month he expected
the European market to be down around 10 percent this year. Peugeot increased overall market share in Europe to 13.4
percent compared with 12.9 percent a year earlier. The market for light commercial vehicles remained ""very
weak"" in the quarter, Peugeot said, adding that it increased
market share to 22.1 percent from 19.2 percent in this segment. Inventories of unsold vehicles -- a major cash concern for
carmakers when the crisis hit last year -- decreased by 36
percent to 400,000 vehicles compared with 628,000 at the start
of the year, the company said.
 SHARES DROP Shares in Peugeot were 5.65 percent lower at 22.85 euros by
0904 GMT, making them the biggest fallers on a 1.77 percent
weaker DJ Stoxx European autos index. They also led declines on
the French blue-chip CAC 40 index. ""The factors behind our view that 2010 can see positive
surprises remain intact; we see nothing incremental
today to improve the case,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts added. Daimler on Monday posted a fall in third-quarter earnings
before interest and tax to 470 million euros that beat the
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus estimate of 141 million. It
said it expected free cash flow to be positive for the year. On Tuesday, French car parts makers Faurecia, 70 percent
owned by Peugeot, and Valeo made upbeat statements about the
rest of the year. Valeo said it was increasing its second-half production
forecast after a third-quarter profit, and Faurecia raised its
outlook for second-half sales. PSA's domestic rival, Renault, is due to report
third-quarter sales on Oct. 29. Italian auto maker Fiat SpA is
due to post results later on Wednesday.

12-month closing high on Monday on increasing optimism for the
third-quarter corporate earnings season, and with food group
Nestle rising after a broker upgrade. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares rose
1.7 percent to 1,026.46 points, its highest close since Oct. 3,
2008. The index is up 59 percent from its lifetime low hit on
March 9, as investors have become more confident on the
prospects of economic recovery and as companies such as JPMorgan
Chase and Intel beat Wall Street expectations.  Up to and including Oct. 16, 61 companies in the S&P 500
Index have reported Q3 earnings, of which 79 percent topped
analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors were looking ahead to results from Apple, due
after the close of the U.S. market. ""I don't think anybody would dispute that a recovery is
underway,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of
research at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London. ""The only issue is whether it's going to be sustainable or
not. The number of companies beating estimates in their
earnings, and also the number beating top line (revenue)
forecasts suggest it will be."" Nestle, the world's biggest food company, gained 3.5 percent
after UBS upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and
increased its price target to 50 Swiss francs from 43 francs. UBS said Nestle is benefitting from the rising stock of eye
care company Alcon, in which Nestle is selling a stake to Swiss
pharmaceuticals company Novartis.  AUTOS RISE Meanwhile, German carmaker Daimler rose 7 percent after
unexpectedly publishing key quarterly earnings figures, which
showed a strong cash cushion. Other carmakers to rise included BMW, Peugeot, Porsche,
Renault and Volkswagen, up between 2.9 and 4.3 percent.
 But the surge for European stocks was widepsread, with
almost every sector rising. Banks, which are up more than 176
percent from the March lows, added most points to the index. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, HSBC and Societe Generale rose
between 2.1 and 3.4 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 closed between 1.7 and 1.9 percent higher.   Wall Street was higher as European bourses were closing.
The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up between 0.6
and 0.9 percent.  Crude oil rose to just under $79 a barrel, near its highest
in a year, boosting energy shares. Total, BP, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell rose between 1.3
and 2.7 percent. Frankfurt stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse rose 6.3
percent, helped by a report in Crain's Chicago Business that CME
Group, the world's largest derivatives exchange, is in talks to
take over the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In macroeconomic news, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke sounded a note of caution. He warned that Asian
policies promoting exports could lead to a reemergence of
imbalances in trade and capital flows, which some believe helped
fuel the U.S. housing bubble.

655,"Oct 12, 2009 06:48AM ET",Global Market Wrap: European Markets Surge After Philips’ Results,nan,"www.TheLFB-Forex.com The Forex Trader PortalGlobal Market Wrap: European Markets Surge After Philips’ ResultsEquity Futures: Dow +47.00. S&P +5.80. NASDAQ +7.75. Japanese Nikkei +110.00. German Dax +4.00.European Trade: European markets are trading in the green, reaching a new high for the current year of trading in equities. In addition, the S&P futures have followed the positive momentum seen in the cash markets and have broke above the 1070.00 area.The European markets surged after Philips, one of the largest electronics companies in the world, beat analysts estimations on better consumer sales. Philips, which is listed in the Hollands’ AEX index surged 6.6%, being Europe’s best gainer. The market expected Philips to post a 45 million euros loss, but the company printed a 174 million euro profit in the third quarter.  The gains are led in Europe by Hollands’ AEX and by Germany’s DAX, both up 1.30%. It happens very rarely for the German Dax to outperform the other major European indexes, because most member companies are seen as blue chips, which tend to move in a more contained fashion. The Eastern European companies are up approximately 1.50%, the most over the last few cash sessions. S&P Futures: The S&P futures are currently trading just below the 1075.00 area, the same place where the market made a swing point high on September 23 09. A break above this level would send the S&P futures to a new high for the current year. S&P Technical View: TheLFB Member Charts 4 Hour chart trend: Long. Main price points: 1075.25. Looking for: 5) S&P futures did not make a larger corrective retrace in wave B in the past few sessions that had been expected technically. Prices are extremely bullish as the 1075.25 highs from September could be thoroughly tested as resistance. In this case, traders may be looking for a final move up of an expanding diagonal triangle with the first target shown around the 1090 area, followed by a second around the 100% Fibonacci projection zone of the wave A distance.Sector Moves: Even though the rally was triggered by Philips’ results, which is a member of the personal & household goods sector, the best performing sector in Europe is automobiles & parts, which is up 2.2%. Within the sector, the best performing company is France’s Renault, which jumped close to 5% after rumors surfaced about joint projects with Russia’ AvtoVAZ. Renault’s news created a strong positive momentum in the European carmakers, with Peugeot, BMW and Volkswagen gaining more than 2%. As a note, the automobiles & parts sector was Europe’s best gainer over the last week of trading. Other important gains came from the telecommunication and from the technology sectors, while the heavy-weights financial and raw material companies only posted modest gains, of 0.80 and 0.55% respectively. Economic Moves: The report calendar is clear in Monday trade. Crude oil for November delivery was recently trading at $72.60 per barrel, higher by $0.85. Crude oil is trading at the highest level in three weeks, helped by the gains seen in the equity markets and by the declining dollar index. To the upside, the next major resistance area is in the $73.30 area. Crude Oil Technical View: TheLFB Member Charts 4 Hour chart trend: Short possibilities. Main price points: 68.00, and 73.00. Looking for: Wave II) topOil is still trading higher, step-by-step as it approaches the $73 resistance area. Traders may see an important turning point to the down-side at this resistance test, where the black c) may be completed with an ending diagonal in the sub-wave v).  If this is the case, then the whole flat pattern in a red wave II) position will be completed.Traders know that once the correction is done the powerful moves are just around the corner, which in our case should be to the down-side, into the red wave III).The break of $68.00 support will confirm the completed impulse move from the $64.97 low, to current wave c) highs.Gold for November delivery was recently trading up by $4.40 to $1053.00. Gold moved relatively little until now, but it is expected to pick up additional momentum during the late session. Gold’s daily relative strength index is sitting just above the 70% oversold line."

low on Friday, extending the previous day's sharp losses, as
investors were nervy before the U.S. jobs figures after data
this week cast doubt about the strength of the recovery. By 0757 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 percent at
971.93 points, after falling 1.6 percent on Thursday to a
three-week closing low. The index, posting its best quarterly gains in nearly 10
years in the last quarter, was on track for a third day of
losses. ""We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while,""
said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in Frankfrut. ""The third quarter performed pretty strongly. With the
beginning of the fourth quarter, we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest."" Banks, which have rallied 160 percent since March, were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture. KBC, UBS, Barclays, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Deutsche
Bank, Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 1.1 to 6.8 percent. But HSBC put on 0.6 percent, as traders said the bank was
the most defensive in the sector. Heavyweight commodity shares, which have also performed
strongly in the rally, were out of favour. BP, Royal Dutch Shell
, BG Group and Total dropped 0.4 to 1.1 percent. Among miners, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American,
Xstrata, Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0.3 to 2.1
percent. All eyes will be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls data, due at
1230 GMT, for further evidence of the pace of the recovery in
the world's largest economy. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180,000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216,000 jobs in
August, while the unemployment rate is seen at 9.8 percent,
compared a 9.7 percent rate the prior month. The dollar held steady against most major currencies with
investors sitting tight ahead of the jobs data. The pan-European index, which slumped 45 percent last year,
has rallied nearly 51 percent since hitting a floor in early
March, and is up 16.8 percent so far this year.  LOW RISK APPETITE The VDAX-NEW volatility index was up 6 percent after hitting
a four-week closing high on Thursday. The higher the index, the
lower is investors' appetite for risky assets. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX fell 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 1.3
percent. Overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500
 suffered their worst one-day fall in three months, while
Japan's Nikkei average fell 2.5 percent. ""Consumer expectations are now extremely stretched relative
to the dismal reality. This also occurred during the early 1990s
credit crunch,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a
note. ""Back then expectations also ran up far ahead of reality.
Interestingly, after the recession had ended in March 1991,
excessively optimistic expectations slumped three more times
until muddling reality caught up with excessive hope. Markets
still have too much hope."" European automakers were also weak after September U.S. auto
sales tumbled by 23 percent as showrooms emptied after the
government-funded boom from the ""cash for clunkers"" programme. Daimler, Renault, Peugeot, BMA and Volvo were off 0.4 to 2.8
percent, but Volkswagen advanced 0.8 percent. Alcatel-Lucent, ASML Holding, Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2.4 to 5.2 percent, leading the tech
sector lower. Carlsberg eased 4.5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to ""sell"" from ""hold"".

Tuesday as gains in technology stocks were offset by losses in
oil and gas stocks on the day marking the one-year anniversary
of the Lehman Brothers collapse. At 0852 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.02 percent at 991.04 points after briefly
turning negative. The index has gained 19 percent in 2009, soaring 54 percent
since hitting a record-low in March, but is still down about 15
percent from its level in mid-September 2008 before the collapse
of Lehman Brothers, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment
bank. ""Generally, the recovery has been a bit quick and valuations
are no longer attractive but have rather become appropriate,""
Commerzbank's chief strategist, Hans-Juergen Delp, said. Technology stocks added the most points to the pan-European
index, with Alcatel-Lucent, Infineon and Ericsson up 0.8 to 3.1
percent. ""Still, recent remarks have highlighted that the banking
crisis is not over yet,"" Delp said. U.S. President Barack Obama warned financial firms on Monday
to heed the lessons of Lehman Brothers' collapse on Sept. 15,
2008, adding that signs of an economic recovery were not an
excuse to avoid reform. Oil and gas stocks took most points off the index with BP,
Royal Dutch Shell and Tullow Oil down 0.7 to 0.9 percent.  BANKS DOWN, MACRO DATA EYED Banks also fell, with the DJ STOXX European Banks Index down
0.1 percent, while BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and HSBC were down
between 0.2 and 0.4 percent. European car stocks were the second-biggest sectoral
decliners, down 0.5 percent. BMW, Daimler and Peugeot were all
down 0.4 to 1.4 percent amid the Frankfurt Auto Show. Shares in K+S declined 1.2 percent, as traders pointed to
pressure from an interview with CEO Norbert Steiner, saying
shortened work hours for employees are likely to continue for
K+S workers. ""The comments are basically a reiteration but reinforce the
opinion that potash demand will likely stay muted,"" says a
Frankfurt-based trader. Later in the day, investors will focus on macroeconomic data
such as Germany's ZEW economic sentiment due at 0900 GMT and
U.S. retail sales PPI at 1230 GMT. ""If positive, as is expected, the data will underline the
positive market trend,"" Commerzbank's Delp said. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was 0.01 percent lower,
Germany's DAX fell 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.2
percent.

trade on Monday, breaking a six-session winning streak and
pulling back from 11-month highs, with banks and commodity
stocks leading the fallers. By 0751 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.9 percent at 984.58 points, after hitting its
highest closing level in 11 months in the previous session. Oil producers eased as crude fell on a firmer U.S. dollar
and on nagging concerns that prices may have run ahead of market
fundamentals. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, StatoilHydro and BG Group lost
0.5 to 1.7 percent. Metal prices also slipped as the dollar regained some ground
after investors covered short positions, sending mining stocks
lower. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Kazakhmys
, Vedanta Resources and Eurasian Natural Resources were down 1.2
to 3.9 percent. Banks were among the top losers, with KBC, BBVA, BNP Paribas
, Commerzbank, Barclays, Societe Generale and Swedbank down 1.7
to 4.2 percent. However, Stephen Pope, chief global market strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald, said any weakness offered a buying
opportunity and he expected the FTSEurofirst 300 to hit 1,100 by
year end. ""If you turn around and look at the economic numbers coming
through, everything is showing signs of improvement,"" Pope said,
referring to Asian growth and Germany PMI data. ""I know there is an issue about how much longer government
stimulus programmes can continue but believe me these western
governments will do whatever it takes to make sure these

percent. U.S. stocks broke a five-day winning streak on Friday, while
Japan's Nikkei average dropped 2.3 percent on Monday, pushed

rally after Kraft Foods' 10.2 billion pounds ($17 billion)
approached for the UK confectionery group. Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr said it was an ""unappealing
prospect"" being absorbed into Kraft's low growth conglomerate
business model. Among other top gainers in Europe, Finmeccanica put on 1.3
percent after the group said its DRS Technologies was chosen
with another supplier to supply infrared technology. Automakers were weaker, down 0.9 percent, weighed by a
sectoral downgrade to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" from Societe
Generale. Peugeot, which was cut to ""underperform"" from ""outperform""
by Credit Suisse, shed 3.8 percent, while Daimler, Volvo and
Renault lost 1.3 to 3.2 percent. Fiat added 1 percent after Goldman Sachs reinstated its

European markets continue the negative momentum seen earlier in the day, but the vast majority of declines came during the pre-opening hours, while after the opening bell the major European indexes moved flat. Interestingly enough, the emerging blue chip companies underperformed the mature markets, something that happened for the first time in the last few weeks of trading. This may indicate that the market is looking to shed riskier asset, which usually happens when investors are approaching a longer-term risk-aversion phase. However, further confirmation will still be needed before that builds into something sustainable. The trading volume in Europe had been very light. The mining and the commodity sectors were among the worst performers in Europe, just one day after they helped the U.K. FTSE to reach a new high for the current year. The same was the case on the German Dax, where BASF led the declines together with ThyssenKrupp AG, after unconfirmed sources have said that the company may lose as much as 2 billions this year. The positives came from carmakers, who posted very strong gains in Europe, especially in the German Dax and in the French CAC 40, after BMW and MAN were upgraded by analysts.

On top of this, investor’s optimism had been lifted as both Goldman Sachs and UBS increased their year-end forecasts for the European markets. For now, the gains in Europe are evenly spread between the emerging and the mature markets; something that has not been seen lately, with blue chip companies up around 1%.Only a hand full of companies declined in Europe and most of these declines were relatively small, and much less than 1%. The U.K. FTSE advanced on Friday for the first time in three days, with the mining sector leading the pack of gainers, closely followed by the financials.

Tuesday, raising hopes for third quarter economic growth. The Markit/CDAF final manufacturing purchasing managers'
index rose to 50.8 from a final reading of 48.1 in July. It was the first time since May 2008 the index had broken
through 50 -- the level separating growth from contraction. ""The recovery in France's manufacturing sector gained

quarter of the year and economists are looking for signs that it
will do better than forecast in the third quarter. A Reuters poll of economists carried out in July before the
second quarter data was released found they expected growth of
just 0.1 percent between July and September. The Markit survey found new orders had jumped to 53.8 in
August from 51.3 in July, the highest since January 2008. ""Stabilising demand may also start to benefit manufacturers'
pricing power - the latest drop in output prices was the slowest

with many being forced to shut down or halt production until
demand improves, but there have been recent signs that the
outlook has brightened. Car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen said on Wednesday that total
car demand in the second half of the year would fall less than
expected. The car sector has been helped by a government scrapping
scheme to support the industry through the financial crisis. The government has warned that unemployment will continue to
rise despite signs that the worst is over for the economy. French factories shed jobs for the sixteenth consecutive
month in August although the rate of decline eased.

Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive Philippe Varin told reporters on
the fringes of a visit to a technical centre outside Paris. The event was attended by France's industry minister
Christian Estrosi who said he hoped the French government would
decide by the end of October on the future of the car scrapping
scheme, introduced last year. The scheme has proved a genuine boon for carmarkers battling
the most severe drop in demand in recent history. Estrosi also said the government was considering tilting the
scheme in favour of clean vehicles.

choppy trading on Friday, with positive financial and energy
stocks outpacing weaker mining shares, which came under pressure
on concerns about global demand for metals. At 0839 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.2 percent at 946.66 points after hitting an
intraday low of 941.64. The index, which slumped 45 percent in
2008, is still up 13 percent this year and has jumped 46 percent
since a record low in March. Banks were among top gainers, with Standard Chartered, HSBC
, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and BNP Paribas rising 0.3-1.1
percent. ""We have had a rally of around 50 percent, so profit taking
is quite normal. But overall market sentiment is positive and
momentum is good. Just keep an eye on China,"" said Koen De Leus,
economist at KBC Securities. ""The most decisive thing now is the Chinese stock market.
And as long as the Chinese market holds up, the risky assets
will hold as well,"" he added. China has been a big worry for investors, registering large
losses that have seen the Shanghai Composite Index swing wildly
and even drop into bear market territory, 20 percent below its
recent peak. But the index gained 4.5 percent on Thursday for its second
largest gain this year and rose 1.7 percent on Friday. Energy shares were generally higher, with BP, Royal Dutch
Shell, Repsol, Total and StatoilHydro gaining 0.1-0.8 percent. But miners came under pressure after BHP Billiton, the
world's largest miner, said it did not expect to see ""clean
demand"" for the global metals sector until early 2010 as a
global slowdown bites. BHP Billiton fell 0.7 percent, while Antofagasta, Rio Tinto
 and Eurasian Natural Resources fell 0.1-0.5 percent. Automakers were also lower after the U.S. Transportation
Department said on Thursday the popular ""cash-for-clunkers""
programme that gives rebates for new car buyers trading in less
fuel-efficient vehicles will end on Monday. BMW, Peugeot, Renault and Fiat were down 0.1-1.1 percent. Investors ignored losses posted by the world's biggest
container shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk, sending its shares
about 5 percent higher. Maersk made a deeper-than-expected
first-half loss as freight rates, volumes and oil prices fell,
but its CEO did see some improvement in the world economy that
would work its way through to the company's results. Swiss drugs industry supplier Lonza fell 5.3 percent. It bid
$3.55 per share for Canadian rival Patheon, offering a potential
windfall to majority shareholder JLL, which bid just $2.00 per
share for the firm last December. In economic news, French private sector activity expanded
for the first time in 15 months in August, a survey of
purchasing managers showed on Friday, in a hopeful sign for
third-quarter economic growth. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 rose 0.2-0.3 percent.

 By Atul Prakash LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - European equities ended lower on
Wednesday, with banks and autos leading the fall, as investors
scaled back their trading positions after heavy losses in Asia
and on concerns about the pace of the global economic recovery. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.3
percent lower at 931.98 points after trading in a range of
920.28-934.68.But the index is still up 44 percent since a
record low in March and has gained 12 percent this year. ""We are expected to experience a short period of
consolidation after such a significant surge in the market -- an
increase of about 20 percent in equity markets in three to four
weeks,"" said Romain Boscher, head of equity management at
Groupama Asset Management. ""We are convinced that in September, people will reallocate
money in favour of risky assets."" Financial stocks were among top decliners, with Standard
Chartered, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas
and Societe Generale down 0.5 to 2.2 percent. A survey by accountants KPMG found that Britain's banks are
likely to see their battered retail arms slide to a loss in the
second half of 2009, as the cost of bad loans, tough competition
and wholesale funding continues to weigh. UBS fell 1 percent on news the Swiss government will hand
over details of about 4,450 bank accounts to U.S. authorities as
part of a deal struck with Washington over UBS. Automakers were led lower by Volkswagen, which  slipped 14
percent after a German magazine said Qatar paid Porsche hardly
more than half the current market price for shares of Volkswagen
in a multi-billion euro deal announced last week. Both Porsche, which gained 3.7 percent, and VW declined to
comment. Qatar could not immediately be reached for comment. Daimler AG, Peugeot and Renault fell 0.8-2.1 percent.  CHINA FACTOR  The European stock market also came under pressure after the
Shanghai composite index slid 4 percent to a two-month closing
low on disappointment that authorities were not taking steps to
support the market amid heavy losses. It has fallen 20 percent
in two weeks, rattling global markets. ""The markets were looking overbought and in need of a
correction,"" said Mike Lenhoff, a strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""I do not think it is going to go very far. If anything the
supporting news flow is still very positive and interest rates
are going to remain where they are."" However, energy stocks ended in a positive territory,
tracking higher crude prices, which jumped 3.5 percent following
the American Petroleum Institute's report of a surprising draw
in crude oil inventories last week. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol and
StatoilHydro added 0.2-1.3 percent. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation was up 6.2 percent.
It posted a sharp fall in first-half earnings but the drop was
smaller than expected and the miner predicted further recovery
in the second half.    Telekom Austria rose 5 percent after it
kept its outlook for this year's core earnings along with
second-quarter results in-line with analyst forecasts, defying
market expectations of a profit warning. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 percent,
Germany's DAX fell 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 ended flat.

* For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Dominic Lau LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday,
ending four weeks of gains, pressured by weak U.S. consumer
confidence data, which raised questions about the pace of
recovery in the world's largest economy. Financials were among the top losers on the pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 index, which closed 0.8 percent lower at 940.94
points after trading as high as 954.60 earlier in the day. It
lost 1 percent during the week. Among financials, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered,
ING, Credit Agricole and Deutsche Bank lost 0.9-4 percent. ""This is becoming more of the view that this rally is
looking to run out of steam anytime soon and no one wants to be
exposed on the upside,"" said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX
Capital in London. U.S. consumer confidence fell in early August as a growing
number of Americans fretted about their finances even though
they expected the broader economy to improve, the
Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said. Stronger second-quarter corporate earnings, partly aided by
lower market expectations, have helped the FTSEurofirst 300 to
maintain its rally since hitting a lifetime low in March. The
index has gained 46 percent since March, and is up 13 percent
for the year. ""To get further upside, companies need to deliver on the
earnings. They have to start seeing positive earnings growth
coming in, rather than less (earnings) downgrades,"" said Nick
Nelson, UBS's equity strategist. ""You also need to see positive
GDP growth in the third quarter as well."" Auto makers were another heavy loser on the pan-European
index, after Volkswagen plunged 15.6 percent on fears it was
overpaying for a stake in the sports car unit of Porsche, and on
its plan for an issue of preference stock. Porsche shares, however, jumped 8.7 percent. Within the sector, Renault, Peugeot, BMW and Daimler shed
1.2-5.2 percent. Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were about 77 percent of its
90-day daily average volume.
Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were down 0.8-1.7 percent. U.S. stocks were also
down sharply.  LUXURY LINING, HOT PROPERTIES Swatch Group, the world's largest watchmaker, surged nearly
13 percent after saying it expected demand to pick up in the
second half, while reporting first-half net profit that beat
forecasts. The results boosted the luxury goods sector, with Richemont
 and LVMH up 3.3 and 5.5 percent, respectively. Real estate shares were also in demand after a 3.9-percent
gain in British Land on a report that a group of Indian and Gulf
investors is mulling a 10-billion-pound-plus ($16.6 billion)
takeover of the property firm. The news lifted the property sector, with Hammerson, Liberty
International and Land Securities rising 0.7-1.7 percent. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey said equity markets were
likely to fall after their sharp rally so far this year. ""Markets are now a little overbought and will probably have
a pullback,"" said Odey, founding partner at Odey Asset

close in more than nine months on Friday, reversing earlier
losses, after unemployment in the United States rose less than
expected in July.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 1.3
percent to 950.38 points, its highest close since Nov. 5. Over
the week, the index rose 2.3 percent, its fourth week of gains. Telecoms, among the best performers in the morning due to
their defensive qualities, extended their gains by the close.  France Telecom rose 3.6 percent after JP Morgan upped its
rating on the shares to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"". Vodafone, Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom rose between 2.6
and 3.8percent. ""The U.S. jobless numbers were a very pleasant shock and
really turned it (the market) round,"" said David Buik, senior
partner, at BGC Partners in London. ""It's a step in the right
direction."" But Buik added that markets may be in for a correction next
week, if the jobless data boosts the dollar,  hurting oil
prices. U.S. employers cut 247,000 jobs in July, far less than
expected and the least in any month since last August, according
to a government report on Friday that provided the clearest
evidence yet that the economy may be turning around.  With fewer workers being laid off, the unemployment rate
eased to 9.4 percent in July from 9.5 percent in June, the Labor
Department said, the first time the jobless rate had fallen
since April 2008. The government revised job losses for May and June to show
43,000 fewer jobs lost than previously reported. The European benchmark index is up more than 47 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more
confident on the prospects of recovery.  Banks, which weighed heavily on the index in the morning,
closed mostly higher. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Societe Generale and Deutsche
Bank rose between 2.1 and 3.3 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 12.1 percent after reporting a
first-half loss. ""It was a pity about RBS,"" said Buik. ""I don't think there
was anything wrong with the numbers, but expectations were far
too high."" Crude prices were 0.4 percent lower at $71.67 a barrel late
in the afternoon, but most energy companies were higher.
Investors weighed the positive effect of the U.S. jobless data,
in terms of demand implications, against the stronger dollar,
which usually reduces oil prices. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol and StatoilHydro rose between
1.2 and 2.1 percent.
 PUMA FALLS  Puma, the world's third-largest sports goods maker, fell 4.6
percent after posting a smaller-than-expected fall in
second-quarter earnings but adding that it expects a challenging
second half due to the recession. Carmaker Peugeot fell 5.4 percent after S&P cut its debt
rating to junk.   Economic data in Europe, like the United States, was upbeat.
German exports surged at their fastest pace in almost three
years in June, showing the economy's industrial engine room is
emerging from its deepest recession since World War Two. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 closed 0.9 percent higher;
Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were up 1.7 and 1.3 percent
respectively. Wall Street was higher as European bourses were closing. The
Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up between 1.6 and

earnings will disappoint,"" he said. Miners were in the doldrums as copper  slipped 2
percent. Anglo American , Antofagasta , BHP

demand will hurt the French automaker's already weak
profitability. [ID:nN06340471] Shares in Belgium's Umicore  slumped 10.1 percent

 (Updates with CEO comments) PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - French car equipment supplier
Plastic Omnium on Thursday said the financial troubles at
General Motors Corp, Chrysler and Saab Automobile had not
affected its interim earnings. Plastic Omnium, which supplies parts to automobile groups 
including Peugeot and Renault, had consolidated net profit of 8
million euros in the six months to end-June, compared with 2.5
million a year earlier. This was due to cost cuts, lower capital
expenditure and working capital. Shares in Plastic Omnium were up 6.57 percent at 1440 GMT,
against a CAC-40 index up 1.54 percent. Its net debt was 440 million euros by end-June with net
debt-to-equity of 99 percent. This compared with net debt of 560

slowdown in its automobile division expected despite signs of an
upturn in production by car makers. ""We expect the third quarter to be above the first and

quarter,"" said Chief Executive Laurent Burelle.  ""Today we think that we are at a low in terms of volume, and
we think this low will last 18 months, in other words the

customers either delaying or reducing their capital spending and
operating expenses, the firm added. Chrysler entered bankruptcy in April, while General Motors
filed for court protection on June 1. The new GM emerged from

parts maker New Fabris came out of a meeting with officials on
Wednesday saying they may resume a threat to blow up their plant
to back demands for bigger redundancy payouts. Union representatives met Industry Minister Christian
Estrosi after workers agreed on Monday to remove gas canisters
they had placed at the New Fabris plant in Chatellerault in
central France, ready to blow it up. The 366 workers have been demanding a payment of 30,000
euros ($42,580) each from the two main clients of New Fabris,
Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen but are only in line to get
around 11,000 euros from the proceeds of the sale of assets to
the two carmakers. ""We knew very well we wouldn't get everything today,"" Eric
Poisson, a representative of the CFDT union said after the
meeting with Estrosi. ""If there is no progress, the canisters
will return,"" he said. The threat to blow up the plant was one of a spate of
similar protests by French workers following the ""bossnappings""
earlier in the year in which company executives were held
hostage in the workplace. Such spectacular protest actions have become the tactic of
choice for some workers but have been frowned upon by some
unions who regard them as counterproductive. ""These struggles for redundancy payouts...in no way solve
the underlying problems,"" the powerful CGT union said in a
statement. As well as staff at New Fabris, workers at telecoms
equipment maker Nortel and crane manufacturer JLG have made
similar threats. Renault and Peugeot have agreed to buy New Fabris' remaining
assets and stocks, subject to quality guarantees, on condition
that the money goes to the company's former workers. Estrosi also said in a statement that government measures
were in place that would help New Fabris staff find new jobs and
he repeated his condemnation of violent threats.

vehicle sales fell 16.5 percent in the first half, matching the
rate of decline in the overall market, though its business
managed to generate cash. Its sales of passenger car sales fell 13.7 percent, a slower
rate than the global market, it said. ""It's not a surprise, but it's good news,"" said a

second day on Tuesday, with banks boosted by hopes that
better-than-expected results at Goldman Sachs are heralding a
strong reporting season for the sector. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 1.2
percent to 840.15 points, the highest close since July 3, and
following a 2 percent surge in the previous session. Banks added most to the index. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank,
HSBC, Societe Generale, UBS and UniCredit rose between 2.1 and
3.6 percent. ""The economy is getting close to a turning point,"" said
Darren Winder, head of macro and strategy research at Cazenove,
in London. ""Profits are starting to form a bottom, and they
should grow in the second half of the year, and further into
2010."" Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's largest surviving investment
bank, reported a 33 percent rise in quarterly earnings as a
strong gain in trading was offset by a one-time charge to repay
government loans. The European benchmark index is up 30.2 percent from the
lifetime low it hit on March 9, but some analysts say the rally
has gone too far, relative to any real signs of recovery. Economic data from the United States was open to different
interpretations. A jump in auto and gasoline sales boosted U.S. retailers in
June, while a measure of inflation soared by twice as much as
expected, bolstering hopes the economy was finally beginning a
modest recovery.    Commerce Department data showed sales at
U.S. retailers rose 0.6 percent from a month earlier, ahead of
economists' expectations for a 0.4 percent advance. But some analysts said the data was weak, once autos and
gasoline are excluded. A separate report from the Labor Department showed producer
prices jumped 1.8 percent last month, far outstripping forecasts
for a 0.9 percent gain.  MINERS GAIN Miners were bolstered by higher metals prices. Anglo
American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton,  Kazakhmys , Lonmin and
Xstrata rose between 2.9 and 9.3 percent.Rio Tinto rose 5.1 percent, ahead of a statement on output
on Wednesday. Fresnillo, which  reports second-quarter production figures
on Thursday, closed 13.3 percent higher with some investors
believing the silver price is ready to rebound. Autos stocks were also buoyed by the slightly more
optimistic stance investors were taking on the economic outlook.
Renault, Peugeot, and BMW added between 2.7 and 5.3 percent. Shares in Fiat rose 2.8 percent after a double upgrade from
ICAP, raising its recommendation to ""buy"" from ""sell"", ahead of
the company's second-quarter results on July 22. Energy stocks rose, though crude prices struggled to stay
above $60 a barrel.  Total, Royal Dutch Shell and StatoilHydro rose between 0.9
and 2.8 percent. On the downside, Q-Cells, the world's biggest maker of solar
cells, fell 14.4 percent after it withdrew its full-year sales
outlook, expecting a substantial operating loss in the second
quarter as the market environment remained dire.  Mobile phone operator Vodafone fell 1.9 percent after UBS
downgraded it to ""neutral"" from ""buy"". ZEW data showed German analyst and investor sentiment fell
in July for the first time since October 2008, but investors
soon shrugged off the weaker-than-expected data. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 rose between 0.9 and 1.3 percent.  Wall Street was slightly higher as European bourses were
closing. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up
between 0.1 and 0.3 percent.

675,"Jul 14, 2009 06:56AM ET","European stocks bolstered by banks, Goldman eyed",nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index gains 1.1 percent * Banks, commodity, auto shares rise ahead of key results * Q-Cells tumbles on sales outlook By Simon Falush LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Strength in banks powered gains
in European equities which rallied for a second day on Tuesday,
ahead of results from U.S. bellwethers Goldman Sachs and Intel.
 By 1023 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares were up 1.1 percent at 839.02 points after surging 2
percent in the previous session. The index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008, is up about 30
percent since falling to a lifetime low in early March. Financial shares were the biggest drivers of growth, with
Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Ireland and BNP Paribas rising between 1.9 and
7.9 percent. Analysts said banks were being boosted on anticipation that
Goldman Sachs's second-quarter results would shine. ""All eyes are in bank results across the pond, and there are
rumours that Goldman will report strong profits, which is
leading to a lot of bidding activity for banks,"" said Robert
Quinn, European strategist at Standard & Poor's equity research. As well as Goldman Sachs, Intel and Johnson & Johnson will
report later in the session, while other companies announcing
results this week include Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan,
Citigroup and General Electric. Low trading volumes and uncertainty on the corporate and
economic outlook mean that these results are likely to drive
relatively sharp equity movements, analysts said. ""We could have continuing volatility. It is the lowest
period of activity in the year apart from the Christmas period,
so volumes should be low. You might see some sharp moves,"" said
Jonathan Lawlor, head of European research at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Autos stocks were also buoyed by the slightly more
optimistic stance investors were taking on the economic outlook.
Renault, Peugeot, and BMW added between 3.2 and 4.8 percent. European equities briefly pared gains after ZEW data showed
German analyst and investor sentiment fell in July for the first
time since October 2008, but investors soon shrugged off the
weaker-than-expected data. In the United Kingdom, the macroeconomic data was more
positive. Surveys showed British retail sales rose in June and
house prices fell at their slowest rate in two years, in further
signs the economy may be bottoming out after the worst downturn
in decades.  MINERS, ENERGY GAIN Miners were bolstered by higher metals prices. BHP Billiton,
 Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Eurasian
Natural Resources rose between 2.6 and 4.7 percent. Energy stocks tracked crude prices, which reversed the
previous session's losses and rose above $60 a barrel on
improved sentiment. BP, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol and StatoilHydro added
between 0.6 and 3.2 percent. While the tone of the market was broadly positive, there
were some significant losers. Q-Cells, the world's biggest maker of solar cells, slipped
13.2 percent after it withdrew its full-year sales outlook,
expecting a substantial operating loss in the second quarter as
market environment remained dire. Germany's Software AG fell 3.9 percent after it said it
would buy IT consultancy group IDS Scheer for almost 500 million
euros ($696 million) in what would be the first major corporate
takeover in Germany this year.
 IDS shares surged 38 percent. Mobile phone operator Vodafone was the UK's largest
blue-chip faller, down 2.2 percent after a UBS note which
downgraded it to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were up 0.5 and 0.8 percent.

676,"Jul 13, 2009 10:08AM ET",UPDATE 1-EU plans to sign $100 bln S.Korea trade pact in '09,nan," * Swedish EU presidency plans to conclude S. Korea pact * Free-trade agreement estimated to be worth $100 bln * Diplomats see initialling of deal in September * EU carmakers remain opposed, BusinessEurope in favour 
 (Adds details, background) By Veronica Ek and Darren Ennis STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - The European Union
plans to finalise a $100 billion trade pact with South Korea by
the end of the year, the prime minister of EU president Sweden
said on Monday. ""The finalisation of the agreement will follow during the
Swedish presidency,"" Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt told a
news conference in Stockholm following talks with South Korean
President Lee Myung-bak. The agreement with Seoul to lower barriers to trade and
investment would be the EU's first such pact in Asia. The EU is
South Korea's second largest export market after China, and
South Korea is the EU's fourth largest non-European trade
partner with bilateral trade reaching $98.4 billion in 2008. Trade officials from the 27-nation bloc gave their tentative
assent for the European Commission -- which oversees EU trade
policy -- to complete negotiations with a view to initialling
the deal in September. The pact is estimated to be worth an additional $100 billion
to the two economies. ""We had a breakthrough in the negotiations last week. That's
why I signalled I have good hope to finalise this during the
presidency,"" Reinfeldt, whose country assumed the six-month
rotating stewardship of the EU this month, said. Brussels and Seoul began negotiations in 2007 to scrap
import duties and other barriers in industries including
pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics and cars.  But efforts to clinch the so-called free-trade agreement
(FTA) were stymied by some countries concerned that the deal to
open EU markets to South Korean producers would severely damage
Europe's ailing car industry.  AUTO CONCERNS The EU's auto sector -- employing 2.3 million people
directly and a further 10 million in related sectors -- is
unhappy that South Korean manufacturers would be allowed to
avail of so-called ""duty drawback"". Under the politically sensitive duty drawback scheme, South
Korean carmakers would be able to import cheap components and
have all import duties paid on those parts reimbursed if they
are in cars destined for the EU market. Europe's carmakers, suffering from the worst financial
crisis since World War Two, also wanted to limit the amount of
foreign components -- mostly from China -- used by South Korean
producers.  European automobile association ACEA said last week that the
FTA would create a ""severe competitive disadvantage"" for
European industries and ""effectively open the door for cheap
imports from China and other Asian countries"".  But Lutz Guellner, spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner
Catherine Ashton, said the deal will give ""a much-needed boost
to dwindling global trade and sends a positive signal ahead of
negotiations to complete the Doha round of World Trade talks"". ""We have addressed, as best we can, the concerns of the auto
industry and the overall benefits for the European economy are
critical at this time,"" Guellner said. Europe's top business lobby, BusinessEurope, also backs the
deal currently tabled by the Commission.  LATEST PLAN The latest agreement drafted by the Commission and South
Korea would make 97 percent of trade between the two governments
duty-free within five years, phase out the bloc's 10 percent
tariff on Korean cars in three to five years and scrap South
Korea's 8 percent duty on European autos over the same period.
 Brussels says the trade pact would eliminate duties worth
1.6 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for European exporters and
around 1.2 billion euros in levies on industrial goods.  The Commission estimates the accord would save European
carmakers such as Volkswagen and PSA Peugeot Citroen around
2,000 euros on every car worth 25,000 euros. Once initialled, the agreement must be translated into each
of the EU's 23 official languages before requiring the final
green light from EU governments, which normally would take at
least six months after initialling.  The South Korean parliament must also approve the deal,
which could take up to another seven years to be fully
implemented.

seven-week closing low on Thursday, weighed down by exporters
such as Canon as the yen stays near five-month highs against the
dollar amid growing doubts about a speedy recovery in the global
economy. Energy-linked shares fell after oil prices dropped more than
4 percent on Wednesday on bearish oil data that underlined
continued weak demand amid concerns about the economic recovery. In a seven-day losing streak through Thursday, the Nikkei has
lost 6.7 percent, though it remains more than 30 percent above
its lows hit in March. Market players said the 200-day moving average of around
8,800 appears to be forming a support level for the benchmark for
now, compared with the Nikkei's current level around 9,300. ""Over-optimism about an economic recovery is being modified
to neutral. The market has started examining the situation more
calmly, though it hasn't turned pessimistic yet,"" said Mitsushige
Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. ""Considering the rally in global stock markets since March,
what we are seeing is still within a correction as there are no
further reasons to keep buying now."" Akino said risk-money that recently buoyed oil and other

mull their next move. At one point on Thursday, the benchmark 10-year Japanese
government bond yield fell as low as 1.270 percent, its lowest
since March 25. Yields move inversely to prices. In moderate trade, the Nikkei fell 1.4 percent or 129.69
points to 9,291.06, its lowest finish since May 22. It ended at the day's low, though investors earlier took some
comfort in the dollar's rebound above 93 yen on Thursday after it
slid to a five-month low around 91.8 yen the previous day. The broader Topix declined 1.7 percent to 873.91. After U.S. aluminium giant Alcoa Inc reported a
smaller-than-expected loss after the market close on Wednesday,
corporate earnings season will become a major focus for the
market, analysts said. ""Both the U.S. and Japanese markets are in a correction phase
right now, and for further gains, investors need to see corporate
earnings have been steadily improving,"" said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an
equity strategist at Mizuho Securities. YEN, DOUBTS ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY WEIGH Exporters fell as investors fret over a stronger yen, which
eats into their profits' when they are repatriated. Camera and office equipment maker Canon shed 1.5 percent to
2,940 yen and Toyota Motor Corp slipped 2 percent to 3,400 yen.
Honda Motor Co dropped 2.7 percent to 2,325 yen. But Mitsubishi Motors Corp inched up 0.6 percent to 162 yen
after a newspaper said it and French carmaker Peugeot Citroen
would work together to develop and produce parts for plug-in
hybrid vehicles. Oil refiner and distributor Cosmo Oil Corp declined 1.8
percent to 281 yen and Nippon Oil Corp, Japan's largest oil
distributor, fell 1.6 percent to 485 yen. Oil and gas field
developer Japan Petroleum Exploration lost 3.6 percent to 4,520
yen. Shares of Clarion Co, a maker of car audio equipment, sank
7.9 percent to 82 yen after the Nikkei business daily said the
company is expected to post an operating loss of about 2 billion
yen for the April-June quarter due to sluggish domestic sales of
automotive electronics. Shippers rose on a brokerage upgrade, though they lost steam
in afternoon trade. Nikko Citigroup lifted its rating on Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines to ""1M"" from ""2M"", saying the stock looks
undervalued, and upgraded Nippon Yusen KK to ""2M"" from ""3M"",
saying it now looks appropriately valued. Mitsui O.S.K. rose 0.5 percent to 558 yen, while Nippon Yusen
dipped 0.3 percent to 393 yen, after rising as high as 406 yen at
one stage. Among stocks that benefited from the yen's rise, travel
agencies such as H.I.S. Co Ltd and Kinki Nippon Tourist Co
advanced as the stronger yen is expected to boost demand for
travel abroad, market participants said. H.I.S., a discount airline ticket vendor, surged 5.5 percent
to 2,115 yen and Kinki Nippon Tourist, Japan's second-largest
travel agency, rose 2 percent to 103 yen. Some 2.1 billion shares changed hands on the Tokyo exchange's

fifth straight session on Wednesday to their lowest closing
level in 10 weeks, as investors faced further signs that the
pace of economic recovery will not be quick. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 1.1 percent lower at 817.12 points. The fifth consecutive
drop also marked the index's longest losing streak since
mid-January. Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were about 80 percent of its
90-day average daily volume. Financials were among the standout losers, with HSBC
, Banco Santander , UBS , BNP Paribas
, Aviva , KBC Groep , Legal & General

""significant risks"" and may need further help, according to

683,"Jul 07, 2009 06:56AM ET",UPDATE 2-PSA Peugeot Citroen's H1 unit sales fall 14 pct,nan," * H1 sales fall to 1.587 million vehicles * H1 sales of assembled vehicles down 17.5 percent at 1.386
million * Gives no outlook, says H1 to be shaped by new car models * Citroen head calls for scrapping schemes to be extended 
 (Adds comments from Citroen head) PARIS, July 7 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen said sales of vehicles and knocked-down kits fell 14
percent in the first six months of the year. Leaving aside sales of completely knocked-down (CKD) kits --
shipped for assembly in other markets such as Iran -- sales were
down 17.5 percent at 1.386 million vehicles, PSA said in a
statement on Tuesday. The company gave no forecast, saying only that the second
half of the year would be shaped by the arrival of new car
models including the revamped Citroen C3 and Peugeot's 5008. The car industry has been hit by an unprecedented crisis,
with carmakers slashing production and cutting jobs late last
year in reaction to a slump in sales.  European car sales fell for the 13th straight month in May,
down 4.9 percent to 1.27 million vehicles. Governments have stepped in to help, providing loans and
introducing incentive schemes to help carmakers survive the
downturn, leading to some signs of improvement in recent months. The head of Citroen told Reuters he hoped car scrapping
bonus schemes put in place in several European countries to
encourage owners to replace older vehicles with newer models
would be extended.
""We are campaigning for the measures to be continued,""
Frederic Banzet said in an interview on Tuesday. ""In any case, we are campaigning for them not to be ended
suddenly; nothing would be worse as the automobile industry
cannot cope with major movements,"" he said. Germany's BMW, the world's biggest premium carmaker, said on
Tuesday that its group vehicles sales fell 12.7 percent in June
but added it was seeing ""the first signs of a slight recovery on
automobile markets.""  In France, car sales rose 7.1 percent in June, while in
Germany sales were up 40 percent in the month. But industry
watchers are concerned about how carmakers will cope with the
transition when the schemes end. Rival Renault is due to report its commercial results
together with its financial results at the end of July. Banzet added that the level of stocks at Citroen, the second
brand of car group PSA Peugeot Citroen, was ""satisfactory"".

684,"Jul 06, 2009 07:24AM ET",European shares hit 7-week low on economic outlook,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index falls 1.9 percent * Energy, mining shares follow weaker crude, metals prices * Financials, autos slip; but drugmakers advance * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on By Atul Prakash LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - European shares hit a seven-week
low on Monday, mainly dragged down by banks, oils and miners,
with investors trading cautiously on concerns about the pace of
economic recovery and ahead of second-quarter results. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
1.9 percent at 826.81 points by 1100 GMT after touching 825.95
points -- the lowest level since May 14. But the benchmark index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008,
is still up 28 percent from its lifetime low in early March. Energy stocks were among top losers on the index, tracking a
4.5 percent decline in crude oil on doubts about the prospects
of an early economic recovery and a firm dollar. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total
and StatoilHydro shed 2.4-3.4 percent. ""The road to recovery is still going to be incredibly bumpy
and there are still some major hurdles to overcome before the
markets could get tremendously excited about adding to the
rally,"" said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. ""We need to see some confirmation that the economic recovery
is on track and corporate profitability is going to return. And
until we get that, we suspect that the market will be in a
nervous mood,"" he said. Financials also fell. Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays,
Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Commerzbank
and KBC Groep fell 1.4-9.5 percent. Miners lost ground as copper prices fell more than 2
percent, nickel was down 3 percent and zinc slipped 2.3 percent. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Xstrata, Lonmin
and Eurasian Natural Resources were down 3.4-9.2 percent. Rio Tinto fell 4.5 percent in line with the broader market.
The miner agreed to sell its Americas food packaging business
for $1.2 billion after last week raising $15.2 billion in one of
the world's largest-ever rights issues.  POOR ECONOMIC DATA  Recent macro-economic data also failed to cheer investors
and analysts said the market was cautious ahead of quarterly
results. ""There's a feeling corporate results are still going to be
poor,"" said Justin Urquhart-Stewart, investment director at
Seven Investment Management, in London. ""People are asking where the growth is going to come from.
They're looking at data and noticing it's still getting worse,""
though not at the same rate as before, he said. Data from the Sentix research group showed investor and
analyst sentiment in the euro zone worsened unexpectedly after
three months of improvement. Automakers also skidded on concerns about vehicle demand.
BMW, Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG, Peugeot, Renault, Fiat were down
2-3.9 percent. Porsche was down 3.2 percent. The automaker denied a
newspaper report which said five more potential bidders have
emerged for a Porsche-owned derivatives package which controls
around 20 percent of Volkswagen voting shares. But pharmaceuticals, generally seen as defensive, gained
ground. AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline
rose 0.6-1.2 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down 1.5-1.9 percent.

685,"Jul 03, 2009 07:08AM ET",UPDATE 2-China moves on Opel with BAIC bid,nan," * BAIC submits indicative bid - sources * Binding bid seen by mid-July * Winner faces tough EU cartel probe - German dep minister  * Opel task force head has doubts about Magna's concept  * UK govt. says may help fund any deal 
 (Adds BAIC bid report, detail on Vauxhall, background) By Angelika Gruber and Christiaan Hetzner FRANKFURT/MUNICH, July 3 (Reuters) - A Chinese automaker has
offered to buy a stake in General Motors unit Opel, challenging
a deal from Canadian auto parts supplier Magna, sources said on
Friday.  State-owned Beijing Automotive (BAIC) has submitted an
indicative, non-binding offer for Germany's Opel, sources
familiar with the situation told Reuters, and would make a
binding offer by mid-July. The news comes ahead of a Friday deadline for GM lawyers to
submit papers to U.S. federal bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber who
will rule by July 10 on a plan to create a ""new GM"" with brands
Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and truck unit GMC. Magna, backed by Russian partners, is the frontrunner to buy
Opel. Sources told Reuters on Thursday that Magna's board of
directors wants to approve a business plan for Opel on July 7. Belgian holding company RHJ International is the third
bidder, although it posted a sharply wider full-year loss on
Wednesday and analysts are doubtful it has the cash to compete
with its rival suitors. Whoever wins the race for Opel faces a tough antitrust
probe, a German government minister said on Friday. When asked whether he counted on Brussels examining any deal
for Opel under a lengthier, so-called 'phase II' investigation,
German Deputy Economics Minister Jochen Homann told reporters:
""Yes, clearly."" He declined to specify what issues might concern EU
competition authorities since the German government is still
awaiting a business plan for the takeover, which he hoped to get
by the end of July.Any business plans submitted will be evaluated by
PriceWaterhouse Coopers on behalf of Berlin, since the
government will have to offer more state aid after already
extending Opel a six-month 1.5 billion euro ($2.1 billion)
bridge loan that matures on Nov. 30. ""Every day that there is no restructuring costs money, every
month that goes by is a lost month,"" said Homann, the head of
the government's Opel task force. Some support may come from Britain, where GM produces and
markets Opel cars under the Vauxhall brand. The British government said on Friday it was prepared to
support any deal, possibly in the form of loans, if the terms
were right. ""I'm not going to discuss the detail of any financial
underwriting, but it may involve loans or loan guarantees,""
Business Secretary Peter Mandelson said. ""We would obviously
have to have interest paid and some security (for the loans).""  MAGNA DOUBTS Speaking at a Handelsblatt auto industry conference, Homann
expressed scepticism over Magna's concept for Opel and said that
vested interests praising the auto parts supplier's offer as the
best left the German government open to ""extortion"". ""We will see whether Magna's concept is successful. It is
based on theories over which one can heartily discuss...There
are justifiable question marks,"" he explained. He expressed doubts as to the wisdom of basing a business
plan on the boom-and-bust Russian car market and questioned
whether Magna could lure other carmakers to utilise Opel's
unused production capacity. Homann, who reports to Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg,
stated no preference for any of the three current bidders. Homann warned that whoever wants to acquire Opel would have
to prepare for a tough EU cartel probe.  ""The negotiating parties would be well advised to develop a
concept that is economically sustainable, fulfils our laws
governing loan guarantees and is compliant with EU subsidy
rules,"" he told the conference. Homann pointed to the chronic structural overcapacities that
the EU is concerned about and cautioned that the European
Commission has stated a bailout could not distort competition. Sources familiar with the Opel negotiations have voiced
anxiety that Paris might try to install French Economy Minister
Christine Lagarde as the next EU Competition Commissioner under
a likely second term for President Jose Manuel Barroso. They fear she might be more critical in part since Opel does
not have any major manufacturing operations in France, home to
key competitors PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, which counts
the French state as a large shareholder.

morning trade on Friday after slipping in the previous session,
with a rise in crude and metals prices boosting commodity
stocks, while financial stocks recovered after recent losses. At 0840 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.6 percent at 855.65 points after falling 0.9
percent on Thursday. The index, which slumped 45 percent in
2008, has jumped 32 percent since hitting a lifetime low in
early March. Energy stocks tracked crude oil prices, which rose more than
1 percent to trade above $71 a barrel. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG
Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total and StatoilHydro added 0.5-3.3
percent. ""Most people will agree now that we won't revisit the low
point, that we have seen this year, again any time soon,"" said
Luc Van Hecka, chief economist at KBC Securities. ""But there are still some problems to be resolved in the
financial sector and as long as that is not out of the way in a
convincing manner, we could still have intermediate
corrections,"" he said. UBS AG fell 1 percent after the Swiss lender said it planned
to raise about 3.8 billion Swiss francs by selling stock and
expected to post a second-quarter net loss. But the banking sector was in a positive territory after
falling in 7 out of 11 previous sessions. HSBC, Royal Bank of
Scotland, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse and
Deutsche Bank gained 1.3-3.8 percent. The Bank of England said British banks looked in better
shape than six months ago but were still vulnerable to economic
shocks. Miners got strength from higher metals prices. BHP Billiton
, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Eurasian
Natural Resources rose 0.4-2.9 percent. Sanofi-Aventis shares tumbled 9 percent, extending the
previous day's sharp losses, while Novo Nordisk lost 2.5
percent, on continuing concerns about the safety of Sanofi's
diabetes drug Lantus and modern insulins in general. Morgan Stanley downgraded Sanofi to ""equal-weight"" from
""overweight"" in the light of a debate among diabetologists over
the potential cancer risk of insulin analogues like Lantus,
while JPMorgan cut its rating on Sanofi to ""neutral"" from
""overweight"". Roche gained 0.5 percent as it filed its MabThera cancer
drug for approval in Europe as a first line biologic treatment
for rheumatoid arthritis. Peugeot fell 2.8 percent after Standard & Poor's said it may
cut its ratings on the carmaker into junk territory, saying weak
demand is likely to worsen the French company's financial
profile. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were up 0.4-0.8 percent.

by midday on Tuesday after falling sharply in the previous
session, with weaker banks and insurers outpacing positive
pharmaceutical and automobile stocks. Investors traded cautiously on worries that a recovery in
the global economy could take longer than expected. Analysts
said that the market has paused for a breather following an
impressive rally after hitting a record low in early March. At 1118 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 0.1 percent at 836.61 points after briefly
falling below the 2008 close of 831.97 points. But it is still
up about 30 percent since hitting a lifetime low in March. Financial shares were among top decliners on the index, with
Standard Chartered, Barclays, Lloyds, Societe Generale and
Credit Agricole down 1.1-3.9 percent. However, UBS jumped 3.5 percent after the New York Times
reported the U.S. Justice Department may drop a case aimed at
forcing the Swiss bank to reveal the names of 52,000 wealthy
American clients suspected of tax evasion. ""There is nervousness around the market and these sorts of
pullbacks and volatility are likely to continue,"" said Henk
Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers in London. ""The market needs tangible proof that the economic data is
truly getting better,"" he added. The market continued to get mixed economic indicators. Key
surveys showed that a recovery from a severe recession in the
euro zone's services sector stalled in June as consumers
remained nervous, but factories fared better. A Chinese central bank official said that the country's
economy was headed in the right direction, but the foundations
of the recovery were not yet solid, adding to a chorus of voices
cautioning against expectations of a rapid rebound from the
global crisis. The U.S. unemployment rate -- at 9.4 percent, already its
highest in about 25 years -- is likely to hit 10 percent in the
next couple of months, a White House spokesman said on Monday. ""After the massive three-month rally that sent all major
indexes significantly higher, we are now in the middle of the
long-awaited pullback,"" Close Brothers Seydler said in a note. ""Market participants start to realise that the recovery in
the economy and earnings is unlikely to be as strong as the rise
in stock prices since early March.""  INSURERS DOWN, PHARMA UP  Insurers also lost ground, with Swiss Life, Legal and
General, Aegon and Prudential down 1.9-5.8 percent. Drugmakers advanced, however, with AstraZeneca, Merck,
Novartis and Shire all up 1-2.5 percent. GlaxoSmithKline rose 1.8 percent. The company has signed a
deal with Chroma Therapeutics, giving it access to the unlisted
British biotech company's experimental compounds for
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Automakers were also higher. BMW, Daimler AG, Porsche,
Volkswagen AG and Peugeot were up 0.4-3.1 percent. Shares in Anglo American fell 1.3 percent after the mining
group rejected a merger proposal from rival Xstrata. Xstrata
shares fell 1.3 percent. Anglo American trimmed some early losses after dealers cited
market talk of bid interest from China's state-owned Chinalco. A
Chinalco spokesman in Shanghai said the company was unaware of
the bid talk, while Anglo American declined to comment. Later in the day, investors will focus on U.S. housing data
at 1400 GMT. Eyes will also be on the U.S. Federal Reserve central bank,
whose Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day
meeting on interest rate policy.

689,"May 08, 2009 05:48AM ET","ANALYSIS-Spur from car,phone stockpile clearance seen muted",nan," * Global inventory index up after hits record low * Cars, phones, beauty product stockpiles shrinking * Firms say destocking mostly over * But little restocking seen as firms hold low inventories  By Eric Onstad and Helen Massy-Beresford LONDON/PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - Stockpiles of cars, mobile
phones and beauty products that piled up during the global
downturn are being whittled away but restocking will do little
to boost growth as cautious firms adjust to lower inventories. Global inventory data this week and recent comments by
company officials show that a trend by firms to use up stocks
instead of churning out new orders is coming to an end.
 Low inventories could spark some growth as companies
cautiously begin to replenish stocks, but this will be muted
while sustained healthy demand is probably distant. ""It's too early to be talking about broad-based production
volume uplift because of restocking,"" said David Arnold, analyst
at Credit Suisse, referring to the hard-hit auto sector. In cosmetics, the pace of destocking was slowing in North
America and Europe, but this did not mean that sales were
expected to rebound, Chief Executive William Lauder of Estee
Lauder told a results briefing on Monday. ""We've probably we've got another 12 months to go,"" Lauder
said. ""Certainly right now I think what you're seeing is both the
consumer as well as retailer with whom we trade are adjusting to
a level."" Recent data has indicated that the worst of slashing
inventories to cope with weak growth is probably over. A world index complied by Markit Economics showed raw
material inventories at manufacturers ticked higher in April
after touching a record low the previous month. A ratio -- used as a leading indicator -- of stocks levels
to new orders is pointing to more rises in manufacturing output
after the output figure for April reached a seven-month high.  ""What we've been seeing recently at the global level and for
most of our national surveys is that this inventory ratio has
been improving,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit,
adding that the global ratio reached a 17-month high in April. ""We're still talking rates of contraction which have been
almost unprecedented, so we're still at a low point, but we
might be past the worst.""  DESTOCKING Heavyweights ranging from mobile phone giant Nokia to
confectionery group Cadbury have said recently that destocking
is over or will soon come to an end. ""We saw a lot of destocking happening in Q1... I think the
destocking impact has, in most markets, now reached the bottom,""
Nokia Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said. Cadbury reported last week underlying sales growth of 2
percent for its first-quarter, but this would have been 4
percent but for the effect of destocking. This occurred mainly in the United States and Canada and
three-quarters of the effect there was due to one distributor
cutting its stock levels to 17 days from 30 days to reduce its
working capital ahead of its own year-end on January 31. U.S. household product group Procter & Gamble Co said last
week that destocking was expected to continue in the second
quarter. ""It's the distributors that are under real cash and bank
line pressure... the easiest way for them to improve in the
short term is to pull down their inventories,"" Chief Executive
A.G. Lafley said.  LOWER AUTO INVENTORIES In the auto sector, firms made drastic production cuts late
last year to battle a costly build-up of stocks of vehicles. Daimler said on Thursday its inventory of unsold
Mercedes-Benz cars dropped to the lowest level for the month of
April in seven years. France's Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen both achieved their
year-end targets of cutting stocks of unsold vehicles to the
same levels they held at the end of 2007 and since then, they
have both gone further. Other sectors are also likely to adjust to lower inventory
levels so restocking effects are likely to be modest for now. ""The natural level of inventory holdings will more than
likely be reassessed and be lower than it was before,"" said
Dobson. ""We may not see a full inventory building process going
on until we actually start seeing output and new orders show
proper recovery or gains."" German firms still see their inventories as too high, so a
boost was not expected from stock building, an economist at a
think tank said on Wednesday.  Many firms are wary after they were forced to take huge
writedowns last year as the value of inventories fell. A report by Moody's Investors Service estimated that 20
companies with the largest inventories were forced to write down
10.6 billion euros ($14.21 billion) last year when the value of
those stocks slid. While more such writedowns could be seen this year, oil and
chemical firms might post inventory gains rather than losses as
prices recover, it added.

690,"May 04, 2009 06:00AM ET",WRAPUP 1-E.Europe manufacturing drop slows except in Poland,nan," * Polish PMI falls to 42.1 in April * Czech PMI rises to 38.6 from 34.0 in March. * Hungarian PMI, different methodology, edges higher  By Michael Winfrey PRAGUE, May 4 (Reuters) - Manufacturing's decline slowed in
the Czech Republic and Hungary in April in a sign that recession
may be approaching a bottom but activity in Poland, the region's
biggest economy, dipped faster than a month ago. The economic crisis, particularly a fall in demand for goods
produced in the European Union's low-cost east, has saddled the
region with double-digit falls in industrial activity and caused
economists to cut growth outlooks since last year. Poland's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to
42.1 in April from a five-month high of 42.2 in March, Markit
Economics and ABN Amro said.  The Czech index rose to 38.6 in April from 34.0 the previous
month while Hungarian figures, using different methodology from
the Markit data, edged up to 40.4 from 39.5. The data came alongside euro zone PMI data showing the
slowest decline in six months. A score above 50 indicates
manufacturing is expanding, while a score below this means it is
contracting. The Polish contraction was the 12th month in a row. It was
still better than the average posted in the first three months
of the year, but Markit said conditions remained tough overall,
with sharp falls in output, new orders and jobs. ""This is a surprisingly low result compared to our prognosis
... Apparently companies are aware we are still far from the end
of the slowdown,"" said Piotr Bielski, senior economist at Bank
Zachodni WBK. ""I am afraid the slowdown both in Poland and
Europe will last until the end of the year at least."" Poland is one of the least exposed countries in the region
to euro zone demand, with only around 40 percent of its economy
based on exports. It is also the only one that economists say
may escape recession this year. But analysts say what started as an industry-led contraction
may be filtering into the rest of the economy, particularly the
large internal market of 38 million Poles. Evidence includes a
0.8 percent decline in retail sales and a jump in unemployment,
which now stands at 11.2 percent.  CZECH, HUNGARIAN SLOWDOWN EASES The small, open economies of the Czech Republic and Hungary
are the opposite case. There, factories owned by foreign
companies including Volkswagen, Audi, PSA Peugeot, Toyota and
Siemens pump out cars and electronics for sale in Germany.  Exports equal about two thirds of gross domestic product in
both Hungary and the Czech Republic. Both countries have seen companies cut production and shed
workers due to falls in orders, cutting exports by almost a
third over last year's levels.  The biggest Czech firm, Volkswagen-owned carmaker Skoda,
said sales -- 90 percent of which go abroad -- dropped 39
percent in euro terms in the first quarter, while physical
production had fallen 45 percent. Central European governments have also slashed growth
forecasts, with the Czechs expecting a 2009 contraction of more
than 2 percent and Hungary a fall in GDP of up to 6 percent. Analysts said the Czech PMI data -- the 10th decline in a
row -- showed the economic downturn there may be approaching a
bottom, although they were also careful to note the contraction
was not yet over. ""It is a confirmation that the most dramatic decline is
behind us, and that it was in the first quarter,"" said Pavel
Sobisek, chief economist at Unicredit in Prague. ""We can expect
a further moderation in the decline, although the PMI level is
still far from (showing) the drop has stopped."" Markit said Czech manufacturers continued to make
substantial cuts to workforces in April. The employment index
rose from March's record low, but still indicated a rapid rate
of decline.

"
691,"Apr 29, 2009 11:56AM ET",FACTBOX-Fiscal stimulus in G20 countries,nan," April 29 (Reuters) - Governments worldwide are rolling out
fiscal stimulus packages in the hope the public funds will boost
demand, limit job losses and prevent a deeper downturn. International Monetary Fund officials say that discretionary
fiscal stimulus so far amounts to around 2.0 percent of GDP for
2009 and 1.5 percent in 2010 at G20 level. The IMF published
updated estimates on April 26. http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/2009/042609.htm Russia tops the 2009 table with discretionary stimulus worth
4.1 percent of GDP, then comes China at 3.1 percent, South Korea
at 3.9 percent, Saudi Arabia at 3.3, China at 3.1, Japan at 2.4
Australia at 2.1 and the United States at 2.0 percent. The aggregate G20 stimulus figures are 0.2 percentage points
higher than estimates the IMF released in March, mainly because
of extra packages announced in Japan, South Korea and Russia. The IMF did not give revised impacts of the GDP impact in
its April 26 release but those of mid-March were as follows: -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from discretionary stimulus of
anywhere between 0.4 and 1.3 percentage points in 2009 and
0.1-0.2 percent in 2010 -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from total fiscal expansion (which
adds so-called automatic stabilisers to discretionary spending)
of 0.8-3.2 percentage points in 2010 and 0.1-0.9 in 2010. Below is a updated guide to fiscal stimulus programmes from
Reuters correspondents across the G20. Descriptions focus on

692,"Mar 31, 2009 01:08AM ET",TOPWRAP 1-Japan PM to detail new spending amid bleak jobs data,nan," * Japan unemployment at 3-yr high, new jobs fall * Japanese household spending slides * PM set to announce new stimulus package
 (For more on the global financial crisis, click) By Yuzo Saeki TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro
Aso was expected to outline a new stimulus plan for the world's
second-largest economy later on Tuesday, two days before
leaders from the Group of 20 rich and big developing countries
gather in London to discuss ways out of the global crisis. Rising unemployment and falling spending showed Japan was
still stuck in its worst recession in 60 years and underlined
the parlous health of the global financial system already
buffeted this week by the possible bankruptcy of U.S.
automakers. Tuesday's data showed a worrying trend for an export-driven
economy mired in its worst recession since World War Two and
for Aso's unpopular government: the slump in external demand is
feeding into the domestic economy. Japanese unemployment hit a three-year high of 4.4 percent,
and may be headed above 6 percent, some analysts say, while the
number of new jobs sank to a six-year low. At the same time
household spending slid 3.5 percent from a year earlier.. The Japanese economy may have hit bottom in the first
quarter this year but there may be more bad news to come,
analysts said. ""In usual times, it would then start to pick up, but now we
can't expect that to happen. That means companies won't be able
to raise cash flow and therefore will continue to cut jobs,""
said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at Royal Bank of
Scotland. The yen slipped to 98.22 per dollar following the
unemployment and spending data. Stocks rose nearly 1 percent on
hopes the government will buy shares in a bid to restore
consumer confidence. DEMAND AND JOBS Aso was expected to map out his government's third stimulus
package, which Japanese media said would run for three years
and aim to create 60 trillion yen ($612 billion) worth of
demand and 2 million jobs. Some lawmakers have called for up to 20 trillion yen of new
spending, reports say, to go with the 12 trillion of
pump-priming already announced. The latest indications of how badly Japan's economy is
suffering and Aso's response are likely to weigh heavily at the
G20 meeting, where leaders will address a crisis that has
felled major banks and cost millions of jobs as the world faces
its biggest recession since the 1930s. Officials have already acknowledged the G20 summit would
fall short of an overhaul of the world economy. U.S. and
European leaders have also differed over whether more spending
or more regulatory reform are the better response to the
crisis. ""There are tremendous downside risks to this global
outlook,"" Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said
while releasing the bank's annual outlook in Manila on Tuesday. ""The effectiveness of the global responses to the crisis
remains uncertain. Loud calls for protectionist policies are
becoming worrisome. As job losses in the major industrialised
countries continue, the protectionist voices may only get
louder."" Leaders from the United States, Europe and Asia will have
plenty of sobering news to consider this week in London. EUROPEAN TROUBLES, ASIAN SLOWDOWN On Monday, Ireland had its prized Standard & Poor's AAA
credit rating cut to AA-plus and was warned it could drop
more.. The Bank of England also moved to prop up another
lender, Scottish building society Dunfermline. And Spain, among Western Europe's hardest-hit economies,
also rescued its first bank since the crisis began, Caja
Castilla la Mancha. The latest Japanese data came after markets tumbled
following U.S. President Barack Obama rejected restructuring
plans for General Motors and Chrysler. But the fall proved short-lived, with Asian stocks edging
back up as some investors bet the most painful stretch of
corporate earnings damage may be over as the first quarter and
Japan's financial year drew to a close. Asian stocks outside Japan were set to finish the quarter
with a dip of 0.7 percent but were up 15 percent in March in
what would be the largest rise since 1999. A White House task force on Monday rejected restructuring
plans and pleas for billions in funding from GM and Chrysler.
GM will get funds to stay in business for 60 days but new loans
of up to $30 billion it wants are on hold until it reworks its
restructuring plan. Chrysler, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, was
given 30 days to finish a planned alliance with Italy's Fiat or
risk liquidation. The board of French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen sacked CEO
Christian Streiff, citing the need for change to tackle an
unprecedented slowdown for the industry Developing economies have not been spared, with the ADB
forecasting growth slowing this year to the lowest rate since
the 1997/98 financial crisis and any rebound next year
contingent on a recovery in the global economy. The ADB said Asia's developing economies, which include
China, India, the economies of Southeast Asia, South Korea and
Central Asia, should register average GDP growth of 3.4 percent
this year, down from 6.3 percent in 2008. As late as December it had forecast average growth of 5.8
percent. It said China, the world's fastest growing economy,
will grow of 7 percent this year, down from 9 percent in 2008.

rejected rescues for General Motors and Chrysler, rekindling
concern the automakers could go bankrupt, while three European
governments aided struggling lenders. A White House task force rejected restructuring plans and
pleas for billions in funding from the two automakers on
Monday, forcing GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner to step down. U.S. President Barack Obama, who was to make an
announcement at 1500 GMT (11 a.m. ET) on the auto industry,
said on Sunday the two companies had not done enough to save
themselves since receiving a $17.4 billion bailout in
December. GM will get funds to keep operating for 60 days, but up to
$30 billion in new loans it is seeking will be on hold until it
reworks its restructuring plan. Chrysler, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, was
told to complete a planned alliance with Italy's Fiat within 30
days or risk liquidation. The White House's emphatic rejection of the automakers'
plans and further trouble for banks in Europe sent world stocks
tumbling and lifted government bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 3 percent at the
open following stock market falls in Europe and Tokyo that sent
world indexes to a one-week low. GM shares dropped 25 percent. ""The fact that there's still a chance of GM going bankrupt
is shocking,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of investment strategy
at Marusan Securities in Japan. The stock falls come as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown
prepared to host a summit of G20 leaders beginning on April 2
in London. Leaders of the biggest economies will commit to pursuing
responsible economic policies that do not hurt each other's
prospects with protectionism or currency devaluations,
according to a draft communique obtained by Reuters. Wagoner's departure from GM marked only the second time
since the financial crisis began last year that the U.S.
government has forced a CEO from his job. American
International Group (AIG) boss Robert Willumstad was ousted
last September. The government's role in removing Wagoner raised questions,
particularly for U.S. banks that have received large bailouts. ""The worst part about this is anyone else who may need
government assistance or help realizes that they are in for it,
the government will put a heavy hand and tell you what to do,""
said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in
Chatham, New Jersey. ""And when government gets involved, most of the time, it's
inefficient,"" he said. French autos group PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO Christian
Streiff also lost his job when his board sacked him on Sunday,
citing a need for change to tackle an unprecedented slowdown
for the industry. RESCUES SPREAD Governments have focused most of their energy on fixing the
financial sector, at the heart of the crisis. Spain, among Western Europe's hardest hit economies, on
Sunday was forced to rescue its first bank since the crisis
began. The Bank of Spain unveiled a plan including 9 billion euros
($11.9 billion) in guarantees to bail out regional savings bank
Caja Castilla la Mancha, which like much of the Spanish economy
is reeling from a slump in its once-booming property market. Germany also took action, agreeing to buy an 8.7 percent
stake in stricken Hypo Real Estate as a prelude to acquiring
full control under a plan announced on Saturday. Hypo shares were up 34 percent to 1.54 euros in Monday
afternoon trading. The Bank of England was forced into action again at the
weekend as it organized a takeover of Scottish building society
Dunfermline. Its core operations will be taken over by the UK's largest
building society, Nationwide, which has now gathered in three
smaller rivals, while the Bank of England set up a bridge bank
to safeguard the lender's social housing business.

695,"Mar 27, 2009 02:32PM ET",FACTBOX-Global crisis brings threat of protectionism,nan," March 27 (Reuters) - G20 leaders pledged at their November
summit to fight protectionism, yet 18 of their economies are
named in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) report on measures
taken in recent months that could be seen as restricting trade. The report, published on March 26, includes bailouts and
stimulus packages to support industries such as carmaking. The
only G20 countries not listed are Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Here are some recent measures that have raised complaints of
protectionism:  * ARGENTINA - Imposed non-automatic licensing requirements
on products such as auto parts, textiles, TVs, toys, shoes, and
leather goods. * AUSTRALIA - Last December Australia marshalled local banks
to provide funding worth about A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) to
enable car dealers to find long-term finance after a decision by
car-loan providers GMAC and General Electric Co to exit the local
market. * BRAZIL - Said in November it had instructed state-run
Banco do Brasil to make available a total of 4 billion reals
($1.72 billion) so that automakers' financing units could
increase lending and spur sales.
* BRITAIN - Britain announced in January it would guarantee
up to 2.3 billion pounds ($3.29 billion) of loans to the car
industry  - The EU's internal markets commissioner has said some
European countries were ""very upset"" about sterling's recent
losses, which makes British exports more competitive on price.  * CANADA - Unveiled an aid package on Dec. 20 that provided
C$4 billion ($3.28 billion) in emergency loans to the Canadian
arms of General Motors  and Chrysler to keep them
operating. * CHINA - Frequent target of complaints that it blocks

including by keeping its yuan currency weak. A meeting of G7
finance ministers in Rome praised Beijing for allowing some
appreciation of the yuan but maintained calls for the process to
continue. - China has put in place an import ban on Irish pork, as
well as some Belgian chocolate, Italian brandy, British sauce,
Dutch eggs and Spanish dairy products. - On Mar. 19 China rejected a $2.4 billion bid by Coca-Cola
 for China's top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice <1886.HK>,
blocking what would have been the largest-ever takeover of a
Chinese company by a foreign rival. The Ministry of Commerce
made the ruling on grounds that the merger would have been bad
for competition. - Increased rebates under the duty drawback system for
exporters. * EUROPEAN UNION - Imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese
screws, fasteners, candles and steel wire products. - Reinstated export subsidies on dairy produce. - Imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on

to struggling car makers PSA Peugeot Citroen  and
Renault  (3 billion euros each) in return for what has
been characterised as an unwritten pledge not to close
facilities in France. The European Commission has said it is
satisfied the guarantees do not amount to protectionism.  * GERMANY - Unveiled a 1.5 billion euro aid package for its
carmakers on Jan. 13. The package forms part of a 50 billion
euro stimulus package of investments, tax relief and support for
companies. Measures include incentives worth 2,500 euros for new
car purchases. * INDIA - Initiated anti-dumping investigations on some
imported steel products affecting 19 countries. It also banned
imports of Chinese toys for six months, saying it was in the
interest of public safety.  - Increased rebates under the duty drawback system for
exporters. * INDONESIA - Limited the number of ports and airports
serving as entry points for certain imports, such as
electronics, garments, toys, footwear, and food and beverages. * ITALY - Unveiled a $1.7 billion package for its car
industry. Carmakers in turn have been told to maintain their
plants in Italy and pay auto parts suppliers. * JAPAN - Introduced special safeguard measures on imports
of certain foods prepared with flour or starch and konnyaku
tubers. * MEXICO - Angered by Washington's move to block Mexican
trucks from using U.S. highways, Mexico said this week it would

696,"Mar 25, 2009 09:00AM ET",Czech carmaker TPCA delays expansion plan,nan," * TPCA delays plan to boost capacity to 340,000 cars * Expects output to grow by 1.8 percent to 330,000 this year * Sees no European market rebound this year * Plans no extraordinary shutdowns in coming months  By Martin Dokoupil PRAGUE, March 25 (Reuters) - Czech carmaker TPCA has
postponed a plan to boost production capacity to 340,000 cars
this year, due to the global downturn, but its output should
still grow slightly on higher demand for smaller cars, its head
said on Wednesday. TPCA, a 50-50 joint venture between Japan's Toyota Motor
 and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen, has weathered the impacts of
the economic crisis better than other European producers as
people shifted to less expensive models. But its president, Yasuhiro Takahashi, said the carmaker
wanted to stay cautious as it was not clear how long an
incentive scheme to replace older cars in Germany keeps boosting
demand for small cars. ""The main reason (to delay the expansion) was that sales
fell a bit in the autumn,"" Takahashi told Reuters after
presenting last year's results. ""Now we are analysing what to do ... Small cars are selling
well in Germany but this could end very soon as the scrappage
amount is limited. We are ready to go forward when conditions
are right,"" he said. The third biggest Czech exporter, which revealed its
expansion plan in October, increased production of its budget
Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroen C1 models by 5 percent to 324,289
last year. TPCA, which started production in 2005, plans to assemble
330,000 cars this year, reaching its maximum capacity, Takahashi
said. The carmaker plans no extraordinary shutdowns of assembly
lines at its Kolin plant, 67 km (42 miles) east of Prague, in
the coming months.
  TPCA's outlook contrasts with that of Volkswagen's Skoda
Auto, the top Czech firm by turnover, which expects unit sales
to show a single-digit drop this year due to the deepening
recession in western Europe. The Czech economy is highly dependent on the car industry,
which accounts for 21 percent of overall exports and is expected
to axe 13,500 jobs to some 124,648 by June. The country's exports plunged by 24 percent in January,
their fastest annual pace on record, and companies slashed jobs,
pushing unemployment to a two-year high of 7.4 percent in the
same month. ""We can very realistically expect that the (car) market (in
Europe) will not rebound this year and the very difficult period
will continue,"" Takahashi said. The rapid deterioration in the country's export performance
led the government to expect the economy to shrink by up to 2
percent this year in a first contraction since 1998. TPCA said it scrapped the plan to hire additional workers at
the turn of the year due to the market weakness and plans to
keep employment at around the current 3,582 this year. The carmaker's revenue fell by 4 percent to 49 billion
crowns ($2.42 billion) last year, mainly dented by a strong
crown.

698,"Mar 09, 2009 06:48AM ET","Slovak industry output at 10-yr low, carmakers hit",nan," BRATISLAVA, March 9 (Reuters) - Slovakia's depressed car
sector dragged industrial output to the worst result in a decade
in January, data showed on Monday, and analysts said the euro
zone newcomer could see its economy shrink in the first quarter. Slovakia's industrial output fell by 27 percent year-on-year
in January, the worst reading since the current data series
began in 1999, compared with an 18 percent decline in December
and worse than a market prediction of a 24.4 percent fall. ""The global crisis is the key factor, and also the gas
crisis played a role in January,"" said Tatra Banka analyst Juraj
Valachy. A two-week halt in Russian gas supplies forced some
1,000 companies to cut or stop production in January. ""The car sector decline was the key contributor, but this is
not just about car makers -- the crisis is spreading across all
sectors,"" Valachy said. Slovakia's automotive sector, centered around assembly
plants of Volkswagen, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Kia Motors Corp,
showed an annual production fall of 47.7 percent in January,
compared with a 44.6 percent decline in December. The three car makers have a combined output capacity of
around 900,000 units a year.  They assembled 587,400 cars last year, but the car makers
told the government last month their output could fall by as
much as 25 percent in 2009 as consumers curtail spending because
of the financial crisis. Slovakia's small and open economy has avoided a direct
impact on its banks from the financial turmoil, but it is now
feeling the effect of the crisis as demand for its goods, mainly
cars and television sets, weakens in key export markets. Slovak gross domestic product growth slowed to 6.4 percent
in 2008, from a record high 10.4 percent a year earlier, and the
government expects a further slowdown to 2.4 percent in 2009. But analysts said economic data suggested the government's
forecast might be too optimistic. ""We will see bad results in the coming months as well, there
is no reason for optimism. We now expect that the first quarter
annual GDP data will be in negative territory,"" said CSOB Bank
analyst Silvia Cechovicova.

U.S. aid to the car sector to be checked to see if it fits World
Trade Organisation rules, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on
Thursday, escalating tensions over rival industrial policies. Sarkozy, who has announced aid for French automakers that 
critics have called protectionist, also said he would ask for a
coordinated European plan to help the car industry. U.S. officials are this week meeting car company executives
to discuss the industry's requests for billions of dollars in
extra aid to help it through the financial crisis. ""We need to see if the U.S. aid is compatible with the WTO,""
Sarkozy said at a roundtable discussion in eastern France on the
car industry, a sector which accounts for one in 10 French jobs. He said Europe must show itself to be ""less naive"" and added
that within Europe, officials should pay less attention to
checking whether car plans meet EU rules. Leaders of the European Union will meet in Brussels on
Sunday to discuss coordinating responses to the financial crisis
and Sarkozy said he would ask for an EU-wide car plan. ""I hope the Commission will react and understand that there
are other things to do than working out whether state aid fits
competition rules,"" he said. Earlier this month Sarkozy faced criticism from his EU
allies for a 6 billion euro ($7.64 billion) state loan offered
to Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen in return for an unwritten
pledge not to close production sites in France. In the United States, the head of Chrysler LLC, which is
seeking up to $5 billion in new aid on top of $4 billion of
loans in December, met officials on Wednesday.  Ford executives met officials earlier this week and General
Motors Corp bosses will meet them on Thursday.   DOUBLE STANDARDS The EU's transport chief said on Thursday it would consider
appealing to the WTO if U.S. aid made conditions unfair for
European manufacturers, but he warned against double standards
inside and outside the bloc. ""Europe is evaluating -- if that help should impinge on the
competitiveness of our producers -- appealing to the WTO,""
European Transport Commissioner Antonio Tajani said in an
interview with Italian paper La Stampa. The EU car industry, which employs 2.3 million people
directly and 10 million in related industries, has warned that
output could fall by at least 15 percent this year and producers
might need up to 15 billion euros in financial help. EU competition authorities are scrutinising car industry
support in France, Spain, Britain, Italy, Germany and Sweden. ""If we defend ourselves from this outside the EU, we can't
permit it internally,"" said Tajani. Leaders of the G20 developed and emerging countries agreed
last year to fight protectionist tendencies which have arisen as
countries try to defend their national interests during the
financial crisis. WTO chief Pascal Lamy on Wednesday urged G20 leaders not to
backtrack on their commitment.

700,"Feb 24, 2009 10:16AM ET",UPDATE 1-Sarkozy: Europe must protect industry as U.S. does,nan,"(adds quotes, background) By Silvia Aloisi  ROME, Feb 24 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
said on Tuesday the European Union should protect its industries
in the same way the United States does and urged his partners to
take ""strong decisions"" in defence of European interests. ""From next Sunday, Italy and France will talk with tough
language and ask Europe (at a European Union crisis summit) to
take strong decisions,"" Sarkozy told a news conference in Rome
alongside Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. ""If the United States defends its farmers as it does, we can
do the same in Europe; if the United States defends its
industry, as it does, they are right, maybe in Europe we can do
the same,"" said Sarkozy. Sarkozy's words will concern economists who fear
protectionist measures risk lengthening the global recession.
His rhetoric also clashes with a string of verbal commitments
from policymakers that they will avoid resorting to
protectionism. A ""Buy America"" clause in the U.S.' $787 billion rescue plan
approved by Congress this month raised the hackles of many
governments by insisting firms use U.S. steel and other U.S.
goods in public works projects. Within Europe, France has already been accused of
protectionism by some of its partners over its aid package for
the car sector which offered a 6 billion euro state loan to
Renault  and  PSA Peugeot-Citroen  in return
for an unwritten pledge not to close sites in France. But Sarkozy said France had been forced to act on its own
because the EU was not intervening. ""I would have much preferred a common European policy to
support the car industry,"" he said, adding that Germany and
Sweden were now taking similar measures to those adopted by
Paris and Rome to help car makers. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven rich nations who met
in Rome this month stressed the importance of free trade and
their final joint statement said they were ""committed to
avoiding protectionist measures, which would only exacerbate the
downturn."" European Central Bank Executive Board Member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi summed up the concerns of many when he said during the
G7: ""Governments meet and write statements against protectionism
and then they go home and adopt protectionist measures."" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique
Strauss Kahn on Saturday drew a distinction between old-style
""voluntary"" protectionism and more subtle ""involuntary
protectionism"" which is now emerging to face the crisis. ""We are not facing a risk of the old-style protectionism of
raising tariffs,"" he told reporters. ""The problem is that
everyone has to deal with their own taxpayers and the risk is
that (the measures adopted) will hurt their neighbours."" Sarkozy on Tuesday warned the economic crisis could get
worse before it gets better and gave a lukewarm reception to
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's attempts to fix the
financial crisis in the United States. ""Geithner's proposal hasn't reassured markets,"" he said,
adding that a U.S' plan to buy so-called bad assets from banks
""could create problems for competition."" (additional reporting by Gavin Jones and Phil Stewart)

701,"Feb 13, 2009 10:40AM ET",UPDATE 2-Spain approves 4 bln euro car industry aid,nan," (Adds government comment, context) MADRID, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Spain's government on Friday
approved a 4 billion euro ($5.17 billion) package to support its
ailing car industry and protect jobs after a string of layoffs
and stoppages at vehicle plants. Spain said the support package was the second largest in
Europe, in terms of total funding, ahead of a 2 billion euro
programme in Germany and 3 billion euros in investment by the
British government. Most of the measures approved on Friday had been previously
announced as part of Spain's 70 billion euro economic stimulus
plan. France this week offered a 6 billion euro state loan for
Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen and ran into criticism from EU
allies who said the move amounted to protectionism. Spanish Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian said Spain had to
protect its car sector, which is almost entirely foreign owned. He said the government support would depend upon carmakers'
ability to guarantee jobs within the industry and would not
grant aid to any company that has laid off workers permanently
without first reaching agreements with unions. Many job losses within the industry in Spain have been after
agreements between union representatives and company heads under
the condition workers are re-employed within an agreed time
frame. Renault has announced temporary lay-offs for about 10,000
workers at its four factories in Spain and cut 400 temporary
workers at its factory in Palencia, while newspaper La
Vanguardia said Seat would suspend 5,300 workers' contracts. ""The auto sector employs 300,000 people, it drives 6 percent
of GDP, and we are talking about a sector that provides around
20 percent of exports,"" Sebastian said at a news conference
following the government's weekly cabinet meeting. Under the Spanish plan, the government will channel 1.2
billion euros in state credit to boost car purchases during 2009
and 2010. Spain will also earmark 800 million euros to help car and
vehicle part makers upgrade plants and boost value-added
production. A further 950 million euros will go towards improving rail,
road and sea distribution systems and 320 million euros towards
research projects, over 2 years. The government will give 100
million in tax breaks on research spending by firms. The remainder of the 4 billion euro package is made up of
state credit lines to small and medium sized firms in the
vehicle sector. Spain has been hit harder than neighbours by the global
economic crisis as the collapse of its decade-long house
building boom coincided with the credit crunch. Spanish car sales fell 28 percent to 1.16 million in 2008,
the largest-ever yearly decline, and could fall to 900,000 in
2009, according to industry group ANFAC. Sales have fallen amid credit restrictions and a rise in
unemployment to the highest level in the European Union at 14.4
percent in December. (Reporting by Andrew Hay; editing by Ben Harding)

702,"Feb 13, 2009 08:08AM ET",ANALYSIS-Protectionist Sarkozy becomes EU villain,nan," By Crispian Balmer PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
has gone from hero to villain in the European Union within just
six weeks, the plaudits for his deft leadership of the 27-nation
bloc giving way to vilification over his protectionist urges. The row over French efforts to ringfence its car industry at
the expense of its eastern allies has eroded Sarkozy's
international standing and revived accusations that Paris is
wedded to state interventionism. ""Sarkozy had emerged as the pre-eminent European leader,
head and shoulders above other contenders, but now I think he
has largely blown it,"" said Charles Grant, director for the
Centre for European Reform in London. France appeared to be the most dynamic force in Europe at
the end of last year, following its successful handling of the
EU presidency, during which time Sarkozy led from the front to
secure a united response to the financial crisis. But any idea of unity was thrown out the window last week
when he said it was unjustified for French car firms to set up
plants in places like the Czech Republic. Putting actions to words, Sarkozy later handed local car
producers PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault cheap loans in return
for promising not to close their French factories. ""As someone who has followed the European Union for 20
years, I cannot think of any single more damaging comment than
what Sarkozy said in that television interview,"" said Grant. However, to anyone who has followed Sarkozy's political
career, such opinions would not have come as a surprise,
especially in the current context of economic downturn,
gathering social unrest and plunging opinion polls.  COLBERT REVISITED Since the start of the economic crisis, Sarkozy has
denounced the ""dictatorship of the market"", vowed to end
""laissez-faire capitalism"" and created a fund to protect French
business from falling into the hands of foreign predators. Going further back in time, when he was finance minister in
2004, Sarkozy prevented local engineering group Alstom from
going bankrupt by pumping in state cash, defying the perceived
wisdom that the market should have decided its fate. To go from believing in an activist state to promoting
protectionist policies is a short step in the country which gave
the world Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister
who pioneered state control of the economy. But when it comes to defending car factories, Sarkozy is
being driven more by pragmatism than ideology. Up to 2.5 million people took to the streets of France last
month to protest against Sarkozy's economic policies and unions
have called a new day of action for March unless he bows to
their demands for concerted action to help consumer spending. Such protest movements have a habit of spiralling out of
control here, and when Sarkozy went on television last week he
was speaking exclusively to a domestic audience trying to
convince them he could stem the recent flood of job losses. His message did not get through and his popularity rating
subsequently plunged, hitting a record low of 36 points in one
IPSOS poll, down nine points on the month. Analysts said that if anything, Sarkozy did not strike
enough of a populist tone to calm his anxious audience. ""The French almost wanted to hear a more demagogic
president,"" said Jean-Francois Doridot, head of IPSOS. ""He cannot stay motionless. He has to be seen to act. If
people think he is not doing anything, he won't stand a chance.""  EVERYONE AT IT The French centre-right government strongly denies that it
is pursuing a protectionist agenda and says that in any case,
other countries are reacting in exactly the same way as the bloc
tumbles into recession. Before France moved to help its auto sector, Italy had
offered support to its own carmakers in return for guarantees
that they keep their Italian plants running. Numerous western governments have also told their ailing
banks that they expect them to support businesses back home in
return for bailout packages. Such policies suggest that the most severe economic crisis
in the history of the European Union is not just battering its
open market ethos in France, but across the alliance. ""What Sarkozy said wasn't wise, but in the wider context
everyone is engaged in a dismantling the European Union,"" said
Ulrike Guerot, head of the Berlin office of the European Council
on Foreign Relations. ""But if you have a frontrunner like France which is now
dysfunctional, you will find many countries will hide behind it
and do likewise,"" she added.

703,"Feb 12, 2009 03:32PM ET","UPDATE 2-French growth tumbles in Q4, govt sees 2009 in red",nan," (Recasts throughout, adding detail, background, comment) By Francois Murphy PARIS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - France's economy shrank at the
fastest pace in 34 years in the fourth quarter of 2008 as
business investment and exports collapsed, prompting the
government to say it expected negative growth this year. National statistics office INSEE said on Thursday gross
domestic product fell 1.2 percent in the last three months of
last year compared with the previous quarter, more than
expected, bringing economic growth for 2008 to 0.7 percent. Economists had predicted a quarterly fall of 1.1 percent
after growth of 0.1 percent in the third quarter. ""This bad figure reflects in large part a very significant
destocking by companies, which indicates a wait-and-see attitude
in the face of uncertain growth and the crisis in the automobile
sector,"" Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said in a statement. The figures were published a day early after a group of
statisticians leaked them in protest at the government's early
announcement of some statistics. The announcement by the euro zone's second biggest economy
came a day before fellow heavyweights Germany and Italy were
expected to announce their own steep GDP falls, and it followed
a similarly grim statement by Spain. Spain's economy shrank 1 percent in the fourth quarter, its
biggest quarterly fall in 15 years, pushing it into recession
for the first time since 1993. Lagarde said she expected GDP to fall by at least 1 percent
in 2009 but took heart from the fact that household consumption,
a key driver of French growth, had held up in the last quarter
of 2008, rising 0.5 percent. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has struggled to convince a
sceptical public that he has chosen the right strategy to fight
the economic downturn sparked by the global financial crisis. More than 1 million people took to the streets this month to
protest at his economic policies, which favour public investment
in projects such as building roads and modernising train lines
rather than giving more help directly to consumers. Sarkozy made a live television appearance last week to try
to win support for measures including his 26 billion euro
($33.16 billion) stimulus plan but polls have shown his approval
rating has fallen since then.  BRIGHT SPOTS Much of the GDP data published on Thursday will heighten
fears about the state of the economy. ""The fourth-quarter contraction is the worst since the
fourth quarter of 1974, after the first oil shock,"" BNP Paribas
analyst Dominique Barbet said. Business investment fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter
while public investment dropped 1.6 percent. Exports tumbled 3.7
percent and imports slid 2.2 percent, while stocks declined by
0.9 percent, data showed, confirming grim news from companies. France has announced it will provide 6 billion euros in
loans to its carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, which
have been hit hard by the slowdown and complained of draconian
credit conditions. Peugeot said on Wednesday it expected to remain in the red
until 2010 after spending nearly 1 billion euros to slash stocks
of unsold cars last year and on Thursday Renault scrapped its
2009 profit targets, dropped its divided and slashed output. There were, however, some bright spots in the French data. ""The breakdown comes as a real surprise,"" Barbet said,
citing the robust household consumption figure. ""Other components of domestic demand also slightly exceeded
expectations, housing down only 0.3 percent quarter on quarter
and business investment down 1.5 percent,"" he said. Lagarde said France, like its neighbours, had suffered in
the downturn at the end of last year, and highlighted the fact
that French economy grew in the third quarter, a better
performance than many western European countries.

 (Adds French minister saying no protectionism) By Jan Strupczewski and Jan Lopatka BRUSSELS/PRAGUE, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The Czech presidency of
the European Union, livid with French ""protectionist"" comments,
said on Monday it was calling an emergency EU summit to discuss
government responses to the economic crisis. France, where President Nicolas Sarkozy last week suggested
French carmakers move plants back home from the Czech Republic,
meanwhile unveiled plans to help its ailing auto manufacturers
with 6 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in government loans. With recession biting, governments in Europe and well beyond
have pledged to keep international trade channels open to avoid
the protectionist mistakes of the Great Depression years, though
fears that such pledges will not be respected are mounting. Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said protectionist
comments by Sarkozy drove him to call the summit, for which no
date has been set but may take place this month. However, it seems France also wants a meeting. In a letter to Topolanek, dated Feb. 9 and seen by Reuters,
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sarkozy said such a special
meeting was needed. ""The restoration of the supply of credit must be our top
priority,"" Merkel and Sarkozy wrote in the letter to the Czech
EU presidency, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. On Monday, Sarkozy announced the signature of deal on car
aid with the chiefs of PSA Peugeot-Citroen and Renault involving
pledges to each of a 3-billion-euro 5-year loan at 6 percent
interest.  PSA and Renault said their firms would not launch job cuts
in France this year, while a European Commission spokesman said
the EU's executive body would study the fine print of the rescue
for compliance with EU rules. Topalanek said Sarkozy's attitude risked casting the
27-nation EU into a vicious circle of ""beggar-thy-neighbour""
actions to protect national economies.
""The last impulse was the really selective and protectionist
steps and statements of, among others, President Sarkozy, that
led me to the intention to call this extraordinary council (EU
summit),"" Topolanek told a news conference in Prague. ""It is these kinds of statements, made by some European
statesmen, that will lead to a higher level of protectionism
among individual states,"" he warned. The European Commission said such a meeting could take place
in late February.
 TOXIC ASSETS Governments have committed hundreds of billions of dollars
worldwide to keeping the banking industry afloat after a boom
that turned to bust when the U.S. housing boom did likewise --
turning trillions of mortage debt derivatives into toxic assets
that are now weighing on the balance sheets of banks across the
industrialised world and shrinking lending. The International Monetary Fund says the economic downturn
that has come hand-in-hand with the financial crisis is likely
to be the worst since World War Two. The tension shown by Prague overshadowed Monday's meeting of
euro zone finance ministers. EU finance ministers meet on
Tuesday. Ministers were discussing budget policy and their message to
forthcoming meetings of the G7 and G20 clubs of, respectively,
rich and rich and developing economic powers. Some of those present said they were conscious of the need
to resist protectionism and ensure Europe responded in synch. ""I am a little bit concerned that day after day member state
after member state are announcing not only their own ideas but
their own plans and programmes,"" said Luxembourg's Jean-Claude
Juncker, head of the 16-nation Eurogroup of euro currency users. ""All this has to be better coordinated,"" he told reporters. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde defended Paris in
Brussels saying she would tell her colleagues ""there is not a
whiff of protectionism, that it's really the aim to focus on
research and development"". Earlier, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticised
Sarkozy's remarks about a possible return of French car
factories home and said his country, which hosts a plant owned
by PSA Peugeot Citroen, warned of possible retaliatory measures. ""Calls for such brutal protectionism are not helping
anyone,"" he told reporters in Bratislava. ""If one country starts behaving like this, for example
France, then we will send Gaz de France home. We can use the
money Gaz de France is getting as a shareholder in (Slovak gas
company) SPP,"" he added.

706,"Feb 09, 2009 09:56AM ET",FACTBOX-Aid packages for automobile industry,nan," Feb 9 (Reuters) - France is set to unveil details of a plan
to support its ailing car industry later on Monday, as both
Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are set to announce weak 2008
results later this week. Here are some details about recent aid packages for the
shattered auto industry: * BRAZIL -- Said in November it had instructed state-run
bank Banco do Brasil to make available a total of 4 billion
reals ($1.72 billion) so that automakers' financing units could
increase lending and spur sales. * BRITAIN -- Announced last month it would guarantee up to
2.3 billion pounds ($3.29 billion) of loans to the car industry.
The government said it would guarantee up to 1.3 billion pounds
of auto industry loans from the European Investment Bank and
guarantee a further 1 billion pounds of loans to back
investments that are not eligible for support from the European
lender. * CANADA -- Unveiled an aid package on Dec. 20 that provided
C$4 billion ($3.28 billion) in emergency loans to the Canadian
arms of General Motors and Chrysler to keep them operating while
they restructure. The automakers have a deadline of Feb. 20 to
come up with a comprehensive plan that would allow them to get
government aid. * CHINA -- Unveiled measures on Jan. 14, which included
cutting in half, to 5 percent, the sales tax on purchases of
cars with engine sizes below 1.6 litres and one-off cash
subsidies totalling 5 billion yuan ($731.1 million) to owners of
high-emission vehicles who trade them in for cleaner ones. * FRANCE -- Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Jan. 20
France may pump up to 6 billion euros of aid into the industry,
but warned that automakers would have to safeguard French jobs
in return. * GERMANY -- Unveiled a 1.5 billion euro aid package on Jan.
13. The package forms part of a 50 billion euro stimulus package
of investments, tax relief and support for companies. The
measures include incentives worth 2,500 euros for new car
purchases. * ITALY -- Announced a stimulus package for cars on Friday
which includes a payment of as much as 1,500 euros for trading
in an old car to buy a new one. Italian car sales are expected
to fall 17 percent in 2009, after a 13 percent drop in 2008, * PORTUGAL: -- Announced on Dec. 3 a 200 million euro credit
line for auto and car parts exporters. * SWEDEN -- Said on Jan. 22 it had given the National Debt
Office the authority to grant emergency loans to the industry. * UNITED STATES -- Announced on Dec. 19 a $17.4 billion
lifeline to Detroit carmakers. The bailout funds will come from
the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief (TARP) program. GM will
receive $13.4 billion and Chrysler $4 billion. Ford Motor Co
said it did not need a loan. Loans will be called in if the
automakers cannot prove they are viable by March 31.

 (For more on the financial crisis, click on) By Steve Slater and Yumiko Nishitani LONDON/TOKYO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays booked
a 6.1 billion pounds ($9 billion) profit on Monday while
carmakers floundered, but investors focused squarely on the fate
of a U.S. stimulus bill worth more than $800 billion. Most companies around the world are under the cosh from the
worst economic crisis in decades and auto makers in particular
have been hammered by collapsing demand. Japan's No. 3 carmaker Nissan Motor Co. posted a big
quarterly loss and said it would lay off 20,000 workers. For the full year, Nissan now expects an operating loss --
its first in 14 years -- of 180 billion yen ($2 billion). Last
week, its larger peer Toyota forecast an operating loss for the
year would be about $5 billion. France will unveil details of a plan to support its ailing
auto sector later on Monday, an official at the presidential
office said. Both Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are set to
announce poor 2008 results this week. French newspapers said President Nicolas Sarkozy would
announce a government loan of around 6 billion euros ($7.7
billion) to the pair. Their shares rose in response. In the United States, General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC
are racing to prove to the government they can be commercially
viable after receiving a $17.4 billion bailout. Barclays said it expected 2009 to be ""another challenging
year"" with credit market losses shrinking but bad debt charges
set to rise as recession takes a toll. Its 2008 pretax profit was down from 7.1 billion pounds in
2007 but ahead of most forecasts and included 8 billion pounds
in gross writedowns and bad debts. ""In 2008 we've had a crisis in the banking system; the
principal issue for 2009 is going to be rapid economic slowdown,
in a sense more a familiar but nonetheless pretty brutal
slowdown in economic growth all around the world,"" said Barclays
Chief Executive John Varley. The UK economy was likely to contract by at least 2 percent
this year, he said. Britain, the United States, Japan and the
euro zone are already in recession. The damage from the financial crisis in Europe was
highlighted by a 3.7 percent fall in German exports in December
and a Bank of France survey showing the French economy is
expected to shrink by 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2009.  JAPAN LANGUISHING In Japan, data showed core machinery orders, a leading
indicator of the manufacturing-oriented economy, fell 1.7
percent to a two-decade low, and Japan's current account surplus
slid 92 percent in December from a year earlier. Corporate bankruptcies rose 16 percent to a six-year high in
January, with the number of bankruptcies among listed companies
at a record high for any financial year since World War Two,
research firm Tokyo Shoko Research said.  The Bank of Japan's top economist, Kazuo Monma, said prices
may stay in a downtrend for some time and that the central bank
needed to monitor whether price falls and increasing slack in
the economy may create a self-perpetuating spiral of price drops
and further slowing in economic activity. Emerging economies are also suffering, with India on Monday
forecasting 7.1 growth in its fiscal year 2008/09, the slowest
pace in six years. South Korea's LG Electronics said it aimed to cut $2.2
billion in costs and may shed jobs as it expects about a 20
percent sales fall in dollar terms this year.  U.S. DEBATE RUMBLES ON For all that, financial market focus stayed firmly on the
U.S. Congress, which remains sharply divided along party lines
on an $800 billion-plus economic plan. European stocks . fell as investors anxiously awaited the
approval of Washington's stimulus plan and bank rescue package.
Japan's Nikkei average closed 1.3 percent lower and U.S. stock
futures pointed to a lower start on Wall Street. Squabbling will resume over the plan on Monday when the
Democratic-led Senate, with the help of just a few Republicans,
votes to end debate on an $827 billion rescue package and clear
the way for passage of the measure on Tuesday. Negotiators will then seek to resolve differences between
the Senate bill and an $819 billion version passed earlier by
the House of Representatives without any Republican support. ""Negotiations will be difficult, but fun to watch,"" a
Republican aide said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is also preparing
to unveil a bank rescue plan detailing how the administration
will use the remaining $350 billion of a $700 billion bailout
programme set up late last year. His announcement was pushed back to Tuesday, from Monday, to
keep the focus on the stimulus bill.

 (Adds comments from EU commissioner, Peugeot manager)  By Christiaan Hetzner  FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - New car sales in Germany,
western Europe's largest auto market, contracted in January at a
double-digit rate as Germans tightened their belts in
anticipation of the worst recession since the Second World War. In what carmakers believe could be the third straight year
of record low car sales, new registrations in Germany sank 14.2
percent to 189,385 light vehicles last month, the German motor
vehicles department KBA published on Tuesday. Data showed car production down 34 percent in January amid
an export slump of nearly 39 percent in Germany, highlighting an
acute threat to the over 700,000 people employed in the domestic
automotive and parts supplier industry. ""There is no guarantee that all production sites in western
Europe will still be there,"" EU Industry Commissioner Guenter
Verheugen said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, citing
the 20 percent overhang in manufacturing capacity. In spite of his warning not to incite a backlash among
trading partners through protectionist state aid, a much-needed
boost to carmakers could soon be in the cards thanks to a
considerable increase in new orders as Germans take advantage of
Europe's most generous government scrapping incentive. Berlin is offering a 2,500 euro subsidy for each buyer of a
new car in exchange for turning over the keys of older ones
registered nine years ago or more. The head of Peugeot's German import subsidiary expects to
profit substantially from this scrapping premium, estimating the
so-called ""Environment Bonus"" could add another 300,000 vehicles
to the overall German market over his forecast of 2.7 million. ""The mood among Peugeot dealers is currently as good as it
has been in a long time...Orders rose 80 percent in January over
the previous year,"" said Olivier Dardart, who has 400,000
customers alone that could swap their old Peugeot for a new one. According to the KBA motor vehicle department, the owners of
around 13.7 million cars qualify for the state ""Environment
Bonus"" -- roughly a third of all vehicles registered in Germany. Car companies have long pushed for scrapping incentives as
the quickest and most effective way of reducing carbon emissions
from vehicles. The VDA association of German automakers argued that
lowering the average age of cars on German roads by just one
year from the almost nine years at present could lead to a
reduction of 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.  CARBON FRIENDLY  It has forecast 2009 sales could exceed the 3 million mark
thanks to legislative incentives including the scrappage
incentive and car tax exemptions for as long as two years for
buyers of new vehicles fulfilling stringent Euro 5 emissions
norms. New registrations of mini cars, that include the Czech-built
Peugeot 107, grew in January, against the trend, rising 34
percent in Germany -- roughly in line with the increase in
demand for cars emitting up to 120 grams of carbon dioxide per
kilometer that in the future will qualify for tax breaks. Starting in July, the owner of a Smart ForTwo 1.0 litre
petrol vehicle only has to pay a 20-euro base levy per year,
instead of 67 euros previously, since it emits only 112 g/km of
CO2. ""Every tenth vehicle (registered in January) is thus below
the planned car tax threshold,"" the KBA said, adding that Euro 5
cars reached a share of nearly 17 percent that month. The government incentives will prove critical in boosting a
German auto industry as the country endures what the
International Monetary Fund expects will be a contraction in
economic output by 2.5 percent, by far the worst since 1945. Without the artificial boost to demand, the German car
market would almost certainly retreat from last year's level of
3.09 million vehicles.

 * Nippon Steel may cut output as Voestalpine trims outlook 
 (Adds Italy new car sales figures) By Jason Webb and Marcel Michelson MADRID/PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Sales of new cars, for many
households the most expensive outlay after property, dropped
further in Asia and Europe in January as the savage downturn in
the industry left its mark on steelmakers on both continents. With consumers putting off big-ticket buys, new car sales
fell by a fifth in Japan last month and South Korea's automakers
moved a third fewer cars. Sales also tumbled 41.6 percent in Spain, 32.64 percent in
Italy and 8 percent in France. Consumers prefer to save their money because they fear for
their jobs and face tight credit markets. Many global carmakers have already cut production, idling
plants, laying off workers and delaying spending to cope with
weakening markets. Several have sought state aid to survive. As the crisis spreads to suppliers, Nippon Steel Corp said
it may cut its output further but would wait to see the output
plans of leading Japanese automakers for the April-June quarter
before making any changes. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine, which generated 25 percent
of its 2007-08 revenue from the auto sector, cut its 2008-09
forecast amid a ""massive decline"" in demand and said it could
not give an outlook for the following year. The decline in Spanish car sales left manufacturers there
desperately in need of aid similar to that announced in other
European countries, industry association ANFAC said on Monday. France's 7.9 percent January decline came after a 15.8
percent drop in December, auto industry body CCFA said. Sales of
French brands dropped 14.8 percent and took their combined
market share to 50 percent. In Italy, where the government has yet to come up with
incentives to encourage drivers to buy cars, sales tumbled 32.64
percent for the month. Fiat saw sales for its three main brands drop 31.3 percent,
leaving it with a 32.06 percent share of its home market. U.S. data are also due later. Spain's rate of sales decline slowed from December's 49.9
percent drop, but in absolute terms, January's sales were
considerably worse than those of the preceding month as Spain's
recession mauled spending by heavily indebted consumers. ANFAC said government measures announced so far, including
loans for people who want to buy new cars to replace older, more
heavily polluting models, were insufficient. ""The industry urgently needs measures to boost demand ... In
countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, which have
lower production than Spain, they have taken measures to support
the industry in the form of (loan) guarantees,"" ANFAC said. Spain's economy tipped into recession in the second half of
2008 and unemployment has almost doubled to nearly 14 percent. Automakers have announced a wave of job cuts in Spain, where
marques with factories include General Motors, Ford, Renault,
Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Volkswagen.  U.S. SALES SEEN DOWN The Dow Jones Stoxx auto index was down 1.52 percent, after
a fall of some 10 percent this year and a 45 percent slide in
2008. In an interview, Honda's chief financial officer Yoichi Hojo
said January sales in the United States, the world's biggest car
market, fell by a similar margin to a 35 percent drop in
December, and it would take several months to bring down high
inventory levels. Japan's No. 2 automaker plans to operate its factories in
North America, Japan and Asia, excluding China, at just 60
percent of capacity in January-March.

President Barack Obama to act quickly on the global financial
crisis was underlined on Tuesday by tumbling bank shares, a
slump in Japanese consumer sentiment and a teetering car sector. The first African-American to become U.S. president will
take his oath against a backdrop of a deep downturn, a trillion
dollar federal deficit and fears of more crippling bank losses. European shares fell despite a better-than-expected ZEW
analyst and investor sentiment index in Germany. The monthly
poll of economic sentiment by the ZEW economic think tank rose
to -31.0 from -45.2 in December. Underscoring the dire state of the world economy, Japan
reported consumer confidence plunging to a record low last month
in yet another sign of deepening recession. Investors remained rattled, despite the launch of a second
UK bank bailout this week, and the less downbeat ZEW indicator. ""This is mostly an expression of hope. The indicator is
still clearly in negative territory. Nothing is changing in
terms of the 2009 recession,"" said Gerd Hassel, economist at
BHF-Bank. On Monday, Britain threw its troubled banks a second
multi-billion pound lifeline in three months and gave its
central bank the green light to pump cash into the ailing
economy because interest rates are already close to zero. But bank shares suffered more heavy losses on Tuesday. Europe's banking index fell to a 14-year low on fears that
lenders will need more state help to raise capital as recession
bites and bad debts rise. Shares in Lloyds and Barclays fell
particularly sharply. Overall, world stocks were down 1.2 percent and in Europe,
the FTSEurofirst 300 was 1.0 percent adrift with banks taking
most toll on the index. ""After yesterday's carnage, the smoke is still hanging over
the market,"" says Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven
Investment Management..  CAR CRISIS The banking sector aside, no sector has been worse hit than
carmakers by the worst financial crisis in 80 years. Italy's Fiat took a 35 percent stake in Chrysler on Tuesday,

carmaker's future.. The deal will give the Italian carmaker the scale it needs
to survive, while Chrysler can expand its product portfolio to
include small, less-polluting cars. Separately, France said it may pump up to 6 billion euros
($7.79 billion) of aid into the country's ailing car industry,
but Prime Minister Francois Fillon warned on Tuesday that
automakers would have to safeguard jobs in return. ""There is an emergency. We need a massive response on the
automobile sector's financing,"" Fillon said. His comments, at a summit on helping France's battered car
industry, came after the head of PSA Peugeot Citroen predicted a
""terribly difficult"" year in 2009 and declined to say whether
the company would break even. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the aid
threatened to distort competition wand was not a long-term
solution to the struggling sector's problems..  And EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Veheugen said the EU
must watch efforts to rescue U.S. carmakers to ensure they do
not disadvantage European manufacturers.   BURDEN OF EXPECTATION Obama's team has vowed to make bailout funds work harder to

and is expected to announce soon changes to the second half of
Washington's $700 billion bank rescue scheme. The incoming president is also working with lawmakers to
launch a two-year $825 billion fiscal stimulus plan by
mid-February. In one of the most eagerly awaited inaugural addresses,
Obama is expected to reassure Americans that the country can
rebound from hard times. But he faces stratospheric expectations. ""The expectations for the Obama administration are off the

percent of its global workforce by 2012, a source close to the
company told Reuters on Tuesday. And British luxury goods firm Burberry announced up to 35
million pounds ($49 million) of savings, including 540 job
losses in the UK and Spain. Britain is set to confirm on Friday the world's
fifth-largest economy is now in its first recession since 1992. China, the world's main growth engine, on Tuesday reported

 (Adds more Chrysler CEO comments, Fiat share price) By Gilles Castonguay and Poornima Gupta MILAN/DETROIT, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Italy's Fiat took an
initial 35 percent stake in Chrysler, launching a venture
designed to secure both carmakers' futures as France asked its
auto industry to commit to output targets in exchange for aid. Chrysler said on Tuesday the deal, which involves no cash
investment, was a key component in its survival plan, giving
it access to Fiat's more fuel-efficient vehicle platforms and
freeing up an immediate $4 billion of funds from the U.S.
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). News of the transatlantic partnership broke as politicians
struggled to fashion a coordinated response to the worst crisis
to hit the auto industry in decades. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said his government
was considering an aid package for the country's carmakers worth
5-6 billion euros. ""I think all European governments share this opinion ...
There is an emergency. We need a massive response on the
automobile sector's financing,"" he told a French car industry
summit. Measures would be announced in the coming days, he said. But as German carmakers also took steps to bolster
haemorrhaging cash reserves, Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised
U.S. subsidies to the sector and warned that state bailouts
risked distorting competition and did not offer a long-term
solution to the crisis.  ECONOMIES OF SCALE The Chrysler stake, which Fiat's vice-chairman John Elkann
said might be increased, would give the Italian carmaker the
scale it needs to survive, while Chrysler can expand its
portfolio to include less-polluting cars, meeting criteria for
access to U.S. funds. The U.S. carmaker's CEO, Bob Nardelli, told employees in a
letter the Obama administration would provide $4 billion of
initial funding to Chrysler, and that the company would assist
in bringing its partner's brands to the U.S. market. He said the deal, which is expected to be completed in April
pending regulatory approvals, would ""significantly enhance the
long-term viability"" of the company and ""greatly increase (our)
global reach ... in markets outside of North America."" Cost savings from the collaboration are estimated at $3-$4
billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. ""Sharing technology should inevitably save costs,"" said Bank
of America Merrill Lynch analyst Harald Hendrikse. ""Fiat is looking at Chrysler as an inexpensive way to
re-enter the U.S. market ... (and) should gain access to cheap
U.S. assembly."" However, Fiat's optimism about the deal was surprising,
given that ""what Daimler or private equity could not fix is not
likely to be fixed by Fiat"", he said. At 1403 GMT, Fiat shares jumped 4.1 percent to 4.66 euros
after being halted from trade ahead of the news, while the DJS
European auto sector gained 1 percent. In Germany, a spokesman for former Chrysler owner Daimler,
which still holds a 20 percent stake, said the German carmaker
was continuing efforts to sell its holding and welcomed any
initiative that served to stabilise the situation at the U.S.
carmaker. Daimler has written down the value of that stake to zero. Domestic rival BMW on Tuesday became the latest manufacturer
to scale back production amid a relentless rise in inventories
as sales plummet, putting 26,000 German staff on shorter working
hours in February and March. French Prime Minister Fillon said that in exchange for state
aid carmakers would have to give commitments on production
volumes as well as safeguarding jobs. A senior official in President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said
France did not expect the European Union to raise objections to
the plan, and that the government wanted a certain degree of 
collaboration with other European countries in the auto sector. Peugeot chief executive Christian Streiff warned on Monday
that 2009 would be a ""terrible year"", while his counterpart at
Renault-Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, forecast on Tuesday that the auto
sector downturn would be long-lasting. In Tokyo, the world's biggest carmaker Toyota Motor Corp
named the grandson of its founder to steer it through the
crisis.  WEAKEST OF 'BIG THREE' The Fiat deal is the latest in a series of alliances that
car makers have formed to cut costs and improve margins. The weakest of Detroit's three carmakers, Chrysler has been
counting on a further $3 billion of government loans to avoid
collapse. Like General Motors, which also got government money,
Chrysler was required to meet cost-cutting targets as a
condition for the loans. It also has to show it is committed to
developing new vehicles that produce fewer harmful emissions. Analysts had questioned whether Chrysler could survive
without a partner. Most of its sales are in the U.S. market,
where Chrysler posted a 30 percent drop last year.

 (Adds comments from news conference) By Helen Massy-Beresford and Matthias Blamont BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT, France, Jan 9 (Reuters) - French
carmaker Renault posted a 4.2 percent drop in 2008 unit sales in
a world market that fell 4.8 percent, and set further reducing
its stock of unsold vehicles as a priority for 2009. Sales of Renault brand vehicles fell 5.4 percent while Dacia
brand sales rose 11.7 percent, for a market share that was
stable at 3.6 percent, the company said on Friday. On Tuesday, chief operating officer Patrick Pelata said
Renault had met its target of reducing vehicle stocks to
end-2007 levels by the end of 2008, but the company said on
Friday that ""inventory management and reduction will remain a
priority throughout 2009"". In common with other manufacturers, Renault has announced
job cuts and temporary plant closures as it struggles to cope
with a worldwide drop in vehicle sales. On Thursday, its 44-percent owned subsidiary Nissan- which
is not included in Renault group sales data - said it was
cutting 1,200 jobs at its Sunderland plant in northeast England
in response to the dramatic decline in demand. 
 Renault said it expected the auto industry to remain in
crisis in 2009 but it had three assets to boost its market share
-- a range of new models, the Renault Eco brand eligible for tax
breaks for emissions-friendlier vehicles, and a price range well
suited to the current economic conditions. Head of sales Patrick Blain told a news conference that
there were already some positive returns from a new French
scheme to subsidise the scrapping of old cars, and that he
expected further state credit support for the industry. There was no immediate response from the company to comments
from an unnamed government source quoted in daily Les Echos as
saying that Renault required 2.5 billion euros ($3.42 billion)
of funding.
 The government and carmakers are due to hold a summit
meeting on Jan. 20. MARKET SHARE STILL BELOW 2006 Total Renault sales in 2008 were 2.38 million cars and light
commercial vehicles, against 2.48 million in 2007. The group's
market share, while stable against 2007, eased slightly from the
3.7 percent registered in 2006. Vehicle sales will be boosted when Renault consolidates the
sales of Lada and other cars made by AvtoVAZ in Russia, in which
it took a blocking minority stake last year. Car sales fell across Europe in 2008, dipping 1.8 percent in
Germany, 28 percent in Spain and 13.4 percent in Italy.  In France the decline was limited to 0.7 percent as a tax
incentive on purchases of cleaner cars boosted sales of smaller
vehicles where Renault and bigger local rival PSA Peugeot
Citroen have a strong position. Renault is targeting a profit margin of between 2.5 percent
and 3.0 percent for 2008. Its financial results are due on Feb.
12. At 0940 GMT, Renault shares were up 4.1 percent at 21.18
euros, well above its November 2008 low of 14.4 euros and after
a drop of 81 percent last year. The Dow Jones Stoxx Auto index
was up 1.16 percent. (Writing by Marcel Michelson; editing by John Stonestreet)

(Updates with more details, analyst comment, share prices) By Helen Massy-Beresford and Niklas Pollard PARIS/STOCKHOLM, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European new car sales
dropped by a quarter in November, data showed on Tuesday as more
vehicle makers announced output cuts and the Big Three U.S.
players waited for the government to throw them a lifeline. Volkswagen's Spanish car maker Seat and world number two
truckmaker Volvo became the latest companies to announce
temporary production halts in response to falling sales as the
global economic slowdown batters the industry. Governments are rushing to support car manufacturers
struggling to cope with falling sales and difficulties shifting
their stocks of unsold vehicles. On Monday, France said it was ready to take action following
a meeting with top industry executives in return for commitments
to keep production in the country.. ""There's always a certain amount of posturing, but later,
outsourcing can be dressed up as new production,"" said one
Paris-based analyst who declined to be named. ""I think PSA is
less willing to make concessions than Renault,"" he added, noting
the French government's stake in Renault. In the U.S., the Bush administration could act as early as
Wednesday to approve an automaker bailout from its bank rescue
fund, with conditions likely to reflect at least those approved
by the U.S. House of Representatives last week, key lawmakers
and other sources said on Monday. GM and Chrysler LLC, which is owned by Cerberus Capital
Management, have said they need immediate cash injections to
survive. Ford is seeking a government line of credit it could
use if its financial position deteriorated more than expected in
2009. Carmakers are also seeking help from their suppliers: Toyota
Motor Corp plans to ask Nippon Steel Corp and other steelmakers
for a 30 percent price cut, the Nikkei business daily reported
on Tuesday.    Meanwhile, the world's fourth-largest steelmaker
POSCO said on Tuesday it may cut output next year if market
conditions continue to worsen. In a further sign of the financial constraints hitting auto
manufacturers, Fuji Heavy Industries said it would withdraw its
Subaru team from the world rally championship. Fellow Japanese
carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp announced its exit a day earlier,
leaving only Citroen and Ford chasing the manufacturers' title.  Honda Motor Co, Japan's No.2 automaker, this month quit
Formula One racing, saying it needed to conserve cash for its
core-automaking business.  European new passenger car registrations dropped 25.8
percent year-on-year according to the ACEA industry body on
Tuesday, the seventh consecutive monthly drop. ACEA said the last time registrations fell so sharply was in
1999 and in 1993, before EU enlargement, when the data only
covered the 15 EU member states plus the European Free Trade
Association countries. November's data referred to the 27 EU member states, plus
the EFTA countries and excluded Malta and Cyprus, ACEA said.  CUT CUT CUT Separately, Seat said it would further cut production at its
main plant in Catalonia in the first half of 2009 in response to
diving sales. The maker of the Ibiza and Leon said that between
Feb. 2 and June 30 it would halt work at its Martorell plant
near Barcelona for seven to 29 days on various production lines. General Motors said on Monday it would temporarily shut down
assembly lines at three of its Mexican car factories. The decline in November sales was not just in passenger cars
-- truck sales also fell, leading Volvo to stop production for
20 to 25 days in the first quarter of 2009. At 10.30 GMT the DJ Stoxx Auto Index was up 1.25 percent
while Peugeot's shares rose 1.51 percent and Volkswagen rose

717,"Dec 10, 2008 11:15AM ET","Czech car firms to axe 13,500 jobs as demand slumps",nan," By Martin Dokoupil PRUHONICE, Czech Republic, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Czech
Republic's top industry, car production, will shed over 13,500
jobs in the next few months as suppliers are being hammered by
recession in the euro zone, but vehicle output will still grow
next year. The Car Industry Association boosted on Wednesday its
estimate for overall layoffs to 13,552 people from 3,000 in
October due to slumping car demand in Europe. The number of workers in the sector will drop to some
124,648 by June 2009, with parts makers hit the worst, a survey
among 80 percent of the association's 160 members showed. ""Nearly 70 percent of car industry firms are considering
layoffs and the biggest falls are at suppliers, where more than
10,000 workers will lose jobs,"" the association secretary
Antonin Sipek said after a meeting of industry leaders. The Czech economy is highly dependent on the car industry,
which accounts for 21 percent of overall exports. There have been no collapses in the Czech banking sector as
a result of the global turmoil but all other companies are being
hit hard, and both the central bank and the government have
repeatedly cut growth forecasts for 2009 to below 3 percent. Economic growth slowed to 4.2 percent in the third quarter,
which is the lowest pace in four years, more than the 4.7
percent expected by the central bank, data showed earlier on
Wednesday. Auto makers -- led by Volkswagen AG Skoda Auto and TPCA, a
joint Toyota-Peugeot operation -- stuck to their reduced October
forecast for 4 percent growth in overall vehicle output this
year to 969,017 cars. Output should grow further as Hyundai Motor ramps up
production to its eventual 300,000 target at its factory opened
earlier this year. ""Output will be somewhere around 1 million vehicles and we
will cross 1 million next year due to the launch of Hyundai's
plant,"" said Martin Jahn, head of Volkswagen's Russian unit and
the association. ""But we cannot expect such a massive production rise we were
used to due to the recession (in Europe),"" he said. Carmakers across the continent have announced major cuts to
production due to falling demand and many factories will close
for long periods over the Christmas holidays. French car sales dropped 14 percent last month, while
Germany, Czech Republic's key trading partner, posted an 18
percent decline, leaving the industry on track for its worst
year there since reunification in 1990. Skoda Auto, the top Czech firm by turnover, has announced an
extension of a shutdown set for the last two weeks in December
until Jan. 11 next year. Its planned cuts for the final three
months of 2008 would trim output by 31,000 cars. A Skoda executive said last month the company expected a 9.5
percent rise in sales this year to 690,000 units, and will
target unchanged sales in 2009. On a brighter note, TPCA announced in October plans to boost
capacity by 20,000 to reach 340,000 cars next year despite a
downturn in auto markets, due to rising demand for its smaller,
cheaper and more efficient cars.

718,"Dec 04, 2008 08:20AM ET","France pushes green cars, credit to save sector",nan," PARIS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - France took steps to shore up its
embattled car industry on Thursday by giving incentives to
consumers to buy new cars and pledging a 1 billion euro ($1.3
billion) credit line to help people finance any purchases. A slowdown in economic growth spurred by the global
financial crisis has hit the global car sector hard, forcing
auto makers in France to halt production or shed jobs as auto 
sales plummet. PSA Peugeot-Citroen SA, Europe's second-biggest car marker
in terms of European sales, said last month it planned to slash
2,700 jobs across its sites in France. President Nicolas Sarkozy singled out the car sector as
being in special need of state help as he unveiled a 26 billion
euro economic stimulus package in the northern city of Douai. ""We need to clear stocks so that production can get going
again,"" Sarkozy said. Government officials have said around 1 million unsold cars
are standing on parking lots at factories or dealerships. To help clear the backlog, France would give a 1,000 euro
handout to people purchasing cars with carbon dioxide emissions
of less than 160 grams per kilometre. The government was also providing a 1 billion euro credit
line to car financing units so consumers could continue to buy
cars on credit, he said. France would also set up a 300 million euro fund to support
an industrial restructuring in the sector, a third of which
would be financed by the state. The fund comes on top of efforts
to finance the development of electric cars. Auto firms benefitting from state aid would need to do their
bit too and give guarantees they would not outsource production
outside France.
 More help for the car sector in France could be on the way. ""It cannot be ruled out that the state will be led to do
more, depending on what the American authorities decide and in
the framework of concerted European action,"" Sarkozy said.

probably apply this month for shorter working hours.  DAIMLER Discussing cutting the work week to less than 30 hours for
about 50,000 staff at four German plants from the start of
January through April.  BMW Suspended production at its factory in Leipzig for a week
last month and is operating only one shift a day there. The
company plans to cut 400 further temporary workers in Leipzig,
in addition to previously announced plans to cut 8,100 full-time
jobs around the world. It closed two other plants during
Bavarian autumn holidays from Nov. 3 to 7.  VOLKSWAGEN Considering suspending production at its main Wolfsburg
plant from Dec. 18 to Jan. 11. Its luxury brand Audi is
considering similar measures.   PORSCHE Closed its main plant for one day in November and plans to
shut for another seven days before end-January.  PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN Announced in October it would cut production by 30 percent
from what it had originally planned for the fourth quarter. Confirmed in November there would be site closures ranging
from a few days to a few weeks, without specifying which plants
would be closed and for how long. Announced on Nov. 20 it would cut up to 3,550 jobs. It is
due to present voluntary departure plans to its works council on
Dec. 2. The group has already cut 7,400 jobs through voluntary
redundancy since 2007.
 RENAULT Said in November it planned to cut output in an attempt to
get close to the 5.9 billion euros ($7.63 billion) of inventory
it had at the end of last year, by the end of 2008. The Dacia Pitesti plant in Romania was set to close from
Nov. 20 to Dec. 3 and STA Ruitz will shut from Dec. 10 to Jan 3. In Spain, the Valladolid assembly plant will stop production
for 11 days, while the Palencia plant will shut for seven days
in November and seven days in December. Renault will also stop the assembly line at its Moscow
plant, which produces the Logan, from Dec. 12 to Dec. 31. In September, the group announced a plan to cut 6,000 jobs
across Europe through voluntary redundancy.  FIAT Unions said on Nov. 12 that Fiat would shut down its six
plants in Italy for four to six weeks in December and January. In addition, it halted production at its Mirafiori plant in
Turin for the last week of November. The measures come after Fiat had already shut down the
plants down for brief periods between August and November. In Brazil, it shut its Betim plant down from Nov. 11 to 26. Magneti Marelli, a Fiat subsidiary that makes electronic
systems, has scheduled stoppages of up to 50 days at two of its
plants in Catalonia, eastern Spain, according to a Nov. 9 report
in El Pais newspaper.

720,"Nov 27, 2008 10:08AM ET",ANALYSIS-Fast rollout key to Europe economy stimulus,nan," By Brian Love, European Economics Correspondent PARIS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - It is easy to announce that Europe must spend 200
billion euros ($260 billion) fighting recession, as the European Commission did
on Wednesday. It is harder for the many governments that must come up with such colossal
amounts to do so ultra-rapidly, not to mention in a coordinated and neighbourly
fashion that maximises the impact without stoking tensions over cross-border
trade competition. That is the challenge they must rise to in the coming weeks, and speed of
delivery is paramount, economists say. Germany, however, has made it clear so far that it will not let loose in a
hurry with public finances it has spent years getting into balance. Failure to move fast could tip Europe into a more prolonged slump in
activity than anticipated, as Tokyo learned the hard way in the 1990s, Japan's
""lost decade"", according to the international team of economists at Deutsche
Bank. OECD chief economist Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, who sees eight million job losses
in the industrialised world in the next two years and believes the world's first
truly global recession is no longer unthinkable, urged governments this week to
hit hard and swiftly with tax cuts, rebates and extended social benefit payments
to bolster demand and counter economic paralysis. This, he said, would work much faster than grand projects to build roads,
bridges and other public infrastructure, which while good for creating jobs take
too long to get off the ground and too long to wind up when the troubled times
have passed. If anything, Germany has more firepower to pump prime the economy with
public funds than the likes of France, which has a far larger public deficit,
according to the economics department of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.  COORDINATION NOT SO EASY The European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-member European Union,
floated the idea of an EU-wide stimulus package worth 200 billion euros, or
roughly the equivalent of 1.5 percent of the EU's total gross domestic product,
on Wednesday. That is big money, and shows the pace at which things have degenerated since
September, when EU finance ministers said they saw no need for Europe to hatch
stimulus packages on the scale now being discussed. Most of it though is not the Commission's money to commit and the
prescriptions depend on how willing governments are to sign up, which is far
from a foregone conclusion as far as Europe's biggest economy, Germany, is
concerned. Of the 200 billion euros, 170 billion euros is money that the Commission
reckons national governments will produce, and the remaining 30 billion would be
extra money provided by the European Investment Bank, the EU's investment
lending arm. Beyond the money itself the Commission's proposal seeks to serve another
purpose. It makes clear that governments will be freed from the constraints of
Europe's deficit limits while they fly to the rescue and encourages them to
commit to restore state finances to more sustainable long-term levels a few
years down the road. German leader Angela Merkel warned on Wednesday against a ""race for
billions"", showing her reluctance to let loose with public money after years of
painful efforts to get rid of the country's public deficit. Merkel is sounding far less thrusting than the likes of Britain's Gordon
Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Brown's government unveiled a national stimulus package worth 20 billion
pounds ($31 billion) this week, including a cut in value-added sales tax (VAT)
that will take effect as the Christmas shopping season peaks. Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit bank, notes that the
Commission suggests something along those lines would be good in other European
countries because it supports demand fast. ""It creates an incentive to spend now...but several European governments
have already rebuffed the idea,"" he said. Sarkozy has promised a ""quite massive"" French plan will be announced in the
next week or so. By contrast, Merkel is saying her government, which raised VAT last year to
balance public finances, says she will not rush into further outlays, and that
VAT reductions are not an option, illustrating the limits of coordination at
pan-European level. Back in 1997, Tokyo too raised VAT, just as financial crisis swept Asia,
exacerbating what was already a five-year-old downturn. Where Europe's stimulus may also generate friction is when it comes to aid
targeted at specific industries and above all the car industry, which is hit
both sides of the Atlantic by plummeting sales. Washington is working on a $25-billion rescue package for the U.S. auto
industry and European carmakers are clamouring for 40 billion euros ($52
billion), raising the risk of a tit-for-tat skirmish over fair competition. French carmaker Peugeot Citroen, which cut 7,400 jobs in 2007 through
voluntary redundancy, last week announced plans to cut a further 3,500,
prompting Sarkozy to promise help for an industry that remains a huge employer
in France and Germany. What remains to be seen is whether that goes beyond provision of low-cost
loans from the EIB. Finance ministers will get a chance to broach the matter
when they meet on Monday and Tuesday in Brussels.

721,"Nov 25, 2008 07:52AM ET",UPDATE 2-France to launch big stimulus plan shortly-Sarkozy,nan," (Adds quotes from the prime minister in paras 4-6) VALENCIENNES, France, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The French
government will launch a major stimulus plan to revive the
flagging economy within the next 10 days, President Nicolas
Sarkozy said on Tuesday. Sarkozy said the plan would include measures to boost the
construction and car sectors, especially auto suppliers who have
been particularly hard hit by the recent economic slowdown. ""In less than 10 days we will announce a revival plan to
save the car industry...and strengthen the building sector,""
Sarkozy said in northern France, without giving further details. Speaking later in parliament, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
said the measures would include tax initiatives to help car
firms, saying they had around one million vehicles in stock. The government would also make investments to enable
companies to create hybrid and electric vehicles, he added. Coordination with the European Union and the new U.S.
administration would be crucial in implementing such a plan to
help the global economy, he said. The European Commission is seeking to get EU states to agree
to a broad range of measures, including temporary sales' tax
cuts, to pull the 27-nation bloc clear of recession.  France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union
and has pushed hard for an EU-wide response to the slowdown
following coordinated action earlier in the autumn to ease the
financial crisis that brought the banking system to its knees. Sarkozy said on Monday it was time ""to invest massively in
infrastructure, in research, in innovation, in education, in
training people, because it is now or never"". France has expressed frustration at Germany's more cautious
approach to the onset of recession, with Berlin unwilling to
commit vast amounts of cash to spurring the economy. A slew of poor economic data and results over the past month
have highlighted the challenge facing Europe, with the
continent's car firms already suffering. PSA Peugeot-Citroen announced last week it planned to cut
3,550 jobs across its sites in France, while Renault has said it
will cut 6,000 jobs across Europe. France's construction industry is also feeling the pinch.
Data released on Tuesday showed new housing starts fell 20.6
percent in the three months to the end of October.

722,"Nov 24, 2008 06:30AM ET","UPDATE 1-Euro zone orders fall points to recession, ECB cut",nan," (Recasts with economists' comments, background) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Falling demand for cars cut
euro zone industrial new orders by more than expected in
September from August, pointing to a deep industrial recession
and further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank. Orders in the 15-country currency area fell 3.9 percent
month-on-month for a 1.1 percent year-on-year contraction, the
European Union statistics office, Eurostat, said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected orders to fall 3.0
percent monthly and 1.9 percent annually. The euro zone is in
technical recession after output shrank for a second straight
quarter in July-September, and economists see further decline. ""Coming after the August decline and what we know about the
business confidence for October and November, it does point to a
deep industrial recession, which will not be lost on the ECB,""
Holger Schmieding, economist at Bank of America, said. ""We expect a 50 basis point cut in December, with a chance
it could be 75 basis points,"" he said. The bank cut rates by 50 basis points in both October and
November to 3.25 percent as a sharply slowing economy eased wage
pressures and triggered an oil price plunge, which is quickly
bringing down inflation towards the ECB's target. Industrial orders indicate the level of future industrial
activity. The data only partly covers the period when the
year-old global credit crunch turned into the worst crisis on
financial markets since the 1930s in mid-September and October. ""The global financial crisis in the services sector has been
transferred to the manufacturing sector obviously by credit
constraint on manufacturers and also through the demand side in
emerging markets,"" BNP Paribas economist Dominic Bryant said.  CARS IN TROUBLE The fall in orders came mainly because of a 5.1 percent
month-on-month plunge in demand for metals and fabricated metal
products as well as a 3.8 percent fall in the volatile demand
for ships, planes and trains. The falling demand for metals is likely to stem mainly from
production cutbacks among carmakers, as lower credit
availability and the slowing economy sharply reduced consumer
demand, economists said. Car sales have fallen dramatically as the global financial
crisis has gathered steam. Carmakers are frantically trying to
keep up with the declines in the market by slashing costs and
extending the usual plant idling over Christmas to save cash. In western Europe, new car registrations in October plunged
15.5 percent to just over 1 million vehicles, dragged down by
extremely poor results for the Peugeot, Opel, Renault and Toyota
brands.  PSA Peugeot-Citroen SA, Europe's second-biggest carmaker
after Volkswagen AG in terms of European sales, said last week
it planned to cut 3,550 jobs in France.  German labour leaders at Daimler have said management
planned to reduce output of its Mercedes-Benz luxury cars by far
more than 80,000 units, cut the work week to 30 hours and offer
severance packages, after calculating it had 5,800 more staff on
its payroll than needed.  European auto makers have asked for 40 billion euros in soft
loans in state aid to weather the downturn.

723,"Nov 18, 2008 09:32AM ET","WRAPUP 2-EU eyes auto aid, but no blank cheques",nan," * Rules out ""old-style subsidies"" - source * Help may be part of wider stimulus package * EU sees link to ""greener"" cars * Merkel warns U.S. against discrimination vs Europe 
 (Adds Merkel comments on U.S. bailout) By Mark John and Crispian Balmer BRUSSELS/PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The European Union is
studying support for its ailing carmakers but the bloc's
executive was divided on Tuesday over the extent of any aid as
other sectors also face a downturn. EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen signalled support
for a German offer to help the Opel unit of stricken U.S. auto
firm General Motors, but others in Brussels insisted there could
be no special treatment for the auto industry. ""You cannot compare the car sector with the financial
sector,"" Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, referring
to the mass bail-outs by EU governments last month of key banks
in the wake of the financial crisis. EU sources said the European Commission would propose ways
of helping the auto sector in the 27-nation bloc next week as
part of a broad package of economic stimulus measures to deal
with the worst financial crisis in 70 years . But any aid would be temporary, would have to meet the
bloc's strict state-aid rules, and be closely tied to goals such
as improving the sector's environmental performance rather than
no-strings-attached support, the sources told Reuters. ""What will not happen on Wednesday (next week) is a proposal
for old-style subsidies,"" said an EU source involved in the
dossier, declining to be identified because negotiations on the
exact details of the package remained ongoing. ""Any support for the car sector would be targeted, temporary
measures linked to certain objectives, not the dishing out of
billions of old-style aid ... Ecology is certainly an important
element,"" the source said.  WRITING CHEQUES Pressure on European leaders to help industrial giants such
as Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagenand Fiat rose after U.S. Senate
Democrats on Monday proposed a $25 billion loan programme for
their U.S. rivals. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged U.S. lawmakers not to
discriminate against European auto manufacturers. ""We will observe very closely the way the United States
government acts regarding its own automobile industry, because
from the point of view of European industry we don't want the
Americans to adopt certain measures that could become a problem
for us,"" Merkel said during a joint news conference with Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at an Italo-German summit. European carmakers, a powerful lobby, have been stepping up
calls for up to 40 billion euros ($50.5 billion) of aid to
offset a fall in demand caused by a deepening recession, and
similar to the help given to banks hit by the credit crunch. Car sales have fallen dramatically as the global financial
crisis has gathered steam. Carmakers are frantically slashing
costs where possible and extending the usual plant idling over
Christmas by a few more weeks to save cash. In western Europe, new car registrations in October plunged
15.5 percent to just over 1 million vehicles, dragged down by
extremely poor results at the Peugeot, Opel, Renault and Toyota.  But many within the executive are loathe to start writing
blank cheques for the industry as it could open the floodgates
to similar requests, giving the impression that Brussels is a
one-stop shop for suffering industries. ""If your financial system is not working any more, then it
is over. That was our incentive to give medicine to its blood
circulation,"" Kroes said in Paris, explaining why the EU had
used some 2.2 trillion euros ($2.78 trillion) to prop up banks. ""The car industry won't be the last one (that runs into
difficulty), you can be sure about that, but we need to look to
the lessons of the financial institutions,"" she added. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other EU leaders agreed
in October to study support to the sector, and the Commission
last month hinted it could back the possibility of soft loans
from the EU's lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB).  STRICKEN OPEL Germany became the first country on to offer help to one of
its carmakers on Monday, offering to support Opel. But any such
would have to be approved by Brussels. The EU's Verheugen -- a German Social Democrat who has
championed the call by Europe's carmakers for soft loans -- told
German radio the Commission would have to examine any possible
guarantees. But he added: ""I'd welcome it if everything was done to
prevent an important and traditional car producer in Europe from
dropping out of the competition for reasons it's not responsible
for."" However, a second source said some in the Commission opposed
""Verheugen's carte blanche"" approach. The source said Brussels would insist that any loans, if
agreed, would depend on the industry producing ""greener"" cars,
in line with the bloc's ambitious goals to combat climate
change. A fly in the ointment of any agreement next week could be
its compatibility with World Trade Organisation rules. Brussels
has said it is scrutinising Washington's proposed support for
its car industry.

724,"Nov 10, 2008 08:10AM ET",UPDATE 1-EU's Juncker urges banks to do more to help economy,nan,"(Adds details on credit trends in France) By Tamora Vidaillet PARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - European banks have not responded
as much as leaders had hoped for when they launched measures to
support the financial system, Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker said on Monday. Governments across the world have raced to shore up their
banking systems in the face of the global financial crisis in
recent weeks by taking measures including injecting capital into
troubled banks or offering credit guarantees. Speaking to France Inter radio, Juncker said that although
banks were taking some steps to resume activities, they needed
to do more to help the real economy. ""The banks have an enormous responsibility; they are
reacting, yes, but they are not reacting with the drive that we
were imagining when we had the support plans,"" said Juncker, who
is prime minister of Luxembourg as well as heading the group of
European finance ministers. ""The banks need to know that they are holding the health of
the real economy in their hands. If they don't show more drive
it would perhaps be necessary to revisit a certain number of
plans which we have put in place,"" he said, without elaborating. A survey last week from the Bank of France suggested that
credit conditions had tightened for companies despite a 360
billion euro ($464 billion) bank rescue package unveiled by
France last month.. More than 75 percent of French banks had sharpened lending
criteria between July and September, hitting small and
medium-sized companies more than large firms, according to the
survey from the French central bank. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has warned lenders
that the government could take direct stakes in banks that had
benefitted from public bailout packages but refused to open the
lending taps to companies. The Bank of France survey, conducted between Oct. 7 and 14,
suggested that banks may have to work harder given that over two
thirds of the banks polled intended to tighten their credit
allocation criteria in the final three months of the year. The banks also predicted slightly tighter credit conditions
for consumer loans at the end of the year, an area Juncker said
needed to be addressed. ""It is necessary to do everything to put an end to this
shrinkage in credit,"" he said. Juncker said the struggling automobile sector, a blackspot
given temporary plant closures by the likes of France's Renault
 and Peugeot, merited particular attention. ""We must examine very attentively the auto situation, we
cannot not see what the Americans are doing, we cannot accept a
situation in which the European auto sector disappears from the
global scene,"" he said. U.S. President-elect Barack Obama said on Friday that
federal help for the distressed auto industry was a ""high
priority"" of his transition.
