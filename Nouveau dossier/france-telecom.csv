The San Francisco-based startup said it will use the funding to expand, secure more partners and develop new technologies.PayJoy enables consumers with no bank accounts or formal credit history to purchase smartphones on installment payments and get cash loans. It does so by turning the smartphone into collateral through software that locks the phone when payments have not been made.It believes that making smartphones more affordable can be a stepping stone toward increasing financial inclusion since more financial services are now being provided digitally.""We're building technology to help people carve a path into the financial system,"" Mark Heynen, the company's co-founder and chief business officer, said in an interview.Globally, 1.7 billion adults do not have a bank account, but two-thirds of them own a mobile phone which could help them access financial services, the World Bank said in a 2018 report.Josh McFarland, a partner at Greylock, said he believes PayJoy's technology and distribution network could help emerging markets unlock some of their economic growth.""Credit is a major piece of the infrastructure needed to help the global middle class better their quality of life,"" McFarland said.PayJoy, which employs around 90 people globally, operates in more than 10 countries including Mexico, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya and Guatemala. In most markets the startup does not provide financing itself, but partners with retailers and credit providers. Partners include  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), Vodacom and Orange SA (PA:ORAN).It is launching in six more countries through new partnerships with local companies, Heynen said. These include Mutual in Brazil, Waynimovil in Argentina, MyBucks in South Africa, Panacredito in the Dominican Republic, Omnipagos in Honduras and COINFIN in Colombia.PayJoy's technology does not make underwriting reliant on traditional credit scores, but seeks to increase consumers' willingness to pay by taking advantage of their desire to access the phone, which in turn can help keep default rates in check, Heynen said. He declined to disclose default rates.""Customers like it because it makes the phone pay-as-you-go,"" Heynen said. ""In some cases, if they decide they can't pay, they can send in the phone and have their contract canceled."""

6,"Mar 10, 2019 08:40PM ET",Tycoon Tapie goes on trial in long-running French business saga,nan,"By Emmanuel JarryPARIS (Reuters) - The tycoon at the center of a decades-old French legal battle that has dragged politicians and business leaders in its wake goes on trial on Monday accused of fraud. Bernard Tapie, the larger-than-life businessman and one-time chairman of Olympique Marseille football club, is embroiled in a fight over a fraught 1993 corporate deal and the compensation he won from the state 15 years later. The case has already been through the civil courts and prompted a 2016 trial of Christine Lagarde, now head of the International Monetary Fund but at the time finance minister, for her role in the saga. She was convicted of negligence but escaped fines or jail time. Six people will now be tried in a criminal court, including Tapie, 76, and Stephane Richard, the chief executive of telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN), who is accused of being complicit in the disputed state payment. Richard was Lagarde's chief of staff in 2008.The complex case harks back to when Credit Lyonnais bank bought Tapie's stake in the then-struggling sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGN) 26 years ago.The bank, which was government owned at the time, later sold its stake on for a much higher price, leading the businessman to accuse it of defrauding him. Tapie was awarded a 403 million euro ($453 million) state-funded payout as part of a 2008 settlement approved by Lagarde. But litigation continued and he was ordered by a French court to return the funds in 2015, with the ruling confirmed by other judges in 2017.The businessman, who is suffering from cancer, is also being tried for misusing public funds. He told France's JDD newspaper that he was stopping any form of treatment for his illness so he could stay lucid during the trial.""This trial is one of the most important moments of my life,"" Tapie said. ""What matters to me is that we establish, resoundingly, that I was not the crook.""Richard, who is accused of hiding some aspects of the compensation deal from Lagarde, denies any wrongdoing. ""He is looking forward to being able to explain himself in public and demonstrate that the allegations against him are baseless,"" his lawyer Jean-Etienne Giamarchi said. The French government, which has a 23 percent stake in Orange, has said Richard will have to step down if he is convicted. The trial is due to last until April 5. The accused face potential maximum prison sentences of five to seven years, and fines of up to 375,000 euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims, but the allegations have led several Western countries to restrict Huawei's access to their markets.Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the Polish security services, said the country's Internal Security Agency (ISA) detained a Chinese citizen and a former Polish security official on Jan. 8 over spying allegations. The two men have heard charges and will be held for three months, he said.""This matter has to do with his actions, it doesn’t have anything to do with the company he works for,"" Zaryn said of the Chinese man.A person with knowledge of the matter said a Huawei employee called Wang Weijing had been arrested but not charged. A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for Wang showed he has worked for Huawei's Polish division since 2011 and previously served as attache to the Chinese General Consul in Gdansk from 2006-2011. Wang did not immediately respond to a request for comment via the social media site. Polish public TV channel TVP said the Polish man was a former ISA officer and that security services had searched the offices of his current employer, telecoms firm Orange Polska (WA:OPL) (PA:ORAN). Huawei's local offices were also searched, TVP reported. China's foreign ministry said it was ""greatly concerned"" by the reports, and urged Poland to handle the case ""justly.""Huawei said in a statement it was aware of the situation but had no immediate comment.""Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, and we require every employee to abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they are based,"" it said. Orange Polska said in a statement security services had on Tuesday gathered materials related to an employee, whom it did not identify. The company said it did not know if the investigation was linked to the employee's professional work, and that it would continue to cooperate with the authorities.HEIGHTENED SCRUTINYHuawei has come under intense scrutiny in recent months as countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan have followed U.S. moves against the company, citing security concerns.Canadian authorities in December also arrested Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou at the behest of U.S. authorities as part of an investigation into alleged violations of U.S. trade sanctions, raising tensions with China at a time when Washington and Beijing are engaged in a broader trade war.The West's security concerns surrounding Huawei, and fellow Chinese telecoms equipment firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), center around China’s National Intelligence Law. Approved in 2017, the law states that Chinese ""organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.""This has sparked fears Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate ""backdoors"" into their equipment that would allow Beijing access, for spying or sabotage purposes. Some experts also see a risk that Chinese intelligence may develop an ability to subvert Huawei's equipment.Ewan Lawson, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the arrests in Poland could bolster Western concerns.""It does point at the sort of connections that may exist between the state intelligence enterprise and private Chinese companies,"" he said. The European Commission is aware of the reports of the arrests and will reach out to the Polish authorities for further information, spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters in Brussels.Norway said on Wednesday it was considering whether to join other Western nations in excluding Huawei from building part of the country's new 5G telecoms network.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Dec 21, 2018 02:20PM ET","Huawei's Rapid Growth, Alleged Theft Helped Sow Mistrust in U.S.",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. wanted a better way to test its telephone handsets, so it sent an engineer to see “Tappy,” the robot in partner company T-Mobile US Inc.’s laboratory in Bellevue, Washington.“Tappy,” computer-driven and tireless, taps on touch screens, simulating weeks of use in a day. The Huawei engineer was curious about Tappy’s fingertips. So he slipped one into a laptop bag and left with it, in an act T-Mobile branded theft.The 2013 incident, described in a lawsuit filed the next year by T-Mobile, is the sort of alleged behavior by China’s top telecommunications equipment maker that has alarmed security experts. Now some are warning against the use of Huawei gear in the next-generation 5G network being assembled to connect factories, vehicles, homes, utility grids and more.“They’ve surpassed everyone else, and the way they’ve done that is through copycat technology and ruthlessly stealing intellectual property from Western companies,” said Jeff Ferry, an economist with Coalition for a Prosperous America, an advocacy group close to the Trump administration and its China hawks.Representatives of Huawei’s Chinese headquarters referred calls to Chase Skinner, a San Francisco-based Huawei spokesman, who declined to comment. Huawei has regularly denied that it steals intellectual property or unfairly copies technology from other companies. It said this week that blacklisting its equipment without proof will hurt the industry and disrupt the development of new high-speed technology.But Huawei’s conduct is drawing renewed scrutiny after the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on allegations she defrauded banks to violate Iranian sanctions. The daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, she now faces extradition to the U.S. in a case that’s sparked a diplomatic row.Meng’s arrest follows a long string of allegations by the U.S. government about a potential threat to network security. The U.S. has pushed European governments to avoid Huawei’s gear, saying it’s an enabler for Chinese espionage, which the company has always denied.In 2012, the House Intelligence Committee published a report that described Huawei as “a company that has not followed United States legal obligations or international standards of business behavior.” The committee called on the U.S. intelligence community to “remain vigilant,” and said national security officials must block acquisitions involving Huawei or fellow Chinese gear maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763).Years earlier, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Corp. sued to stop Huawei from selling data-traffic switches and routers allegedly based on Cisco’s patents and copyrights. The litigation ended with Huawei agreeing to stop selling disputed products in 2003.In 2010, the company failed to reach agreements to buy U.S. software and wireless-gear makers, reportedly because the sellers doubted the company would win approval. In 2008, Huawei and Bain Capital Partners LLC abandoned a bid for gear maker 3Com Corp. after failing to assuage security concerns raised by U.S. officials.The Tappy caper involved a machine that used its mechanical arm to repeatedly poke and prod phone screens, in imitation of a human user, helping T-Mobile to improve the reliability of its handsets. Huawei wanted to know the size of the finger and the material out of which the conductive tip was made, T-Mobile told a federal court in Seattle.The Huawei engineer, left alone in the lab, first slipped the fingertip behind a computer monitor then three hours later tucked it into his bag, T-Mobile told the court.“There is some truth to the complaint,” Huawei spokesman William Plummer said at the time. He blamed “employees acting inappropriately in their zeal.” (Another worker had furtively taken photos of Tappy, according to T-Mobile.)T-Mobile dropped Huawei as a supplier and in 2017 a jury awarded the American company $4.8 million in damages for breach of contract but rejected allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets. The two sides later agreed to drop the case after settlement talks. Michael Kipling, an attorney in the case for T-Mobile, declined to comment and attorney Bo Yue, for Huawei, didn’t respond to a request for comment.The largest U.S. mobile providers, after urging by U.S. officials, have shunned Huawei network gear, and small providers are concerned they may be forced to rip out and replace Huawei products as the Federal Communications Commission moves against Huawei.U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies harbor a deep suspicion of Huawei, exacerbated by its ties to China’s People Liberation Army, said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington.“Deep connections with the PLA, industrial espionage, and subsidies from the Chinese government -- there you have it,” Lewis said in an interview.Customer TrustA company executive reiterated this week that it abides by international law, and challenged its accusers to produce evidence of their claims about security risks.“Despite the efforts to create fear about Huawei and to use politics to interfere with industry growth, we’re proud to say that our customers continue to trust us,” Ken Hu, one of several Huawei rotating chairmen, told reporters during a press event at its manufacturing base in Dongguan, the company’s largest campus worldwide.Hu slammed U.S. accusations about Huawei’s independence and alleged role in espionage.“Lots of countries have various concerns on 5G. Most of these concerns are reasonable and based on technology,” Hu said. “With regard to such concerns, we’ll work with governments and operators to clear them up.”The company also released a diary entry it said Meng wrote, which described an outpouring of support from around the world. It was entitled “There Is Always Good in People!” and explained how a letter writer from Japan said she was “very sad” for Meng’s arrest in Canada and “cannot keep silent any longer.”Ren, Huawei’s founder, joined the People Liberation Army’s engineering corps in 1974 and rose to become a deputy director, but without military rank, according to a biography by the company. Ren established Huawei in 1987; now the company reports annual sales of about 600 billion yuan, or $93 billion.House ReportThe 2012 House report noted that the ruling Chinese Communist Party maintains a committee within Huawei, and said the company failed to explain its relation to the government. Huawei has said the government plays no role in its business decisions or staffing.But the company is working against hardened sentiment in the Trump administration, Lewis said. “The government in general has decided that the Chinese will never stop misbehaving unless we push back,” Lewis said.Meng’s case exists alongside a shadow cast by Huawei’s reputation, said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology studies at the Eurasia Group consultancy and who regards the matters as linked.“It’s definitely connected to the broad concerns about Huawei and its central role in 5G,” Triolo said. “The fear of the U.S. and its allies is that a 5G network built by Huawei represents a risk, a security risk.”Vulnerability is heightened because 5G systems will rely on software that can be penetrated to a greater extent than 4G networks, and because so many machine-to-machine connections will rely on 5G, raising the stakes for a disruption or espionage, Triolo said.In Europe, carriers and major customers from Orange SA (PA:ORAN) to BT Group (LON:BT) Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) have voiced their concerns about Huawei’s gear, on top of existing bans in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.The U.S. Embassy in Germany said allies and partners are being urged to be vigilant in ensuring network security, including when carriers award equipment contracts.(Updates with comments from Hu in 20th paragraph.)"
15,"Dec 14, 2018 10:56AM ET",Deutsche Telekom reviews Huawei ties; Orange says no on 5G,nan,"By Douglas Busvine and Gwénaëlle BarzicFRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Huawei [HWT.UL] faces fresh challenges in Europe after Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) announced it would review its vendor strategy and Orange (PA:ORAN) said it would not hire the Chinese firm to build its next-generation network in France.The shift by the national market leaders, both partly state owned, follows Huawei's exclusion on national security grounds by some U.S. allies, led by Australia, from building their fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks.U.S. officials have briefed allies that Huawei is ultimately at the beck and call of the Chinese state, while warning that its network equipment may contain ""back doors"" that could open them up to cyber espionage.The Deutsche Telekom review comes as U.S. regulators scrutinize the proposed $26 billion takeover by its T-Mobile US (O:TMUS) unit of Sprint Corp (N:S), which is controlled by Japan's Softbank <9434.T>. Softbank, which is days away from listing its wireless unit in Tokyo, plans to replace its 4G network equipment from Huawei, Nikkei has reported.Huawei says the security concerns are unfounded. Tensions have been heightened by the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada for possible extradition to the United States.""We don't foresee calling on Huawei for 5G,"" Orange CEO Stephane Richard told reporters in Paris. ""We are working with our traditional partners - they are Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia.""Richard said the security concerns were legitimate: ""I absolutely understand that all of our countries, and the French authorities, are preoccupied. We are too.""Responding, Huawei said it was not a supplier to Orange's existing 4G network in France and would not feature in the company's 5G plans in France. Huawei does supply Orange's networks outside France and expects to be involved in 5G there, it said.U.S. EXPOSUREDeutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecoms company, said it was reviewing its vendor plans in Germany and the other European markets where it operates, given the debate on the security of Chinese network gear.""Deutsche Telekom takes the global discussion about the security of network equipment from Chinese vendors very seriously,"" the company said in response to a Reuters query.Telekom already pursues a multi-vendor strategy, relying above all on equipment from Ericsson (ST:ERICb), Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Cisco (O:CSCO) and Huawei. ""Nevertheless we are reassessing our procurement strategy,"" it said.The shift is significant because, German officials have said they see no legal basis to exclude any vendors from the buildout of fifth-generation networks in response to the warnings from Washington.Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, in an interview with Reuters on Friday, confirmed that stance when asked about the prospect of Huawei building 5G networks in Germany.""There are no concerns about individual companies,"" Altmaier said in Berlin. ""But each product, each device must be secure if it is going to be used in Germany.""Nearly half of the German company's revenues come, however, from its fast-growing U.S. unit T-Mobile which is hoping to win U.S. approval to take over Sprint in a deal that would create a close challenger to leading duo Verizon (N:VZ) and AT&T (N:T).A source at one competitor said: ""This looks like an appeasement strategy towards the U.S. government over the Sprint deal.""Other German telecoms players say, meanwhile, that they are continuing talks with Chinese vendors as they draw up proposals to take part in Germany's auction of 5G licenses in early 2019.""We are watching the discussion very closely, but we will not participate in the current speculation,"" said  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn), Germany's No.3 operator that has existing relationships with Huawei and ZTE (SZ:000063), another Chinese vendor. United Internet  (DE:UTDI), a potential new entrant that is weighing bidding for a 5G license, said it was in talks with two vendors on its strategy - one of which is Chinese. A spokesman declined to identify the vendor but according to media reports it is ZTE.Analysts say German telecoms operators depend heavily on Huawei, meaning it will be hard to rip out and replace its existing gear or to cope without the Chinese company, the world's top network supplier, in building their 5G networks.""If the Chinese companies are excluded, this would reduce the number of vendors – and that could drive costs higher,” said Hans Schotten of the Technical University in Kaiserslautern. ""For that reason, many operators would be reluctant to do without Huawei.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Sep 21, 2018 09:10AM ET",France's Orange Bank sued over 439 million euros lost in Madoff collapse,nan,"By Inti LandauroPARIS (Reuters) - A French woman and her daughter are bringing a law suit against Orange Bank to try to recover some of the 439 million euros ($516 million) they say they lost in the collapse of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme a decade ago.Laurence Apfelbaum and her daughter Emilie allege that Banque Finama advised them in 1999 to work directly with Madoff's investment funds, where they had already placed money via Finama, when Finama was itself withdrawing assets from the scheme because of doubts about Madoff's credibility.Finama, which was later renamed Groupama Banque, was acquired by French telecoms operator Orange (PA:ORAN) in 2016 and turned into Orange Bank, a mobile banking business.A civil court in Bobigny, north of Paris, will begin proceedings on the case on Oct. 2. Orange Bank will contest the claim.The case underscores how the ripples from Madoff's $60 billion scheme, one of the biggest financial frauds in history, can still be felt in the financial system 10 years on.Madoff pleaded guilty to federal crimes including securities and investment fraud in 2009. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $170 billion. Nicolas Lecoq-Vallon, a lawyer representing the Apfelbaums, says they would have withdrawn their funds from Madoff's scheme in 1999 if Finama had shared its suspicions with them.Instead, he said Finama shut the Apfelbaums' accounts and told them to deal one-to-one with Madoff. ""The bank advised my clients to deal directly with Madoff's firm when it had to -- at the very least -- warn them and share the doubts it had about the legitimacy of the scheme,"" he told Reuters.At around the same time in 1999, Finama withdrew about 100 million euros that it had invested with Madoff, Lecoq-Vallon said, citing comments made by Bernard Pouy, who was the bank's chief executive at the time.Pouy, who was quoted in interviews in 2009 saying Finama withdrew its funds after concluding that Madoff's scheme was suspect, didn't return calls seeking comment.ORANGE PLAYS DOWN THREATOrange said it was aware of the Apfelbaum case when it bought a controlling stake in Groupama Banque and that it had taken necessary steps to mitigate the risks. ""The necessary measures were taken by the Orange Group to protect itself against this liability,"" a spokesman said, without elaborating on the measures taken.Bernard Vatier, a lawyer for Orange Bank, said the Apfelbaums' claim ""rests on lies and inaccuracies"" and reiterated that the bank faced no risk from the lawsuit.He said late financier Albert Igoin, Laurence Apfelbaum's father and Emilie's grandfather, who bequeathed them the wealth after making his fortune in banking, knew Madoff personally and decided on his own accord to invest with him in 1980. Finama cannot be held responsible for the family's decision to invest with Madoff, Vatier said, adding that the bank had dropped the Apfelbaums as clients because it didn't want to retain customers who had dealt directly with Madoff.But Lecoq-Vallon said Finama had a duty to share any information it had about Madoff with its clients, even more so because at that point Igoin was long deceased and his heirs didn't have his knowledge of financial markets.Lecoq-Vallon's clients are seeking to reclaim 303 million euros they say were held in Madoff accounts as of Dec. 11, 2008, when the firm collapsed. Over the 30 years they were dealing with Madoff, they say they withdrew about 129 million euros to pay taxes on profits that turned out to be fictitious. They are seeking those funds back too.As a result of the withdrawals they made, the Apfelbaums were sought out by Irving Picard, a trustee charged with tracking down any remaining assets from Madoff's scheme in order to recoup funds on behalf of others who were defrauded, Lecoq-Vallon said.In a separate case resolved last year, the two women agreed to pay about 7 million euros to Picard to settle his claims. They are seeking that payment back via the suit, too.They have pledged to hand over 35 percent of whatever they might get from Orange Bank to the Madoff recovery funds.($1 = 0.8503 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

26,"Sep 19, 2018 12:50PM ET",Exclusive: Orange Bank's CEO Coisne to resign in next few weeks - sources,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - The boss of telecom group Orange's (PA:ORAN) online bank will resign in the next few weeks, three sources close to the matter told Reuters, underscoring operational challenges at the lender less than a year after its launch.Andre Coisne had been hired to run and develop Orange Bank, which was formed after Orange acquired a majority stake in Groupama Banque in 2016. He had previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.The nomination in May this year of a new group head for mobile financial services at Orange Bank, Paul de Leusse, precipitated Coisne's departure, as a new management structure is being prepared at the banking unit, two of the sources said.Orange's Chief Executive Stephane Richard has championed the new division as a key driver for growth and a new way to attract customers as a price war continues to rage in France's telecoms market. Orange has set a goal to get two million bank customers within 10 years, or a quarter of France's online banking sector. But the group has declined to update the markets on its progress since February, when it said the service had a total of 100,000 clients. ""Paul de Leusse came in with his team, perhaps Andre Coisne felt excluded from this new organization,"" one of the sources said. ""The operational integration hasn't been done yet. The culture clash between Groupama and Orange hadn't been anticipated,"" another source said. De Leusse, a former chief financial officer at Credit Agricole's investment bank, is set to have broad authority over Orange Bank, with the aim of developing the service internationally, two of the sources said. Orange Bank is only present in France and offers customers services that include instant mobile payment, free debit card, current and savings accounts as well as consumer loans.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

32,"Jul 07, 2018 11:07AM ET","Orange says open to French telecom tie-up talks, not an instigator",nan,"By Pascale Denis and Sarah WhiteAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - French telecoms firms Orange (PA:ORAN) is open to discussing potential tie-ups with other operators in its home market but is not likely to be the instigator of consolidation in the sector, financial chief Ramon Fernandez said. An aggressive price war between French telecoms companies has revived expectations in recent months that the sector, dominated by Orange,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD) was ripe for consolidation.Fernandez said in an interview with Reuters that Orange was in a strong position and could afford to see how other maneuvers in the sector played out. ""There is no urgency for us for this scenario of consolidation to materialize,"" Fernandez said on the sidelines of an economic conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. ""Our position is to say that the door is always open to potential discussions,"" he said, adding, however, that it was improbable that Orange would try to trigger those talks. A previous bid by Orange to buy Bouygues Telecom and forge a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed in 2016. It was complicated in part by a stand-off between the French government - which has a 23 percent stake in Orange - and billionaire Martin Bouygues over the clout the billionaire, and head of the Bouygues, would have gained in the merged group, according to sources at the time. ""The previous scenario under which Orange was in the driving seat is very, very unlikely (to repeat itself),"" Fernandez said. ""That said, there's always room in a car for several passengers, so we'll have to see if at some stage we should take one of those seats.""Other French operators have signaled they could make a move. Altice Europe's French unit SFR was approached last month by Bouygues, two sources close to the matter have told Reuters, confirming earlier reports by French newspaper Le Monde. Orange's Fernandez said that consolidation would have to happen at some point, across Europe as well as in France. ""In France there's no room for four operators ... This is an industry that needs a lot of capital, you need to invest a lot to roll out next generation networks,"" he said, adding that powerful competition from the United States and Asia was also a factor.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Lombard, a former human resources head and a deputy CEO were placed under court supervision until trial.""As it has always said, Orange rejects the accusations and will make its case during the public hearing which will be scheduled in the coming months,"" an Orange spokesman said.Jean Veil, Lombard's lawyer, said the move was ""absurd"".The crime of ""moral harassment"" can be punished with two years in prison and 30,000 euros ($35,000) in fines.France Telecom, which has since become Orange, was hit by a wave of employee suicides beginning in 2008 that took the lives of over 30 workers in two years, including a man who stabbed himself in the stomach during a staff meeting and a woman who threw herself out of a window.Blamed on workplace stress, the suicides continued in 2010, taking the lives of five workers in 10 days in one particularly difficult period.A 2010 report by labor inspectors said management used ""pathogenic"" restructuring methods such as forcing people into new jobs and giving unattainable performance objectives.Lombard, who denied any wrongdoing during an investigation of the suicides, stepped down as CEO of Orange in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis.""This must serve as an example so that management never again uses social violence to get people to leave,"" said the head of the CFE-CGC union at Orange, Sebastien Crozier.The restructuring plan aimed to reduce France Telecom's headcount by 22,000 while shifting 10,000 people into new jobs and recruiting 6,000 new employees.All but two of the accused executives are now retired.A lawyer for the CFE-CGC union said that the trial was not expected before the second half of 2019.($1 = 0.8615 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"May 17, 2018 07:30AM ET",Blood but not much treasure: Vivendi's European media crusade,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Pamela BarbagliaMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - French tycoon Vincent Bollore's stated goal to create a southern European media empire faces defeat in Italy, despite pumping 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) into his biggest foreign conquest, raising questions over whether the strategy ever existed.Three years into the venture, the billionaire's media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) appears to have made more enemies than allies, estranging the Italian government and falling out with Silvio Berlusconi, the influential former prime minister and media magnate. Vivendi also fought a losing battle this month with minority investors for boardroom control of  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT), the business it hoped would form a key platform for distributing music, video and gaming content. ""I never believed in this pan-European empire story,"" a top-30 Vivendi investor told Reuters, saying the idea of cross-border synergies between media and telecoms companies was hard to follow.""It's a pure financial investment: Bollore sees an opportunity and tries to catch it; and then he's telling a story that nobody really believes ... he's been doing this his whole career, for decades."" Vivendi insists strong European players are needed to not ""be swallowed"" by the big U.S. media giants. ""If not, we are doomed,"" CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine said at a recent event. But Vivendi's failure to build a European powerhouse highlights the political challenges of stitching together national media assets, especially when the buyer limits itself to minority stakes without full control. Ironically, big U.S. firms like Comcast (O:CMCSA), Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and video-streaming giant Netflix (O:NFLX) are closer to building European heavyweights, eclipsing Vivendi either with outright acquisitions or by using online platforms and vast content resources to extend their reach.When it first became a TIM shareholder back in 2015, Vivendi said the phone group was a stepping stone to expanding in a market with significant growth prospects and strong appetite for quality content. It chose Italy, saying the country shared its cultural roots and would help create Latin content to complement that of its Anglo-Saxon rivals. 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' But its aggressive stakebuilding at TIM and Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS) has ruffled feathers and strategic alliances remain elusive. The stocks never took off and the two investments carry a 1.3 billion euro loss on Vivendi's books.""The plan to create a southern European media and telecoms giant is buried,"" Mainfirst analyst Jean-Baptiste Sergeant said. Italy's industry minister said Vivendi had been an ""awful"" investor. Rome eventually stepped in to loosen Vivendi's grip and even backed activist fund Elliott in its boardroom coup.""For Vivendi, Italy has become mission impossible,"" a banking source close to TIM said. ""There is no quick fix ... in one word they're stuck.""Vivendi received a stake in TIM when it sold off Brazilian operator GVT to  Telefonica  (MC:TEF). Bollore, already a long-term shareholder in investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), ""felt very comfortable in Italy"", one source close to the matter said. ""He saw an opportunity and the stock was very cheap so he bought more,"" the person said. ""Originally this was a pure financial investment.""Less than a year later Vivendi agreed to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit Premium, fuelling speculation of a future three-way alliance including TIM.The deal also involved Vivendi and Mediaset - controlled by Berlusconi's family - taking a stake in each other, thus cementing the ties between Bollore and the politician. But the deal turned sour when Vivendi backtracked from the acquisition, calling Premium's business plan unrealistic.The two sides have been embroiled in a legal spat since, only aggravated by Vivendi buying more shares to become Mediaset's second-largest shareholder after the Berlusconis.Vivendi keeps reiterating it is a long-term industrial investor in TIM. It repeatedly shot down speculation it could sell its stake on to French telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN). Any deal to sell the TIM stake to a rival looks unlikely, with its planned turnaround only at the start, and Bollore not in a position to negotiate a deal after facing graft allegations over his work in Africa, sources familiar with the matter said. ""Bollore has lost his credibility and he would not be in a position to sit down in front of government representatives and soothe concerns,"" the banking source added. Bollore strongly denies the allegations.A full takeover of either TIM or Mediaset is also out of the question, with Vivendi lacking the cash to pull it off. A plan to create a content joint venture between TIM and Vivendi's pay-TV unit Canal+ was put on hold after opposition from some TIM board directors. TIM clinched a content deal with Mediaset instead, while a separate deal between the broadcaster and Sky (L:SKYB) signed in April isolated Vivendi further.A chance to distribute pay-TV content over TIM's fiber optic network is also at risk if U.S. hedge fund Elliott has its way and the infrastructure is spun off and TIM loses control.To view a graphic on Vivendi and its Italian investments, click: https://reut.rs/2wOtcnvTRACK RECORD Yet despite the setbacks, Vivendi has no wish to exit Italy. Bollore brushed off any criticism over Italy, saying ""we don't count the chickens until they're hatched"".Many investors bet on Vivendi because of its UMG music label and what a potential listing could bring.They see the Italy venture as a distraction, although they also trust that Bollore would exit at a profit, as happened when Vivendi sold its share of gaming group  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP). ""He's playing Monopoly with the money available at Vivendi. You can decide not to play along, but our interests are aligned, his track record is not bad,"" the first investor said. Most investors expect Vivendi to sell out once TIM's and Mediaset's shares recover, although the size of the investments - it owns 24 percent of TIM and nearly 30 percent of Mediaset - makes finding a buyer difficult. Despite a recent rally, TIM's share price still trades 30 percent below the average price at which Vivendi entered. ""Bollore is pragmatic and rarely sticks around at companies he cannot control,"" another Vivendi investor said, but added the industrialist never committed to a single plan. ""It's hard to underestimate Bollore because historically he pulls out rabbits out of the hat,"" he added. Still, looking at Italy, it's hard to imagine how the 66-year-old can turn the tables in his favor. Marina Berlusconi, Silvio's eldest daughter, said Bollore and Vivendi had ""behaved with the delicacy and composure of Attila"" when they entered Italy.But unlike the king of the Huns, they did not conquer an empire, and their strategy was ""so well disguised that it makes you wonder if there is a strategy at all"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

45,"Mar 13, 2018 06:01AM ET",E.ON leads European shares higher as investors await U.S. inflation data,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher in muted trading on Tuesday as investors awaited the latest inflation figures from the United States, while results drove big moves in  Iliad  (PA:ILD) and E.ON . French telecoms company Iliad fell 6 percent even as it reported higher annual sales and profits for 2017, with traders pointing to flat fixed-line revenues in the final quarter.It comes as Orange (PA:ORAN), Iliad rival and dominant French telecoms company, returned to growth last year for the first time since 2009 after spending heavily to roll out high-speed broadband. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.2 percent, with utilities a top-performing sector for a second day on plans by German utilities RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn) to divide up the assets of power utility Innogy (DE:IGY). E.ON (DE:EONGn) got a further boost to the top of the STOXX 600 on Tuesday, its shares gaining 4.4 percent after its results. The company said it would raise its dividends for 2018 and 2019.M&A deals have multiplied in the European market recently, but investors said dealmaking was not at feverpitch.""One thing I am very pleased not to see is the over-arching cross-industry deals which marked the apex of ambition in the early noughties,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.""That sort of reckless expansion and combination seems to be missing from the data, which suggests there is room for further growth,"" he added.Other notable gainers included Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia (ST:INTRUM) rose 6.2 percent to the top of the STOXX, with traders pointing to a note from SEB upgrading the stock to 'hold' from 'sell'. Traders said the strong price gains on the note were likely down to investors covering short positions on the stock which is down 10 percent so far this year.Oil stocks were also strong boosts.  Total  (PA:TOTF) gained 1.4 percent after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded its rating on it, saying the French oil major is entering a new phase of growth in cashflow and production.Struggling South African retailer Steinhoff (J:SRRJ) saw its Germany-listed shares rise 2.9 percent after it cut its stake in KAP Industrial (J:KAPJ) as it tried to plug a liquidity gap. A weaker full-year outlook sent chemicals group  Wacker Chemie  (DE:WCHG) down 4.1 percent. The firm said sales would slow due to currency pressures.Veolia (PA:VIE) fell 2.4 percent, the top faller on France's CAC 40, after the Qatari government sold its 4.6 percent stake in the utility group.Overall European company results have been encouraging. Investors said European earnings had further room to grow as they were still lagging the U.S..""The European market isn't pricing in quite as much as the U.S. is, and it's in a more favourable part of the business cycle,"" said Rothschild's Gardiner. ""We are aware that it's a pretty crowded story, but we still think it's very attractive,"" he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

46,"Feb 26, 2018 10:11AM ET",Plenty of smoke in European telecoms M&A but little fire,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Pamela BarbagliaBARCELONA/LONDON (Reuters) - The prospects of seeing a handful of telecoms giants take control of the European market as in China and the United States look remote as hopes for a new wave of large cross-border deals quickly run into cold reality.Vodafone's (L:VOD) talks with Liberty Global (O:LBTYA) about buying some of the cable company's assets and a $6.7 billion bid led by Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure (N:MIC) for Danish telecoms company  TDC  (CO:TDC) have rekindled expectations for further mergers.However, none of them look set to transform Europe's telecoms landscape -- a collection of national markets with typically three to four operators in each.Tough anti-trust rules, wariness over politically-charged mergers involving former monopolies such as Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), France's Orange (PA:ORAN),  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) or Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and the investments needed to upgrade networks limit the appeal of the sector. ""There is no catalyst for a mega-deal, investors don't see the synergies and see very well the integration risks of two traditional operators,"" said a senior French telecoms banker.""The conditions are not yet met for these complicated deals to happen,"" he added. Orange's boss Stephane Richard dampened the idea that Europe's fourth-biggest telecoms operator could tie-up with bigger rival Deutsche Telekom last week after a source confirmed in January that merger talks between the two fizzled last year.""There is no hidden project. There is no hidden negotiation with anybody, neither with the Germans nor… with anybody else,"" he said. ""There is no project today that make sense in terms of value creation, in terms of political feasibility, in terms of equity story for us,"" he added.LOW SPENDING Several analysts and industry executives have long lamented the state of play in Europe, insisting the current fragmentation shrunk revenues for companies in a context of rising demand for data usage by consumers.Europe's average revenue per user (ARPU), a key indicator used within the industry, represents a third of that in the United States and half of Japanese levels.""You need more consolidation in Europe, you need less regulation in Europe, you need higher data usage that gets monetized in Europe,"" said Rajeev Suri, the chief executive of Nokia (HE:NOKIA) , one of the world's top telecoms equipment makers, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Suri cited the relatively low European ARPU as a key factor that will explain the slow adoption of the next generation of mobile internet technology, or 5G.A champion of competition within national markets and low prices for consumers, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager would disagree.Ever since she expressed concerns about a proposed merger of Telenor and TeliaSonera in Denmark in 2015 – leading to its collapse, Europe has not seen any big move on the M&A side. The total value of deals in the European telecoms sector at large, including the debt of targets, halved over the last two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shares of Europe's benchmark telecoms stock index fell 17 percent (SXKP) over the same period, underperforming the broader Stoxx 600 index, which rose by 16 percent. INTERNAL DEALSIn Italy, the arrival of French telecoms maverick Iliad is expected in the next few weeks, a move favored by EU regulators in the wake of the merger of CK Hutchison Holdings and Veon's Italian businesses.Iliad triggered a protracted mobile price war in France and intends to grab a quarter of the market share through low-cost offers, sources have said. ""Is any consolidation really relevant when the implied costs of the remedies are higher than any benefit derived from the consolidation?” said a fund manager at a French bank with a stock-picking strategy. Still, the Vodafone-Liberty Global talks could lead to other deals within major European markets, according to several M&A bankers.If the deal goes through, it would greatly reinforce Vodafone's presence in Germany and provide Liberty with fresh cash to spend.""By selling EU assets Liberty will have options to do deals in the UK,"" a Britain-based telecoms banker said.""Selling continental Europe means they will focus on building their UK business."" Liberty controls the Virgin Media business in Britain. Markets were also surprised by the bid for TDC, which is backed by consortium that include Danish pension funds and could be an example for Altice's (AS:ATCA) struggling French unit SFR, were it to be put on sale, several bankers said.Yet cross-border transactions remain a distant prospect, for now at least. ""In a couple of years I think we will see more cross-border consolidation - and I think it would be good for this industry,"" said Marie Ehrling, the chair of the board of Nordic telecoms operator Telia (ST:TELIA).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But Orange said in a statement it was renewing Richard's mandate as a member of its board, in anticipation of renewing his position as chairman of the board.Shareholders will vote on renewing his mandate at the company's annual general meeting in May, Orange said.Richard faces charges over payments to businessman Bernard Tapie of about 400 million euros ($494 million) from public funds. The payments were made in 2008, when Richard was chief of staff to Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister. He denies any wrongdoing.Last month, Richard got the backing of French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said Richard's contract should be renewed. The French state is Orange's biggest shareholder.In December, Richard told investors that he would invest in upgrading networks rather than in content.Richard is credited with improving Orange's results in the fiercely competitive French market, where it contends with the likes of  Bouygues  Telecom (PA:BOUY), Altice (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD).France's telecoms and media industries face the challenge of dealing with contrasting demands from customers who want both fast Internet services and appealing media content.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Maury said the business generated about 900 million euros ($1.10 billion) in sales over 2017, up from 700 million euros a year earlier. He added it is expected to grow by about 10 percent annually in the coming years.Governments and companies are behind a surge in demand for services and products aimed at better protecting data and information systems, in the wake of several global cyber attacks last year.""We're only at the dawn of a world in which this kind of risk emerges, constantly evolving with increased virulence,"" Maury told reporters on Monday. ""Every additional interconnection represents a potential vulnerability,"" he added. Last December, research firm Gartner published a report which forecast that worldwide enterprise security spending would total $96.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8 percent from 2017.Thales has strengthened its range of cybersecurity products over the last few years.In 2016, it bought data protection services provider Vormetric for 375 million euros ($460 million) - a deal which Maury said had enabled Thales to win a data security contract with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), France's biggest bank.Thales, led by chief executive Patrice Caine, is also expecting its 4.8 billion-euro ($5.9 billion) takeover of digital security group  Gemalto  (AS:GTO), due to be finalised later this year, to reinforce its cybersecurity expertise further.

Lagarde is now head of the International Monetary Fund.The trial concerns six people in all, said the source, who is an official in the judiciary who declined to be identified by name, which is standard practice in France on confirmation of judicial matters.The source said Tapie and Richard faced charges of embezzlement and misuse of public funds.Tapie's defense lawyer Herve Temime told Reuters: ""I've been eager to fight this one out ... now all the cards will be on the table and we will be able to establish the truth. Not only was there no fraud but we will also see who was robbed and who did the robbing.""A spokesman at Orange said lawyers had received notice of the trial order and declined to comment further.The case dates back to when Tapie sued the state for compensation after selling his stake in Adidas to then state-owned Credit Lyonnais in 1993.He accused the bank of defrauding him after it resold its stake for a much higher price. With the case stuck in the courts, the two sides agreed to a private settlement and a 403 million euro payout to Tapie. Lagarde approved the settlement.Tapie, now seriously ill, has fought one court battle after another but has already been ordered to pay back everything he was awarded.Those rulings had prompted Tapie, the flamboyant owner of a Parisian mansion and a large yacht, to say recently that he was ""utterly ruined"". IMF chief Lagarde escaped punishment in the same affair and kept her job, despite being convicted of negligence regarding the payout.(Reporting Sophie Louet; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Luke Baker and Robin Pomeroy)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It recently said it will start operating in Britain and the United States next year.""We see the U.S. as a big opportunity because digital banking is underdeveloped,"" Stalf said. ""There are no clear rivals for us there.""The regulatory environment is also becoming more favorable, Stalf said. In 2018, new European Union rules will start to force banks to allow customer data to be made available to other companies if the customers agree. That will help the likes of N26 identify potential customers and offer them better deals than their current lenders.Stalf said that within three years N26 expects to have a 5 to 10 percent share of the market in the main countries where it operates.N26 offers a free current account, its ""anchor product"", but makes most of its money through card usage, savings, credit and insurance services.The company made its name taking on traditional banks but came under scrutiny itself last year after a security researcher found that its apps exposed users to potential account hijacking. N26 then implemented fixes to prevent such problems.Stalf said the main advantages of being an app are having daily interactions with customers and as a result being able to better understand their needs and offer tailor-made, value-added services.""If I happen to book a trip and hire a car with my N26 card, my app would instantly use that information to offer me travel and car insurance.""With marketing costs of 5 to 10 million euros per year - far lower than those of traditional banks - and customer data gathered via payments, N26 has been able to either make a profit or break even from each newly acquired customer.Stalf said that excluding marketing costs, the company could be profitable in about a year.Acquiring a banking license has also helped keep costs down, and the company is now betting that word-of-mouth and good Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Store ratings will help it contain its marketing costs and help it move along the path to profitability.""Today you can create a trusted brand much faster because everything is more transparent,"" said the 32-year-old Vienna-born entrepreneur.(In the first paragraph, company corrects to say .. retail customers aged 18 to 35 ..not.. all retail customers)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

57,"Oct 31, 2017 12:26PM ET",Exclusive - Orange is the new bank? Telecoms giant ventures into lending,nan,"By Maya Nikolaeva, Sophie Sassard and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Telecoms giant Orange (PA:ORAN) launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25 percent of France's online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal share from established lenders with inferior technology. The launch is part of a push by the French firm to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector. It is also a test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank. ""We are targeting 2 million clients in ten years. That would represent 25 percent of the (online banking) market, but I hope we will not stop there ... and we will be the market leader in several years,"" Andre Coisne, chief executive of Orange Bank, told Reuters in an interview.Coisne has previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.Orange is starting from a small base - Coisne says it has 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch, a tiny fraction of the company's 21 million mobile clients. But the timing of its entry gives some room for optimism. In France, 793.4 million online banking e-payments were made last year according to the European Central Bank, up from 586.2 million in 2014. Consultancy Ernst & Young predicts the number of customers going online to open an account in France will surge nearly six-fold to 17 million in the next ten years. The regulatory environment is also becoming more favorable - next year new European Union rules will start to force banks to allow customer data to be made available to other companies, if the customers agree. That will help the likes of Orange to identify potential customers and offer them better deals than their current lenders. ""This is a good start,"" said Coisne, who will also face competition from telecoms rival Altice, which launches its bank in 2019. ORANGE IS THE NEW BANKOrange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past ten years under several brands, such as Orange Money and Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.It targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.Africa is the world leader in mobile banking. Around 12 percent of adults there have a mobile money account against 2 percent globally, according to a 2014 World Bank survey.Telecoms operators have long hoped to repeat their banking success in Africa and other developing markets in advanced economies, but until now have only done so by relying on partnerships with existing banks, with little success. So far most telecoms operators have sought to retain customers by offering media content such as free access to music streaming apps like Spotify or movie streaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as well as exclusive sports broadcasts.But a minority investor in Orange told Reuters that diversification through banking could prove smarter because these services are essential and sticky.""To me, it is smarter than spending millions on sport rights that expire every two or three years"", the investor said.There is no clearly successful precedent in major Western markets, which makes Orange's move so brave, said Tom Levine, global head of telecoms practice at Allen & Overy.""I hope their ambition goes beyond retaining customers through bundles because there is a real opportunity for telcos in banking to be a platform, thanks to the trust they inspire, their strong brand, and large customer base"".Orange is betting on a wide range of services - mobile, internet, TV, videos and music, and now banking - to help generate enough revenue to offset costs on infrastructure investments.""Our ambition is to offer everything, we are a complete bank,"" Coisne said.From Nov. 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings accounts. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android wallets.Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year.BANKS COUNTER ATTACKOrange is not the only new entrant. Established banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are competing with new online low-cost banks such as N26, and retailers such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Some French banking executives have expressed concern about the entry of Orange Bank into the market and the impact on profit margins.Orange is ""potentially a very important competitor"", Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Credit Agricole, said in May.Banks are making investments to increase the appeal of their services to smartphone users, while also cutting branches to keep costs down.France's BNP Paribas upgraded its mobile app this year and hired a former marketing and digital executive at  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom to head its online Hello Bank! in France, while Credit Agricole is set to announce a new online banking offer in November.If Orange meets its target of 2 million customers in the next 6 to 10 years, it would likely be at the expense of these rival online businesses. But for Orange, banking would remain a small business relative to its overall size, says Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), CEO of telecoms consulting firm Northstream.""This would only bring a very small stream of additional revenue relative to the scale of Orange,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

The companies argued that it amounted to double taxation. The tax brought in 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) a year to France's state coffers.The AJEF group of French blue-chip companies welcomed the court's decision, saying in a statement it was a strong signal for France's attractiveness in terms of the business environment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deezer will also promote Fnac's concert ticket service.Fnac's Jukebox streaming service will be shut before the end of the first half, and Deezer will take over its subscribers.Deezer has 6.3 million subscribers who can listen to a catalog of 43 million songs for 9.99 euros a month, while the newly merged Fnac-Darty group had 664 stores worldwide, including 455 in France, and 2016 revenues of 7.4 billion euros.Streaming services remain unprofitable for now, even though they are growing rapidly, as they have high costs for licensing music, and face challenges in persuading people to upgrade from free versions.They have also been criticized by artists such as pop star Taylor Swift for not paying them enough."

80,"Dec 16, 2016 01:20PM ET",Orange CEO under fire at Tapie affair trial of IMF's Lagarde,nan,"By Chine LabbéPARIS (Reuters) - French telecoms boss Stephane Richard was sharply criticized by one of the judges and by a witness during the negligence trial of IMF chief Christine Lagarde in Paris this week.Richard, the chief executive of Orange (PA:ORAN), is a target of investigators in a related inquiry which has yet to conclude.He was Lagarde's chief of staff when, as French finance minister, she approved a payout to businessman Bernard Tapie in a rare out-of-court settlement which cost the French taxpayer 400 million euros ($425 million).Richard and five others are under formal judicial investigation on suspicion of embezzlement linked to the Tapie case. Under French law, such a step often, but not automatically, leads to trial. He contests the allegations.Richard declined to take the stand as a witness in Lagarde's trial, on the advice of his lawyer, writing a letter to the court asking it not to take this refusal as an admission of guilt.Recommending that Lagarde be acquitted of the charge of negligence, Philippe Lagauche, the prosecutor in the special court that tried her, left open the question as to the role of Richard, a civil servant-turned businessman. ""You cannot call placing confidence in a chief of staff negligence, even should it later turn out that that confidence was misplaced, which remains to be demonstrated,"" he said. However, Lagarde herself, who will hear on Monday whether she is to be acquitted, referred to Richard repeatedly during the trial as her ""filter,"" and her lawyer said his absence at the trial had deprived it of ""an essential debate"".One of the 12 lawmakers who sat as judges at the special court for French ministers said Lagarde's account ""gave the strong impression of being misinformed,"" adding: ""That misinformation is damning for Stephane Richard.""Another witness, Bruno Bezard, who was head of the state shareholding agency APE at the time, also criticized Richard and the way he dealt with the proposal to offer Tapie compensation.""The way the chief of staff presented the case seemed to indicate a desire for an arrangement weighted strongly in favor of the interests of Mr. Tapie,"" he told the court.Jean-Etienne Giamarchi, Richard's lawyer, rejected Bezard's testimony as lies.Lagarde was accused of negligence for signing off on the unusual out-of-court settlement between the state and Tapie, a French businessman with connections to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.The case dates back to when Tapie sued the state for compensation after selling his stake in sports company Adidas (DE:ADSGN) to Credit Lyonnais in 1993.He said the bank, owned by the French state at the time, had defrauded him after it later resold its stake for a much higher sum.Tapie subsequently received the 400 million euro settlement funded largely by taxpayers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

90,"Sep 12, 2016 11:00AM ET",Mobile money shakes up sheep trade in Senegal's Muslim feast,nan,"By Nellie Peyton and Diadie BaDAKAR (Reuters) - Sheep are a hot commodity in Senegal leading up to the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, when each family traditionally slaughters a ram for a feast that has become a boomtime for traders who often travel hundreds of miles to sell their livestock.It is a tradition stretching back centuries, but these days paying for the sacrifice is a whole lot easier and safer than it used to be.Using mobile money services operated by telecoms firms, traders can accept cashless payments, bypassing the need for a bank. Drooping from the heat, the animals lolled on sidewalks and packed into vacant lots in the capital Dakar, where their numbers multiplied in the weeks before the holiday on Monday. Called Tabaski in Senegal, Eid al-Adha commemorates the story of prophet Ibrahim - known to Christians and Jews as Abraham - who was willing to sacrifice his son but was given a ram to kill instead after proving his faith.On Monday morning, hundreds of men gathered outside a Dakar mosque and boys stood on tiptoe to get a glimpse of the first slaughter before running home to help with their own. By midday, the streets were stained with blood in the culmination of the West African nation's biggest annual spending splurge. The government estimated that 700,000 sheep would be needed this year in Senegal, which is more than 90 percent Muslim. There are not enough available domestically, so traders come from neighbors Mali and Mauritania to supply more.Buyers navigating crowded sheep pens with wads of cash often find their earnings nimbly pick-pocketed. So to avoid this, some sellers have partnered with French telecoms giant Orange (PA:ORAN), allowing customers to complete the transaction on their mobile phones. First launched in Kenya in 2007, mobile money services have since been rolled out across Africa by companies including Orange, South Africa's MTN (J:MTNJ) and  Vodafone  (L:VOD) (O:VOD), catering to millions of people who lack affordable bank accounts. Orange's version, known as Orange Money, was launched in Ivory Coast in 2008 and now has over 18 million users in Africa. ""It allows for greater security,"" said sheep seller Moustapha Deme, who made about a dozen mobile sheep sales the week before the holiday and said interest in the service was high.In a dusty pen on the side of the road, he prodded a white ram costing 1 million CFA francs ($1,715) - a Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) among sheep made expensive in part because it had been raised with good quality food and vaccinations, he said. A less discerning buyer might hope to bring home a scrawny animal for around $200, still exorbitant for many Senegalese.As with all commodities that shoot up in price because of a predictable surge in demand, the sheep attract speculators. That is despite Senegalese government efforts to clamp down on them. Bassirou Gueye, a 22-year-old university student trying his luck in the business, and a friend bought ten sheep several days before the holiday, hoping to resell them at the last minute and make some extra cash. Even with mobile money, there are risks.""If you buy your sheep early it can get stolen,"" Gueye lamented, sitting in the shade of a market stall surveying his flock. ""We stay up all night to guard them.""($1 = 582.9600 CFA francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

91,"Sep 08, 2016 01:50PM ET","EU to extend some telecom security rules to WhatsApp, Skype: draft",nan,"By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is set to extend some security rules currently only applicable to telecom operators to web services such as WhatsApp (O:FB), Skype (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc's FaceTime (O:AAPL), according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters.The European Commission, the EU executive, will unveil a proposed reform of its 15-year-old telecom rules next week in which it will extend some provisions to web companies offering calls and messages over the Internet, so-called ""over the top players.""Telecom companies such as  Vodafone  (L:VOD), Orange (PA:ORAN) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) have long complained that web groups including Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), Microsoft and Facebook are more lightly regulated despite offering similar services and have called for the EU's telecoms-specific rules to be repealed.Under the draft directive, over the top services will have to ensure the security and integrity of their services, including reporting breaches to authorities and having contingency plans and service continuity strategies.The proposal is part of a broader drive to level the playing field between European companies and mainly U.S. tech firms.However the proposal does allow for some of the security obligations to be lighter for services which like, for example, WhatsApp, do not exercise control over the transmission of their services over telecom networks.""Providers of such services should thus ensure a level of security commensurate with the degree of risk posed to the security of the communications services they provide,"" the document says.""Therefore, whenever it is justified by the actual assessment of the security risks involved, the security requirements ... should be lighter.""Companies will be required to notify national authorities ""without undue delay"" of a security breach which has a significant impact on the operation of their service.The Commission has previously said it was considering extending some security obligations to web services given their increasing equivalence to traditional phone calls and text messages.Over the top services using a number or allowing users to call a number, such as Skype Out and messaging app Viber Out, will also have to offer emergency calls under the new rules.The Commission will propose giving all European consumers the right to affordable basic broadband, which will enable them to check emails and access online banking, meaning national governments will have to provide public money to ensure universal coverage.The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states before becoming law, meaning it is likely to undergo changes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

115,"Apr 07, 2016 01:30AM ET",Mega deals morph into mega problems for Wall Street ,nan,"By Carl O'Donnell and Pamela BarbagliaNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - If 2015 was a dream year for Wall Street's top dealmakers, 2016 is starting to take a nightmarish turn.Some of the mega transactions that had champagne corks popping in boardrooms are running into antitrust problems and, in the case of pharmaceutical firm  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) $160 billion takeover of rival Allergan PLC (N:AGN), political opposition to a deal that envisaged the biggest drug company in the United States moving to Ireland to lower its taxes.The U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules this week that, while they did not name Pfizer and Allergan, had provisions that targeted a specific feature of their agreement and prompted both parties to walk away from what would have been the second-largest deal of all time.The move by the Obama administration to suddenly change the rules has sent a chilling message to dealmakers and comes on top of a number of legal challenges to big transactions such as Halliburton Co's (N:HAL) takeover of rival oil services company  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) on antitrust grounds.The political uncertainty and antitrust concerns mean that firms will think twice about future tie-ups that consolidate industries and move tax dollars offshore.""As uncertainty increases on multiple fronts, companies are markedly more cautious and the number of transformational deals worth $10 billion or more has significantly dropped this quarter compared to last year,"" said Luigi Rizzo, head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).The new U.S. rules do not directly affect most inversion deals, in which an American company buys a foreign counterpart and then moves abroad to lower its tax bill, but they have sent a message to company bosses about the risks of attempting to move their tax addresses overseas.Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), the U.S. exchange considering a bid for the  London Stock Exchange  Group PLC (L:LSE), has ruled out structuring any possible deal for the LSE as an inversion, despite it being possible to do so, according to people familiar with the internal deliberations, who declined to be identified.Intercontinental Exchange declined to comment.Tax inversions have been a political hot button issue in Washington for years.The rules unveiled this week were the Obama administration's third effort to stop U.S. companies renouncing their American citizenship but they are only a temporary stopgap.Formal legislation to overhaul U.S. tax rules would be needed to bring a permanent end to the practice.""We have succeeded in making it significantly harder for companies to strike inversion deals and redomicile overseas,"" said U.S. congressman Peter Welch. ""But we still need action in Congress.""With a U.S. presidential campaign looming later this year there is much uncertainty about what shape such legislation would take, making deals all the more difficult to strike. UNIQUE CHALLENGESLast year was a record for M&A and a bumper year for mega matches. Out of the $4.6 trillion in deals inked, the number of individual transactions that exceeded $30 billion in value was 18 compared with seven deals worth more than $30 billion in 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed.But the consequence of greater consolidation is increased scrutiny by antitrust officials. That was exemplified on Wednesday by the U.S. government filing a lawsuit to stop Halliburton from buying Baker Hughes, arguing the combination of the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies would lead to higher prices in the sector.The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop an unusually high number of deals in the past 18 months. FTC officials are in court this week to block a merger between  Staples Inc  (O:SPLS) and  Office Depot  Inc (O:ODP).""It isn't just the number of proposed deals that makes this a unique moment in antitrust enforcement; it's their size and their complexity,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a speech on Wednesday.""This represents a remarkable shift toward consolidation and it presents unique challenges to federal enforcers in our work to maintain markets that serve not just top executives and majority shareholders, but every American.""In Europe, meanwhile, talks between Orange SA (PA:ORAN) and  Bouygues  SA (PA:BOUY) to create a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed last week, amid competition concerns and a stand-off between Martin Bouygues and French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron about the clout the billionaire would have gained in the former state monopoly, according to people familiar with the matter.For bankers, scuttled deals cost money.Investment banks on the Pfizer and Allergan deal, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Centerview and Moelis, lost more than $200 million in fees when the companies walked, showed data from consultancy Freeman & Co.Faced with greater hurdles to get deals through, some investment bankers are rethinking how they want to structure their payoffs, including trying to get more cash upfront rather than a big check after a deal closes, said a person familiar with the matter.(Carl O'Donnell in NEW YORK and Pamela Barbaglia in LONDON; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, John McCrank and Diane Bartz; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Christopher Cushing)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

118,"Apr 03, 2016 07:20PM ET",Suspicion and soured relationships sank Bouygues Telecom's deal,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Sophie SassardPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - When French Prime Minister Manuel Valls phoned billionaire Martin  Bouygues  on Thursday evening in an attempt to save a merger between Bouygues Telecom (PA:BOUY) and state-controlled Orange, it was already too late. The deal would have created the dominant player in an industry damaged by fierce competition, but collapsed on Friday morning with Bouygues deciding not to sell his telecoms business to the former state monopoly even though he had floated the idea himself four months earlier. The fact Bouygues had confirmed that the unprofitable telecom service provider he founded in 1994 was for sale made his rivals and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron think the businessman had decided he had no choice but to sell, said four people involved in the talks who spoke to Reuters on Saturday and Sunday.""It's probably because of this first call that they all tried to rip him apart,"" one of the sources who is close to Orange (PA:ORAN) said, referring to the French government, which owns 23 percent of Orange, and rivals  Iliad  (PA:ILD) and SFR (PA:NUME).For the deal to go through, Iliad and SFR would have had to agree to buy some Bouygues Telecom assets to ease competition concerns. Spokespeople for the French Economy Ministry, Orange, Bouygues, SFR and Iliad declined to comment for this story. The weeks of deliberations were the best chance in years to take a contender out of the game and ease competitive pressures that had hammered profits in the industry and drained the capital needed for network investments to better serve an increasingly data-driven economy. The deal's collapse is a blow not just for the companies but for the French government.The perception among Martin Bouygues' rivals that they had the upper hand proved decisive on March 24 when a stand-off between the 63-year-old businessman and 38-year-old Macron came to a head and Bouygues stormed out of a meeting at the economy ministry, according to two of the sources.Bouygues felt humiliated by Macron's demands, said one of the sources, who is a banker. The scene highlighted the rocky relationship between France's Socialist government and Bouygues, who is godfather to a son of former right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy.CONTROL OF ORANGEThe complex telecoms merger, whose price tag Bouygues fixed at 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) in cash and Orange shares, would have made the conglomerate the second-biggest shareholder in Orange after the French state, which would have seen its stake diluted. For Macron, a former Rothschild & Cie banker, that raised questions about the role Bouygues would play in Orange which owns and manages submarine cables that are central to France's surveillance apparatus, making it a strategic asset for the government. Macron did not want to be perceived as having let Bouygues gain control. He wanted the government to keep three seats on the Orange board and a blocking minority at shareholder meetings, an idea that Bouygues understood and accepted from the start. But Bouygues was not happy with Macron's request to cap his potential stake in Orange for seven years and give up for 10 years the double-voting rights he was entitled to as a long-term investor in Orange, three of the sources said ""It's criminal to impose such conditions on Bouygues,"" the banker said. ""It's treating him like a second-class citizen. Any foreign raider who starts buying Orange shares would get better terms."" Macron and his advisers feared that Bouygues would use the same tactic as another French billionaire, Vincent Bollore, whose media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) quietly expanded its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) to eventually gain control. FRICTIONBouygues himself was not present at the discussions between Orange, Bouygues, Iliad and SFR at the Paris offices of his lawyer Jean-Michel Darrois where about 40 people gathered in the ten days preceding the collapse of the deal.All four companies wanted an agreement to end their price war. But the talks soured in the final week, according to several people present, with Bouygues increasingly mistrustful of the two other players Xavier Niel, the founder of Iliad, and the owner of SFR, Patrick Drahi. Bouygues became increasingly wary of the risks to his interests from the break-up of his telecom assets and the manner of their distribution among his rivals. Disagreements over break-up fees and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal proved intractable, said several of the sources. ""Niel made concessions but only on the last day,"" said one of the sources who is close to Bouygues. ""He tried to obtain as much as he could.""($1 = 0.8782 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

119,"Apr 01, 2016 04:58PM ET",Orange and Bouygues $11.4 billion French telecoms deal collapses,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Sophie SassardPARIS (Reuters) - Talks between Orange (PA:ORAN) and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) on a deal to create a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed on Friday, ending an attempt to ease a price war that has ravaged operators' margins.The failure of the proposed 10 billion euro ($11.4 billion) cash-and-share deal involving Bouygues Telecom is a blow to the two companies and the French government, which was heavily involved as it has a stake of around 23 percent in Orange.The proposed tie-up was widely seen as a make-or-break chance to reduce the number of telecoms groups to three from four and prop up profits, which have been depressed since the arrival of low-cost operator  Iliad .But a stand-off between Martin Bouygues and French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron about the clout the billionaire would have gained in the former state monopoly had weighed on the talks, sources had told Reuters earlier.""The two main reasons explaining the failure of these talks are execution risks and the general attitude of the French state,"" a source close to the matter told Reuters.The risks included the break-up fees involved and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal, the source added. Orange's position as the No. 1 French telecoms operator meant that an acquisition of Bouygues Telecom would have required selling some of its assets to rivals Iliad (PA:ILD) and SFR (PA:NUME), with which Orange held parallel negotiations.This added to the complexity of getting a deal done, sources said, as apart from Bouygues himself, the talks involved two other influential billionaires, Iliad's founder Xavier Niel and SFR's owner Patrick Drahi.""It would have been a miracle if they had come to terms,"" a source close to the matter said. GOING IT ALONEThe failure to reach a deal, which was confirmed by both parties, leaves Bouygues Telecom to go it alone.""In a market where the possibility of consolidation is now ruled out for the long term, Bouygues Telecom will continue its standalone strategy,"" Bouygues, the construction-to-media conglomerate said in a statement.That could prove difficult for them, Francois Mallet, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said.""They will all be kicking themselves,"" Mallet said on BFM Business, adding: ""The state has a big responsibility in this. The big loser is Bouygues, let's not kid ourselves.""A source at the French Economy Ministry said that the main hurdle had been the risks involved in getting a deal across the line, with competition concerns a factor.""It was an extremely complex deal and there was the question of the competition authority hanging,"" the source told Reuters.The tie-up would have made Bouygues the second-biggest shareholder of Orange after the French state, whose stake would have been diluted.The French Economy Ministry had asked Bouygues to accept capping its potential stake in Orange for seven years, under a so-called standstill clause.It had also asked it to accept giving up for 10 years the double-voting rights Bouygues would get as a long-term investor in Orange, another source said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Italy does not own a stake in Telecom Italia, but has a say over so-called strategic assets, including the phone group's network.Telecom Italia, which has net debt of around 27 billion euros ($30 billion), is widely seen as a potential takeover target in a consolidating industry, partly because of its relatively small size.""We see the European telecom market as a single legal entity: in this scenario, there would be room for just a few players,"" Mediobanca said in a note.Vivendi has gradually built up a stake of 23.8 percent in Telecom Italia and has secured four seats on its board, giving it greater sway over strategy at the former state monopoly.Some analysts were skeptical about the benefits of an Orange-Telecom Italia combination, especially given Telecom Italia's debt burden and the French state interest.While major savings can be reaped from telecoms deals within countries, the case is less clear for cross-border ones where local networks and commercial operations are not being combined.One trader said a paper offer with a 30 percent premium would dilute the French state to 14 percent, which would be ""too much for Italy to digest, and too low for France""."

""We're having this kind of discussion about consolidation in Europe because we're having a convergence issue.""That desire to broaden the appeal to customers wanting a single operator for multiple services was highlighted by the announcement last week of a tie-up between mobile telecoms network operator  Vodafone  (L:VOD) and cable company Liberty Global (O:LBTYA). The two companies are looking to combine their Dutch operations to create a stronger package of TV, broadband Internet and mobile.Similarly, Britain's BT Group (L:BT) bought EE from Orange and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) for 12.5 billion pounds ($17.4 billion) to create a single integrated network offering a combination of telecoms and TV services.TWITCHY WATCHDOGSHowever, competition authorities are becoming increasingly twitchy about the shrinking number of operators in some countries.The proposed takeover of Telefonica's (MC:TEF) O2 by CK Hutchison Holdings (HK:0001) in Britain received a less than glowing response from the head of British telecoms regulator Ofcom, Sharon White, who spoke of potential risks to investment and prices in a Financial Times article this month.Hutchison also received a list of objections this month from EU's antitrust authorities over a deal that would create Britain's biggest mobile operator, a person familiar with the matter said.EU authorities are anxious to avoid a repeat of the situation that followed the 1.3 billion euro acquisition of Orange Austria by Hutchison in 2013. That deal led to price increases of more than 30 percent for mobile users, Austria's telecoms regulator said.The hardened attitude of competition watchdogs was emphasized in September, when a proposed merger of  Telenor  (OL:TEL) and TeliaSonera (ST:TLSN) in Denmark was withdrawn after EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager expressed concerns it would lead to higher prices for consumers, marking the first time such a deal had been blocked since telecoms companies began their M&A spree three years ago.One might think that these obstacles to domestic deals would raise the prospect of pan-European consolidation among the region's 30-plus operators, but the risks and complexity make such mega-mergers unlikely.VALUATION PEAK?""We're not the United States of Europe. There are very few synergies between countries as of today,"" says  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Agathe Martin.""Content (services) are specific to each country and social stakes create difficulties, not to mention the different regulatory frameworks.""One of the upshots for European telecoms companies is a potential drop in share price valuations.""It's not the right time to buy telecoms shares,"" Natixis analyst Jacques de Greling said.""We're reaching a valuation peak that is essentially due to the M&A activity in the domestic markets. It will soon be over as there won't be anything else to consolidate after the number of operators is cut to three in each market and given that there's no cable operator to buy.""De Greling estimates that the relative price-to-earnings ratio for the European telecoms sector is at about 1.3, compared with the historic average of 0.9 for the overall market.Yet M&A is far from an exact science and a big acquisition is not totally beyond the realms of possibility.“Would I rule out that somebody does something completely stupid? No,"" said Wolfgang Bock, leader of the telecommunications practice at Boston Consulting Group. ""You can always find big egos who ignore the economic realities to build an empire. Empire-builders might come back at some point.”($1 = 0.9112 euros)($1 = 0.7200 pounds)(Corrects typographical error in first paragraph, clarifies eighth paragraph to show deal would create biggest mobile operator)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

133,"Oct 07, 2015 08:02PM ET",Smaller U.S. businesses fear freeze from EU privacy ruling,nan,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Julia FiorettiSAN FRANCISCO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. businesses from online coupon company RetailMeNot Inc (O:SALE) to security software company  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) said a European change to rules governing transatlantic personal data transfers would hurt U.S. companies and called for a quick fix.An EU court on Tuesday struck down a deal to let U.S. and European companies easily transfer personal data between continents, leaving some U.S. companies concerned that they will be frozen out of the market or replaced by EU competitors.""The biggest fear is they'll lose the opportunity to provide data services in Europe,"" said Emery Simon, counselor to BSA | The Software Alliance, an industry group for software companies such as Oracle (N:ORCL), Salesforce (N:CRM) and  IBM  (N:IBM).Tech giants like IBM are more prepared for the change, because they have come to use a number of different legal arrangements they say will keep their data flowing.The so-called Safe Harbor system allowed U.S. companies to self-certify they met stricter European privacy standards, but the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said the provisions used by more than 4,000 firms did not give Europeans sufficient protection against U.S. government access. Companies from all sectors, from pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (N:PFE) to tech firms like Microsoft (O:MSFT), move user and employee data back and forth across the Atlantic. Tech companies, for instance, store data on many global users in the United States, where they can parse user information for lucrative ad targeting.A U.S. company with overseas operations might transfer data about employees to centralize its human resources functions at its headquarters.The EU and the United States will step up efforts to craft a new system, but some U.S. software and data storage firms fear the data flow will stop and that companies will instead rely on European competitors for their services.Midsize companies including document management company Adobe Systems Inc (O:ADBE), design software maker  Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK) and coupon company RetailMeNot relied on Safe Harbor.""Any U.S. company with employees or customers in Europe is potentially impacted by this ruling,"" RetailMeNot spokesman Brian Hoyt told Reuters by email. ""We also believe it may also create challenges for data sharing necessary to rapidly provide data analysis for business operations.""Adobe said it was ""evaluating options"" to transfer personal data between continents and Autodesk also said it was evaluating the decision. Symantec said it has other mechanisms in place to legally protect data transfers, but the uncertainty following the ruling has made it difficult for such companies to determine their next steps and how much business might be lost.Even setting up data servers in Europe would not solve their problems, said Ilias Chantzos, Symantec senior director for government affairs in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and privacy advisor.""You can't isolate the flow of data only within one territory or jurisdiction,"" Chantzos said. And data storage without processing would not be enough, added Thomas Boue, Director of EMEA Government Affairs at BSA.""For companies a lot of the added value is on all the tools they use to process the data, what you do with that data,"" he said.Companies could create new agreements with their customers in the European Union, but the lack of clarity and high costs could leave smaller firms with a ""disproportionate share"" of the burden of new legal requirements, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said.OPPORTUNITYThe change could be an opportunity for European competitors such as Orange (PA:ORAN) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) to take business from U.S. companies. One major European telecoms operator expects many customers, both private individuals and businesses, to reassess their data plans and to look at storing their data within Europe, a source close to the company said.""It is much more likely that companies will need to store their data in the EU and not with U.S.-based providers, challenging the hegemony of U.S. data storage companies,"" said Ian De Freitas, a partner at the law firm Berwin LeightonPaisner.The larger U.S. companies may face a problem of perception that they have abetted U.S. government surveillance. They say, however, that they have broken no laws. IBM, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc (O:AMZN),all have additional legal arrangements such as ""model clauses"" which set privacy standards between the sender and receiver of the data and allow them to continue data transfers.Some also have agreements with European users who consent to having their data transferred to the United States. Facebook, for example, has a registration process that allows it to obtain consent from users when they sign up for the service.A prime concern of U.S. companies is that without a centralized system like Safe Harbor, EU privacy regulators could adopt diverging approaches to international data transfers.The European Commission said it would provide guidance to the regulators to ensure they adopted a common approach.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

138,"Sep 01, 2015 03:17AM ET",New Numericable-SFR chief says not planning price war,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French mobile operator Numericable-SFR has no intention of launching a new price war, incoming chairman Michel Combes has told daily Les Echos.SFR, a unit of telecoms group Altice where Combes also becomes chief operating officer from Tuesday, will aim to regain market share with new and simpler subscription offers, a better network, new services and better content. ""We will continue our investments. However, I do not believe that winning back customers requires lowering prices,"" Combes was quoted as saying. Low-cost telecoms group Iliad has shaken up France's mobile market in 2012 with cheap, no-contract plans, putting pressure on established players Orange, Numericable-SFR and  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) Telecom. In the first half of the year, Iliad's Free Mobile increased its market share by one percentage point to 16 percent. Combes said SFR had long been known as the most innovative company in the industry and that it would regain that position. Asked whether Altice would continue its acquisition drive, Combes said his priority was to consolidate the firm's current assets. ""We need to continue to structure and industrialise the operation of the group,"" he said. Altice, controlled by billionaire Patrick Drahi, has been on a buying spree, including the purchase of Vivendi's SFR, the second-biggest French mobile firm, to create Numericable-SFR. Drahi also made a bid for Bouygues Telecom, which was rejected.Combes, 53, is leaving his role as head of telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PARIS:ALUA) ahead of its takeover by Finland's Nokia (HEL:NOKIA) Corp.Combes, who joined  Alcatel  from  Vodafone  (LONDON:VOD) in 2013, has more than 25 years of experience in the telecoms industry and has a record as a cost-cutter.But he has come under fire over the payout he is set to receive after leaving Alcatel-Lucent. Weekly Le Journal du Dimanche reported Combes could receive the equivalent of 13.7 million euros in stock by 2018.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It has said that it plans to merge its Spanish unit and Jazztel and then list part of the merged company on the Madrid stock exchange. With the purchase Orange will expand its presence in Spain several times over to reach 10 million households with its fiber optic network by 2016.It said 95 percent of Jazztel shareholders had supported its offer of 13 euros per share, which was a 34 percent premium to Jazztel's average share price in the month before Orange made the offer last September.The remaining 5 percent will now be forced to support the deal under a separate compulsory offer to be launched by Orange at the same price. The French company hopes the deal will help it better compete with  Vodafone  (L:VOD) in the Spanish market after Vodafone acquired cable operator Ono last year.Acquisitions are picking up pace in the European telecoms sector as operators seek to cut costs and increase market share at the same time, but EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager warned this month that mergers could result in higher bills for consumers and less innovative companies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

149,"Jun 23, 2015 09:24AM ET",Bouygues faces crossroads choice on telecoms business,nan,"By Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - Martin  Bouygues , scion of one of France's top industrialist families, must decide on Tuesday whether to part with the telecoms business that is his main contribution to the conglomerate built by his father.The Bouygues (PA:BOUY) board is due to meet later on Tuesday to discuss what sources said was a 10-billion-euro ($11.3 billion) bid by European telecom group Altice (AS:ATCE). In reality, the decision lies with the 63-year-old Bouygues alone.""No-one really knows what is on his mind, whether he'll sell now,"" said one person familiar with the situation.""(But) if he sells, he'll have commanded an amazing price for the business he founded and carries his name,"" the source said of a business ranked as France's third-largest mobile player.Martin Bouygues has already rebuffed at least two offers in the past year for the unit he founded in 1994, insisting as recently as last month that Bouygues Telecom could prosper on its own. He once even rebuffed a question about selling the business by firing back at a journalist: ""And you, would you sell your wife?""But the offer by Altice's Patrick Drahi outstrips all past approaches. Drahi's own empire-building took off in 2014 when he beat out Bouygues to acquire Vivendi's (PA:VIV) SFR, the second-biggest mobile operator.The 10 billion-euro price tag would value the unit as much as the entire Bouygues group before the offer was made public. It also eclipses earlier offers from Orange (PA:ORAN) and low-cost operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) - each around 5.5 billion euros - as well as a previous 8 billion-euro approach by Drahi.The business, which has been posting losses since Iliad broke into the French mobile market three years ago, had a 2014 total asset value of 5.8 billion euros.The deal value would be the equivalent of 14.4 times the division's 2014 EBITDA earnings of 694 million euros, well above a sector average multiple of 7-11, according to investment house Raymond James.If he sells, Bouygues could use the cash to cut debt, raise his family's stake in the group or finance other acquisitions, said Natixis analyst Gregoire Thibault. POLITICAL CONCERNPrice is not the only factor in Bouygues' decision.Drahi, known for aggressive cost-cutting, could extract as much as 1 billion euros a year in synergies to raise profit margins, analysts estimate, but only at the expense of painful job cuts - which Bouygues has indicated he wants to avoid.President Francois Hollande's Socialist government has moreover expressed concern over the deal.Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Tuesday set five conditions for any accord, including employment guarantees and assurances on investment in high-speed broadband and in the upcoming auction of radio spectrum for 4G mobile broadband networks, from which the state wants to raise 2.5 billion euros.Drahi is set to discuss the proposed deal with French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron later on Tuesday.Set against such obstacles to a deal is the increasingly cut-throat nature of the French telecoms sector and how Bouygues Telecom, after a strong start, has struggled to keep up since Iliad's 2012 arrival as a fourth national player.A turnaround plan including staff cuts and a re-positioning of the business has failed to generate positive cash-flow for Bouygues, while its late entry into the fixed-line market means it can only sell broadband by renting capacity from Numericable.By 1243 GMT Bouygues shares were up 0.16 percent, having jumped 13 percent on Monday despite uncertainties surrounding the deal, while Altice shares were up 1.58 percent and Numericable-SFR (PA:NUME) shares were down 1.04 percent.

151,"Jun 22, 2015 11:05AM ET",Altice offer for Bouygues Telecom lifts French sector shares,nan,"By Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - European cable and telecoms group Altice (AS:ATCE) has made an offer to buy France's  Bouygues  Telecom through its subsidiary Numericable-SFR (PA:NUME), the companies said on Monday, sending share prices up across the French telecoms sector.Bouygues Telecom's parent Bouygues SA (PA:BOUY) said its board would meet on Tuesday to discuss what it called Altice's ""unsolicited offer"", adding that no negotiations between the two sides were underway. ""Altice will update the market in due course,"" it said.Neither party disclosed the value of the offer, but sources told Reuters at the weekend that Patrick Drahi, the controlling shareholder in Altice, had submitted a bid in recent weeks worth around 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in cash.Investors cheered the prospect of a merger that would generate big cost savings and potentially calm a brutal price war that has raged in France since 2012 when low-cost operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) entered the mobile market.Drahi is set to discuss the matter on Tuesday with French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, according to a person familiar with the matter. The government is concerned that the focus on such deals could slow investment in mobile and high-speed broadband and that developments could upset the smooth running of an upcoming auction of air waves for mobile networks, the person said.Shares in Altice and Numericable-SFR were up 14 percent and 14.5 percent respectively by 1424 GMT, while Bouygues was up 13.6 percent. Shares in French market leader Orange (PA:ORAN) rose 7.5 percent, while Iliad (PA:ILD) gained nearly 12 percent.Analysts value Bouygues Telecom at between 5 and 6.5 billion euros, making a 10 billion-euro bid appear generous for a company that has been posting losses since Iliad's assault on the mobile market.The offer is also higher than previous bids made for Bouygues Telecom, including a joint one last year from Orange and Iliad which was valued at around 5 billion euros and one from Numericable earlier this year worth 8 billion euros.The entire market value of the Bouygues (PA:BOUY) conglomerate, which includes businesses in roads, construction and television, as well as telecoms, stood at 11.3 billion euros before the latest offer was made public. If completed, the deal would put Numericable-SFR ahead of state-backed Orange in terms of subscribers, and cut from four to three the number of competing network operators in Europe's third-largest telecoms market.Buying Bouygues would allow Numericable-SFR to reap massive cost savings by cutting staff and rationalizing stores, among other measures. Berenberg analysts put the savings at 850 million euros per year.Two sources familiar with the matter said Drahi has already secured financing with banks  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) and JP Morgan.POLITICAL ISSUESBut it remains to be seen if a deal will get done, especially since the billionaire founder of Bouygues Telecom, Martin Bouygues, has said repeatedly in recent months that he does not want to sell.There are also political issues for Drahi and Altice to overcome as the French government has already signaled its opposition due to concerns for jobs and spending on infrastructure.The state is preparing to auction off more radio frequencies for use by 4G mobile broadband networks this summer and the government is counting on raising at least 2.5 billion euros that has already been earmarked for the military budget.If Numericable-SFR buys Bouygues, there would be one fewer bidder competing for the low-frequency 700 megahertz band of frequencies on offer, potentially lowering the proceeds for the state.In a separate statement, Numericable-SFR and Iliad confirmed they were in exclusive talks over selling a portfolio of Bouygues assets to Iliad if the first deal goes through. In an effort to allay competition concerns, Iliad would take over many of Bouygues Telecom's mobile masts and radio spectrum, two sources said on Sunday. The companies did not say anything about how Bouygues' network assets would be valued.Such an arrangement would be a massive boost for Iliad, which has been rushing to expand its own mobile network and owns far less mobile spectrum than its three larger competitors. France's antitrust authority declined to comment on the proposed takeover.Stephane Beyazian, analyst at Raymond James, put the chances of success for the Altice deal to buy Bouygues Telecom at 50 or 60 percent due to ""antitrust risk"".""Bouygues' board will likely accept the offer, in our view, assuming there is a material cash proportion,"" said Beyazian.""We also believe that the board will need to consider that they may not achieve a better value for this asset, even assuming that the ongoing restructuring plan is successful.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

154,"Jun 09, 2015 09:11AM ET",Austria becomes battleground in fight over mobile mergers,nan,"By Shadia Nasralla and Leila AbboudVIENNA/PARIS (Reuters) - When the number of mobile network operators competing in Austria was cut by a merger from four to three in January 2013 it was seen as an important test case just as a deal-making frenzy was about to break out among telecoms firms across Europe.Yet two years after Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK> bought larger local rival Orange Austria for 1.3 billion euros ($1.45 billion), there is still no consensus as to whether Austrians are better off in terms of coverage or service, and regulators and operators are disputing whether consumers are paying more.Nor is there any clear evidence of the merger bringing the promised additional investment in faster networks, since other than an expensive auction of 4G mobile broadband airwaves in late 2013, operators' capital expenditures are largely unchanged.""The debate on what metrics to use to judge these mergers can quickly devolve into a shouting match,"" said Francesco Liberatore, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in London, who has advised telecoms operators in the past.""A lot of this is in the eye of the beholder. Companies, national regulators and investors do not necessarily agree on what has happened or the best way forward from here,"" he said.But conclusions have to be reached as competition regulators are likely to be judging more deals soon, as telecom and cable companies forge ahead with mergers in other national markets, with deal volumes in Europe having reached $67 billion this year, their highest level since 2000.Britain is now reviewing Hutchison's proposed takeover of Telefonica's (MC:TEF) 02 UK which will reduce the number of mobile network operators there to three. Analysts and industry sources have predicted there could be more deals soon in Italy and France.There is also a sense in the industry that the European Commission has opened the flood gates by approving similar deals in Austria, Germany and Ireland in the past two years. As a result, competition lawyers now say rather than banning a reduction in the number of network operators the main issue is what conditions regulators impose on merging companies to keep competition sharp enough to protect consumers from price rises.In Austria, the Commission has admitted that the remedies it asked of Hutchison were too slow in getting off the ground. Hutchison was required to rent out its network to so-called mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) but it took nearly two years before the first of these rival service providers actually launched.Meanwhile, the debate continues over what has happened to prices following the merger. There are radically different conclusions depending on how the data is analysed. Austria's industry regulator, which opposed consolidation in 2013 and remains worried about its potential negative impact on consumers, says its analyses of users' bills shows that prices paid have risen more than 30 percent between late 2013 and the end of last year. A slight dip has been seen this year due to the impact of the newly created MVNOs from local cable groups.Rewheel, a consultancy which opposes such mergers and advises smaller telecom carriers, says that Austria has gone from being the second cheapest market for a smartphone plan with 4 gigabytes of data to the 14th of 28 European countries. Figures from the GSMA mobile industry lobby, which supports more mergers, show that price per megabyte of voice, message and data traffic has fallen by roughly 25 percent since the deal.People are consuming double the amount of mobile data than before, according to a GSMA report, while average download speeds have quadrupled because of faster 4G mobile networks.To settle the debate, Austria's competition watchdog and RTR, the telecoms industry regulator, are working on a report to come out by year end looking at average revenue per user. This is different from RTR's usual methodology, which looks at four different user types based on their consumption of data and minutes.Both institutions are critical of any analysis of prices based on translating minutes and text messages into data units to create a price per unit average, as operators often do.""It will be clear that prices have risen after the merger,"" RTR head Johannes Gungl told reporters.  British regulators are undertaking a similar exercise as they prepare to review Hutchison's deal domestically, and European Commission competition authorities are also undertaking a separate study on how best to evaluate price changes.""Only now do we have some level of historical data on four-to-three mergers so we can look at price signals, and the economists are arguing about what it all really means,"" Peter Alexiadis, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn in Brussels, said.""Everyone is having the first real conversation about the effects of the mergers on mobile prices, quality of service, and how to weigh these different objectives."" Antonios Drossos, co-founder of Rewheel, thinks the methodology pushed by the big telecom companies is wrong and that remedies in Austria, Germany and Ireland are inadequate to ensure strong competition is maintained.""The argument that consumption went up and coverage is better is irrelevant,"" he said.""The question you should ask is how much higher consumption would have been if there were still a fourth operator offering good deals and how much better the networks would have been with more competition.""A new forum for the debate opened on Monday. A small German wireless operator Airdata filed a challenge with the EU General Court to contest  Telefonica  Deutschland's (DE:O2Dn) 8.6 billion euro acquisition of KPN's E-Plus (AS:KPN) last year.(Corrects spelling of name in paragraph 4.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Our intention is to terminate the contract. Our intention is as soon as possible from a contractual point of view and preserving our interests of course, our intention is to withdraw Orange brand from Israel.""He added: ""Our group policy is not to license our brand when we're not the operator... There isn't a single country in the world where we do that, so there's no reason to do it in Israel either... We want to control our brand.""Partner said the only link between it and Orange was the brand, used by the Israeli company since 1998.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week demanded France publicly renounce what he called ""the distressing statement and action"" taken by Orange.France's Foreign Ministry responded that Paris opposed any boycott of the Jewish state but stressed Orange was free to define its own policy.France issued a warning to French investors a year ago that investments in Israeli settlement areas carried legal risks, a move which raised concerns in Israel.French human rights groups have asked the government to encourage Orange to pull out of its relationship with its partner.Israel has said the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, sponsored by pro-Palestinian intellectuals and bloggers, is motivated by anti-Semitism and a desire to paint Israel as illegitimate.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The extra physical infrastructure deployment is not as big as you would think.""Mobile phones have been one of the factors behind Africa's recent growth spurt, by freeing people from the shackles of the continent's awful landline infrastructure and allowing them to communicate and transact at minimal personal and financial cost.The simple SMS - and more recently mobile social media - have also become powerful political tools, used by grassroots political movements to mobilize support against oppressive states, such as happened in the north African 'Arab Spring'.Governments across the continent are aware of the economic potential of mobile telephony but are sometimes slow to implement the legal frameworks needed to allow phone companies to expand, Mortimer said.""Many governments across Africa have developed broadband plans.

161,"May 05, 2015 12:55PM ET",Orange in talks with buyers of fiber assets to get Jazztel deal approved,nan,"By Leila Abboud and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - Orange (PA:ORAN) has begun talks with several potential buyers for parts of Jazztel's (MC:JAZ) fiber network, which it has agreed to sell to get regulatory approval for the takeover of the Spanish broadband company.Nicolas Laederich, an executive who handles regulatory affairs and competition issues for the French telecoms group, said the divestment would be paired with a promise to rent out capacity on the company's fixed network to whoever buys the fiber assets. European regulators have asked Orange to make these concessions as a condition of approving the 3.4 billion euro ($3.80 billion) deal to acquire Spanish broadband company Jazztel. The arrangement would bring back a fourth national competitor to Spain's broadband market. Sources told Reuters last Thursday that European regulators would approve Orange's takeover of Jazztel. The deadline for a decision is June 1.Orange clinched the Jazztel deal in September to keep up with Spain's leader  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and  Vodafone  (L:VOD), which were both already present in mobile and fixed services. Vodafone bought national cable operator Ono several months before Orange moved for Jazztel.Spanish customers are flocking to buy discounted bundles of fixed and mobile services, and Spain is now Orange's second most important market in terms of revenue and sales, after its home country of France.Laederich said Orange would sell about 720,000 fiber connections that Jazztel had installed in five cities including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. The company that buys the fiber assets will also have the right to piggyback on Orange-Jazztel's fixed network via a wholesale agreement so as to be able offer broadband nationally.""We have already had contacts with several interested parties,"" the executive said by telephone, declining to give specifics.""These remedies in no way undermine the attractiveness of the Jazztel acquisition for Orange.""About 60 percent of the fiber connections overlap with Orange's own network, he explained, and the goal of generating 1.3 billion euros in cost savings from the Jazztel deal remains.Potential buyers for the fiber assets could include budget mobile carrier Yoigo, which is owned by Sweden's  Teliasonera  (ST:TLSN), or regional cable companies such as Euskaltel and R, which are both owned by private equity funds. Small mobile company Masmovil (MC:MASM), which already rents capacity on Orange's network, could also be a good fit.Shares of Orange closed 4.7 percent lower at 14.21 euros on Tuesday, compared with a 2.1 percent drop in France's blue-chip index (FCHI).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

165,"Apr 17, 2015 01:20PM ET","EU telecoms reform to address competition from WhatsApp, Skype",nan,"By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will take into account increased competition from cable operators and alternative services such as WhatsApp (O:FB) when it overhauls Europe's telecoms rules next year, a move that will be cheered by the telecoms industry.A draft seen by Reuters of the Commission's strategy for creating a digital single market says telecom operators compete with ""over-the-top"" services ""without being subject to the same regulatory regime"".""It is necessary to design a fair and future-proof regulatory environment for all services,"" the document says. The bloc's telecom firms such as Orange (PA:ORAN) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) have long called for lighter-touch regulation, after years of declining revenues and competition from new entrants, to enable them to invest in network upgrades.Telecom companies point to increased competition from services such as Skype (owned by Microsoft (O:MSFT)) and online messaging as a reason for easing the regulatory burden.Considering Skype, or any other ""voice-over-IP"" application, as a substitute for traditional phone services could lead to those companies being subject to the same obligations as traditional operators, such as offering emergency calls.The new European executive, which took office in November, has made investment in superfast broadband a priority. But incumbent telecom operators say the current set of rules does not provide incentives to invest in their networks.They argue they would be forced to give competitors access to those networks, an argument rejected by smaller alternative operators. Yet an evidence document backing up the strategy, also seen by Reuters, states that incumbents ""appear to lack incentives to overbuild their own largely depreciated copper network assets.""The Commission will unveil its proposals for an overhaul of the telecoms framework in 2016, the document states. Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip is expected to unveil his digital single market strategy on May 6.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

168,"Feb 27, 2015 12:05PM ET","Europe's big telecoms roar back to health, worrying rivals",nan,"By Leila Abboud, Harro Ten Wolde and Julia FiorettiPARIS (Reuters) - Europe's big telecom firms are back to rude financial health after years of poor results and regulatory pressure, drawing crowds of new investors and protests from rivals who worry the formerly state-owned companies may rebuild their monopolies.Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Spain's Telefonica (MC:TEF) have predicted that revenues will grow this year, while France's Orange (PA:ORAN) and Norway's Telenor (OL:TEL) have promised higher future dividends, a major motivation for investors in the sector.The renaissance is a marked shift from the past five years in which the sector's sales fell steadily because of regulation ending various types of mobile fees and tough competition from cable operators such as Liberty Global (O:LBTYA) and low-cost players like France's Iliad (PA:ILD).Sector executives credit the improvement to new 4G technology that powers speedier mobile broadband, as well as a more relaxed attitude by regulators to mergers and acquisitions, and the fees the former state firms can charge to share their networks.Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges attributed the rebirth of the firms often referred to as incumbents to the trend of selling multi-service packages comprising broadband, television, and fixed and mobile services. ""It is the convergence that makes the incumbents fly,"" he said on Thursday. ""We are in a better position to tell that story with confidence.""Thus for the first time in eight years these incumbents gained broadband market share between January and July 2014, according to EU Commission figures, beating alternative players by emphasizing higher speeds.All this has translated into a 15 percent rise in the European telecoms index (SXKP) this year, after a 7.5 percent rise last year. (http://link.reuters.com/was65t)Consequently the once yawning valuation gap between U.S. and European telecoms has reversed, with the European sector now trading at 19.3 times forward price to earnings compared with 14 times for U.S. peers such as AT&T (N:T) and Verizon (N:VZ). (http://link.reuters.com/fym63v)SOFTER REGULATIONAfter recent years of recession, the new European Commission under President Jean-Claude Juncker wants to spur growth in part by encouraging telecoms firms to invest in faster broadband infrastructure, which underpins the modern economy. By way of incentive, Brussels has decided that when telecoms companies build new high-speed fiber lines they may charge rivals commercial rates to use them, rather than the regulated rates that were introduced in the 1990s to inject competition into the markets.The regulators are also taking a softer line on consolidation, prompting a wave of activity: since December 2012, antitrust authorities have approved mobile deals in Austria, Ireland and Germany, as well as Vodafone's (L:VOD) purchases of cable operators in Germany and Spain.ECTA, the trade association for alternative operators such as Iliad (PA:ILD) and Talk Talk (L:TALK), warns however that such policies have tipped the balance too far to the big firms. Its claim is given weight by a Citigroup (NYSE:C) report titled ""The Rebirth of the telecom monopoly"" last November that showed a decrease in competitiveness in 25 global mobile markets since late 2011, a shift from the prior decade when incumbents were losing clients.The recent rapid re-making of the British market sums up the big players' rebirth. BT Group (L:BT), the former state-owned entity that was focused on fixed telephony and broadband, has agreed to buy the country's biggest mobile provider EE. This recreates an integrated market leader in Britain just as Telefonica dominates in Spain or Orange in France, competition advocates warn.BT's rivals, including heavyweight Vodafone - which grew by stealing mobile business from the former monopolies - are calling for closer monitoring of the new leader and a full separation of the Openreach unit that makes its network available to competitors.""Some operators can use their networks as a fortress,"" Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao told an audience of lobbyists and policy makers at an event in Brussels on Thursday. ""We cannot afford to have remonopolization in Europe.""MORE DEALS COMING It remains to be seen whether the big firms' stronger positions will result in higher prices for consumers. In Austria where the market went from four to three mobile players in 2013, the cost for average phone and text users rose by 29 percent between September 2013 and December 2014, while mobile data users saw costs jump 78 per cent, according to the Vienna Chamber of Labour.Senior executives at major telecoms groups say raising prices across the board remains difficult so instead they must focus on high-end customers to sell bigger buckets of mobile data or faster broadband, both of which bring in more revenue. Bankers and industry executives predict more mergers and acquisitions in Europe, perhaps eventually across borders.""Some like Deutsche Telekom, Telenor, Teliasonera will eventually consolidate the markets outside their home country,"" said one banker.But he added that so far the likes of Altice (AS:ATCE), Hutchison (HK:0013) and Iliad founder Xavier Niel were better placed to buy assets because they had billionaire founders behind them with big ambitions and were unafraid to load up on debt. The trio has done recent deals in Portugal, Britain and Switzerland respectively.Ramon Fernandez, the chief financial officer of French incumbent Orange, said he was glad the tough times were over but added the company had emerged stronger.As part of the sector shake-out, Orange had to slim down, cutting 1.6 billion euros in costs and prompting a 57 percent rise in its share price in 2014. That, says Fernandez, means it is now in a far better position to compete.""When your valuation multiples are closer to your competitors, it gives you more flexibility in expansion opportunities because you can pay for deals in share and cash,"" he said.Bruno Grandsard, an investor at Axa Investment Managers, said there was further upside in the European telecom sector especially because of the high dividend yields on offer in an environment of low interest rates.""The continued decline in profitability is ending, you can start dreaming about future growth, and the M&A story is not complete,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

175,"Jan 26, 2015 12:50PM ET",Europe's telecoms heavyweights call for lighter 'net neutrality' rules,nan,"By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should not force telecoms operators to treat all the traffic on their networks equally as it crafts rules on ""net neutrality"", several industry bodies said on Monday.The reaction comes a week after Latvia, which holds the rotating European presidency, tabled a compromise text on net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, under which telecoms operators would face strict rules on when they can intervene to manage traffic.Four industry bodies representing the likes of Vodafone (L:VOD), Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA), Orange (PA:ORAN) and Liberty Global (O:LBTYA) called on the EU to allow them manage internet traffic to meet the different needs of all consumers.""It is not technologically efficient or beneficial for consumers if all traffic is treated equally. Nor has this ever been the case,"" the letter, seen by Reuters and signed by ETNO, Cable Europe, the GSMA and Make The NetWork, says.Under the Latvian proposal, internet service providers would be obliged to treat all traffic equally, except when their networks face ""exceptional ... congestion"", or they are ordered to block some content by a court, or they need to intervene to ensure the security of the network.Providers would also be free to offer specialized services, typically at higher speed and guaranteed quality, as long as broader internet access is not impaired.Telecoms firms say the ability to offer specialized services is key to innovation in the digital sector, such as in the areas of connected cars and e-health, and that strict rules would only stifle that.But supporters of net neutrality counter that if left unregulated, specialized services could crowd out other content and degrade the quality of the Internet.U.S. President Barack Obama has come out in favor of strict net neutrality rules in the United States and said operators should be banned from offering paid ""fast lane"" deals with content companies, for example Netflix (O:NFLX). The EU has been debating net neutrality for more than a year as part of reforms to its telecoms sector.EU lawmakers voted on strict net neutrality rules in April last year and any eventual compromise text agreed among EU governments would have to be squared with the parliament's position.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

177,"Jan 16, 2015 11:20AM ET",EU considers domestic-rate data roaming allowance for travelers,nan,"By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union consumers could pay domestic rates to access mobile internet data across the 28-nation single market under EU Council proposals to grant travelers an allowance capped at their home tariffs.The ""roam like at home"" option put forward by Latvia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, garnered the support of most member states at a Council meeting this week, EU diplomats said, paving the way for legislation to be drafted.A first draft is expected in around two weeks, diplomats said, although it could still undergo further changes. Once member states in the Council agree on a position, they can negotiate with EU lawmakers and the executive European Commission to arrive at a final version.Last year, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to flatten roaming fees within the EU by the end of 2015, as data-hungry consumers complained of the high and opaque cost of using their devices abroad. Under the current system, network providers pay their overseas counterparts a fee for each megabyte (MB) of data used by their customers abroad, then pass this cost on to consumers in their monthly bill.But the cost to consumers of accessing data abroad is frequently much higher than at home. In some well-publicized cases, travelers have received bills of thousands of euros on their return.According to the proposal, operators would have to provide data to consumers abroad at domestic rates up to a limited allowance, which has not been specified.Beyond this allowance, operators will not be able to charge consumers more than the maximum wholesale prices, currently 0.05 euros per minute or MB of data. Many consumers pay over 0.20 euros per minute or MB of data abroad.Member states with cheap domestic rates, such as those in eastern Europe, worry that their operators will be forced to hike domestic prices if the wholesale tariffs they pay other operators when their customers travel abroad are not lowered.Latvia's paper says the proposed system would avoid the situation where retail roaming prices would be lower than wholesale costs.But depending on the size of the domestic-rate allowance, the legislation could lead to a flattening of data prices across the single market if companies in cheaper markets have to cover the cost of their customers using data abroad.Telecoms companies have said ending roaming charges prematurely would hurt their revenues.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Orange said Telesocial has already taken the company to two French courts including the Paris Court of Appeal based on the same complaints, but in both cases the claims were rejected.  ""This reinforces our view that Telesocial's complaints are totally lacking in merit,"" the group said in an emailed statement. The complaints relate to an application that lets users make phone calls via their Facebook profiles.  According to an earlier report in the Financial Times on the subject, Telesocial said that the PartyCall app, launched in November 2012 by Orange, was based on its own code that it shared with the company during negotiation of a deal that the telecom carrier later dropped.  Telesocial's complaint included server logs that it claims show several Orange employees gaining unauthorized access to its servers to ""copy and reverse engineer Telesocial's proprietary application and related technologies."" A Telesocial spokesman said on Wednesday that ""it is not Telesocial but Orange which has had its case dismissed twice in France"", adding that Telesocial had not called for a full examination of the case in France at this stage.

The UK Competitive Telecommunications Association (UKCTA), said other companies should be allowed to lay their own cables in BT ducts and use their own equipment to control BT cables, saying it would improve service and encourage innovation. The group, which includes firms such as Sky  , EE (PA:ORAN) (DE:DTEGn), TalkTalk (L:TALK) , Virgin Media (O:LBTYA) and Vodafone (L:VOD), also said many consumers did not know who was responsible for the network when services were disrupted. BT's network business Openreach, which manages the national telecoms network, continues to dominate the business end of the market, 30 years after the company was privatised. A BT spokesman said in a statement that forcing Openreach to open up access to BT ducts would increase costs and that the company was voluntarily publishing its service performance to reflect its commitment to improving service. ""The UK has a vibrant wholesale business connectivity market, with strong competition and innovation amongst a large number of providers,"" he said.

184,"Nov 05, 2014 10:15AM ET","Britain wants mobile phone operators to tackle ""not-spots""",nan,"By Paul Sandle and Ankush Sharma (Reuters) - The British government said on Wednesday it could force mobile phone network operators to improve coverage in rural parts of the country for simple voice calls and text, eliminating so-called ""not-spots"". One possible solution would be to introduce a compulsory national roaming plan which would switch users' phones to whichever network gives the strongest signal, the government said, in announcing a range of proposals. The government has set a deadline of Nov. 26 for the industry and other interested parties to respond. ""It can't be right that in a fifth of the UK people cannot use their phones to make a call,"" said Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. ""The government isn't prepared to let that situation continue,"" he said. Network operators, however, who have spent billions of pounds on building their networks, are fiercely opposed to sharing them with rivals. EE, the country's largest mobile operator, said national roaming would affect network reliability and might also lead to price rises. EE is a joint venture of Deutsche Telekom and France's Orange SA. Vodafone agreed, saying such a scheme would be technically far more complex than international roaming, slow to implement and could cause problems with network resilience. ""National roaming would also be extremely challenging from a legal and regulatory perspective as UK mobile operators have paid the government hundreds of millions of pounds for spectrum licences on the basis of existing regulation founded on the principle of competing networks,"" the company said.  MAST SHARING The three other options proposed by the government are: to increase infrastructure sharing by enabling operators to put transmitters on each other's masts; obliging the networks to cover a certain percentage of the UK; giving mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) access to all four of the national networks. Analyst Matthew Howett at consultancy firm Ovum said a combination of infrastructure sharing and tougher obligations was the most likely outcome of the consultation. ""While national roaming sounded attractive to those with coverage issues, it is a messy solution that ought to be abandoned,"" he said. He also noted that the government's plan only dealt with voice services carried on older 2G networks. Licences for new 4G mobile broadband services include tougher obligations, for example a requirement in one licence to serve 98 percent of the population by 2017.  The lower frequencies used for 4G services also range over larger areas, making them better for rural coverage, although 4G networks do not yet carry voice calls. As well as upsetting the mobile industry, Javid's proposals also put him on a collision course with a ministerial colleague, according to a report in The Times on Wednesday. The paper said that a confidential letter it has seen from Home Secretary Theresa May said the proposals by Javid for switching networks could jeopardise the fight against terrorism, by complicating the ability of security agencies to intercept suspect calls. National roaming, and another proposal to allow a company to launch services using all four networks, ""could have a detrimental impact on law enforcement, security and intelligence agency access to communications data and lawful intercept"", the newspaper quoted her as saying. The Home Office said it would not comment on a leaked document.  (Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan; Editing by James Dalgleish and Greg Mahlich) "

189,"Jul 31, 2014 07:02PM ET",France's Iliad challenges Sprint for control of T-Mobile,nan,"By Soyoung Kim and Leila Abboud PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - French telecommunications company Iliad SA (PA:ILD) has made a surprise offer for T-Mobile US Inc (N:TMUS), setting up a potential bidding war with Sprint Corp (N:S), the U.S. mobile carrier now controlled by Japan's Softbank Corp (T:9984).Iliad, which has shaken up the French mobile and broadband market in the past decade with its cheap, pared-down subscriber plans, bid $15 billion in cash for 56.6 percent of T-Mobile US at $33 per share, it said in a statement on Thursday.The Paris-based company said its offer for the fourth-largest U.S. carrier values all of T-Mobile at $36.20 per share, a premium of 42 percent over the pre-announcement share price.That is less than the roughly $40 per share Sprint agreed to pay under the broad terms of an agreement worked out with Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), T-Mobile's majority owner. The terms of that proposal, which followed months of talks and which was reported by Reuters in early June, would value T-Mobile at nearly $32 billion.Deutsche Telekom and Sprint declined to comment, and a representative for Softbank could not be reached.Despite Iliad's lower offer, a person close to the French company said founder Xavier Niel believes he has a strong card to play because his bid would not face the antitrust scrutiny that confronts Sprint in trying to merge the third and fourth-biggest U.S. mobile operators.""SoftBank has been told in many very clear coded words that the Department of Justice and the FCC would probably not approve the acquisition,"" said Reed Hundt, a former chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. ""There's no question to me that the FCC would say 'bienvenue'"" to the proposed Iliad deal.The FCC and Department of Justice expressed a desire earlier this year to have at least two more network operators competing against AT&T and Verizon.The T-Mobile offer is Niel's most audacious attempt at extending his reach beyond France, Monaco and Israel, where he owns part of operator Golan Telecom. Still, his bid to enter the United States mobile market is a long shot, some investors and analysts say.The French company specializes in broadband and lacks experience in mobile, T-Mobile's main business, having launched its mobile service only in 2012. It is also unfamiliar with the demands of competing in the United States, with its massive coverage needs and deep-pocketed competition from AT&T Inc (N:T) and Verizon Communications Inc (N:VZ), the market leaders.Iliad expects $10 billion in savings from the deal, although it is unclear where they would come from because the company has no U.S. operations.The Iliad offer could falter on price alone, said Joseph Mastrogiovanni and Michael Baresich, analysts at CreditSuisse.""We are sceptical that T-Mobile and its shareholders, including Deutsche Telekom, will find this bid attractive,"" they wrote in a research note. ""However, it could put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather later.EMPIRE BUILDINGFew doubt the scale of Neil's ambitions. The entrepreneur, an unknown outsider in France when he started out, has joined the elite, lunching with ministers, starting a tech school, and holding part ownership of the influential Le Monde newspaper.He earned his first fortune from an adult chat and dating service on the Minitel, a rudimentary computer network that pre-dated the Internet in France. He then surfed on a wave of market liberalisation in telecoms to create Iliad.In many ways Niel is similar to Masayoshi Son, the head of Softbank and his rival for T-Mobile US. Both have operated their companies as challengers who cut prices and take on larger rivals with bigger resources.Niel sees the U.S. market as ripe for the kind of challenge Iliad mounted in France, where its entry into the mobile market in 2012 sent prices down 30 percent and hurt the profits of bigger rivals Orange SA (PA:ORAN) and SFR, as well as Bouygues SA (PA:BOUY). He ranks 133rd on Forbes' list of billionaires, with a net worth of $9.5 billion.Son, who is also Sprint's chairman, has pledged to start a price war in the United States, and he has said industry consolidation would allow Sprint to compete more effectively against Verizon and AT&T. He owns 19.3 percent of Softbank and is 46th on the Forbes list, with a net worth of $18.4 billion.T-MOBILE TURNAROUNDT-Mobile would appear well-suited for the role of challenger championed by Niel and Son. Last year, it turned around years of subscriber losses using a strategy that eliminated contracts, restructured plans and set off a race to slash prices across the industry.Earlier on Thursday, T-Mobile posted a net profit after a year of losses, and reported the industry's largest post-paid phone subscriber additions of the quarter.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere, known for his outspoken and sometimes abrasive style, has come to define T-Mobile's new audacity, epitomized by his frontal attacks on competitors, offering to pay early termination fees for customers who defect from rivals, for example.""We know this is a scale industry. Scale brings advantage,"" T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter told Reuters earlier on Thursday.""What we've seen so far is a glimpse of what real competition in this industry looks like. If we could turbo-charge it, it could be an incredible opportunity to bring more competition to the market.""BIG BITE FOR ILIADIliad said it would finance its offer, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, through a mix of equity and debt, and that it already had the backing of unnamed international banks.Nevertheless, the deal would be a big bite for Iliad. Its market capitalization of just above $16 billion compared with about $25 billion for T-Mobile US.T-Mobile owner Deustsche Telekom will now have the benefit of two bidders.A person at Deutsche Telekom familiar with the talks also said a deal with Iliad had a certain appeal because of the lower risk of being blocked by U.S. regulators.Three years ago, regulators rejected AT&T's $39 billion bid for T-Mobile US, which resulted in AT&T paying Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's full owner, a reverse break-up fee of $6 billion in cash and U.S. mobile assets.T-Mobile shares closed up 6.5 percent at $32.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. Sprint shares were down 5.3 percent at $7.35.(Reporting by Edwin Chan in San Francisco, Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore, Marina Lopes, Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh in Washington, Harro Ten Wolde and Peter Maushagen in Frankfurt; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Greg Mahlich, Tom Brown and Andre Grenon)"

191,"Jul 02, 2014 09:00PM ET",Asian stocks tread water ahead of U.S. jobs data,nan,"By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks lingered near three-year highs on Thursday as investors waited for the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report to see if the economy is gaining momentum. Spreadbetters saw a mixed open for Europe, forecasting Britain's FTSE .FTSE to open up as much as 0.1 percent higher, Germany's DAX .GDAXI 0.1 percent lower and France's CAX .FCHI effectively flat. Expectations rose on Wednesday after payrolls processor ADP said U.S. private-sector hiring hit a 1-1/2-year high in June.  The upbeat ADP report heightened expectations that June U.S. nonfarm payrolls due at 1230 GMT would show the American economy was picking up speed after a dismal start to the year, helping boost demand for metals such as zinc and copper. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 rose to as high as $7,145 a tonne, its highest level since late February. ""People were saying, 'What is cheap in the world?' They figured out the metals were cheap and if things accelerated a little bit, why not take a position?"" said analyst Dominic Schnider of UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. MET/L Asian equity markets were little changed, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS steady after inching up to briefly touch a new three-year peak. Tokyo's Nikkei .N225 flitted in and out of negative territory, although analysts expected a positive U.S. jobs data reading to make up for any modest losses. ""If the data shows that the U.S. economy is in good health, Japanese shares in the auto and technology sector will likely be bought,"" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. A Reuters poll forecast non-farm payroll gains of 212,000. The data will be released on Thursday because U.S. markets are closed for Independence Day on Friday, the day the report is usually released. Investors are also keeping an eye on a European Central Bank meeting later on Thursday, although market participants do not expect the ECB to do much after it eased policy last month. The focus was on whether the ECB mentions quantitative easing or verbally warns against the strength of the euro, which has crawled higher against the dollar despite last month's easing. The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 101.87 yen JPY=, helped after the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 1-1/2 week high on the strong ADP report. The euro stood little-changed at $1.3648 EUR= after shedding 0.15 percent overnight. The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.9382 AUD=D4, after the central bank warned that investors were underestimating the risk of a sharp fall in the currency. It was knocked down from an eight-month peak the previous day on disappointing trade data. In commodities, crude oil extended losses after falling the previous day on encouraging signs of supply from Libya and Iraq. O/R U.S. light crude CLc1 fell 0.4 percent to $104.07 per barrel. Gold also slipped amid the possibility of bullish U.S. jobs data denting the appeal of the safe-haven metal. GOL/ Spot gold XAU= fell 0.3 percent to $1,323.55 an ounce, pulling back from a 3-month high of $1,332.10 hit earlier this week as tensions in Iraq and Ukraine stoked safe-haven demand.

Thursday led by defensive sectors, with investors encouraged by
data showing U.S. factory activity cooling in August but still
expanding.	The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
ended 0.7 percent higher at 973.39 points, gaining ground for
the seventh time in nine sessions.	 But the recovery rally following a 20-percent nosedive in
four weeks was seen fragile, with relatively thin volumes this
week.	 Defensive shares with big dividend yields were in demand on
Thursday, with Deutsche Telekom  rising 2.2 percent,
GlaxoSmithKline up 1.4 percent , Vodafone up 2.1
percent and France Telecom up 1.4 percent.	 The four stocks have dividend yields ranging from 5.7
percent to 10.5 percent, well above the benchmark 10-year Bund
yields of 2.1 percent.	 Valerie Gastaldy, head of Paris-based technical analysis
firm Day By Day, said despite this week's recovery investors
shouldn't rush to buy equities even if valuation levels look
attractive.	 ""The heart of the problem is in the bottom-up analysis,
which highlights interesting mid-term opportunities, while
top-down analysis highlights a clear deterioration in risk
conditions,"" she said, referring to recent sluggish macro
economic data.	 ""Either the market purges one last time, and puts the record
straight ... or we are entering a very high dispersion phase,
with sector rotation and intra-sector rotation which is
difficult to anticipate. In both cases, there is no urgency to
buy.""	  BAD, BUT NOT AS BAD AS FEARED	 The U.S. ISM index of national factory activity edged down
to 50.6 from 50.9 in July, remaining at its lowest level since
July 2009. However, analysts had been expecting the index to
fall to 48.5.	 ""All in all, the deterioration of the U.S. economy isn't as
bad as feared by the consensus, which is very 'bear'. But
activity remains fragile,"" said Arnaud Cayla, fund manager at
Barclays Wealth Managers France.	 ""However, the market might start to expect further measures
from the (Federal Reserve's) FOMC (Federal Open Market
Committee) while inflationary pressures have abated.""	 Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index rose 0.5 percent,
France's CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent, while Germany's DAX
index tumbled 0.9 percent.	 Charts show cyclicals-heavy DAX index , hard hit
over the past month, remains the weakest European benchmark
index in the short term.	 The German blue-chip index remains in the lower band of its
Bollinger Bands -- a momentum indicator that uses standard
deviations away from a simple moving average, while the Euro
STOXX 50 , the FTSE 100, the CAC 40 , Spain's
IBEX and Italy's FTSE MIB are all in the upper
band of their respective Bollinger Bands.	 The DAX sank 19.2 percent in August, underperforming
Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300, which lost 10.6 percent over
the same period.	 Last month Italy, France, Spain and Belgium put in place a
ban on short selling of shares of financial institutions, which
also applies to derivatives based on indexes that contain
financial shares such as the CAC 40 and the Euro STOXX 50.	 The charts also show the Bollinger Bands for all the indexes
sharply narrowing over the past few sessions, which usually
warns of a sharp move that could come in the short term.

223,"Apr 29, 2011 04:24AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Dollar eyes low road,nan," * Dollar seen on downward path post-Fed * ECB, BoE meetings keep focus on European rate policy * Spanish 5-yr bond auction key for peripheral debt markets  By Carolyn Cohn LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - The prospect of low U.S.
interest rates for some time is likely to trigger more dollar
selling next week, with upcoming central bank meetings in Europe
serving as a reminder of greater chances of rate rises
elsewhere. The Federal Reserve's promise this week of continued
ultra-loose monetary policy in the world's largest economy has
taken U.S. and global shares to new peaks -- the Nasdaq index
 hit 10-year highs and the MSCI index of world stocks hit its
highest in nearly three years. At the Fed's first post-meeting press conference, chairman
Ben Bernanke also soothed stock markets by saying inflation was
a transitory problem. The upshot is that the dollar is looking like the carry
trade of choice -- as a low-yielding borrowing tool to buy
higher-yielding currencies -- especially after the European
Central Bank raised rates in April. The dollar is hitting three-year lows against an index of
currencies, as well as its lowest since the Bretton Woods system
collapsed in 1973 against the inflation-adjusted version of the
Fed's broad trade-weighted index. The weak dollar and persistent
inflation concerns have propelled gold and silver to record
highs. The ECB holds its policy meeting on Thursday, with analysts
seeing a 90 percent probability of no change to current euro
zone rates of 1.25 percent. But they see a 45 percent
probability of a rate hike by end-June. ""Markets are positioned for further interest rate hikes from
the ECB,"" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe at
Standard Chartered. ""But if we have an indication next week that the ECB is
likely to raise rates in June, that's sooner than the market is
anticipating and would be euro-supportive and dollar-negative.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For POLL-Reuters ECB May pre-meeting poll results, see For POLL-Reuters BOE May pre-meeting poll results, see
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The dollar's fall is also an indication of structural
worries about the U.S. economy, its deficits, its ageing
population and the vulnerabilities inherent in a far-from-secure
reserve currency status. ""The euro is going up because it is the prime reserve
alternative to the dollar,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.  The euro has spurted nearly 2 percent since Monday's close,
and analysts expect it to pack on another two cents in the next
week or two, to hit $1.50 for the first time since Dec 2009. The U.S. economy is still showing some signs of life,
however, with employment data on Friday seen giving a further
sturdy boost to non-farm payrolls in April, following a 216,000
increase in March.  EQUITY TREND If U.S. and European first-quarter earnings data next week
continue the current trend, they will also support a bright
equity outlook. Of 248 S&P 500 companies that have reported first quarter
earnings, 78 percent beat or met expectations, and 22 percent
came in below, according to data from Thomson Reuters StarMine. For the 81 STOXX Europe 600 companies which reported so far,
a slightly less stellar 58 percent beat or met expectations. Major European companies to report first quarter earnings
next week include Siemens and France Telecom and banks RBS and
Commerzbank. In the U.S., earnings are due from Kellogg, Time Warner and
AIG.  GOVERNOR WATCH In addition to the ECB's post-meeting press conference,
which takes place in Helsinki, president Jean-Claude Trichet
speaks again at a conference in Finland, alongside his likely
successor, Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, and other
central bank governors. The Bank of England also meets next week, with an 80 percent
probability seen of no change in rates of 0.50 percent. But
another quarter point is expected on rates by the end of the
third quarter. Britons go to the polls on Thursday in a referendum on the
way legislators are elected, along with local elections in some
areas. The vote lacks headline appeal but is likely to show up
cracks in the coalition government, which is attempting to push
through tough austerity measures. ""We fear that the UK will experience a long period with poor
growth which can result in a larger rise in the debt burden than
currently anticipated,"" Danske analysts said in a note.  ""There is a good chance that rates will be kept at record
lows for a long time. The weak underlying growth and the tough
fiscal austerity measures crowd out monetary normalisation."" In bond markets, Spain auctions five-year debt on Thursday
as investors continue to fret about the euro zone periphery, in
particular the possibility of Greek debt restructuring. The worries have punched out peripheral debt spreads against
core German debt. But for now, the euro is proving resilient to
the debt woes. (Additional reporting by Dominic Lau and Jessica Mortimer;

 (Adds analyst comment, share reaction) WARSAW, April 21 (Reuters) - Shrinking fixed-line revenues
and a one-off charge pulled first-quarter net profit at Poland's
top telecom TPSA well below expectations, with the company
stressing its full-year goals remain intact. Shares in the France Telecom affiliate fell 2 percent drop
on Thursday as it posted a 34-percent drop in net earnings to
189 million zlotys ($69.3 million), compared with 268 million
seen by analysts polled by Reuters. ""The results do seem to be in-line with the company's
overall guidance, but they are below expectations,"" IDM SA
analyst Jakub Viscardi said. ""Operating results disappoint and
do not provide for a comfortable look into the future."" First-quarter earnings were hit by 51 million zlotys in
accelerated amortisation, the company said, as the incumbent
operator switches to a 3G network. The operator, which is scrambling to cut costs, has suffered
years of declining revenues from a market slowdown and a
regulatory drive to boost competition. Despite a 0.6-percent uptick for the local telecoms market
in the last quarter, TPSA sales fell 3.7 percent to 3.729
billion zlotys compared with 3.787 billion seen by analysts, hit
by lower regulatory fees for mobile text messages. Further cuts in mobile termination rates (MTRs), the fees
operators charge for calls to route through their networks, are
expected to depress TPSA sales 2-4.5 percent this year after a
5.1-percent fall in 2010, but level off in 2012. The group expects the market may fall a tad this year, sees
its 2011 core profit (EBITDA) margin reaching 36-37 percent and
aims to have free cash flow of at least 2.4 billion zlotys this
year, compared with 2.45 billion last year. This year's results will be skewed by the 1.7 billion zloty
sale of its unit Emitel, while last year's were hit by 1.1
billion in new provisions for claims in a decade-long row with
Danmark's GN Store Nord's unit DPTG.

 (Adds details from press conference, vendors)  By Leila Abboud  PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom plan to jointly buy network gear, mobiles and other
information technology to save money, the two groups said on
Monday. The project could save about 1.3 billion euros ($1.9
billion) annually after three years -- a little under 900
million euros for France Telecom and around 400 million for
Deutsche Telekom, they said. The venture is an extension of a co-operation initiative the
two groups unveiled in February covering areas such as mobile
network sharing in Europe and giving customers wireless Internet
on each other's networks. European telecom operators face sluggish growth and tough
price competition and are searching for ways to cut costs to
improve profitability. With the advent of smartphones and tablet computers, data
traffic is exploding on networks, requiring steep investments. ""We see significant growth in data and pressure on tariffs,
so our procurement needs to be as efficient as possible,"" said
Edward Kozel, Deutsche Telekom's director of technology. The new venture will begin to renegotiate some 13 billion
euros worth of contracts in the fourth quarter, said France
Telecom executive vice-president Olaf Swantee.   NETWORK SAVINGS The companies expect the biggest savings to come from
network gear. They also hope to save on the 45 million handsets
they buy a year. Supply firms in the firing line include equipment makers
like Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens Networks. ""It means another headache for the supply industry,"" said
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at CCS Insight. The two companies are already trimming their portfolios to
focus on countries where they have scale. Deutsche Telekom is
selling its T-Mobile USA unit to AT&T while France Telecom is
reviewing European operations outside France. Several analysts on Monday said the JV could rekindle
speculation on an eventual tie-up but banking sources told
Reuters recently that such a deal was unlikely. France Telecom shares were down 0.8 percent at 15.52 euros,
while Deutsche Telekom's were flat at 11.25 euros by 0906 GMT.

 (Adds quotes, shares, detail, background) By Leila Abboud PARIS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - France Telecom said on Thursday it
did not expect sales to improve in the fourth quarter and said
measures aimed at easing tensions with staff after a string of
suicides could cost up to 1 billion euros. Europe's third biggest telecoms operator in terms of market
value has been deeply shaken by the recent suicide crisis, which
forced it to freeze its restructuring in France until the end of
the year and prompted a management reshuffle. Hit by lower consumer spending, regulatory decisions and
foreign exchange impacts, the group posted a bigger-than-
expected 6.4 percent slide in third-quarter sales and lower
profits. However, it managed to keep margins relatively stable by
trimming investments in communications networks. Finance Director Gervais Pellissier said the suicide crisis
was not affecting sales in France to date. But he acknowledged
that the bottom line could be hit if the group saw new costs
imposed by ongoing negotiations with unions. ""If we decided to do a part-time work plan for older workers
that might lead to a provision on our accounts for 2009, but it
would have a positive effect on subsequent years."" Asked about whether the extra costs linked to the workers'
measures could add up to 1 billion euros, Pellissier said: ""That
order of magnitude is not fundamentally far from our working
hypothesis."" There have been 25 suicides at the firm since the beginning
of 2008. Unions blame the problem on poor working conditions caused
by France Telecom's drive to rationalise its operations and
lower costs in the face of declining sales.  SALES WOE ""We do not expect revenues to recover in the fourth quarter,
and it is too early to say how next year will go,"" Pellissier
said. ""There is a lot of uncertainty on when consumer spending
will pick up."" European telecom operators' revenues are under pressure so
many are focusing on cost cuts to maintain profits.. Some analysts suggest social tensions at France Telecom
could hamper or slow down the group's ability to deliver the 1.7
billion euros in costs cuts it has pledged for the end of 2011.
One third of the cuts are supposed to come in France, where it
earns about half its sales and profits. France Telecom is seen as less apt at cutting costs than
some of its peers, which has led its shares to underperform
rivals, one-London based analyst said, declining to be named. France Telecom shares have declined about 11 percent since
Jan. 1, even as the Dow Jones Telecom Index climbed 8.7
percent. Its third quarter sales reached 12.69 billion euros, below a
Reuters poll forecast of 12.81 billion while earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came at
4.56 billion euros, undershooting a forecast of 4.58 billion. The margin reached 35.9 percent against expectations of 35.7
percent. France Telecom shares were down 1.4 percent at 1042 GMT,
compared to a 0.4 percent fall in the DJ Stoxx European Telecom
index. For more on the suicide crisis at France Telecom, click on:For more on France's introduction of a fourth mobile phone

closing low on Wednesday, hurt by disappointing earnings from
Spain's Banco Santander and Germany's SAP and by U.S. new home
sales unexpectedly falling in September. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1.9
percent to 980.23 points, its biggest one-day decline since Aug.
17 and its lowest close since Oct. 5.
 The European benchmark is still up nearly 52 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9. Banks were among those taking most points off the index.
Banco Santander, the euro zone's biggest bank by market value,
fell 3.4 percent after it posted a 2.8 percent fall in

 (Adds CEO and analysts comments, market reaction) By Adrian Krajewski and Pawel Bernat WARSAW, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Poland's top telecoms group TPSA
 expects its fall in revenue to continue into next year as
fierce competition and price pressure from the regulator hit
margins and halved its third-quarter profit. The former state monopoly has suffered from a shrinking
fixed-line business, like its European peers, and recently lost
the top spot in the cellphone market. It has also been under
pressure from the telecoms regulator to cut mobile rates. ""We expect the market to keep eroding for now,"" TPSA chief
executive Maciej Witucki told reporters. ""I can confirm that the
full-year drop in our revenues should outpace the 7.6 percent
fall in the first three quarters."" By 0812 GMT, TPSA shares were the worst performers in
Warsaw's main WIG20 index, dropping 3 percent. TPSA, a unit of France Telecom, said net profit almost
halved to 327 million zlotys ($116 million) in the quarter,
compared with the 360 million seen in a Reuters poll. TPSA has been trying to shift its focus towards Internet and
television services, but revenue has remained under pressure.
Investors are awaiting a plan to revive its top line and
margins. The operator, which was expected to publish its mid-term
strategy with the third-quarter results, said it would instead
release it at the start of 2010 to include details of last
week's deal with the regulator, which lifted the threat of a
forced split-up of the company. TPSA committed to treat smaller rivals seeking access to its
infrastructure on a par with its own operations and to roll out
1.2 million broadband connections, which it estimates would cost
3 billion zlotys. Expectations that an agreement would chase away one of the
darkest clouds on TPSA's horizon had pushed its shares roughly a
third higher since falling to a record low in August. ""The agreement gives us and the market new possibilities,""
Witucki said. ""In the longer term our results should be getting
better thanks to that. But I wouldn't expect a sudden
improvement in our sales before the second half of 2010."" ""2010 is hard work, while 2011 is reaping the benefits."" Sales fell 11 percent in the third quarter to 4.06 billion
zlotys, compared with 4.13 billion seen by analysts. The drop
outpaced the sector's record 6 percent decline in the period. ""Revenue trend is disappointing,"" ING analyst Dalibor
Vavrushka said. ""Market expected the top line would not look
good, and the number came in even below that ... The good news
is TPSA is not losing market share in the mobile segment."" The company, which has a market capitalisation of around $9
billion, has previously said it expects sales to shrink this
year along with the rest of the Polish telecoms market.

inability to post convincing gains in recent days. The index had

236,"Oct 20, 2009 11:21AM ET",France Tel restructuring on hold until year end,nan," PARIS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - France Telecom said on Tuesday it
would put off any restructuring of sites or offices in France
until the end of the year, meeting a demand from labour unions. The telecom operator has suffered a series of suicides among
its workers that has seen 25 people take their own lives since
the beginning of 2008. Labour unions blame ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring
for creating poor working conditions that are pushing some
workers to the edge.  A spokesman for France Telecom said the promise not to
merge or close any sites through the end of the year had been
made in the context of ongoing negotiations with unions about
how to combat stress in the workplace. Earlier in the month, France Telecom said it would freeze
all worker transfers till the end of the year. The suicides have sparked a political and media storm in
France, with some political parties and unions calling for the
France Telecom CEO Didier Lombard to resign.  On Saturday, Lombard told French newspaper le Figaro he did
not plan to step aside and that measures were being taken to
tackle the situation. Analysts have been watching the situation carefully for
signs as to whether it will affect the performance of the group.

237,"Oct 07, 2009 06:03AM ET",France Telecom talks with unions on suicide spate,nan," * Management adopts conciliatory tone-union * New deputy CEO Richard in the spotlight * Unions want to end ""policing"" of staff, performance grades  By Leila Abboud  PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - France Telecom on Wednesday began a
second day of negotiations with unions on ways to reduce
workplace stress blamed by labour leaders for a spate of
suicides at Europe's third biggest telecoms company. The talks, which are expected to continue for several weeks,
are part of France Telecom's effort to calm the political
firestorm surrounding the deaths of 24 workers in the past 18
months. As sporadic strikes continued at sites across France, Labour
unions said management was more conciliatory on the first day of
talks, although points of contention remained, such as
performance reviews and controls on call centre workers. ""There has been a real change in tone that we can only be
pleased about,"" said Christian Pigeon, a representative of SUD
labour union. Analysts are closely watching the negotiations to gauge if
concessions by management will impact the group's restructuring
and cost-cutting drive. France Telecom has promised to reduce costs over the next
two years by 1.7 billion euros ($2.50 billion), an effort that
will go a long way to determine whether it can reach its free
cash flow target of 8 billion euros a year. Shares in France Telecom were trading mostly flat on
Wednesday morning, in line with the CAC 40 index but
outperforming a 0.7 percent lower DJ telecoms index. At the opening of the talks on Monday, Chief Executive
Didier Lombard promised ""a new social contract"" and pledged to
make employee well-being a priority. Freshly-named deputy CEO Stephane Richard, who has been
handed the task of calming the storm over the suicides and is
seen as a successor to Lombard, was also taking part in the
negotiations. The government, which is France Telecom's biggest
shareholder with 27 percent of shares, has also been closely
involved in trying to manage the fallout from the suicides. To better understand workers' concerns, ""all employees will
receive a questionnaire on stress in the workplace"" on October
19, said Lombard.  Christian Mathorel, a CGT union representative, was not
convinced that management would deliver on its pledges. CGT
wants the company to stop monitoring employees' calls, measuring
individual performance and giving managers headcount reduction
targets. ""We think the employees are still in danger,"" he said. ""If
we don't address the fundamental causes behind these dramatic
incidents, we will be negotiating in fear of new suicides.""

 (adds company extending restructuring freeze, union reaction,
share price) By Leila Abboud PARIS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - France Telecom on Monday appointed
a new leader of its French business to calm a political
firestorm over a spate of employee suicides and extended its
freeze on restructuring until the end of the year. Stephane Richard, a former top aide of France's economy
minister who is being groomed as next chief executive of the
former state-owned telecom operator, will take over immediately
from Louis-Pierre Wenes. Wenes, an ex-management consultant, was closely identified
with cost cuts and job moves blamed by union leaders for
creating a stressful atmosphere at Europe's third biggest
telecoms company. He became a polarising figure after saying in a recent 
interview the suicides affected only a ""a small handful"" of
employees who could not adapt and that the situation was ""not
that bad."" There have been 24 suicides at France Telecom since the
beginning of 2008 and 13 attempts, according to labour unions, a
pro rata rate broadly in line with the population as a whole. Some unions and left-wing political parties last week urged
CEO Didier Lombard to step aside after a worker threw himself
from a bridge but the government said Lombard had its full
confidence. Christian Pigeon, a labour union representative, said the
management shake-up would not be enough. ""We need more concrete
measures to improve working conditions for employees,"" he said.Unions have demanded an end to all restructuring and movement
of employees in France, no more out-sourcing, and reduction of
stress by hiring more workers. They've also called for two days
of strikes this week to protest working conditions at France
Telecom. Analysts say such policies could dent France Telecom's
profitability and hamper its ability to cut costs.  COST CUTS AT RISK The firm has said its plans to boost competitiveness and
efficiency aims to cut costs by 1.7 billion through 2011, with
32 percent of the amount to come from France. Although France Telecom has expanded internationally with
its Orange brand, especially in the U.K., Poland, and Spain, it
still earns about half of its revenues and operating profits in
its home market.  As part of its response to the suicides, the company set up
a telephone help line for employees and appointed a mediator to
field complaints on job re-assignments. The elevation of Richard to deputy CEO could be a sign that
the government, which is France Telecom's biggest shareholder
with 27 percent of its capital, could take a more active role in
the group.  ""With the replacement of Wenes by Richard, the state's
control of the group with be much tighter than before,"" said
labour union representative Pigeon. Michael Kovacocy, telecom analyst at Daiwa Securities, said
the appointment of Richard, 51, was a ""tolerable move to pacify
the press, labour and left-leaning political elements"" while
leaving current CEO in place and ""avoiding
damaging/destabilising change at France Telecom."" He wrote in a research note: ""Hopefully this will draw a
line under this issue and allow management to concentrate on its
stated cost control objectives,"" more of which will now have to
come from outside of France. Shares in France Telecom were roughly flat at 0811 GMT, in
line with the CAC 40 index.   (Additional reporting by Matthias Blamont and Dominique

239,"Oct 01, 2009 12:33PM ET",ANALYSIS-MTN-Bharti collapse shouldn't put off buyers,nan," * Emerging markets still attractive for telcos * Acquisitions back on agenda * Complexity of MTN-Bharti deal not the killer  By Victoria Howley and Georgina Prodhan LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A failed audacious bid to tie up
Africa's largest mobile phone company MTN with India's Bharti
Airtel is more likely to trigger fresh takeover interest in
emerging markets than put off prospective buyers. The collapse of the $24 billion deal was always likely
because MTN is a cherished national champion, but high growth
emerging markets still offer attractive targets for acquisitive
telecom companies. With political rather than commercial factors derailing the
transaction, which would have created the world's third largest
mobile operator, the failure is a statement about the attitude
of the South African authorities rather than the health of the
mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market. ""That this landmark deal almost happened will lead other
operators to pursue deals in Africa. It provides something of an
opportunity,"" said Paul Lambert, telecoms analyst at industry
research group Informa. ""Vodafone, France Telecom, China Mobile will definitely look
at them (opportunities in Africa) now. Telcos are in an
acquisitive mode to offset declining growth in their home
markets and they are looking in emerging markets,"" he added. MTN was such a difficult target not because Africa is an
emerging economic region and not only because of the South
African government's stake -- though these elements played their
part -- but largely because of its success. At the end of August, MTN posted headline earnings up 22
percent, revenue up 24 percent and subscribers up 14 percent for
the first half of the year. ""MTN is a viable business doing wonderfully well, a global
leader, so there is no compelling reason for the South African
government to give over control,"" says Emeka Obiodu, mobile
strategy analyst at telecoms and technology research firm Ovum. ""MTN doesn't need a turnaround. This was about scope."" The case of MTN contrasts with Vodafone's successful
acquisition of a majority stake in state-run Ghana Telecom last
year, which was both loss-making and debt-laden. Despite resistance from opposition politicians who branded
the sale a ""sell-out"", Ghana's government decided to take the
$900 million sale proceeds and invest it in state funds. A France Telecom-led consortium also managed to buy a
majority stake in Telkom Kenya in 2007, after several years of
losses at the Kenyan incumbent. Most of France Telecom's new
customers in the first half came from its African operations. A banking source, who asked not to be named because he is
unauthorised to speak to the press, said on Thursday that
operators including Vodafone and France Telecom had already run
the slide rule over Zain's African operations. These fast-growing assets could become available again if
Kuwaiti conglomerate the Kharafi Group's sale of a 46 percent
stake in the Zain group falls apart.
 ACQUISITIONS ON THE AGENDA Large, emerging-markets acquisitions are still unpopular
with telecoms investors, who generally favour the sector for its
steady cashflows and dividends rather than growth prospects. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone firm by revenues,
has pleased shareholders by guiding that it is only interested
in in-market consolidation rather than ambitious mergers, even
though its organic sales are falling. But current market conditions coupled with a prolonged
downturn in home markets may persuade normally conservative
Western telcos that current opportunities are too good to miss. In other sectors, rallying stock markets have encouraged
companies to put long-held acquisition plans back on the agenda. North American food group Kraft made an approach worth over
10 billion pounds ($16 billion) for British confectioner Cadbury
, an asset it has coveted for around two years. And Finnish retailer Kesko is considering buying in Russia,
where the consumer sector has been booming for much of the last
decade.   COMPLEXITY The complexity of the Bharti-MTN proposal, which involved
cash and share swaps, dual-listing discussions and competing
political interests has also been cited as a reason for its
failure, but plenty of other transactions are just as
challenging or in some cases even more complicated. Bankers point to scenarios involving hostile bids, multiple
buyers and situations where there is a side sale for some of the
assets as the most challenging in the dealmaker's repertoire. This hasn't stopped tough deals from happening. Carlsberg and Heineken bought underperforming UK brewer
Scottish & Newcastle last year for 7.8 billion pounds, splitting
the assets between them to avoid overpaying as well as
anti-trust concerns. (Additional reporting by Nicola Leske in Frankfurt, Editing

BASE and Mobistar SA have filed a complaint with European
antitrust regulators alleging Belgacom SA abused its dominant
position in its home market. The joint complaint -- filed in April but not previously
publicly revealed -- argued former state monopoly Belgacom
abuses its position in the Belgium broadband Internet market. ""Although Belgacom has offered us access to its ADSL2+ and
VDSL2 (fast Internet) networks, we feel that the conditions are
not fulfilled to allow for sufficient competition,"" a
spokeswoman for Mobistar said on Thursday. Mobistar, majority owned by France Telecom SA, is Belgium's
second-biggest mobile phone operator and also provides broadband
services. BASE, owned by Dutch telecoms operator Royal KPN NV, is
Belgium's third and smallest mobile operator and is active in
broadband through Tele2 Belgium, which KPN acquired in 2007. ""Belgacom has also caused us a number of operational
difficulties, for example when customers decide to move from
Belgacom to us,"" a spokesman for BASE said. But Belgacom said the operators had no grounds for
complaint. ""They have access to our network. These are regulated
prices which were approved by (Belgian telecoms regulator)
BIPT,"" a spokeswoman said. Earlier this week, antitrust prosecutors advising Belgium's
competition watchdog said Belgacom had engaged in a ""margin
squeeze"" aimed at driving out competition. In May, the competition authority imposed a 66.3 million
euro ($96.6 million) fine on Belgacom's mobile arm Proximus
after a complaint filed by BASE in 2005. ""We are counting on the fact that things will move forward
faster in Europe than in Belgium,"" BASE's spokesman said.

241,"Sep 30, 2009 12:39PM ET",France Telecom suicides could impact business-analysts,nan," * Could slow plan to cut costs by 1.7 billion by 2011 * Suicides put CEO Didier Lombard's position at risk * Share price down about 2 percent By Leila Abboud PARIS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A spate of suicides among
employees at France Telecom could dent the investor appeal of
the former state-owned monopoly if they lead to management
upheaval or slow the pace of cost cuts, analysts believe. As a media and political storm intensified around France
Telecom, some analysts have started to question whether the firm
will be able to deliver on its promise to cut costs by 1.7
billion euros through the end of 2011. The cost cuts, 32 percent of which are supposed to come in
France, are a crucial tool for France Telecom's plan to generate
8 billion euros in free cash flow in 2009, 2010, and 2011. ""It is possible that the planned restructuring might be
delayed,"" wrote one London-based analyst in a research note. ""The situation is weighing on the share price,"" said a 
Paris-based analyst, referring to the increasing tensions
between the company, its workers and the government. There have been 24 suicides at France Telecom since the
beginning of 2008 and 13 attempts, according to labour unions
who blame restructuring and poor working conditions for creating
a climate of stress and unhappiness.  A spokeswoman for France Telecom declined to comment on how
the suicides could affect the business. But in an interview with Reuters in New York last Thursday,
Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier acknowledged that the
situation posed a risk to the group. ""If we are not able to deal with the issue in the next
weeks, it's going to hurt our bottom line,"" said Pellissier.
""It's a serious issue. We have to deal with it."" After a 51-year old France Telecom worker jumped off a
highway overpass in Annecy on Monday, left-wing politicians,
including the opposition Socialist party, have called for Chief
Executive Didier Lombard to quit. Unions also called for Louis-Pierre Wenes, who heads
France operations, to stand down.  ""I don't think the situation will affect the company's
financial objectives, but it is a catastrophe in terms of its
brand image,"" said another Paris-based analyst.  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT The government, which is France Telecom's biggest
shareholder with a 27 percent stake, has voiced support for
Lombard via spokespeople who said ousting the CEO was not the
right answer.  ""We shouldn't have this reflex of thinking that cutting off
the head of the boss will solve all the problems in a company,""
said Jean-Francois Cope, the head of President Nicolas Sarkozy's
UMP group in the National Assembly. Under pressure from unions, Lombard has promised to freeze
all transfers of workers until the end of the month. Unions are also calling for a new early retirement scheme
like one in 1996 when France Telecom was transforming itself
from a government agency to a for-profit company. That program led 40,000 workers to leave the firm at a cost
of about 200,000 euros each and analysts fear a new scheme could
add another layer of costs. France Telecom's shares were down 2.02 percent to 18.15
euros per share at 1655 GMT, compared with a 1.15 percent
decline for the CAC 40 index. (Reporting by Leila Abboud)

about 16 percent in the quarter so far, which would make it the
index's best such period since the fourth quarter of 1998. The Xerox deal comes a week after another large buyout in
the tech sector, when Dell agreed to buy Perot Systems for
about $3.9 billion. ""The tech sector is going to be one of the first
beneficiaries of an economic rebound,"" Kenny said. ""The fact
that these deals are in the tech sector is a further piece of

end of the third quarter two days later could translate into
thin volume and volatility as fund managers reposition their
assets amid fewer market participants, investors said. Dutch biotech firm Crucell said Johnson & Johnson bought
14.6 million new Crucell shares for over $400 million as part
of a flu vaccine development deal. Crucell shares fell 6.1 percent to $22.25 on the Nasdaq. But blue-chip J&J's stock was up 1.3 percent at $61.43 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Dow Chemical advanced 3.7 percent to $26.07 after it said
the Federal Trade Commission had cleared the way for its $1.68
billion sale of Morton Salt to Germany's K+S AG to go ahead. Apple shares gained 2.1 percent to $186.19 on Nasdaq after
China Unicom said it would sell Apple's iPhone in China,
starting in October. France Telecom's Orange also said it would
sell the product later this year. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said its National
Activity Index was minus 0.9 in August, but its three-month
moving average of economic indicators improved for the seventh

255,"Sep 14, 2009 10:51AM ET",SNAP ANALYSIS-D.Telekom must make U.S move or take back seat,nan," (Corrects typographical error in second bullet point) * Sprint buy would come at cost of shareholder payout * Differing technologies pose significant obstacle * Deutsche Telekom may be using dealmaking momentum  By Nicola Leske, European Telecoms Correspondent FRANKFURT, Sep 14 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom will have to
make an expensive acquisition if it wants to sustain its role in
the cut-throat U.S. market -- even if that means cutting its
dividend. ""Deutsche Telekom will have to decide to stay in the U.S.
and grow at the cost of its dividend or to continue to give
value but quit the U.S.,"" said Michael Kovacocy, a senior
analyst at research group Metacommunicare. Speculation has swirled about a takeover of U.S. rival
Sprint Nextel -- valued at $11 billion -- by the German
incumbent ever since the U.S. company announced a huge goodwill
writeoff in February last year. Deutsche Telekom, which will not comment on Sprint rumours,
has vowed to keep an attractive dividend policy for shareholders
including the German government, which owns around 30 percent of
the company, and private equity firm Blackstone with just under
5 percent. For the past two years its has paid out 0.78 euros per
share. Its dividend yield is at 8.2 percent compared with France
Telecom at 7.7 percent, Telefonica at 6.3 percent and Vodafone
at 5.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. ""There is a strong commitment to key shareholders looking to
extract value, but not enough growth at group level to continue
high remuneration,"" Kovacocy said. ""There is no real growth
strategy, the emphasis currently is on extraction of value."" That may be changing.   DEALMAKING MOMENTUM Last week, Deutsche Telekom announced it planned to merge
its struggling UK wireless business with France Telecom's Orange
unit. Now all eyes are on the United States, where T-Mobile USA
is battling similar problems. ""Sprint is a story that needs to be closely monitored as
Deutsche Telekom's management, in our view, has gained
'dealmaking momentum' from its transaction in the UK
and it might be tempted to address the 'other major issue' it
has,"" UniCredit's Thomas Friedrich said. As in the British market, T-Mobile USA is the fourth player
in a maturing industry of five large operators. It is
underrepresented in the high-end corporate business. It would have to beef up spending considerably to catch up
with U.S. market leaders Verizon and AT&T. Currency effects hit company earnings, forcing Deutsche
Telekom to issue a profit warning in April. Chief Executive Rene Obermann, who took over in November
2006, has promised to ""fix, focus and grow"" the company. He has
reduced costs and staff, improved customer service and sold
non-core assets. But unlike charismatic former chief executive Ron Sommer,
Obermann may not be bold enough for a major acquisition such as
Sprint. He has preferred instead to acquire stakes in familiar 
markets such as the Netherlands or Greece or opting for a small
buy such as U.S.-based wireless outfit SunCom. It was under Sommer that Deutsche Telekom bought
Voicestream, an acquisition much critised at the time for being
too expensive but that later turned out to be a clever move.  BE BOLD Now, Deutsche Telekom may need to take another bold decision. Sprint stock was at its lowest in November, when it hit
$1.38. On Monday morning it rose 11 percent to $4.18. ""A move to buy out Sprint Nextel would remove a major threat

Kovacocy said, but added: ""Such a large transaction would carry
significant risks, both financial and executional."" Sprint had $19.6 billion in long-term debt at the end of the
second quarter and its network technology is not compatible with
the technology of T-Mobile USA. ""Sprint currently trades at 4.2 times estimated 2010 EBITDA.
We believe if Sprint were to be acquired, the board would
require a premium valuation in the neighborhood of 5x 2010E
EBITDA, which would equate to roughly $5.50/share,"" Michael
Nelson at Soleil/Nelson Alpha Research said . ""On the surface, we believe a Sprint/T-Mobile combination
makes strategic sense as both companies have been losing market
share and a merger would remove a competitor,"" he said, but 
warned the two networks posed ""significant integration risk"". There also may stumbling blocks connected to national pride. An acquisition of Sprint would need support from the German
government, which may be reluctant to see Deutsche Telekom shift
its attention to the United States from its home market. ""When Deutsche Telekom acquired Voicestream (now T-Mobile
USA) in the 1990s the German chancellor (Gerhard Schroeder) had
to support the deal and soften U.S. concerns about M&A from a
company with a large government stake,"" UniCredit's Friedrich
said. Deutsche Telekom could also opt for organic growth but that
would put some pressure on its dividend as well. ""They are between a rock and a hard place...an organic
growth path would mean they have to increase capex and that
would also put pressure on the dividend,"" said Kovacocy.  (Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)

staff through reorganisations but it was ""unimaginable"" to stop
restructuring, given competition and changing technology, he
said. ""Our results are comparable to those of our competitors. If
they went down, we would be at a disadvantage competing
internationally and we would have difficulties financing our
investments,"" Barberot said. ""We are evolving in a sector where technology and clients'

for a third straight session on Tuesday, buoyed by the return of
M&A activity and supported by hawkish economic data and with
heavyweight mining and energy stocks leading the gainers. The FTSE 100 closed 14.16 points higher, or 0.3 percent, at
4,947.34, hitting a fresh highest closing level in 11 months. The UK index is up 43 percent since its year low in March.
However, it remains 8.7 percent shy of its level prior to the
collapse of Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers a year ago, which
jolted the financial markets worldwide. ""It's been a session dominated by M&A activity yet again,""
said Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC Markets, referring to
Orange owner France Telecom's plan to merge with Deutsche
Telekom's T-Mobile, plus continued speculation about potential
suitors for Cadbury.Confectionery group Cadbury rose 0.4 percent amid hopes Kraft
Foods might have to raise its offer by up to 40 percent after
shares in the world's second biggest confectionary maker
increased by almost half on Monday on news of the approach. Cadbury rejected a $16.7 billion bid from North America's
biggest food group Kraft on Monday. Cazenove analysts said Nestle might make a counterbid for
Cadbury, perhaps in a joint approach with U.S. chocolate group
Hershey Co. Nestle declined to comment on Monday. Vodafone gained 1.7 percent, with traders citing relief that
it was not involved in expansion in the UK market, after
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom said they had launched
exclusive talks to merge their UK mobile units. Miners added the most points to the index, cashing in on a
buoyant gold price. Gold surged through the $1,000 an ounce mark
to its highest level since February, boosted by a weak dollar
and with investors looking for a hedge against inflation. Gold miner Randgold Resources gained 3.3 percent, while
Kazakhmys, Rio Tinto, Vedanta Resources and Lonmin rose 2.5 to
6.4 percent. Economic data also added to the blossoming view that the
domestic UK economy was emerging from recession. British manufacturing output rose at its fastest monthly
rate in 1-1/2 years in July, with factory output rising 0.9
percent, three times faster than analysts had expected, which
helped push up sterling as well as supporting stocks. ""The solid manufacturing data have given markets a bit of a

pointed to a flat employment market for the rest of the year,
said the Conference Board, a private research group. A survey by the British Retail Consortium showed UK retail
sales fell on the year last month for the first time since May
as cost-conscious consumers refrained from splashing out on
non-essential items. ""The mixed messages do not seem to be deterring traders from
pushing this market higher so instead of the September slump it
seems we may be in store for the September surge,"" said Yates. Oil stocks motored higher supported by the price of crude,
which rose more than $3 to beyond $71 a barrel, underpinned by
comments by delegates from an OPEC meeting that began on
Wednesday. Analysts said there may be more rhetoric on
compliance at the meeting but no change in output targets. BG Group, Cairn Energy, Tullow Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP
 climbed between 0.6 and 3.5 percent. Banks were the biggest losers as talk of new rules to
reshape the global financial system to prevent another Lehman
Brothers-style collapse, hung over the stocks. HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland shed 1.1 to 1.6
percent.

267,"Sep 08, 2009 11:24AM ET",SNAP ANALYSIS-Rivals set to gain from UK mobile merger,nan," * Rivals could benefit if JV partners struggle to integrate * Analyst says deal is best outcome for Vodafone, O2 * JV unlikely to ditch Orange brand  By Kate Holton LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom's deal to combine their UK units faces big challenges
despite potentially large savings for the two groups, and may
benefit rivals in the short term. Analysts said Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom may have
made life easier for the rivals by reducing the number of
operators jostling for share, and any delay or conflict between
the two partners could magnify this advantage. ""We are not naive,"" said Gervais Pellissier, France Telecom
CFO, on a conference call with media and analysts. ""There will
be disagreements.""  Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom said on Tuesday they
planned to merge their British mobile units in a 50:50 joint
venture that would grab the top spot ahead of current leaders O2
of Telefonica and Vodafone. But the move will help all operators as the new entity
focuses on integration in a sector where customer loyalty is
low. ""In our view this is the best result for Vodafone and
Telefonica,"" RBS said in a note to clients. ""We remain nervous
that longer term the JV may have to compromise on strategy,
while they benefit from a consolidated market without having to
commit capital."" Citigroup analyst Terence Sinclair also suggested that the
new joint venture would be likely to focus on building
profitability rather than grabbing as many customers as
possible, meaning that prices would stay firm for others. Other analysts pointed out that partnerships have often
proved difficult in the telecoms industry, such as Vodafone's
ventures in the United States and France. But one banker on the deal told Reuters the agreement was a
way of bringing about change at minimal cost in a difficult
market and still creating billions of pounds of synergies. ""An operator who paid (for consolidation) would be a gift to
everyone else,"" he said. The joint venture deal follows months of speculation that
either of Vodafone or 02 would bid for T-Mobile UK, after it
said it would consider all options following a massive
writedown. The main operators had all opened up to the idea of
in-market consolidation after seeing pressure on prices slash
operating margins to well below European averages.  REGULATOR CALLING The new joint venture may also face other challenges, in
terms of appeasing British and European regulators and deciding
which brand, if either, will survive.  The companies said they would maintain the same brands --
Orange and T-Mobile UK -- for the next 18 months and then agree
with shareholders on the next move.  They could continue to run both brands, choose one or create
something new entirely, although Orange is unlikely to want to
ditch the brand it uses across its portfolio, especially in the
market where it launched. ""We both have huge brand loyalty in the UK and spent a lot
of money to build that up,"" Orange UK chief executive, and head
of the new joint venture, Tom Alexander, told reporters. ""That
won't be thrown away lightly."" That kind of debate however worried analysts, who were
looking further down the line for any disagreements. Robin Bienenstock, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said that
the synergies would be ""large and meaningful"" yet she noted
further cost reductions would be hampered if the firms kept both
brands alive.  ""If they don't cut one of the brands eventually, the
synergies will be one billion lower than they say they will be,""
said Bienenstock.  Hours after the companies outlined their plans for the new
venture, analysts and industry insiders were already looking
further down the line, to how long the venture would last. Industry sources familiar with the negotiations said the
joint venture could eventually be floated or Deutsche Telekom
could sell or float its stake, but added there was no rush. Deutsche said it was committed to 3 years to the venture. (Additional reporting by Nicola Leske, Kirstin Ridley and

up 0.5 percent at midday on Tuesday, rising for the third
consecutive session and flirting with 11-month highs, with
miners shining as gold hurdled the $1,000 mark. Propelled by technical momentum and a drop in the dollar,
spot gold vaulted the $1,000 per ounce psychological barrier on
Tuesday, just shy of last year's record high of $1,030.80, while
prices of other metals such as copper and nickel also surged. At 1108 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.5 percent at 980.30 points, not far from an
11-month high of 986.59 points touched in late August. Miners were the top gainers, with Rio Tinto up 3.1 percent,
Anglo American up 2.9 percent and Xstrata up 2.6 percent. ""The break-out in gold was really sparked by weakness in the
dollar. There is no other explanation. There is a lot of
arbitrage between the two,"" said Philippe Waechter, head of
economic research at Natixis Asset Management. The dollar sank to its lowest level in nearly a year against
a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, with traders citing
talk of reserve diversification into gold undermining the U.S.
currency while boosting the precious metal. ""There are recurring rumours that the Chinese Central Bank
could convert part of their reserves into gold,"" Natixis AM's
Waechter said. ""The fact is the portion of their reserves currently in gold
is relatively small compared with other central banks, so there
is a lot of speculation that they might have to adjust these
levels."" Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.5 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.3

talks. The news also fuelled consolidation hopes across Europe,
with Telefonica up 1.4 percent, KPN up 1 percent and Swisscom up
0.9 percent. The talks between the two telecom providers came one day
after U.S. firm Kraft Foods unveiled a takeover bid for UK group
Cadbury, triggering hopes that a revival in mergers and
acquisitions could give a second wind to the stock market's
six-month rally. ""With M&A back on the agenda, the markets have found a new

 (Adds analyst comments, updates share price) By Nicola Leske BERLIN, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom AG and France
Telecom SA plan to merge their British mobile units, responding
to intense competition with a venture that would grab top spot
in the crowded UK market. Setting out their plans on Tuesday, the partners said they
plan to reach an agreement by the end of October and hope to get
approval by mid 2010 for a combination of their British T-Mobile
and Orange brands which could present a fresh challenge to
market leaders O2 and Vodafone Plc. Yet analysts said the two telecom groups could struggle to 
agree on one brand and strategy and questioned if forecast
savings of more than 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) were
realistic. Regulators could also raise objections. The British market with its five operators has long looked
ripe for consolidation, but companies have been reluctant to
make a move out of fear others would benefit while they focus on
integration issues. Now, the move by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom could
in the short term take pressure off O2 (part of Spain's
Telefonica) and Vodafone, which have market shares of 27 percent
and 25 percent respectively. Orange has 22 percent followed by T-Mobile with 15 and
Hutchison Whampoa's 3 UK with 8 percent. Some analysts said the news was positive for France Telecom
because it would shore up its position in the UK without
spending cash, but less so for Deutsche Telekom, which had
considered selling its struggling UK unit but according to
analysts did not receive the offers it was looking for. ""It's probably positive (for Deutsche Telekom) and better
than doing nothing. But whether it is the best option is
debatable,"" said analyst Lawrence Sugarman at ING. Sanford Bernstein analyst Robin Bienenstock noted Deutsche
Telekom could have used the cash from a disposal to invest in
its U.S. business. Shares in Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom both gained
around 2 percent against a 1.5 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx
European telecoms index.  DELAY IN EXPECTED SYNERGIES? Analysts were sceptical of forecast synergy savings of more
than 4 billion euros from merging T-Mobile UK with Orange UK and
also doubted company forecasts it would boost free cash flow
from 2010 and earnings per share from 2011. ""As (Deutsche Telekom) expects a regulatory approval by the
end of H1 2010 and the incumbents have to agree on one brand and
one strategy, we expect synergies to be delayed,"" Germany's
WestLB bank said in a note, adding that total synergies could be
lower than forecast. The two companies said they will keep both brands for the
first 18 months and then review the appropriate strategy. ""If they don't cut one of the brands eventually, the
synergies will be 1 billion lower than they say they will be,""
said Bienenstock. ""For me, the big question is will they bite
the bullet and go down to one brand?"" Tom Alexander, who will lead the newly merged company, said
one solution might be to somehow marry the brands, with a slogan
such as ""Orange powered by T-Mobile"" or vice-versa. ""We both
have huge brand loyalty in the UK and spent a lot of money to
build that up,"" he said. ""That won't be thrown away lightly."" Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz also expressed concerns on
future management control: ""We ... think that the joint
management structure (no clear dominance of one partner) might
slow down decision taking.""  France Telecom's Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier
conceded this would not be easy. ""We are not naive,"" said Pelissier on a conference call.
""There will be disagreements between the partners."" But he said
cooperation would be helped by the fact that the companies are
not direct competitors in their home markets, and by delegating
authority and decision-making power. Another issue that may crop is regulation. As any consolidation in the UK market will likely draw the
attention of regulators, a deal could be blocked by Britain's
competition regulator, which said in July it was happy with the
state of competition in the market. Analysts, however, noted some European operators hold 40
percent market shares and believe it will be approved.

Monday it needed at least 28.5 million polish zlotys ($10.0
million) to keep borrowing under control, money that it aims to
raise from a comprehensive privatisation plan that targets 36.7
billion zlotys. Following is a list of the main parts of the two-year
privatisation programme, with the bulk of the revenues planned
for next year:  MINERS * Poland is considering to sell up to 10 percent in Europe's
No.2 copper producer KGHM, which could bring in 1.7 billion
zlotys. The government rejected the treasury's proposal to
unload its entire 42 percent stake after it was criticism by
ruling coalition politicians and KGHM unions. * The treasury plans to sell a controlling stake in coal
miner Bogdanka, following its successful listing in June. The
government's 65.5-percent stake is currently worth 1.6 billion
zlotys.  REFINERS * Poland aims to sell about 13 percent in the country's No.2
refiner Lotos and maintain a majority stake. The state currently
owns 59 percent of the company but before selling the 13 percent
stake will boost its holding by transferring some assets.  Lotos
has a market cap of 3.2 billion zlotys.  ENERGY COMPANIES * Poland last month started exclusive talks with Germany's
RWE o sell its 67-percent stake, worth 7 billion zlotys, in
Polish utility Enea. * The treasury plans to unload part of its stake in Poland's
top utility PGE in 2010, keeping a majority holding. The fully
state-owned company aims for a November debut on the Warsaw
bourse, hoping to get 5 billion zlotys from the issue. * Tauron, which trails only PGE among Polish energy
companies, aims to raise 4 billion zlotys when it goes public
next year in a yet unsettled combination of a new share issue
and stake-sale by the Polish government.  WARSAW BOURSE * The 98.8-percent state-owned bourse -- the region's
largest -- is set for privatisation this year, with Deutsche
Boerse, London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext
making preliminary offers. The bourse's last valuation in 2007
pegged its worth at 1.8 billion zlotys.  SMALL STAKES * The Treasury wants to sell its leftover 4.2 percent stake
in France Telecom unit TPSA when the share price breaks the
six-month average of 19.3 zlotys. The Polish operator, worth 22
billion zlotys, trades at 16.69 zlotys. * The government plans a sale of its 2.5-percent stake in
Citibank's Handlowy, with the current market price valuing the
holding at almost 200 million zlotys. * Last month, Poland sold almost all of its 4-percent stake
in Bank Pekao, a unit of Italy's UniCredit, for a joint sum of
almost 1.3 billion zlotys. * Also in August, it unloaded its 1.93-percent holding in
lender BZ WBK, controlled by Allied Irish Banks, for 167
million. * Sources told Reuters on Monday that the Treasury was
seeking buyers for its 3.7 percent, or 1.06 million shares, in
General Electric's Bank BPH, pegging the price at around 60
zlotys per share.

 (Adds CEO, analyst comments, shares, detail, background) By Mark Potter LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - British music, books and games
retailer HMV Group Plc  posted a 1.8 percent fall in
underlying sales for the first 18 weeks of its financial year
and announced a deal to boost its digital business. Chief Executive Simon Fox also played down media speculation
he might leave the firm to head broadcaster ITV  or
retailer Marks & Spencer .  ""I'm completely committed to staying with HMV,"" he told
reporters on Thursday.  HMV, which runs music, DVD and video games shops under its
own name as well as Waterstone's bookstores, said sales at shops
open over a year fell 1.8 percent in the 18 weeks to Aug. 29. Like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland rose 1.7 percent,
helped by big market share gains following the demise of rivals
Woolworths and Zavvi around the end of last year. However, this was offset by weak sales of video games, a 3.4
percent drop in like-for-like sales at Waterstone's and a 12.6
percent decline in underlying sales in international markets.  Fox said trading conditions were tough, but was upbeat about
prospects for the coming months, helped by recent price cuts in
games consoles, new books from Jamie Oliver and Dan Brown and
the release of remastered albums by The Beatles. Nomura analysts kept their full-year profit forecast of 74.7
million pounds ($121.9 million), with a 2 million cut to their
international estimate offset by an upgrade for the UK. Altium's David Stoddart, however, was concerned the
performance in the UK might not make up for the weakness abroad
and at Waterstone's. At 0840 GMT, HMV shares were down 1.6 percent at 112.9
pence, lagging a small rise on the FTSE midcap index .  DIGITAL  HMV, which faces the same competition from supermarkets,
online retailers and digital downloading that led to the demise
of Woolworths and Zavvi, has responded by cutting costs and
widening its focus. It has entered the live music and ticketing markets, is
trialling digital cinemas in partnership with Curzon and selling
mobile phones in a deal with France Telecom's  Orange. The firm said on Thursday it was buying a 50 percent stake
in digital media firm 7digital for 7.7 million pounds ($12.6
million) in cash. The deal will give it access to industry-leading technology,
a catalogue of over 6 million digital music tracks and boost its
position in the digital books market, it said. ""We believe this has the potential to put HMV's digital
content on the front foot for a change, rather than playing
catch-up to market developments,"" said KBC Peel Hunt analyst
John Stevenson.  Fox said HMV planned to tackle weakness in its international
markets -- Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore -- by broadening its
product offering as it has done in the UK by, for example,
selling more computer games.

it wanted to sell its 22 percent stake in Poland's top cellphone
operator, Polkomtel, joining refiner PKN which plans to unload
its 24.4 percent holding. Analysts have said the most likely buyer was British giant
Vodafone, which holds 24.4 percent and would gain control of
Polkomtel by buying out the two Polish companies. ""The current market situation seems to favour such
transactions. We're preparing a tender for an adviser,"" chief

consolidation, declined to comment. PKN, under pressure to reduce debt, has been spearheading
the push to sell Polkomtel, which would likely fetch a premium
if at least two of its Polish owners sold their stakes. ""A coordinated Polkomtel stake sale between PGE and PKN is
possible and would be advisable,"" PKN spokesman Dawid Piekarz
said, adding no talks between the two Polish companies have
taken place so far. Copper miner KGHM, which also has a 24.4 percent stake, has
been the main holdout, saying it had no need to sell. ""The management reiterates that our decision to sell our
Polkomtel stake will be made before a big investment, when the
company will need money,"" KGHM spokeswoman Anna Osadczuk said on

(Adds details) PARIS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - French market research company
Ipsos posted a 14.6 percent fall in first-half core profit on
Thursday amid a global economic downturn and said it did not
expect a significant improvement in the second half.Ipsos said further cost-cutting would allow it to achieve a
stable 2009 operating margin, before exceptional items. ""It would be premature and probably unrealistic to hope for
the second half of 2009 to be much better than the first half,""
the statement said. Cost cuts and the sustaining of activity at a level ""at
least equal"" to that of the first six months of the year should
enable Ipsos to achieve a stable operating margin, excluding
non-recurring items, when compared to the 10.2 percent achieved
in 2008, it said.  Operating profit before non-recurring items declined to
36.3 million euros from 42.4 million. This translated into a
margin of 8.1 percent of sales against 9.2 percent in the
year-ago period. Revenue declined 3.2 percent to 447.8 milion euros. On a
like-for-like basis, sales were down 4.8 percent. Global advertising sector revenues have been battered this
year as clients have cut spending during the downturn. Earlier in the day, WPP, the world's largest advertising
group by revenue, posted first-half like-for-like sales at the
low end of forecasts but said it expected a better second half
due to job cuts and easier comparatives.Paris-based Ipsos is one of the world's top-ten market
research groups with 2008 sales of 979.3 million euros. It
competes with Taylor Nelson Sofres Plc, Synovate and Germany's
GFK.With a market capitalisation of 687 million euros, Ipsos
serves a vast array of clients ranging from comsumer goods giant
Procter & Gamble to France Telecom. Ipsos shares closed down 1.72 percent at 20 euros. The stock
has gained 6 percent so far this year.

 (Adds detail, comments, share price) LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan on Tuesday upgraded the
European telecoms sector to ""overweight"", anticipating an
improved economic climate in the second half, and said Vodafone
, France Telecom and KPN were top picks. The upgrade buoyed telecom shares with Vodafone gaining 2.2
percent by 1054 GMT. France Telecom shares rose 2.5 percent and
KPN stock was up 1.37 percent. Deutsche Telekom gained 1.2
percent. The DJ Stoxx Telecom index was 1.1 percent higher. JPMorgan said the telecoms sector was favoured by cheap
valuations, increasingly stable and predictable results, and
seasonal trading patterns that had led the sector to
consistently outperform in the final months of most years since
1995. ""In H109, this seasonality `predisposed' the sector to
underperform, but in addition, expectations regarding the
sector's `immunity' from the recession were too optimistic,""
JPMorgan said. In the first quarter, only two incumbents beat estimates on
core profit and while domestic fixed line businesses remained
almost stable ""mobile revenues tracked a deeper than expected
GDP drop"", it said. The second quarter gave reason for a more optimistic outlook
as incumbent operators missed less on the top line and eight out
of 13 incumbents beat core profit expectations. ""In H2, we believe the improving economic context will act
to strengthen the usual trading seasonality, for which we found
Q2 results overall supportive."" JPMorgan said positive seasonality in the third and fourth 
quarters and valuations would be supportive, and pointed out
that European telecom companies were currently trading at 50
percent relative price-to-earnings discount. BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the sector earlier this month
to ""neutral"". The brokerage said telecoms would likely lag behind sectors
that were more geared into the economy and it would be hard for
the sector to see catalysts for outperformance over the
near-to-medium term. However, BofA Merrill Lynch said telecom-sector valuations
remained extremely attractive, with 2009 and 2010 dividend
yields estimated to be the highest of any sector, and it
remained the brokerage's favourite defensive sector.

early trade on Tuesday from the 10-month closing highs they hit
in the previous session as investors took profits and after
declines in Asia. At 0832 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.4 percent at 971.54 points. The European benchmark index is still up 50 percent from its
lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more confident
on the prospects for worldwide economic recovery. Data on
Tuesday confirmed that Germany, the region's biggest economy,
exited recession in the second quarter. ""We've enjoyed the euphoria. (The fall in shares) is
profit-taking and worries about China,"" said David Buik, senior
partner at BGC Partners. ""And the U.S. Budget deficit has reared
its ugly head again. But I don't see it as a serious correction,
which won't happen till people get back from holiday."" The sell-off was across the board, but the heavyweight
banking sector took most points off the index. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, UBS and UniCredit fell between
1 and 1.7 percent. Shares in France's Natixis, which reports on Thursday, have
been suspended from trading for the day, following a report that
majority owner BPCE will guarantee some of its toxic assets. Miners fell as metals prices retreated from recent highs.
Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Lonmin, Rio Tinto and
Xstrata fell between 1.5 and 3.7 percent. Crude prices slipped 0.8 percent to less than $74 a barrel,
impacting oil shares. Total, ENI, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and
StatoilHydro fell between 0.7 and 1.2 percent. British oil explorer Cairn Energy fell 2.7 percent after
warning that meeting targets for the next stages of the
development was becoming ""increasingly challenging"", as it
reported a first-half loss after tax. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down between 0.4 and 0.5 percent.  DEFENSIVES GAIN Defensive sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and telecoms,
were among the small number of risers. Mobile telecoms firm Vodafone gained 1.4 percent after
JPMorgan upgraded the telecoms sector to ""overweight"", and
advised exposure to the stock. The broker said the telecoms sector is favoured by cheap
valuations and seasonal trading patterns that have led the
sector to consistently outperform in the final months of most
years since 1995. It was also ""overweight"" in France Telecom,
which rose 1.8 percent, and KPN, up 1.6 percent. Among drugmakers, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis rose
0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively. Beauty products giant L'Oreal, which reports results on
Thursday, rose 1.5 percent after Jefferies upgraded it to ""buy""
from ""hold"". In other broker-inspired moves, German tourism group TUI
surged 7.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to
""overweight"" from ""equal weight"". Irish building materials group CRH fell 1.4 percent after
posting a sharp drop in first-half pretax profit and saying the
rate of decline would ease in the second half due to
cost-cutting and improvements in its core U.S. market. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.8 percent lower. China's
benchmark Shanghai Composite was down 2.6 percent, having been
down more than 5 percent earlier. Analysts pointed to the volatility in the Chinese market,
which has enjoyed a strong run, and said that in the longer
term, it is not correlated to other markets.
 Later in the session, investors' attention will switch to
key macroeconomic data from the United States on house prices

 (Adds quote, TPSA CEO, shares, details) By Adrian Krajewski WARSAW, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Poland's telecoms watchdog will
likely abandon its plans to split dominant phone operator TPSA
after reaching a preliminary deal with the France Telecom unit,
its CEO said on Tuesday. The move signals a reversal by the regulator's chief, Anna
Strezynska, who during her three years in office levied hefty
fines on TPSA, forced it to cut rates and wanted to divide the
company into retail and wholesale units. ""We were able to reach a satisfying level of agreement and
at the current stage we can suspend work on the functional
separation of TPSA to the end of the year,"" Strezynska told a
news conference. ""If everything goes well, in the autumn we will suspend the
procedure for a year. If the situation in 2010 is as good as it
is now, by the end of next year we will be able to drop it,"" she
said. Shares in TPSA, which have been the worst performers among
Warsaw-listed bluechips, bucked the negative trend and closed
2.1 percent higher at 16.25 zlotys, earlier reaching their
highest level in 2-1/2 months. The stock also gained from a Reuters report that Poland
would hold off from selling its rump stake. TPSA has maintained there is no need to divide the company
and hand over control of the wholesale arm to the regulator
because it had taken steps to treat other operators more fairly. TPSA Chief Executive Maciej Witucki, who previously warned
of the negative effects of the regulator's actions on the
operator's results, said he welcomes Strezynska's change of
heart. ""The closure of disputes, the stabilisation of the market
and revived investments are crucial for there to be something to
regulate,"" Witucki said. He added that TPSA would boost capital expenditures to 18
percent of sales in the coming years, as long as it reaches
wholesale agreements with local rivals.

losses, after unemployment in the United States rose less than
expected in July.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 1.3
percent to 950.38 points, its highest close since Nov. 5. Over
the week, the index rose 2.3 percent, its fourth week of gains. Telecoms, among the best performers in the morning due to
their defensive qualities, extended their gains by the close.  France Telecom rose 3.6 percent after JP Morgan upped its

eased to 9.4 percent in July from 9.5 percent in June, the Labor

since April 2008. The government revised job losses for May and June to show
43,000 fewer jobs lost than previously reported. The European benchmark index is up more than 47 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more
confident on the prospects of recovery.  Banks, which weighed heavily on the index in the morning,

first-half loss. ""It was a pity about RBS,"" said Buik. ""I don't think there
was anything wrong with the numbers, but expectations were far
too high."" Crude prices were 0.4 percent lower at $71.67 a barrel late
in the afternoon, but most energy companies were higher.
Investors weighed the positive effect of the U.S. jobless data,
in terms of demand implications, against the stronger dollar,
which usually reduces oil prices. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol and StatoilHydro rose between
1.2 and 2.1 percent.

U.S. jobs were lost in July compared with a loss of 467,000 jobs
in June.  Financial shares were among the biggest decliner. Royal Bank
of Scotland slipped 12 percent after it reported more losses as
investment banking profits failed to offset bad debts and the
state-owned lender warned of more ""poor"" results to come before
its own and the economy's recovery. Other banks were under pressure. Standard Chartered, HSBC,
Barclays, Lloyds, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit

 (Recasts, adds Telecom Italia results, updates shares) By Nicola Leske and Deepa Babington BONN/ROME Aug 6 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia's first-half
profits met market expectations and confirmed their forecasts, but failed to
spark enthusiasm among investors as other large European telecom peers have with
their results. Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telecoms group by sales, posted quarterly
earnings in line with analyst expectations, thanks to growth abroad and a stake
it acquired in Greek telecoms group OTE last year.  As expected, Italy's largest telecoms operator Telecom Italia reported a
drop in first-half profit due to higher taxes, but not as much as expected by
analysts. Telecom Italia shares were down 3 percent after the results, which one
analyst said could be due to disappointment that the company did not turn in
sharply better-than-expected results like peers France Telecom, BT and
Telefonica did last week. Former incumbent Portugal Telecom (PT), the country's leading telecom
company, said its second-quarter net profit fell in line with forecasts, as its
Brazilian operations offset the impact of lower mobile termination fees in its
business at home. European telecom operators are struggling with saturated markets and fierce
competition at home and so are increasingly reliant on securing growth abroad,
especially in emerging markets. PT shares were trading 1.76 percent lower at 7.14 euros by 1304 GMT.
Deutsche Telekom shares were flat, while the DJ Stoxx Telecoms index slipped 0.3
percent.  UK, U.S. PROBLEMS Deutsche Telekom said adjusted core profit rose 8.4 percent to 5.3 billion
euros ($7.63 billion) and it was on track to meet 2009 targets, which were cut
in April due to difficult market conditions, especially in the United States and
the UK. In spite of the company's reassurances, however, its UK business, where it
is number four out of five operators, could still act as a drag. Chief Executive Rene Obermann said the business had improved and its new
managing director, Richard Moat, would present details on UK strategy in the
next few weeks. He declined to comment on persistent rumours that the business
would be sold. As for its other problem child, T-Mobile USA, Obermann said Deutsche Telekom
was working to improve the business, but that a turnaround would not be evident
in the third quarter. Analysts welcomed the results but warned of problems on the horizon. ""There is no escaping the fact that what was once Deutsche Telekom's growth
engine -- T-Mobile US -- is now a declining franchise,"" Michael Kovacocy of
Metacommunicare said, adding he saw ""decidedly negative year-on-year
comparisons"" within a few quarters. Joeri Sels at DZ Bank was more pessimistic: ""We continue to assume that the
company will struggle to achieve its FY09 guidance and rate a further profit
warning likely.""  OUT OF STEAM Telecom Italia, Europe's No. 5 telecoms operator, has adopted a conservative
debt- and cost-cutting strategy to turn itself around and has said it will not
focus on revenues at the expense of profitability. Like Deutsche Telecom, it confirmed its targets after posting a 13 percent
drop in first-half net profit to 964 million euros due to higher taxes. ""The numbers are in line with expectations, there are no surprises,"" an
analyst said. ""The question remains on how the top line will fare over the next
six months."" Telecom Italia shares have risen 14 percent over the last three months, as
the company noted seeing the first signs of an economic recovery and an uptick
in Italian telecom spending. In Portugal, smaller peer PT said net profit fell 20 percent to 89.7 million
euros, as expected, hit by a 41 percent fall in call termination charges and
higher taxes. ""The shares have had a good run and offer a committed dividend yield of 8
percent for 2009-2011. However, I'm not sure there's enough in today's numbers
to drive further upside,"" Terry Sinclair, an analyst at Citi Global Markets,
said.

 (Releads with confirmation closing share price) By Maciej Onoszko and Adrian Krajewski WARSAW, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Poland sold a 3 percent stake in the country's No. 2 bank Pekao
 for 1.08 billion zlotys ($379 million) on Wednesday as it collects funds to plug a budget
gap, but it failed to sell its entire holding due to a high price. Earlier on Wednesday, Polish fund managers and a source close to the transaction told
Reuters the treasury ministry was selling shares in block deals at 135 zlotys, a price
confirmed by ministry officials after the session. ""We sold nearly eight million shares for 135 zlotys each,"" Deputy Treasury Minister Adam
Leszkiewicz told Reuters. The ministry, which held 10.4 million shares in Pekao left over from its privatisation,
sold nearly 8 million shares after launching a bookbuilding process late on Tuesday. Shares in Pekao, a unit of Italy's UniCredit, traded touch above 135 zlotys for most of
the session when the government was selling its stake. But they closed 3.2 percent lower at 133.10 zlotys, in line with Warsaw's main index that
retreated with other world markets after weak U.S. economic data. Fund managers told Reuters that Poland would have sold its entire stake had the treasury
set the price closer to 130 zlotys. The stock ended last week at 144 zlotys, but fell 5 percent on talk of an imminent sale of
state shares, despite better than expected second-quarter results on Tuesday. Citigroup Polish unit Bank Handlowy was managing the bookbuilding process. Last year, Poland failed to sell its stake to Italy's UniCredit, which already holds 59
percent of Pekao. Poland's centre-right government also plans to sell several small stakes left over from
privatisations of a handful of listed companies, led by phone operator TPSA. The sale of Poland's holding in the France Telecom unit could yield some $300 million at
current market prices. But a ministry spokesman backed off from earlier comments that all the stakes would be
sold this year, saying that the deadline for the sell-offs is the end of 2010. He also added that the government would not sell any of its remaining Pekao stake at less
than 135 zlotys per share. The treasury ministry aims to collect 36.7 billion zlotys from the sale of state assets by
the end of next year to relieve the pressure on the state budget, which it forecasts to have a
27 billion zlotys shortfall in 2009. Analysts expect the budget gap to be closer to 32 billion zlotys next year.

Mobinil is likely to deflate its share price in coming months as investors give up hope of a
positive resolution, analysts say. Mobinil, Egypt's largest mobile operator by subscribers, is caught in a dispute between
its two main shareholders, Cairo-based regional operator Orascom Telecom and France Telecom,
that has included court arbitration and regulator rulings. ""We believe the case will continue to drag on, and Mobinil's share price will start losing
upward momentum,"" EFG-Hermes analyst Marise Ananian wrote on Wednesday after FT lost an appeal
against regulator rejection of a buyout offer. The two heavyweights, who together own a controlling stake in Mobinil, have gone through
years of arbitration resulting in a ruling that Orascom should sell its 28.75 percent stake in
their joint holding company to FT for 273 Egyptian pounds ($49). Orascom also owns a 20
percent direct stake in Mobinil. Mobinil shares jumped from 148 pounds to 215 pounds in the two days after news of the
ruling hit the market in April. Although that transaction has not proceeded as the firms fight regulatory battles over
minority shares, the stock remains buoyant, trading broadly within the 185 and 220 pound
range. ""The share price has been consistently not reacting in a rational way to the rejections
made by the regulator, because investors are still hoping a tender offer could be accepted in
the future,"" said Sally Gerges from Beltone, which is neutral on the stock and gives it a fair
value of 206 pounds. On Tuesday, an Egyptian appeal committee ruled against a France Telecom appeal over the
rejection of its second of three bids, upholding the regulator's decision to block the sale
due to a lack of shareholder equality. Mobinil's shares dipped 4 percent in late trade on Tuesday and stabilised on Wednesday at
211 pounds, still 42 percent above the pre-ruling price of roughly 150 pounds. Analysts saw value in Mobinil's second-quarter financial results, posted in late July,
noting promotions that have lifted ""on-net"" traffic and strong subscriber growth. But while Orascom chairman Naguib Sawiris has said the dispute has not soured working
relations between Mobinil executives, analysts say this bonhomie is unlikely to last. ""We are concerned that the dispute will affect the operations of Mobinil in the medium to
long term,"" Gerges said. Analysts say executives from both Orascom and FT need to agree on issues relating to
Mobinil's overall strategy, budget, marketing, promotions and distribution of dividends.  ""If this dispute continues, the approval of such strategic decisions for Mobinil in the
future might be affected,"" Gerges said.

TPSA saw net profit halve in the first six months of 2009, as
lower mobile fees and the economic slowdown hit operating
earnings, the company said on Wednesday. The France Telecom unit earned 702 million zlotys ($241
million) versus 675 million expected in a Reuters poll. Sales
fell 6 percent to 8.5 billion zlotys compared to 8.53 billion
seen by analysts. Poland's former state monopoly has seen a steady
deterioration of its fixed-line business and until now has
relied on its mobile arm to compensate. The model has been under increasing pressure as the state
regulator pushed for lower mobile fees and the market became
saturated, causing a price war between operators. ""In line with our expectations, the telecom sector is under
the negative influence of a number of factors this year,"" TPSA
Chief Executive Maciej Witucki said in the statement. ""Nevertheless, I cannot be satisfied with our operating
results, even if a big part of them stems from the deterioration
of the environment in which we operate... We are in the course
of reviewing our strategic goals."" The group's operating profit fell 42 percent to 1.11 billion
zlotys, compared to 1.17 billion seen in Reuters poll, while
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation) declined by a fifth to 3.2 billion compared to
3.29 billion seen by analysts. Although TPSA did not publish separate second-quarter
results, the figure stood at around 374 million zlotys according
to Reuters calculations, or 53 percent down year-on-year. TPSA, whose shares are down 17 percent so far this year,
also said it opted not to make further payouts to shareholders
on top of 2 billion zlotys it handed back as dividend earlier
this year. The group reiterated it aims for at least 3 billion zlotys
in free cash flow at the end of the year. After the first six
months the figure stood at 1.48 billion.(Reporting by Adrian Krajewski; editing by John Stonestreet)

carriers, so far relatively unscathed by recession, risk
disappointing investors soon unless they keep cutting costs,
quarterly reports from Vodafone and TeliaSonera showed. The first of Europe's major players to publish second
quarter numbers, Vodafone reassured on Friday by reiterating its
full-year forecast after upping the pace of cost-cutting in the
quarter to end-June, while TeliaSonera said its tight grip on
costs would lead to higher margins this year. Telcos have proved resilient in the economic downturn as
businesses and consumers have continued to find communications
indispensible, but even so spending has been cut to a minimum
and the benefits of lucrative roaming charges have been
curtailed by regulators and by a reduction in travel. Mature markets in western Europe and North America where
there are more phones than people hold little scope for growth,
and even operators like Vodafone and TeliaSonera, which have
been relatively aggressive in emerging markets, will find it
hard to compensate. Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile telecoms group by
sales, makes 70 percent of its revenues in Europe.  'ONE TOUGH SLOG' ""The company is now a stagnant or declining enterprise and
it's all about cost control,"" said Mike Kovacocy, telecoms
analyst at Daiwa. ""It's looking like it's going to be one tough
slog for the rest of the year."" Expectations are modest: Vodafone's reiteration of its
forecast for flat profits at best, and a 2 percent quarterly
decline in organic revenues, were enough to push its shares up
more than 2 percent on Friday. Even at that, the company accompanied its guidance with the
caveat that it was based on rates of $1.5 and 1.12 euros to the
pound and would be updated in November to reflect updated
assumptions for foreign exchange. Each percentage point of increase in the euro-sterling
exchange rate would cost Vodafone 60 million pounds in adjusted
operating profit, it said, while a 1 percent increase in the
dollar/sterling rate would cost it 40 million pounds. Vodafone said it was on track to achieve more than 65
percent of its 1-billion-pound cost-saving target this fiscal
year, which ends in March 2010, and said it would update the
market on progress in November. It gave no profit figures on Friday. ""Their job is going to be to strip out as much cost as
possible and deliver a good presentation to the investor
community in November with respect to their cost control,""
Kovacocy said.  A NEW COST BASE TeliaSonera, the Nordic region's top telecom operator,
delighted the market by delivering a 13 percent increase in core
profits excluding one-offs, ahead of sales growth of 9 percent
that was driven by developing markets. TeliaSonera Chief Executive Lars Nyberg told a conference
call:""We have totally changed the way we operate this company
in terms of costs... I think we're at the beginning of the
journey, because we will always have to work with costs."" The company's shares rose 6.8 percent by 1245 GMT after
TeliaSonera raised its core earnings margin target for the year,
saying its efforts to lower costs and capital expenditure --
which include 2,900 job cuts so far -- would pay off. ""Things are going better because the cost-cutting is
working. They're not exactly getting any help from the economic
environment,"" said one analyst, who asked not to be named. Norwegian operator Telenor and Belgium's Mobistar,
majority-owned by France Telecom, said earlier this week they
were also cutting their capex targets. Raymond Yu, mobile analyst at research firm Ovum, said:
""When the top-line revenue numbers fall, you have to look at
cost-cutting, especially in those markets where you're not going
to see much customer growth, like in Europe."" ""They've all come out to say cost-cutting is top priority at
the moment."" Vodafone shares were up 2.3 percent while the DJ Stoxx
telecoms sector rose 0.8 percent, outperforming a flat overall

for a 10th straight session on Friday, hitting a new eight-month
peak as better-than-expected economic data prompted investors to
rush for banking and telecom shares. The market brushed aside poor results from major companies
such as Microsoft on Thursday and gloomy comments from Ericsson
 on Friday, and focused on German business climate data and
eurozone purchasing managers' surveys. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.3
percent at 910.77 points by 1127 GMT after rising as high as
915.34, its highest since mid-November. The index has soared 12
percent over the past two weeks -- its longest winning run since
December 2006. Optimism about an economic recovery and better-than-feared
company profits have helped the index surge 41 percent from a
record low in March. The FTSEurofirst 300 is up about 10 percent
this year after plummeting 45 percent in 2008, but still down 44
percent since a multi-year peak in 2007. Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers, with
Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of
Scotland, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale up 0.8-4.1 percent. ""Markets have moved from the bottom to the top of their
recent trading range in a very short space of time. We probably
need some time to pause for breath,"" said Henk Potts, equity
strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. ""Valuations are rapidly approaching their fair value, which
could potentially cut upside momentum in the near term. Although
better-than-expected earnings season will certainly see some
upgrades in due course and give scope for further gains in the
longer term,"" he said. Charts show the rally is technically bullish, suggesting the
market has become confident a two-year bear run has ended. After rebounding from March's record low of 645 points, the
index retreated in late June and early July from the first
strong chart barrier it encountered: resistance between 879
points, the 23.6 percent retracement of its drop from mid-2007,
and this year's peak of 895, hit in January. While that resistance band held, the market could not be
said to have established a strong floor; technically, there was
a significant risk of a drop back to fresh lows.  POSITIVE DATA After an drop in early trade, European stocks turned
positive when data showed Ifo's closely-watched German business
climate index rose to 87.3 in July, higher than the Reuters
consensus for a smaller rise to 86.5. Eurozone provisional purchasing managers' surveys also
showed the services and manufacturing sectors contracted much
less sharply than expected in July but firms continued to cut
jobs in a bid to reduce costs. ""The stellar run continues, with talk of an inevitable
pullback falling on deaf ears,"" said Chris Hossain, senior sales
manager at ODL Securities. ""A return of confidence has given the
markets real impetus to push higher."" But Britain's economy shrank more than expected in the
second quarter to register its biggest annual decline since
records began in 1955, in a reminder that more poor economic
data could dampen sentiment. Energy shares were generally higher as crude prices gained.
BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group and Repsol added 0.4-1.8
percent. Vodafone gained 2.5 percent after the world's largest mobile
phone company by revenues reported in-line sales and reiterated
its outlook. BT Group, France Telecom and Telefonica rose
0.4-1.6 percent. Merck KGaA tumbled 13.4 percent after the German drugmaker
posted weaker-than-expected quarterly results and on a negative
opinion by a European regulatory body regarding the use of its
cancer drug Erbitux. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 added 0.3-0.7 percent.

 (Adds more comments by CEO, updates share price reaction) By Niklas Pollard and Helena Soderpalm STOCKHOLM, July 24 (Reuters) - Ericsson, the world's biggest
supplier of cellphone network equipment, said on Friday the
economic downturn was now taking a bigger toll on its market, a
shift that took the gloss off a sharp rise in its headline
second-quarter profit and sent its shares lower. The company had been largely unscathed by the economic woes,
sheltered by robust sales in China and strength in its services
business, while growing its share of a shrinking market for
mobile network gear. But Chief Executive Carl-Henric Svanberg said the effects of
the financial crisis were now being seen, especially in emerging
markets where currency wobbles were adding to economic woes. ""The weak economy that we have now will not go away for the
next several quarters anyway, so we are living in a tougher
environment,"" he told a news conference. ""I don't think we can give any better indications of whether
it's going to be a little bit better or a little bit worse. It
is an uncertain environment."" Chief Financial Officer Hans Vestberg, who will take the
helm after Svanberg moves to BP, also told analysts that
operators were optimising cashflows, making it tough to collect. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company, said on
Friday its earnings this year would be flat to lower while
Nordic market leader TeliaSonera said it was focused on cutting
costs. Ericsson's second-quarter operating earnings rose 47 percent
to 6.9 billion Swedish crowns ($914 million), excluding
restructuring charges and its loss-making joint ventures, while
sales were up 7.4 percent at 52.1 billion crowns. Analysts had on average forecast a profit of 6 billion
crowns and sales of 52.9 billion, according to a Reuters poll. ""It's a bit of a mix. On the negative side we have the
cautious comments on the macro environment -- this will get
noticed and should be seen as a warning sign for the later part
of the year,"" West LB analyst Thomas Langer said. Ericsson shares were down 7.0 percent at 72.10 crowns by
0855 GMT. ""They now say for the first time that the networks side is
starting to be affected by the economic climate,"" said Greger
Johansson, analyst at Redeye. ""It's not totally unexpected, but
still a small downgrade.""  DOWNTURN WEIGHS MORE Many analysts expect worse to come as operators slash
capital expenditure to weather deep recessions on both sides of
the Atlantic, weighing on equipment sales for manufacturers such
as Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks. Earlier this week Norwegian operator Telenor cut its capital
expenditure target as did Belgium's second-biggest mobile
operator, Mobistar, majority-owned by France Telecom, and
analysts at Morgan Stanley said more spending cuts were likely
to follow. ""The effects of the global economic climate on the mobile
infrastructure market are now more notable, especially in
markets with currencies under pressure and tougher credit
environment,"" Svanberg said in a statement. Svanberg, due to step down at the turn of the year, said the
firm's cost savings target remained at 10 billion Swedish crowns
($1.32 billion), from the second half of 2010. While Ericsson has managed to safeguard earnings in the face
of the financial crisis, some of its smaller rivals are hurting. The NSN joint venture of Nokia and Siemens, the world's
second biggest wireless network equipment maker, skidded to a
second-quarter operating loss and France's Alcatel-Lucent, due
to issue its April-June report on July 30, made a loss in the
first three months of the year. Ericsson and China's Huawei Technologies, which shot to the
No. 3 spot in the mobile networks market in the first quarter,
have been winning market share this year at the expense of NSN
and Alcatel-Lucent. Ericsson reported a gross margin of 36.3 percent in April
through June, above the mean forecast of 35.7 percent seen by
analysts but down from the 37.0 percent posted a year ago.

its guidance of slightly lower revenue but steady operating free
cash flow for this year, and will have more to say next month
once it has run a new forecast, it said. New Chief Executive Hannes Ametsreiter said macroeconomic
and currency uncertainty in some of the carrier's important
markets such as Bulgaria and Belarus made predictions hard but
said the company would do everything to preserve free cash flow. ""We commit to our guidance, and it's still valid what we
said in May,"" Ametsreiter told Reuters on Thursday, on a visit
to London to meet investors and media. ""We are now in a forecast situation so we are running
another forecast and I believe that in August we'll have some
new insights about the development,"" he added in an interview. Ametsreiter said he was open to in-market consolidation, for
example in his crowded Austrian home market, but was
concentrating on keeping the business in shape in the current
difficult circumstances. ""For our group at the moment, it is not M&A time, it is
focusing on doing our homework, it is really focusing on
operations, it is being as efficient and productive as possible,
and it's also about strengthening positions,"" he said. ""If strengthening position means in-market consolidation,
this could be one option,"" he said, but added: ""It's not very
hot at the moment."" The Austrian mobile market is seen as overcrowded with four
operators active, including, apart from Telekom Austria,
Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Hutchison Whampoa's 3
Austria, the smallest operator. There is little fixed-line competition in Austria compared
to other western European countries.  CIVIL SERVANTS Former state monopoly Telekom Austria is hampered in efforts
to lay off workers to cut costs by the high proportion of staff
who are civil servants and cannot be fired.  Last year, it sent home about 1,250 employees whom it
continued to pay, to save at least on overtime payments. Ametsreiter said the company was trying to persuade these
staff to accept large payoffs as part of a social plan that
would take them off Telekom Austria's books for a one-off
payment, and that more than expected had accepted so far. The company had been planning on 400 accepting by the end of
2009, but in fact 500 had already decided to accept, he said,
""which means we are saving money as well, we have better results
than expected"". Ametsreiter said he believed Telekom Austria, with the
advantage of having a fixed-line as well as a mobile network,
had also found a good solution to the danger of its mobile
network becoming overcrowded as mobile data usage doubled each
year. ""If you have very low prices, which we have in Austria, you
are reaching a point that your network is being filled and then
you need to think about having further investments into capex,""
he said. Ametsreiter said the company had found that 80 percent of
mobile broadband usage took place in the home, and so for the
past two months it had been automatically directing connections
to the fixed-line DSL network when users were at home. The switch happened without customers needing to do
anything, Ametsreiter said, and had the added advantage that
sending data over fixed lines was far cheaper than doing it over
a mobile network. ""It's like we are producing in China. It's like having a
low-cost production company, and we are mixing that with the
convenience of mobility. That's our hybrid approach,"" he said.

since reaching a record low in early March as banking and
cyclicals stocks sharply rose on hopes of a speedy economic
recovery. But the market's rally during the spring has stalled since
early May, and a number of analysts are now saying investors
should turn again to defensive stocks. ""Defensives outperform falling markets,"" Citigroup analysts

strong second quarter in terms of new subscribers for mobile and
fixed-phones and is ahead of its sales targets on the iPhone
smart phone, its chief executive said on Thursday. Frank Esser told a group of reporters on the sideline of a
telecoms conference that: ""We had a good momentum, a very strong
second quarter in mobile and in fixed phones."" Esser was answering a query over subscription levels. SFR, which started selling the iPhone in April, has
currently sold over 200,000 units and was ""ahead"" of its targets
despite a global economic downturn. Esser declined to disclose what these targets were. ""If one looks at the iPhone, one sees that people are ready
to spend more,"" he said. SFR, which last year bought fixed-phone operator Neuf
Cegetel, has no immediate plans to launch a ""quadruple play""
offer (internet, television, fixed-phone and mobile phone) for
the consumer market, he said. Some analysts expect SFR to react to Ideo, the first
quadruple-play offer in France launched by Bouygues Telecom on

the multifibre solution in large cities. That solution uses one
fibre per operator to connect a household and had been backed by

295,"Jul 01, 2009 05:40AM ET",ANALYSIS-Mobile market consolidation in UK is risky business,nan," * Deutsche Telekom considering options for UK mobile arm * Consolidation would benefit all players, not just buyer * Sale would likely spur acquisition of fifth operator 3  By Kate Holton and Nicola Leske LONDON/FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - Consolidation within
the crowded British mobile market is desperately needed but any
acquirer runs the risk of overpaying and watching the benefits
be shared among its rivals. Analysts and executives have long said that the British
market, with five operators, is the most competitive in Europe
and consolidation is the best way to address ever-reducing
margins. ""Everyone agrees consolidation is needed and seemingly
T-Mobile will fall first,"" said Emeka Obiodu, senior analyst at
industry research group Ovum. Deutsche Telekom is currently deciding whether to sell its
underperforming T-Mobile UK unit although a decision is not
expected imminently, a person familiar with the situation said
earlier this week. Deutsche is not in a hurry to sell, however, and would
expect a premium, even though the unit is hard to value because
of uncertainty about how well it can hold on to its customers. ""Can (a buyer) be certain that it will have T-Mobile's
entire customer base when a deal is completed? Or will it pay
for a vanishing customer base?"" Obiodu said. Any sale of T-Mobile UK to one of the three big operators
would also likely spur a sale of the fifth operator 3, owned by
Hutchison Whampoa, which would benefit all remaining operators
by reducing competition and improving profit margins. Vodafone has seen margins in the UK shrink to around 22
percent from around 33 percent three years ago, while T-Mobile
UK's margin has declined to 15 percent in that time. Yet, while rumours abound over who will make a move on
T-Mobile UK, operators are reluctant to do so ""because the
player buying T-Mobile UK would pay the bill for intra-market
consolidation and everyone else would benefit"", Jochen Reichert
at SES Research said. With that in mind, it is not clear which of the three big
operators -- leader O2 from Telefonica, Vodafone and France
Telecom's Orange -- would take the risk. T-Mobile has put out feelers to the operators to gauge their
reaction, people familiar with the situation have said. ""We would be happy with consolidation, like the others,""
France Telecom financial head Gervais Pellissier told Reuters in
May. ""But the risk is the one who pays may not be the one who
gets the proceeds,"" said Pellissier, who said France Telecom's
Orange would not make an offer because they could not guarantee
keeping hold of the customers. But that would not necessarily rule out Orange as a joint
venture partner.  TIMING NOT RIGHT? Most analysts also believe the new management at T-Mobile UK
should be given the time to introduce changes, such as reducing
staff numbers and promoting its offers of SIM-card only deals
for the lower end of the market. Offering a SIM-only contract means the consumer does not
have to pay within the contract for the price of a new handset
and it has proved popular with users in the economic downturn. Daiwa analyst Michael Kovacocy said an acquisition of
T-Mobile would act as ""damage control"" by removing a competitor,
but said the timing was not right for T-Mobile. He also said the high cost of third-party distribution in
Britain would not change with operator consolidation. ""Selling out now would not make sense,"" Kovacocy said. ""They
could wait until they're through the Christmas season.  ""If there is a second half uplift in the economy, and if
they get some rebound in the prepaid market they could improve
the valuation, the business and get their margins up. And the
people who would buy it are still going to be there."" Some are more sceptical, arguing that T-Mobile UK has no
chance of a turnaround because it has too many problems. Deutsche Telekom entered the British market in 1999 when it
acquired One 2 One, and launched the T-Mobile UK brand in 2002. T-Mobile grew steadily in the UK but started to lose
customers in the second quarter of 2008 as it failed to keep up
with new deals and handsets offered by rivals. It took a hit
with an impairment writedown of 1.8 billion euros in the first
quarter. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile group by revenue, was
reported by the Financial Times to be considering a bid,
although the British group has declined to comment. But the deal would push Vodafone ahead of O2 in market share
and attract the attention of regulators, who could let it
through with some adjustments such as the sale of spectrum.  ""Despite the potential strategic advantages, this is not a
case of a square peg in a square hole,"" said Ovum's Obiodu,
citing the fact that both companies had suffered revenue
declines in recent quarters. Sharifah Amirah at Frost & Sullivan said she would rather
see O2 buy T-Mobile because it would be a better fit. O2 has reaped the benefits in the last year from securing
the exclusive contract to sell the Apple iPhone and from also
pushing the SIM-only service. (Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)

296,"Jul 01, 2009 05:40AM ET","European shares rise led by commods, banks",nan," * FTSEurofirst rises 1.2 percent * Energy adds most points on back of higher oil price * China PMI above 50, lifting basic resources  By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - European shares rose early on
Wednesday as energy stocks drew strength from higher oil prices
and Chinese economic data gave a lift to resource stocks such as
steelmaker ArcelorMittal . By 0917 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 1.2 percent at 860.09 points, boosted
also by banks, notably Commerzbank  which shot up on
news of a political deal giving German banks greater scope than
before to rid balance sheets of toxic assets. The European benchmark index rose 2.2 percent in the first
half of 2009 thanks to a gain of 15.9 percent in the second
quarter, after hitting a lifetime low on March 9. The second-quarter rally came to a halt by mid-June and the
FTSEurofirst has remained range-bound since then. It fell 1.1
percent on Tuesday. ""Some investors seem to be ready to buy on the dips,"" said
LBBW analyst Michael Koehler. ""There is no clear downward dynamic,"" he added. Other strategists said many investors appeared to be on
hold, awaiting the U.S. second-quarter corporate earnings season
kicking off with bellwethers such as Alcoa  on July 8 and
Intel  and Johnson & Johnson  on July 14. ""Q2, 2009 earnings revisions have now turned positive with
the season only a week away, a striking contrast to recent
seasons where estimates declined coming into reporting,"" Goldman
Sachs said in a research note. That, said JPMorgan, was making investors cautious. ""The view is that (consensus earnings) expectations have
moved too far too fast, setting the scene for a disappointment,""
JPMorgan said in a June 30 strategy note. Oil & gas  added the most points to the FTSEurofirst
early on Wednesday, with Royal Dutch Shell , BP 
and Total  up between 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent. Oil  rose above $71 a barrel after a fall in U.S.
crude stocks buoyed hopes of a demand recovery. [ID:nSYD509355] China's manufacturing sector extended its recovery in June,
its official purchasing managers' index consolidating for the
fourth month above the watershed mark of 50. [ID:nPEK138883]  RESOURCES RALLY In European stock markets, basic resources was the strongest
sector, up 3 percent on the DJ Stoxx index , led by
ArcelorMittal, up 2.8 percent, and miner Rio Tinto . Rio was up 3.5 percent. A source briefed on the matter told
Reuters that China's state-owned Chinalco was likely to
participate in Rio's $15.2 billion rights offer. [ID:nSYD518726] Steelmaker ThyssenKrupp  rose 3.1 percent. Banking  was the second strongest sector measured by
points contribution. Commerzbank climbed 16.7 percent, BNP
Paribas  was up 2 percent and Barclays  rose
1.4 percent. Standard Chartered  added 1.0 percent. A source with
direct knowledge of the matter said StanChart was in talks to
purchase assets in China and India owned by the Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS) , whose shares rose 1.1 percent. The DJ Stoxx retail index  rose 1.8 percent, with
Marks & Spencer  up 4.3 percent after the British
retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter
underlying sales and said consumer spending seemed to be
stabilising. [ID:nLU57554] Telecoms  rose on the back of an upgrade of the
European sector to ""overweight"" from Credit Suisse, which said
that telecoms have the highest 2009 free cash flow yield and
highest dividend yield of any European sector. BT Group  traded 3.4 percent higher, Vodafone 
was up 1.7 percent, France Telecom  put on 2.1 percent
and Deutsche Telekom  rose 1.3 percent. Losing 5.9 percent, telecoms was one of the three weakest
sectors in Europe in the first half of 2009. [ID:nLU94057] Later in the day, the focus will be on the U.S.
private-sector ADP employment report at 1215 GMT and the U.S.

in positive territory, gaining 2.2 percent, against a 20 percent slide in the
Jan.-June period in 2008. The FTSEurofrst 300 index of top Euroepean shares hit a lifetime low on
March 9 following the financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and threatened much of
the world with a deep and vicious recession. The index surged 15.9 percent in the Apr.-June period of 2009, the best
quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still
down 48 percent from a multi-year peak scaled in the middle of 2007. The index lost 45 percent in 2008 after five straight years of gains. The
basic resources and banking sectors were among the worst perfomers last year,
both down 65 percent, but the sectors are the best performers so far this year,

298,"Jun 29, 2009 11:16AM ET","COLUMN-Vodafone needs focus, not scale in UK: Eric Auchard",nan,"-- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed
are his own -- By Eric Auchard LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - A Vodafone takeover of T-Mobile
UK to create the country's dominant mobile operator would be bad
news for consumers and competitors. It might even be bad news
for Vodafone itself. Wireless operators are hungry to consolidate the UK market,
which, with five players, is notoriously competitive, relative
to the rest of Europe. UBS estimates that profit margins for the
five UK players are 11 percentage points lower than the European
average. Greater scale is, of course, the justification for such a
deal. Vodafone takes in 25 percent of the revenue in the UK
market, while T-Mobile has around 15 percent. Including Virgin
Mobile, which runs on T-Mobile's network, the combined group
would control nearly half the market in subscriber terms. T-Mobile UK has played a role in undercutting rivals on
price. Consolidating a disruptive pricer would no doubt drive up
costs for consumers. However, a potential combination would be likely to fall
foul of competition rules. Regulators have in the past blocked
the consolidation of supermarkets, with positive results for
consumers. Lloyds' emergency rescue of HBOS in the banking
sector is the notable exception. The real aim of floating a T-Mobile/Vodafone tie-up may be
to test regulators willingness to consider other options across
the UK telecoms market, including airwaves or smaller merger
deals. The fact that T-Mobile is up for sale and has reportedly
hired J.P. Morgan as a strategic advisor suggests that its
owners expect flexibility from regulators. The only deal that is likely to pass muster with regulators
is one involving No. 4-ranked T-Mobile with Hutchison Whampoa's
, which is a distant No. 5 in the UK market, with just 8 percent
of revenues. Arguments about scale make more sense here as a deal would
create a fourth player with sufficient scale to compete, joining
its bigger rivals -- Telefonica's O2, Vodafone, France Telecom's
 Orange, each with about one quarter of the market. For Vodafone, the pursuit of scale in the UK could also
prove illusory in a fast-changing market that depends on fickle
consumer tastes. It should focus instead on creating
differentiated products and services that appeal to its existing
mix of business and consumer subscribers rather than diluting
margins by buying up T-Mobile's lower quality, largely pre-paid
customer base. The danger for Vodafone is of overpaying for T-Mobile UK,
which estimated to be worth around 3.5 billion pounds. With
customer turnover high between operators, it's no sure bet that
T-Mobile customers would stick with Vodafone if a deal were
consummated. Vodafone might end up paying billions of pounds for
a disappearing customer base.  -- At the time of publication Eric Auchard did not own any

299,"Jun 22, 2009 10:08AM ET",TPSA sees 2009 CAPEX at lower end of forecast,nan," WARSAW, June 22 (Reuters) - Poland's top operator TPSA sees
its 2009 investments at the lower end of the forecast 12-14
percent of revenue as expenditure takes a back  seat in the face
of a shrinking market, TPSA IR chief said.
 Polish phone groups face leaner times amid a steep economic
downturn that has added to the woes of their fixed-line business
and of their mobile segments, which have been hit also by
regulatory fee cuts. ""This year's investments shift to second stage as the
possibility of lower than expected returns grows in the face of
the crisis,"" TPSA's head of investor relations Tomasz Pozniak
told Reuters on Monday. ""They (investments) will be pegged at the lower end of the
range of 12-14 percent of revenue set by TPSA ... Acquisitions
are not a priority for TPSA currently."" TPSA, a unit of France Telecom, has said it expected a flat
Polish telecoms market this year after 5.5 percent growth in
2008. The group did not provide investors with full-year revenue
guidance, reiterating only that it should end 2009 with free
cash flow of at least 3 billion zlotys ($923 million). ""If the company decides the goal is under no threat ... it
may go for an extra dividend payout of maximum 0.5 zlotys per
share or a share buyback of maximum 700 million zlotys, so that
the overall payout level pars with last year's,"" Pozniak said. Earlier this year, TPSA already proposed to pay out a
dividend of 1.5 zlotys per share from its 2008 profits, a total
of 2 billion zlotys. The company, which holds top spots in the fixed-line,
cellphone and Internet segments, hinted it might go for an
additional dividend rather than another share buyback, stressing
it would announce the final decision by the end of July.

300,"Jun 17, 2009 01:00PM ET",Growth and bank health woes weigh on Europe stocks,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 down 1.9 pct to lowest close since May 15 * Financials, oil & gas, basic resources leading losers * Defensive telecom, pharma stocks gain; Vodafone up 3.7 pct
 By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, June 17 (Reuters) - European shares fell for the
fourth straight session on Wednesday amid doubts about a return
to economic growth, which hammered commodity stocks, and with
banks in the red on fresh concerns about U.S. financial sector
health. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1.9
percent to 845.76 points -- its lowest close since May 15 -- but
remains up 1.7 percent year-to-date. ""We've seen a couple of weak days but no radical sell-off,""
said Commerzbank Chief Strategist Hans-Juergen Delp, who
attributed the downward move to a persistent discrepancy between
upbeat sentiment indicators and weak real economy data. ""The sentiment indicators have been positive but have not
been backed up by hard real economic data,"" he said. ""We need new impulses to kick off sustained gains but no
such impulses are in sight."" Banks took the most points off the European benchmark index. Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings and revised its
outlooks on 22 U.S. banks. ""Operating conditions for the industry will become less
favorable ... characterized by greater volatility in financial
markets during credit cycles, and tighter regulatory
supervision,"" S&P said, adding the changes also reflected an
ongoing broad-ranging reassessment of industry risk for U.S.
financial institutions. In Europe, Allied Irish Banks tumbled 17 percent, Dexia lost
6.8 percent, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse both fell 4
percent, and UBS dropped 3.9 percent.  DEMAND WORRIES London copper fell to a near two-week low as doubts about
the global economic recovery renewed worries over metals demand.
 Among miners, Xstrata plunged 10.2 percent, Rio Tinto lost
7.8 percent, Anglo American fell 6.3 percent and BHP Billiton
was down 3.9 percent. Steelmakers also suffered, notably ArcelorMittal, which
dropped 6.4 percent to its lowest close in three weeks. Softer oil prices hit energy stocks, with Repsol down 3.2
percent, BP down 2.4 percent and Total down 2.2 percent. Economic data on Wednesday showed the euro zone's unadjusted
exports fell 27 percent year-on-year in April and imports
dropped 28 percent. Bank of England policymakers acknowledged recent data on
Britain's economy had been encouraging but stuck with gloomy
projections published in May, minutes to this month's policy
meeting showed. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs lowered its
forecast for the domestic economy to contraction of 2.7 percent
this year and 0.4 percent in 2010, suggesting a deeper and
longer recession than so far anticipated. U.S. package delivery company FedEx Corp gave an outlook
well below Wall Street estimates, saying the next two quarters
would be ""extremely difficult"" although there were signs that
the pace of economic decline had slowed. ""The bulls have lost their swagger and after a week long
stalemate, the bears appear to be winning (the) recovery debate.
Financial markets have now broken out of last week's unusually
tight trading range,"" BetOnMarkets.com said in a note.  TRIPLE-WITCHING Some analysts have said the so-called triple witching -- the
simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options
and single stock options -- on June 19 could be playing a role. Technical analysts, or chartists, at UniCredit, said that
impact may have run its course by now. ""In the last five quarters, expiration effects already
occurred at the beginning of the week ... we expect most of the
expected pressure already to have happened,"" they said in an
equity strategy note. ""The market is clearly missing some real inspiration,""
UniCredit said, citing turnover on the New York Stock Exchange,
the trend of which European equity markets tends to follow. The day's European gainers were mainly in traditional
defensive sectors such as telecommunications and healthcare. In
telecommunications, Vodafone added 3.7 percent, Deutsche Telekom
 put on 2.1 percent and France Telecom rose 1.6 percent. Among healthcare stocks, AstraZeneca was up 2.5 percent and
Sanofi Aventis rose 1.5 percent. It was thin on the corporate news front, but some companies
made waves. Sainsbury fell 5.7 percent after Britain's third-biggest
grocer said it would raise about $700 million to accelerate its
expansion. ""The market isn't buying the capital raising and expansion
plans,"" ETX Capital said in a note. ""Analysts are concerned that the UK grocery market is
developing into a `barbell' shape, with giant Tesco at one end
and low-cost retailers like Morrison's and Asda (part of U.S.
WalMart) at the other. Sainsbury's, in this analysis, looks
uncomfortably stuck in the middle,"" ETX Capital said. Shares in K+S fell 14 percent after the German fertiliser
and salt maker warned of a bigger drop in earnings and sales
this year than previously forecast, as farmers continue to hold
off on potash orders.

dispute between the two firms. ""Since the announcement yesterday that the deal got
rejected, we've been seeing selling pressure,"" said Wafik Dawood
of Naeem Brokerage. France Telecom has since said it might reduce its
investments in Egypt, which added to the negative sentiment in
the market, Dawood said. Shares in OT lost 6.8 percent to 32.60 Egyptian pounds
($5.80) per share, while Mobinil shares dipped 1.7 percent to
190.90 pounds. Dawood added that declines on global markets also
contributed to a drop on Egyptian shares, as foreign and
institutional investors sold shares. Global shares fell from recent 2009 highs on Thursday as
government bonds tumbled around the world, dragged down by
investor concern about mounting Western government debt. Shares in market heavyweight Orascom Construction Industries
 fell 4.5 percent to 202.27 pounds. The benchmark EGX 30 index fell 3.48 percent to 5,665.32
points, while the broader EGX 70 index lost 2.1 percent to 571
points.

think it will last too long,"" he added. Shares in the two firms had been suspended from trade since

 (Adds detail, CEO, analyst comments, updates shares) By James Davey LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - British music and books
retailer HMV Group forecast full-year profit at the top end of
market hopes, boosted by market share gains following the demise
of Woolworths and Zavvi. The 88-year-old firm also announced on Wednesday a
concession partnership with France Telecom's Orange to offer
mobile phones and services, and a deal with Curzon Cinemas to
trial digital cinemas. These developments, along with a plan to enter the live
music market announced in January, continue to reposition the
HMV brand away from its traditional music base into a broad
entertainment retailer. ""Our vision is getting customers closer to the content that
they love,"" chief executive Simon Fox told reporters. He said group profit before tax and exceptional items for
the year to April 25 would be towards the upper end of market
expectations. Prior to Wednesday's update these were pitched at between
50.3 million pounds and 63.7 million ($74 million-$94 million).
In 2007-08, HMV made 56.6 million pounds. Shares in HMV have increased in value by 18 percent over the
past year, outperforming the UK's general retail index by 31
percent. The stock was down 2 pence at 148 pence at 0923 GMT, valuing
the business at 632 million pounds. HMV, which runs music, DVD and video games shops under its
own name as well as Waterstone's bookstores, said underlying
sales in the 16 weeks to April 25 were flat year-on-year, ahead
of analyst forecasts for a fall of about 1.5 percent. Sales at HMV UK and Ireland shops open at least a year were
up 4.3 percent, reflecting ""double-digit"" volume growth in music
and DVDs, as well as continued growth in video gaming despite a
softening of this market since Christmas. ""We're working hard to take advantage of the opportunities
arising from the changes to our competitive landscape that have
taken place since Christmas,"" said Fox. The group, which has acquired 23 former Zavvi stores, is in
the midst of a three-year turnaround plan aimed at meeting the
challenge of competition from Internet retailers and
supermarkets, as well as the rise of music and film downloads. Amid a downturn in consumer spending, rivals Woolworths and
Zavvi failed to cope, with both groups entering administration
late last year. Woolworths and Zavvi had accounted for 20 percent of UK CD
sales and 15 percent of DVD sales. Waterstone's like-for-like sales fell 4.5 percent over the
16 week period, reflecting an overall book market down about 4
percent, but maintained market share over the year. ""HMV will continue to benefit from reduced high street
competition through to the all-important Christmas period ...
Thereafter, focus will return to the structural challenges of
selling entertainment products on the high street: there is a
reason why there is only 'one man standing' in that arena,"" said
David Stoddart, analyst at Altium Securities. HMV forecast year end net debt of about 10 million pounds. Fox said the release schedule looked good with ""Slumdog
Millionaire"" in DVDs in June and a new novel from Dan Brown in
books in September.

304,"Nov 05, 2008 06:02AM ET","Orange UK scales back broadband, IPTV plans",nan," LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Mobile operator Orange has slowed
its fixed-line broadband roll-out in Britain and returned to the
drawing board on its planned Internet-based TV service as it
grapples with the most competitive market in Europe. Tom Alexander, chief executive of Orange UK, which is owned
by France Telecom, told reporters the company had scaled back
the broadband roll-out to focus on improving the quality of
service rather than simply going for growth.  It is also building out its own broadband network, rather
than renting lines from BT, which will allow it to take more
control and secure better profits. Olaf Swantee, the head of Orange's global mobile operations,
said he had previously received hundreds of complaints from
unhappy broadband customers in Britain but had recently seen
that improve after the change of focus. Orange has just over 1 million users signed to its
fixed-line broadband service and is ranked sixth in Britain
behind BT, Virgin Media, Carphone Warehouse, Tiscali and BSkyB. Alexander, speaking late on Tuesday in comments embargoed
for Wednesday, said the group was also reviewing its plans to
launch Internet protocol television because it was not happy
with the service. Alexander said Orange had run a trial of the TV service in
Britain following its success in France and said it had been
ready to roll out. But they had decided it was too similar to a
TV offering from BT, BT Vision, and wanted to rethink how the
service should work. ""No roll-out imminent,"" he said at a briefing in central
London, adding that they would look at different business
models. New business models for TV could include TV on mobile.
