But what really unsettled investors in the latest round of earnings calls was retailers admitting that tariffs were starting to bite and how little they had to say on how they could soften the blow. Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) warned higher duties would put pressure on prices for U.S. consumers, while Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney Company Inc said their businesses would suffer if tariffs were extended to include apparel and footwear.Kohl's Corp said trade tensions were one of the reasons for a cut in its profit outlook and called the situation ""fluid."" ""We have been watching this tariff story play out,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research and a portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management. ""There doesn't seem to be in the immediate term (any sign) of things getting any better."" Many high-end brands have relied on China to boost sales and counter a slowdown in saturated developed markets and it is now by far the world's biggest market for luxury goods, fueled in particular by young shoppers.Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) has invested heavily, partnering with Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and WeChat to sell its products and targeting $500 million in revenue in China in five years. Asian sales have risen 18% in the past two years to over $1 billion. Capri Holdings' Michael Kors last year had Chinese actress Yang Mi visit their flagship store at Rockefeller Center in New York City for a fan meet-up event and PVH's Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Tapestry Inc's Coach have all hosted Chinese fashion shows and opened flagship stores in China.However, with China's economy growing last year at the slowest pace in nearly three decades and April data pointing to surprisingly weak retail sales, growth of the luxury market globally has slowed by around two percentage points to 6%-8% annually, according to Boston Consulting Group.CONSUMER SHIFT BACK TO MAINLAND CHINA Investors are on edge after any signs of a further downturn.Louis Vuitton owner LVMH's shares dropped more than 7% in October after it said sales growth in China fell from the high-teens to the mid-teens, dragging shares in Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA,  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) SCA and  Burberry  Group (LON:BRBY) PLC.Stocks have since recovered and some top brands have flagged a pick-up in mainland China, with Vuitton saying last week that demand for its handbags was still at ""unheard of"" levels. Spending by Chinese shoppers, however, is increasingly shifting from overseas shopping capitals like Paris or New York back home, encouraged by cuts in import tariffs and other measures by China's government to boost domestic spending. That trend has in turn dented sales at labels like jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) that are exposed to falls in spending by Chinese tourists to the United States. WHO CAN WITHSTAND THE TARIFF BLOW?Until early May, S&P 500 retail companies were outperforming the broad market, up 23% compared with 17.5% for the main index. Since Trump's May 5 tweet announcing tariffs would rise to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports, they trail by about 2% and the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF saw outflows of $162.4 million in May, Lipper flow estimates from Refinitiv show. Among the most exposed are firms who have poured much of the investment capital worked up in the good times into a near-future that they assumed would be largely Chinese. Shares of winter jacket maker Canada Goose fell 26% in one day after it reported the first slowing in sales growth in two years, undermining its plan to open three stores in China in the coming years on top of the six it has already.By contrast, analysts say  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart are among a few with the scale to force suppliers to absorb part of any tariff-driven rise in costs. Both have been working to trim China's role as their chief supplier by sourcing products elsewhere. ""Companies that are doing well and indicate they can mitigate tariffs are being rewarded while those that are missing are being doubly punished,"" said John Zolidis, president of New York-based investment advisor Quo Vadis Capital.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1,"Apr 11, 2019 04:02AM ET",StockBeat - Luxury Goods Shine After Another Big Quarter for LVMH,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s been a tough 12 months for most sectors in Europe’s stock market. Exporters of capital goods have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, banks and financial services hobbled by negative interest rates, consumer stocks struggling to escape the shackles of low wage growth and demographic decline.But one sector has been a relatively constant bright light, and it’s leading the way again this Thursday. Luxury goods makers are roaring ahead after another strong quarter for LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French drinks-to-fashion group.LVMH announced after the bell on Wednesday that its revenue grew 16% on the year in the first quarter and said the positive trends that had helped it to a record year in 2018 were still in place. Most remarkably, in a world economy that is supposedly suffering a synchronized slowdown, the group said that “all geographic regions are experiencing good growth.”The news has sent the stock up 3.1% on a day when most indexes are down, due in part to frustration at the prospect of another six months of uncertainty over Brexit.  As of 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was at 385.12, down 1.56 points or 0.4%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while the German DAX was down 0.4%. The Paris CAC 40 was outperforming, down less than 0.1%, thanks mainly to its luxury names.As has often been the case, LVMH’s performance is supporting the rest of the sector. Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and scarf-maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) were close behind it at the top of the CAC 40, while Italian rivals Salvatore Ferragamo  (MI:SFER) and Moncler (MI:MONC) were also both among the best performers in Milan.The results have distracted attention away from one less pleasant piece of news that may come back to haunt the sector in due course. French police raided the premises of some of the country’s drinks makers on Wednesday on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a drinks maker that doesn’t have the same exposure to fashion as the other stocks in the sector, is the notable laggard this morning, rising only 0.3%."

4,"Mar 20, 2019 04:59AM ET",StockBeat - Bayer's Remorse Deepens After Second Roundup Verdict,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- German chemicals group  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has more cause to regret its $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) this morning, after a U.S. jury found that its weedkiller Roundup was responsible for causing the cancer of plaintiff Edwin Hardeman. It’s the second verdict against the company and worse is to come, as the current trial in California will now move on to assessing corporate liability.Bayer is still arguing that the verdict is scientifically unfounded, but its arguments are falling on deaf ears as the market has wiped another 11% off the stock’s value this morning. That move alone is around $7 billion, which is more than the $6 billion in direct costs that analysts see as likely from the Roundup cases, so there’s an open question as to whether analysts have been too cautious or the market is overreacting.Back in 2015, when management was streamlining the sprawling conglomerate, its shares were worth over twice as much. But the Monsanto acquisition, intended to make it the global leader in agrichemicals, has not only brought a whole bunch of legacy legal liabilities, it has also created a lack of focus that has hit operations at the rest of the group. Those problems will remain even if the direct costs of Roundup can be reasonably contained.Aside from Bayer, markets are flat to lower, content to await the result of today's Federal Reserve meeting and tomorrow's EU summit before making any more major moves. Germany's Dax is down 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 is unchanged and the benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 0.3% at 383.24.U.K.-based satellite group  Inmarsat  (LON:ISA) is up 16.5% after receiving a bid from private equity interests, and Hermes (PA:HRMS), the French luxury group famous for its scarves and bags, is up 1.1% after posting another set of results that showed its business in China is still thriving, despite all the talk of an economic slowdown there.On the downside, the big mining companies in the FTSE 100 are all lagging, due partly to fresh news of problems in U.S.-China trade talks and to a sharp drop in iron ore prices overnight. Brazilian giant Vale (NYSE:VALE), which has been in regulators’ crosshairs since a fatal dam collapse earlier in the year, announced on Tuesday it had received court permission reopen one of its largest mines, which would ease a global supply bottleneck. It had said earlier in the week that it would have to close another large mine temporarily due to regulatory issues."

Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told the Wall Street Journal that spending by Chinese customers either in China or on trips abroad grew by double digits for most of its major brands in the quarter, and that there had been no visible slowdown at the end of the year. LVMH shares were up 6.9% by 04.55 AM ET (09.55 GMT), and the results also pulled rivals Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) up to the top of the French CAC 40 index. The U.K.'s  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) also rose in sympathy.U.K. stocks posted mixed reactions to the votes in parliament last night that reaffirmed a ‘no-deal’ Brexit as the default option for March 29 and rejected the chance to call for an extension of a deadline that’s now less than two months away.The British pound lost nearly 1% against the dollar and euro on the votes but had recovered much of those losses by mid-morning. At 04:55 AM ET, the GBPUSD was at $1.3117, up over half a cent from its overnight lows.

16,"Dec 18, 2018 03:30AM ET",Burberry Skeptics Still Dominate as Gobbetti Seeks Turnaround,nan,"(Bloomberg) --  Burberry  Group Plc (LON:BRBY) Chief Executive Officer Marco Gobbetti and star designer Riccardo Tisci may be the saviors who finally deliver on the U.K. trench-coat maker’s long-promised turnaround. Analysts aren’t buying it yet.Burberry is running neck and neck with  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) for the dubious distinction of being the lowest ranked by analysts among Europe’s 10 biggest luxury and apparel stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has 16 hold recommendations, four sells and only three buys, the data shows.Shares of Burberry have fallen 4.6 percent this year through Monday and are hovering at about the same level as mid 2017, when Gobbetti took the helm of the London-based company. Protracted weakness in the share price could end up making Burberry a takeover target, some analysts say.The share performance and analysts’ skepticism show that the new team hasn’t yet convinced the market that it’s given Burberry the boost it needs, just as the broader luxury industry faces the prospect of slowing economic growth globally and weaker demand from Chinese consumers.“Gobbetti has inherited a very challenging situation,” Flavio Cereda, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “If all goes well, there could be some positive signals at the end of next year, but in a market that’s slowing down, the risk is that it takes longer.”Gobbetti has pulled together a good team and is making the right choices, with Burberry starting to address its distribution problems, said Cereda, who has a hold rating. Still, the company’s supply chain remains weak and brand heat on social media, considered an indicator of future performance, remains a question mark, he said. Another issue is the delay with which Tisci’s creations will hit stores.“Timing is the big issue: Tisci’s debut collection isn’t available in stores yet and will just start meaningfully contributing to performance towards the end of next year,” Jelena Sokolova, an analyst at Morningstar who also has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, wrote in an email in response to a Bloomberg query.The stock rallied after Tisci’s appointment was announced March 1, reaching a high on Aug. 28, before heading down again in October amid a global market rout tied to investor worries that China, a key engine of growth, was cooling off. If there’s no revival in the share price, an acquirer could pop up, Cereda said.Burberry has told analysts that they will need to be patient. Tisci’s debut runway collection will start being in stores in February and from May, all new deliveries will be his design, the company has said.“At this stage, our strategic focus is on igniting brand heat -- starting with influencers and key opinion leaders, which will cascade to all consumers -- and I’m pleased that we have started to make some good progress on this front,” Gobbetti said on a conference call last month. “But as you know, shifting consumer perception, transitioning product, and transforming our distribution will take time.”There’s “no rush to get involved” with Burberry shares, HSBC analyst Antoine Belge wrote in a Dec. 3 note. “In 2019 we think the British brand will still be too fragile.” He upgraded the stock to hold from reduce in October."

19,"Nov 30, 2018 02:23AM ET",Chinese sneeze could give Europe Inc. a nasty flu,nan,"By Julien Ponthus, Helen Reid and Danilo MasoniLONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - With sluggish growth translating into the most disappointing earnings in years, European stocks are set for a tough ride if a full blown Sino-U.S. trade war erupts following Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping's G20 dinner on Saturday.The ongoing tariff dispute has already made the Chinese economy sneeze and given a cold to some of Europe Inc's most iconic powerhouses due to their heavy exposure to the world's second biggest economy. This drag is set to continue even if Trump and Xi's meeting ends cordially. If relations between the economic superpowers deteriorate further, the impact on many of Europe's top firms could be profound.Upmarket German car makers like BMW (DE:BMWG) or French luxury houses such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) have already been tagged as collateral victims of the Trump administration's trade policy after sharp falls in their share prices this year. With about six percent or roughly 80 billion euros of its constituents' revenues originating from China, Germany's DAX (GDAXi) is typically used as a proxy to bet on a trade war and is lagging, with a 12.5 percent fall year-to-date, the less exposed pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark.BMW will make 18 percent of its revenue in 2018 from the world's second-largest economy, while Volkswagen's share stands at 14 percent, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Even if Germany, whose bilateral trade with China hit a record 188 billion euros last year, is a key concern, worries among investors are widespread. A study conducted for Reuters by business insights platform AlphaSense shows a threefold increase in the number of times a China slowdown was mentioned during European earnings conference calls between July and September this year.While just 16 companies in the MSCI Europe index mentioned China in the context of a slowdown between April and June, that number climbed to 49 companies, in earnings calls during the following quarter. The mention of China, in any form or way, jumped from 361 to 540 during the same period.For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2QLBKAN.(GRAPHIC: European companies increasingly cite China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QLBO3v) If some of the underperformance of European bourses in comparison to Wall Street can be partially explained by the Trump's administration tax cuts, many analysts believe the key lies elsewhere. ""Europe is very much exposed, being very cyclical, it's an open economy and its stock markets already reflect that"", explained Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).""European markets are quite vulnerable to a slowdown in emerging markets, not less given the domestic dynamic which is polluted by the political problems in Italy or Brexit,"" he added referring to Britain leaving the European Union and the Italian government's tug-of-war with Brussels over its budget.An escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war would force Dutch asset manager NN Investments to reassess its view that European stocks are due for a comeback in 2019. ""It's the biggest threat,"" said Valentijn van Niewenhuisen, head of multi-asset at the firm. Acknowledging slowing growth, the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for China and since then indicators from automobile sales to e-commerce trends and production data are suggesting the world's second biggest economy is cooling somewhat.With creeping corporate and household debts, China is believed to have little room for maneuver for fiscal stimulus if it doesn't want to weaken its currency, which the Trump administration believes gives it an unfair trading advantage.Data compiled by Morgan Stanley shows how European miners are not the only ones dependent on the appetite of material hungry China.

(GRAPHIC: European companies with the highest China exposure - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QOVGCY) 'THE BIGGEST THREAT'CHINA SYNDROMEAside from basic material providers, firms such as France's fashion giant  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the owner of Gucci, and Switzerland's jeweler  Richemont  (S:CFR) have a sales exposure of 24 percent.Analysts at Jefferies have nicknamed the contamination of luxury stocks a reverse ""China Syndrome"", in reference to a 1979 movie in which a nuclear meltdown in the United States could make its way through the Earth to China. ""It would appear that the reverse threat is now in place in the Personal Luxury Goods sector with fears of a sharp slowdown in China threatening to contaminate the entire sector starting in 2019.""Other companies under threat are the big German industrial powerhouses such as  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) or BASF (DE:BASFn).""We're concerned about what's embedded in German industrials' share prices. They embed continued profitability in China that's very strong and continued growth and we're skeptical that's sustainable,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn, director at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners, where he helps manage $30 billion.But the reliance on the Chinese market isn't only worrying investors. A new strategy paper from Germany's influential BDI industry federation calls on firms to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market. While their presence there was once seen as a strength, it is now unsettling German politicians and industry as Beijing asserts control over the economy under President Xi Jinping.This weekend's G20 meeting between the leaders of the world's top two economies will be key for market sentiment, which has been battered by the months-long trade spat.But investors aren't betting on an end to the dispute any time soon.""Ultimately it's hard to see China will be able or willing to offer enough to meet U.S. demands so things could get worse,"" said Royal London senior economist Melanie Baker.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

LVMH on Tuesday reported a 14 percent rise in comparable sales in its key handbags and fashion division, home to its Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior brands, beating forecasts, and overall revenues were in line with expectations.But that was not enough to reassure investors, with LVMH shares down 4.7 percent by 0725 GMT. ""I think the market is in sell the news mode, anticipating a looming slowdown due to the trade war,"" a trader in Geneva said. Brokers at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the luxury goods sector to ""underweight"" on Wednesday, also adding to pressure on industry stocks.

""Consequently, the brand's presence at exhibitions no longer corresponds to its strategy for exclusive and selective distribution,"" the company said in a statement.Both brands will be present for the last time at the next Geneva fair in January, they said.The announcements deal another blow to third-party retailers and the two big industry shows designed for them - the SIHH (Salon International de Haute Horlogerie) in Geneva, which takes place in January, and Baselworld, held in Basel in March.The number of exhibitors at the Basel fair halved this year and it recently lost one of its most important pillars when Swatch Group (S:UHR) dropped out.The SIHH had been seen as benefiting from Baselworld's troubles, with brands such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) moving from Basel to Geneva, but the latest news shows it is not immune to the increasing focus on digital channels.Watch retailers are trying to adjust to the changing environment, with bigger players such as Bucherer or The Watches of Switzerland expanding internationally and pushing online and pre-owned activities, while smaller rivals try to find a niche to survive.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Sep 21, 2018 01:30PM ET",French handbag maker Longchamp to invest in China to revive sales,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag makers, is increasing its presence in China and the United States to boost its sales, its CEO said, betting on celebrity tie-ups and its online platforms to revive sluggish growth. Founded in 1948, Longchamp, best known for its folding Pliage handbags, is one of the last remaining independent family-owned leather goods makers in France with a global presence. At a time when some top-of-the-range luxury brands, such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton and Hermes (PA:HRMS), are riding high on strong demand from China, others are having to refresh their designs or marketing strategies to keep young shoppers in particular hooked. Longchamp, which does not publish its earnings, saw sales grow at a ""less vigorous"" pace in 2016 and 2017, having tripled in the decade before, Chief Executive Jean Cassegrain, grandson of the firm's founder, said in an interview. The company - whose top market is French, followed closely by China - took a hit as tourist numbers in France fell following deadly Islamist militant attacks in 2015. But by next year, Cassegrain said Longchamp aims to outperform growth in the broader luxury industry, which according to consultancy Bain, should rise 6 to 8 percent globally.The firm had said it made sales of 560 million euros ($658.11 million) in 2015, and they are estimated by industry watchers to still be in a 500 million to 600 million range.Longchamp, which sells its bags and accessories in China through Tencent's (HK:0700) messaging site WeChat, plans to launch its own e-commerce platform there in 2019 to increase sales, following similar moves by rivals LVMH and Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci. The handbag maker has largely finished expanding its worldwide store network, with 1,500 sale points in department stores and 300 of its own shops, although it plans to open a few more in the United States, including one in Beverley Hills.""We're entering a different phase of growth, it's no longer about store openings but about improving the performance of our current network,"" Cassegrain said. Longchamp, which manufactures about half its bags in France with the rest in countries including Tunisia and Romania, recently marked its 70th anniversary with its first fashion show in New York and picked celebrity model Kendall Jenner as the face of its campaigns to raises its U.S. profile.

33,"Aug 19, 2018 07:10PM ET","Global luxury brands again chase China's young, rich and spendthrift",nan,"By Farah Master and Donny KwokHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada (HK:1913) to LVMH (PA:LVMH) are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows.Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster.The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said.""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said on a call with analysts.""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands.""Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewelry and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say.Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialization and urbanization. ""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. TRADE WAR JITTERSChinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. Brands including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy.The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said.Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC) has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. ""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here.""SMALLER CITY PUSHTo capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth.Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's.LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewelry brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September.Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates.""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus,  Kering  group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs.""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said.Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers.Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year.Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country.Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to some of the carmakers that Trump has explicitly targeted in his tariffs rhetoric, fell the most, down 1.2 percent. BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 0.8 to 2.4 percent. The STOXX 600 autos sector (SXAP) hit a seven-month low.""The automotive sector is one of the main sectors that could potentially be impacted by import tariffs,"" said Weidenbach, adding that the impact on different German carmakers may depend on how much of their production is U.S.-based.Europe's companies in general are more exposed to the global economy than their U.S. counterparts, making them more vulnerable to countries imposing higher tariffs on goods. Some 18 percent of European company revenues comes from North America and 9 percent from China. Thirty-two percent is derived from emerging markets.U.S. companies get just 4 percent of their revenues from China and 10 percent from Europe, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Multinational sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell 2.5 percent, as the fear of an end to unfettered access to global markets also bruised luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS), LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Moncler (MI:MONC).Industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX, along with French planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). Mining shares (SXPP) tumbled 2.4 percent, tracking a decline in London copper prices amid the escalating trade tensions.Highly valued tech stocks were also selling off as investors shed the sectors that have led the strong equity rally. The tech sector (SX8P) fell 1.4 percent, having hit a 17-year high as recently as Friday.The most impressive falls were in the UK retail and housing sectors.  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares plummeted 10 percent after the British department store warned on profits for the third time in six months, blaming its poor trading on increased competitor discounting and weakness in its key markets.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

40,"Jun 06, 2018 11:50AM ET",There Aren't Enough Pampered Cattle to Produce Luxury Leather,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- There may not be enough coddled animals to supply booming markets for luxury leather.There’s strong demand for the best leather as there are more people with extreme wealth in the world that want luxury goods, said Don Ohsman, publisher of Hidenet, which reports on leather markets. But not many animals have hides that are good enough to turn into an expensive handbag.French luxury brand  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) has already started complaining about the lack of quality hides. The company uses the leather for its Birkin and Kelly handbags, known for their five- and six-figure price tags.Even while beef production is increasing, it’s not any hide that can be turned into high-quality leather. Many European luxury bagmakers use calfskins, and people aren’t eating much veal these days, Ohsman said.“A calf is raised in a pen and never goes outside, so its skin is blemish-free,” he said.Other animals are raised indoors where they’re not exposed to the elements and can’t rub against fences or get scratched or bitten up by bugs, said Ken Maxfield, president of the Maxfield Report, a hide-market publication. Japanese cattle that famously receive massages could be turned into a luxury hide, for example. Only a small percentage of U.S. hides go into luxury markets because those cattle are mostly raised outdoors.Buyers of luxury leather are “so selective, and it’s such a critical process -- not many hides can qualify into that,” Maxfield said."
41,"Apr 06, 2018 07:31AM ET",Birkin bag maker Hermes expands manufacturing with new French workshop,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) said on Friday it had opened a new manufacturing plant in eastern France, as rivals like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton also expand leather goods production to keep up with thriving Chinese demand. Hermes, known for its squared silk scarves as well as its hand-stitched $10,000 Kelly or Birkin bags, trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is famed for attracting long waiting lists. Like luxury peers, Hermes benefited from strong appetite from Asian shoppers in 2017, lifting its sales and profits to record levels.In the fourth quarter, sales growth slowed slightly from the previous three months, however, as stocks of its handbags ran low. Hermes, originally a saddle and equestrian equipment maker, said its 16th leather goods workshop, located in the country not far from the city of Mulhouse, would eventually house 260 specialists trained to hand-craft a bag from start to finish. Vuitton is also expanding its leather goods production with at least two new domestic workshops this year and next.Hermes has tended to pick sites in rural areas for its plants, hiring locally and training staff-in house, for workshops of around 300 people maximum. Hermes also plans two more production sites in France by 2020, and currently employs around 3,310 leather goods workers making everything from saddles to wallets. France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialisation.

A third new opening should follow later next year, Vuitton's industrial director Emmanuel Mathieu said.Parent LVMH, also home to labels like Givenchy and Christian Dior, reported record profits and sales in 2017, helped like its peers by the rebounding appetite of Asian shoppers for luxury goods.Fashion labels derive some of their highest margins from leather goods like handbags and wallets.Vuitton makes the majority of these items in its home market, echoing rival Hermes (PA:HRMS), which trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is also due to open several new workshops by 2020.By early 2019 Vuitton will have 16 French leather workshops, the firm said. Its last opening was in 2017, following a lull since 2011, although it had increased staff at its sites in the meantime.France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialization.The industrial sector saw its first net job creation since 2001 in the last three months of 2017, national statistics showed this month.Louis Vuitton, which owns all of its own stores, is also looking to cut lead times to help it react to sales trends, managers said. It aims to deliver handbags within a week of internal orders coming in, down from the current two weeks.""When we launch a new product we can adapt very quickly to demand,"" Mathieu said at one of Vuitton's existing plants near the village of Sainte-Florence in western France.Models including Vuitton's Twist bags or the mini Palm Springs backpacks are assembled by hand at the site by some 250 workers trained on specialist stitching machines. Vuitton does have several plants elsewhere, however, including two in California to cater to the U.S. market and a new one planned in Texas.It also has four workshops in the Spanish region of Catalonia, and production facilities in Portugal and Romania where it makes components like luggage handles.LVMH does not break out earnings for its brands, but analysts estimate Vuitton's sales reached at least 8 billion euros last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

43,"Feb 18, 2018 07:10PM ET","Chanel, Farfetch pair up for digital push at fashion label's stores",nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - French couture house Chanel has taken a minority stake in London-based online retailer Farfetch, the companies said on Monday, as part of a tie-up to develop digital services such as chats to connect the label's clients with store assistants. Luxury goods companies worldwide are trying to expand their digital services to court younger or more tech-savvy clients.Privately-owned Chanel, famed for its tweed suits and quilted leather handbags, has been an outlier in the industry push to move more shopping online by deciding not to roll out web sales of its clothing and leather goods. Under the new deal, the label will not sell its wares through Farfetch but would work with the platform in coming years on digital innovations linked to customer services, said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's fashion president. These could include smartphone applications allowing people to flag their preferences and sizes online before entering a store, meaning assistants can cater to their needs, or help them locate an item spotted in a magazine for instance, he said. ""This is about how to enrich our relationship with our customers,"" Pavlovsky told Reuters, adding that Chanel was not trying to take a ""Big Brother"" approach of tracking clients but giving those who wished it more tailor-made assistance. He did not give any financial details about the tie-up. Farfetch has long been tipped for a stock market listing, and investment banks were recently pitching to work on a U.S. flotation later this year, sources said in January.Farfetch's other investors include Chinese online retailer JD.com (O:JD), French investment company Eurazeo (PA:EURA) and Singapore state investor Temasek. The online retailer's shopping platform connects buyers to luxury fashion items from more 700 boutiques worldwide. The firm has also invested in developing digital functions for stores, which can be adapted to suit its partners. Britain's Burberry said on Thursday it would team up with Farfetch.""The challenge for our luxury industry is that our clients are used to ultra-personalized experiences,"" Farfetch's Portuguese founder and Chief Executive Jose Neves said. ""When you walk into a store, people don't know you.""Chanel already offers select clients some digital support but wants to make this more widely available, Pavlovsky said, adding the firm would start testing new services this year.The brand has close to 200 stores. It sells cosmetics, eyeglasses and perfumes online, but says releasing other items on the web would make them less exclusive.Rivals such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton,  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci or Hermes (PA:HRMS) have taken a different tack, chasing sales growth by selling more online.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Jan 17, 2018 01:10AM ET","China luxury sales rebound as millennials snap up cosmetics, handbags: report",nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's luxury goods market is back in fashion.Domestic sales of Gucci handbags to Chanel cosmetics, sluggish in China for years, rose at the fastest pace in over half a decade last year and are poised to consolidate the gains in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co.That could provide a major fillip for brands targeting the world's top luxury spenders, though who benefits most will depend on which brands are able to lure in China's big-spending youth - now the driving force in the market.Sales of luxury goods in China hit 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) last year, up around 20 percent from the year before, Bain & Co said in a report on Wednesday. That's the sharpest growth since 2011, when luxury sales started to be hit by slower economic growth and a fierce crackdown on corruption.China's shoppers are the biggest spenders worldwide on luxury products, making up 32 percent of the 262 billion euros ($308 bln) global market last year and propelling France's LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP).""It's essentially been a flattish market for the last five years; now 2017 is plus 20 percent, that's an amazing rebound,"" said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain, adding lower pricing and government support were key drivers.The sharp rise - which saw particularly strong growth for women's clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, shoes and handbags - follows tepid growth in 2016 and dips in both 2015 and 2014.Beijing has been pushing for greater domestic spending, cracking down on shopping agents known as ""daigou"" bringing products into China from overseas, and cutting high tax rates on imported luxury goods sold in the country.China's domestic market makes up 8 percent of global luxury sales, according to Bain, and despite fast growth at home Chinese shoppers still make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas.MILLENNIAL DRIVERSBain said China's luxury market should also see robust growth this year ""fueled by millennials and ready to wear"" attire, though the growth rate would likely slow down to ""low-mid teen"" levels given the fast growth in 2017.The revival is being driven by China's tech-savvy millennial generation aged between 20 to 34, who generally prefer ready-to-wear and fast fashion over more traditional design, helping propel new areas like luxury casual wear and sports wear.""This is a new China coming in as opposed to the old China coming back,"" said Lannes.That shift creates a challenge for more traditional brands like Prada (HK:1913), which is having to play catch up with newer rivals like Coach.Others like Hermes (PA:HRMS), France's LVMH and Kering are seeing revived appetite from China, helping boost their global sales last year.Luxury spirits makers, including China's own Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) and France's  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP), saw a pick up in China sales too.Lannes added the fast growth would see winners and losers emerge, depending on who could crack the code of China's youth.""A new China is emerging with new consumers that were not there five years ago that have different profiles, different expectations and different tastes,"" he said.

Hermes is also known for its printed silk scarves and neckties and makes perfume and watches, but its leather division - home to coveted handbags that are often only available through a waiting list - is its biggest revenue driver. Sales in that unit were up 12.2 percent in the first half of the year at constant exchange rates, while revenue across the group grew 9.7 percent.The broader luxury goods industry is enjoying a comeback after several years as Chinese demand improves following a slowdown, and younger shoppers worldwide show a growing taste for high-end goods, boosting online sales.Many firms are wary about 2018, however, as comparatives become less favorable following a buoyant year for growth. A strengthening euro is also making a dent in earnings when converted into the currency, and could put off some buyers.Hermes is due to report third quarter sales on Nov. 8.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That will unite the 70 year old fashion label worn by film stars from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman with the Christian Dior perfume and beauty business already owned by LVMH. The Arnault family, which holds a 47 percent stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9 percent of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for about 260 euros per share, a premium of 15 percent over Monday's closing price. LVMH shares rose 3 percent to a record high of 223 euros as investors and analysts welcomed the deals, which Arnault said would boost earnings at its fashion and leather goods division. Dior shares jumped 13 percent to a new high of 256 euros. ""This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view given the strong brand of Christian Dior, good use of its balance sheet and it reunites the Christian Dior brand with the very profitable perfume operation that LVMH operates,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a research note.The Dior holding company owns 41 percent of the LVMH group and 100 percent of Christian Dior Couture, the home of the Lady Dior handbag. Arnault's family company will offer 172 euros per share and 0.192 Hermes (PA:HRMS) shares for each Dior holding company share. It will also offer all-cash and all-share alternatives.Arnault has a stake of about 8 percent in luxury group Hermes, and its shares fell about 5 percent on the prospect of more of the stock coming to the market. The transactions ""will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division,"" Arnault said in a statement.LVMH said the overall deal would boost earnings per share within the first year of its completion, with the transactions expected to close during the second half of 2017.For graphic on European luxury brands, click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2oEKxKF  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(MGI) (N:MOV). ""We see a significant retail shift, especially in the U.S. The acceleration of the digital shift over the last five years has led to less traffic to retailers,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.""You're seeing some adjustments, but they'll take time to materialize. Retailers have to up their game to make venues more exciting and there's also a shift to online sales,"" he said, adding he didn't see that resolving very quickly.Shipments of Swiss watches fell 8 percent in January and February, dragged down notably by a 12.4 percent decline in the United States, where shipments also dropped 9 percent last year. U.S.-based MGI, whose brands include Swiss labels Movado and Ebel, on Monday reported a decline in sales and profits for the fiscal year to Jan. 31 and said it expected a mid single-digit drop in sales this year.Ricardo Guadalupe, head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot brand, said U.S. sales were flat for the brand so far this year. ""The Americans don't have the same luxury watch culture, it's not like in China where people love mechanical watches,"" he said.Laurent Dordet, at the helm of Hermes' (PA:HRMS) watch business, said sales were improving at Hermes boutiques, but multibrand retailers were still facing difficulties in many markets, notably the United States, due to excess stock.Industry major Swatch Group (S:UHR) gave a more optimistic forecast last week, forecasting a 7-9 percent rise in sales for 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

57,"Mar 22, 2017 03:38AM ET",Luxury goods group Hermes delivers record 2016 profit margin,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group Hermes (PA:HRMS) said on Wednesday it was starting 2017 on a solid footing after delivering record 2016 profits, providing further evidence of a broader recovery in the luxury goods industry.Chief Executive Axel Dumas nevertheless struck a cautious note for the year given underlying global political and economic uncertainties.""We did better than we expected in 2016 and we are entering 2017 on a solid base but remain cautious in view of an uncertain environment,"" Dumas told a conference call.Hermes, known for its $10,000 Birkin bags and $400 printed silk scarves, said net profits had risen by 13 percent rise to a record 1.1 billion euros ($1.19 billion).Its operating margin hit an historic high of 32.6 percent of sales against 31.8 percent in 2015, while the company also increased its dividend by 12 percent.Hermes added it was keeping an ""ambitious"" medium-term goal for revenue growth at constant exchange rates.The company's sales growth had mainly stemmed from a strong performance at its leather goods arm, which makes 50 percent of group sales, while other divisions also performed well although its watches unit lagged.Hermes joined other luxury companies such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) in reporting an improvement in the sector, which has suffered from slowing demand in China, while Islamist militant attacks in France have also deterred tourists from Europe.Several analysts expect the luxury goods sector to benefit in 2017 from improved consumer sentiment in China, tax cuts under the new U.S. administration and robust Middle Eastern demand due to firmer oil prices.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

58,"Jan 12, 2017 01:20PM ET",Exclusive: Staff at French fashion house Lanvin fear job cuts as sales slump - sources,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Morale is low at Lanvin with staff expecting job cuts after France's oldest fashion brand swung into the red in 2016 and new designer Bouchra Jarrar failed to lift sales, sources told Reuters.The company appointed advisory firm Long Term Partners to conduct an audit and it is due to present its findings to Lanvin's board at the end of this month and recommend ways to reduce the company's cost base, the sources with first hand knowledge of the matter said. Founded in 1889, Lanvin is one of France's last major independent fashion brands, part of the country's fashion heritage, in the same league as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Christian Dior, Hermes (PA:HRMS) and privately owned Chanel.Lanvin expects to post a net loss of more than 10 million euros for 2016 - its first in nearly a decade - against a profit of 6.3 million euros in 2015, sources have said.Many items on its website are being offered at a 50 percent discount. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company's woes stem in part from the uncertainty created by the arrival of its new designer, as well as the luxury spending downturn and underinvestment. Controlling shareholder, 75-year-old Chinese media magnate Shaw-Lan Wang who is based in Taiwan, has been reluctant to invest in the brand for many years. Wang would also not let her associate, private investor Ralph Bartel who owns 25 percent, inject more cash into the business as it would dilute her stake, the sources said. ""It is clear that the company's situation is deteriorating fast and now it is in a stalemate,"" one of the sources told Reuters.""But since Mrs Wang simply refuses to sell or (let the capital) be diluted, there is nothing we can do about it. It is so sad for the brand and its staff."" Wang shocked the fashion world in 2015 by sacking star designer Alber Elbaz after a boardroom dispute. Elbaz had been at the creative helm for 14 years and was frustrated by Wang's refusal to invest in Lanvin, particularly in areas crucial to growth such as new boutiques and accessories, several sources said. Lanvin declined to comment, while a spokesman for Wang said she was not available for comment and Long Term Partners did not return calls or emails asking for comment. DOWNWARD SPIRALLuxury analysts believe that Lanvin, had it benefited from more investment, has all it takes to become France's answer to Italy's Valentino, now generating more than 1 billion euros ($1.07 billion) in sales and preparing itself for a flotation. Instead, orders for new collections from multi-brand shops and department stores, which represent around 70 percent of Lanvin's turnover, fell 30-40 percent in the last half year. Overall, consolidated 2016 sales fell by more than 20 percent to below 170 million euros, from 210 million in 2015, several sources said. Designer Jarrar, appointed in March last year, presented at a show in September a Lanvin woman dressed in black and white tuxedos, very different from Elbaz's ethereal, light, ultra-feminine silhouettes adorned with clunky jewelry.DISPUTES At its peak in 2012, before Chief Executive Thierry Andretta, now CEO of Britain's Mulberry, resigned over strategic differences, revenue reached 235 million euros and the company's operating margins stood at around 10-12 percent. In 2015, Wang refused offers secured by Elbaz for Lanvin, including one of more than 400 million euros from Mayhoola, the Qatari firm that now owns Balmain and Valentino, sources said. Elbaz is still in legal proceedings with Lanvin and Wang over his dismissal and the value of his stake.Dozens of employees have resigned or been sacked and many former key staff are in legal fights, they said. Wang also sold off many of Lanvin's assets in the past decade, such as its Japanese operations to Japan's Itochu and its perfume business to Interparfums, which the brand can buy back in 2025. Lanvin is also in a dispute with Itochu over the value of the license it is able buy back, the sources said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

59,"Nov 03, 2016 10:10AM ET",Strong Hermes sales confirm China-fueled luxury revival,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - Hermes (PA:HRMS) confirmed stronger-than-expected global demand for luxury goods on Thursday, joining luxury goods industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) in outshining third quarter results forecasts.A sales rebound in mainland China, improvements in Hong Kong, a British surge thanks to a weaker pound and relative U.S. resilience despite the stronger dollar have all lifted luxury stocks including LVMH, Kering, Hermes,  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Burberry  (LA:BRBY) and  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in the past month.Chinese customers, the biggest buyers of luxury goods who make up more than a third of global demand, have been re-opening their wallets, luxury groups said, spurred in part by government policies encouraging local consumption.""The driving trend is that the Chinese customer is slowly coming back,"" Makiko Zuercher, who manages the 22-million euro Dynapartners Luxury Brands Fund, said. These positives now outweigh concerns about lower tourist traffic in Europe, due to the attacks on Paris, and the drop in purchasing power among Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers after the depreciation of their currencies. ""Many of the psychological catalysts which dampened luxury demand - starting with the renminbi deterioration in August 2015 and including attacks in Paris in November 2015 - have now been shrugged off,"" HSBC said in a note. ""Every market, with the possible exception of Japan, is doing better or in line with previous trends.""The broker said luxury stocks had been sold ""short"" by hedge funds, a trade showing they expect the price to fall, and largely ignored by ""long-only"" institutions for many months.The one luxury stock for which there is still shorting interest is Cartier owner Richemont, which makes half of its sales from watches, the luxury sector's most depressed segment. Data from Astec Analytics shows Richemont has the highest ""short"" interest. It is also one of the few luxury stocks still down for the year to date and analysts are not expecting any upbeat comments when it publishes its trading update on Friday. Kering is easily the best performer this year, and short-sellers have very low positions in the stock.Fund managers and buy-side analysts said investors needed to be remain selective as some brands such as Prada (HK:1913) and Tod's (MI:TOD) could continue to suffer in the near term from competition from more innovative rivals. Recent trading updates showed that sales growth in the sector could only be achieved through market share gains as the past levers to boost revenues such as opening new shops and lifting prices were no longer available.Hermes beat market expectations with a 8.8 percent rise in third-quarter sales at constant currencies, above analysts' 7 percent forecast, helped partly by China's rebound.Last month industry leader LVMH, regarded as a proxy for the sector, and later Kering, saw their shares soar after their respective Louis Vuitton and Gucci brands published much stronger than expected sales.""Who would have expected two years ago Gucci's recovery would be so strong,"" said Scilla Huang, manager of the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund, with 200 million euros under management.    ""They made courageous efforts and people were hungry for that kind of newness.""    /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin told Reuters in an interview the company's two Moscow outlets opened so far were ""a minimum"" even though some customers had become more cautious because of the weaker rouble.""Perhaps 10 years down the road we will have five-six boutiques in Russia: three (in) Moscow (or) four, perhaps; one in St Petersburg; and one or two in two other cities,"" he said at the company's second Russian store in central Moscow. ""It might be faster, it might be slower, but probably we will have in Russia eventually the same number of boutiques we have in most ... major European countries,"" Babin said.

65,"May 02, 2016 06:30PM ET",Chanel winning fight against luxury grey market: executive,nan,"By Sarah MarshHAVANA (Reuters) - Chanel, the world's second largest luxury brand, said on Monday its efforts to curb the grey market have been successful and are helping boost revenue in China despite weaker overall demand for luxury goods.The company narrowed its price gaps between the United States, Europe and Asia last year to prevent smugglers buying goods in one region to re-sell to another in the grey market.""We reduced quite a lot the parallel market, mainly in Asia, and we have double-digit growth in our boutiques in mainland China,"" Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's president of fashion, said in an interview in Havana.Chanel will unveil its latest Cruise collection in Havana on Tuesday, in Cuba's first major fashion show since the 1959 revolution and another sign of warming relations between the Communist-ruled island and the West. The United States and Cuba formally agreed to restore diplomatic relations last July.Despite the success in curbing grey market sales, the privately owned company expects slower sales growth this year, Pavlovsky told Reuters in Havana's landmark Teatro Marti. He declined to disclose figures.He noted that Chanel has an entire team, including external lawyers, that monitors the secondary market.The luxury goods industry been plagued in the last few months as a drop in global tourist traffic due to recent terrorist attacks, slower economic growth in China, and record low oil prices have dented the purchasing power of important luxury buyers from Russia and the Middle East.In April, industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) said its fashion and leather goods sales were flat while Hermes (PA:HRMS) said revenue growth slowed in the first quarter.Pavlovsky said fewer Russians were traveling due to the weak rouble, and Brazil's recession has curbed demand there.But Chanel was seeing solid growth in the United States, some parts of Europe such as Britain, Russia, China, Japan and Korea, he said. Chinese and Russians not traveling abroad as much were buying more at home.""There is a slowdown but not such a big slowdown,"" he said.Pavlovsky said Chanel was presenting its latest inter-seasonal Cruise line in Cuba because the country had inspired Karl Lagerfeld, the company's chief designer and creative director. Chanel, which began as a millinery store in 1909 in Paris, was also returning to its roots, he added.Founder Coco Chanel designed early collections for wealthy and glamorous Americans holidaying on yachts and cruises in the Caribbean. Cruises to Cuba had been forbidden during the country's standoff with the United States.Earlier on Monday, the first U.S. cruise ship to sail to the island in more than 50 years docked in Havana.Chanel, which has fewer than 200 boutiques worldwide, will not be setting up shop in Cuba any time soon, Pavlovsky said.""Why not, one day,"" he said.

67,"Mar 17, 2016 06:40PM ET",Swiss watchmakers face another challenging year,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzBASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are braced for another difficult year as economic woes in major markets curb consumers' appetite for pricey timepieces, industry executives said on Thursday.Sales in Hong Kong, the biggest market for Swiss watches, have been depressed as China's economic slowdown and Beijing's anti-corruption campaign have hurt spending by mainland Chinese, which shows no signs of rebounding.Zenith, the upmarket watch brand owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), sells almost two out of three watches to Chinese customers.""2016 is very complicated because people no longer have the confidence needed to simply go and buy our products,"" Zenith's Chief Executive Aldo Magada told Reuters at the Baselworld watch fair.He said he could not rule out job cuts. As well as China's slowdown, tourism in Paris, another luxury goods hub, has been hit by the Islamist attacks in November, while Russians travel and spend less because of the weak rouble, the Ukraine crisis and the low oil price - which is also tempering luxury spending in the Middle East.Like other upscale brands, Zenith has expanded into more affordable watches to meet the demands of more price-conscious consumers, a trend already visible at January's Geneva watch fair dominated by luxury goods group Richemont's (S:CFR) high-end brands.""Our product mix has changed, we sell fewer gold watches, more steel,"" said Magada.Competition from smartwatches is also threatening the luxury watch sector.Among luxury giant LVMH's watch brands, Zenith has suffered the most with a single-digit decline in sales last year, whereas TAG Heuer and Hublot generated growth thanks to their smaller exposure to China, said LVMH watch and jewelry head Jean-Claude Biver.""The first quarter makes us think that we'll again outperform the market this year,"" Biver said, adding TAG Heuer was hiring staff to push ahead with its smartwatch project.Swiss watch exports, which reflect the value of watches leaving the country but give no indication on what has really been sold to end consumers, tumbled 7.9 percent in January year-on-year after falling 3.3 percent last year.""I'm hearing from peers that the overall situation has become rather more tense since the beginning of the year,"" said Laurent Dordet, head of Hermes' (PA:HRMS) watch business, who would not comment on his own company's performance this year. Tissot and Longines, Swatch Group's (S:UHR) mid-price luxury brands, had slightly negative to flat sales growth last year and see at best a slight improvement this year.Independent high-end label Patek Philippe, so sought-after by collectors that it can grow sales by 1-3 percent in good times and bad, says many luxury watchmakers made the mistake of focusing too much on China and Chinese travelers.""They went too quickly. Now stock levels are too high everywhere,"" said Patek Philippe president Thierry Stern.Shares of luxury watchmakers and their parent groups have been hit hard in the past year as sales have slowed. However, some analysts say selling may have been overdone as industry executives see some brightspots such as Japan and South Korea, which are drawing more Chinese tourists.Shares in Swatch, the world's biggest watchmaker, for example, fell 21 percent last year and are down a further 2 percent this year, while  Richemont  has shed 11 percent this year after sliding nearly 19 percent last year. ""There is of course the special case of Hong Kong, where a lot of wholesalers are still very cautious. Overall, however, the mood has become too negative,"" said Scilla Huang Sun, portfolio manager of the Julius Baer Luxury Brands fund.She forecasts 5 percent organic growth for luxury brands this year, but says most of that will come in the second half.For a graphic on the Swiss watch industry, click on this link: http://tmsnrt.rs/1XuXPjH  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"Oct 21, 2015 01:18PM ET",Ferrari shares race ahead 15 percent on Wall Street debut ,nan,"By Lauren Hirsch and Agnieszka FlakNEW YORK/MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (N:RACE) shares jumped 15 percent to $60 on its Wall Street debut on Wednesday after the Italian supercar maker priced its share offering at the top of the range amid heavy investor demand.Limiting the offering to a 10 percent stake helped parent  Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) to leverage the scarcity factor to squeeze out value, defying a choppy U.S. market on which several big initial public offerings (IPOs) have been discounted or delayed this year.FCA, which sold shares in Maranello-based Ferrari at $52 each, could raise up to $982 million if a ""greenshoe"" option is exercised, giving the sportscar business a stock market value of $9.8 billion.Ferrari Chief Executive Amedeo Felisa and Chairman Sergio Marchionne were at the New York Stock Exchange to ring the opening bell, along with the company founder's son Piero Ferrari and FCA Chairman John Elkann, whose Agnelli family will become Ferrari's top investor on the planned distribution of the rest of FCA's stake in Ferrari among its own shareholders next year.Marchionne, who is also FCA's chief executive, has sought to position Ferrari as a luxury goods business to win the high-flying trading multiples of companies such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) and Prada (HK:1913).But some analysts questioned whether the small-volume, capital-intensive carmaker will be able to sustain the high valuations beyond its racy market debut.Proceeds from the offering will help to fund FCA's turnaround plan, centered on revamping its Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Maserati brands in an attempt to boost sales to 7 million cars by 2018 and compete with premium segment rivals BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen-owned Audi (DE:VOWG_p).SHARE PRICE BOOSTThe pledge to distribute FCA's remaining 80 percent stake in Ferrari among FCA shareholders has helped to lift the group's shares by more than 80 percent over the past year and FCA will raise more than $4 billion from the offering and subsequent spin-off. The remaining 10 percent is held by Piero Ferrari, who will keep his stake.The focus, however, will eventually turn back to FCA's operational challenges, including high debt, ambitious sales goals and persistent weakness in its key Latin American market -- only partially offset by a recovering European car market, firmer margins and well-received new models.""We still believe that the current share price overstates the fair value of the company,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Sascha Gommel, who has a ""sell"" rating on FCA.""We expect a significant de-rating the moment the Ferrari spin-off happens.""Once Ferrari's separation is complete, analysts expect Marchionne to pick up his campaign to merge with a rival, with his preferred partner likely to be General Motors (N:GM) after previous calls for a tie-up fell on deaf ears.""Upside in FCA in recent years has come more from M&A than from operational management, but the story is not finished yet,"" one Milan-based fund manager said. ""Marchionne has a plan, be it pursuing GM or possible asset sales.""Speaking to broadcaster CNBC on Wednesday, Marchionne said there was a great chance that car industry consolidation would happen over the next two years to deal with prohibitive costs of building cleaner and more intelligent vehicles.He did not identify any potential merger partners but said that FCA would try to be part of any such consolidation.Milan-listed shares in FCA fell more than 5 percent after Ferrari opened on Wall Street, with some traders saying the market may already be factoring in a discount ahead of the spin-off.($1 = 0.8794 euros)"
71,"Oct 12, 2015 11:20AM ET",Ferrari needs more than racy market debut to stay ahead,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari is being launched as a luxury stock for its Wall Street debut but may struggle to justify such a valuation in the long run given its profit margins and the investment needed to put its prancing horse logo on other products. Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is offering a 10 percent stake in Ferrari at $48-$52 a share, a price that would give the maker of famous sports cars such as the Testarossa a market capitalization of up to $9.8 billion. Including net debt of 2 billion euros inherited as part of its separation from parent FCA, Ferrari's enterprise value could rise to 10.6 billion euros ($12.1 billion) - a valuation that helped push FCA shares as much as 2 percent higher on Monday.Analysts say the small number of shares on sale, Ferrari's strong brand and the exclusivity of a company that for years has capped car sales at about 7,000 a year will support the initial public offering (IPO). The valuation will also satisfy Ferrari Chairman Sergio Marchionne who has said the company is worth at least 10 billion euros and that it should be viewed as a ""true luxury"" stock.But once the IPO hype fades, analysts worry that for all its Formula One racing pedigree and exclusivity, exemplified by the LaFerrari supercar's 1 million euro price tag, Ferrari may have its work cut out to justify a value on a par with luxury goods makers such as Prada (HK:1913) and Hermes (PA:HRMS), which trade at multiples more than double the average for carmakers. At the middle of the IPO range, Ferrari's enterprise value would be 3.8 times estimated 2015 sales and 14 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), according to Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at Evercore ISI.That compares with enterprise value over EBITDA for the coming year of 18.3 times for Hermes and 3.5 times for BMW (DE:BMWG), according to Thomson Reuters data.""Whilst we agree Ferrari has the potential to grow sales from about 7,000 units to about 10,000 relatively easily in the next few years, longer-term we question whether it really has better unit growth potential than a company like BMW,"" said Ellinghorst. ""Investors should seriously question whether (Ferrari) should trade on 4 times the multiple of BMW.""TECHNOLOGY COSTSFerrari's profits have nearly trebled over the past decade and its 14 percent operating margin - operating profit as a percentage of sales - is unmatched by any carmaker bar high-end sports car rival Porsche (DE:VOWG_p).But those margins are also still well below Prada's 26 percent and have been pressured by rising costs. Ferrari's revenue growth has been slower than most European luxury goods companies and the money it invests to develop new models and engines is more than double, depressing its return on capital.""This is a low-growth, low-free cash flow, modest return business with massive technology costs and complex regulatory challenges,"" Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note to clients.A self-imposed cap on sales makes for a healthy customer waiting list of more than a year but keeps average annual sales growth far below other carmakers. Ferrari said it would seek to increase shipments to 9,000 cars in 2019 from 7,255 last year. It also plans to expand into sportswear, watches, accessories and electronics and to open a second theme park next year.But without the backing of a parent, Ferrari's need to meet emissions targets may be costly and could hurt its growth ambitions. Expansion may also be hampered by the slowdown in Asia, already hitting sales of engines to sister-brand Maserati.FCA owns 90 percent of Ferrari, with the remainder held by Piero Ferrari, vice chairman and son of the founder Enzo. FCA will use proceeds from the stock sale for its own ambitious turnaround plan.It aims to spin off Ferrari next year and hand out the rest of its stake to its own shareholders, which would increase the free float in shares to more than 60 percent.($1 = 0.8785 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Sep 09, 2015 02:02PM ET",Bigger iPad announced at Apple 'monster' event,nan,"By Julia LoveSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) announced a bigger iPad with a new keyboard and stylus aimed at business customers.Chief Executive Tim Cook promised a day of ""monster"" news on Wednesday, but shares of the company remained nearly flat as executives showed off the iPad, which will be priced starting at $799.Cook began by talking up the Apple Watch, saying customer satisfaction for the new product was 97 percent. Apple is working with French luxury goods maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) on a new watch collection, and Facebook (O:FB) Messenger is coming to the device, he added.He then rolled out the ""iPad Pro"" with a 12.9 inch screen and said it had performance similar to a desktop computer. Apple showed off a ""smart"" keyboard and a stylus called ""Pencil"". Apple said it had partnered with Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) and  IBM  (N:IBM) to help power the iPad pro, which it said is up to 1.8 times faster and has a 10-hour battery life. Many people on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) seemed unimpressed by the new iPad and lamented its large size, however. Shares of Apple were up less than 1 percent at $112.68.Cook promised ""monster announcements"" at the event, which is also expected to feature an updated version of its Apple TV device and of its iPhones, which drove nearly two-thirds of the company's $49.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter.Apple is widely expected to keep the size of the phones the same but upgrade it with an improved camera and Force Touch, a display technology that responds differently depending on how hard users press their screens.A year after Apple rolled out iPhones with larger screens, touching off a frenzy of sales that saw revenue in the most recent quarter increase 32.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago, the latest upgrades may leave some investors and consumers underwhelmed. ""It's getting harder and harder for Apple to compete against itself,"" said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple shares are up more than 14 percent over the last year, although they are down nearly 12 percent in the last three months.Fortunately for Apple, most consumers buy smartphones under a two-year upgrade cycle, meaning the company will still likely scoop up a lot of sales, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. ""The key point of reference is not how the new phone compares to the iPhone 6, it's how it compares to the iPhone 5s,"" he said. Expectations have been rising for an revamped Apple TV, a set-top box that has seen few significant updates since its release in 2007. Although Apple has yet to hammer out deals for a long-awaited television service, analysts say the company is poised to overhaul the hockey-puck-sized device.The device is expected to gain an App Store and an interface that allows users to make requests through the Siri digital assistant and search for specific programs and movies across apps. The company may also discuss the device's role as a hub for gaming.""It's a big day for the big screen!"" Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue tweeted before the event.Nearly 20 percent of U.S. broadband households own at least one streaming media player, and Apple has a long way to go in the market, according to data from research firm Parks Associates.Roku is the leader in streaming media boxes, accounting for 34 percent of all streaming devices sold in the United States in 2014, according to data from research firm Parks Associates. Google Inc's (O:GOOGL) Chromecast and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Fire TV were next. The Apple TV box came in fourth.""It's important that (Apple) come out and really get up to date and potentially eclipse some of the other living room devices out there,"" Moorhead said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.

82,"Feb 12, 2015 03:29AM ET",European stocks steady to lower as Greece worries persist; Dax up 0.04%,nan,"Investing.com - European stocks were steady to lower on Thursday, after Wednesday's emergency meeting on the Greek debt crisis ended without an agreement on extending the country’s bailout.During European morning trade, the EURO STOXX 50 slipped 0.17%, France’s CAC 40 fell 0.20%, while Germany’s DAX 30 eased up 0.04%.On Wednesday, talks between Greece and European Union officials ended without an agreement, though both sides said there was still hope for a deal. Further talks are due to be held next Monday.Greece’s current bailout is due to expire on February 28 and the new Greek government does not want it extended, fuelling fears over a conflict with its creditors which could trigger the country’s exit from the euro zone.Athens has proposed new economic reforms to replace 30% of its massive bailout deal, replacing them with a 10 point plan of economic reforms.However, Greece’s creditors in the EU are insisting that the country must stick to the terms of the original bailout agreement.Financial stocks were mixed, as BNP Paribas added 0.17% and Societe Generale tumbled 1.17% in France, while Deutsche Bank rose 0.21% and Commerzbank lost 1.25% in Germany.Earlier Thursday, Societe Generale posted quarterly profit below analysts' projections.Among peripheral lenders, Unicredit dropped 0.99% and Intesa Sanpaolo gained 0.73% in Italy, while BBVA dipped 0.04% and Banco Santander added 0.25% in Spain.Elsewhere, Renault (PARIS:RENA) surged 7.18% after the carmaker reported a 30% climb in 2014 earnings, exceeding analysts' estimates.On the downside, Hermes International (PARIS:HRMS) plummeted 1.41% after the French luxury goods maker forecast slowing revenue growth in 2015, as the weakness of the euro weighed on profitability last year.In London, commodity-heavy FTSE 100 inched up 0.01%, supported by gains in the mining sector.Shares in Glencore Xstrata rose 0.38% and Bhp Billiton advanced 0.79%, while Anglo American jumped 1.36%.Rio Tinto led gains on the index, with shares surging 2.18%, after the mining giant reported better-than-expected annual profit and announced plans to spend $2 billion buying back shares.In the financial sector, stocks were also broadly higher as Barclays and Lloyds Banking gained 0.30% and 0.48% respectively, while the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC Holdings climbed 0.72% and 0.80%.In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a steady to lower open.

83,"Feb 11, 2015 09:10AM ET",Prada needs to focus less on new shops and more on new handbags,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Valentina ZaPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - If in fashion, being late on a trend can be lethal, playing catch-up in terms of business strategy can be just as damaging.Prada is learning that lesson the hard way. The trend in luxury goods is to drum up same store sales by curbing expansion and wowing customers with new products, yet Prada continues to pay over the odds to open swanky new shops and stock them with handbags little changed from previous bestsellers.Prada, say analysts, now urgently needs to focus less on new stores and more on new handbags.The group, which also owns the Miu Miu and Church's brands, opened 250 stores in the past three years, far more than rivals. It has finally slowed the pace but still plans 30-35 more stores this year, which it says is part of its long-term strategy.""Prada is starting to focus on same-store sales growth three years later than some of their peers as their priorities were elsewhere, but it is clearly better to do it later rather than never,"" Erwan Rambourg, luxury goods analyst at HSBC and author of The Bling Dynasty, a book focusing on Chinese shoppers.Analysts estimate same-store sales, which Prada stopped reporting last year, fell year-on-year by 12 percent in the third quarter to Oct. 31 and may have dropped by as much as 9 percent in the quarter to Jan. 31.Prada's costly retail space, combined with slower growth, has hammered margins and valuation. The group's share price nearly halved in the past two years and most analysts still have sell or hold recommendations on the stock.Its operating margin fell to 15.4 percent in the third quarter from 21.3 percent in the first half. Some analysts expect small margin growth this year, mainly thanks to the strong dollar that will boost reported earnings in euros.Prada is not alone facing difficulty at a tricky time for luxury goods makers, challenged by cheaper ""accessible luxury"" brands like Michael Kors (N:KORS) and Longchamp.Other brands seen as having rested on their laurels in terms of strikingly new products, like Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci and Tod's (MI:TOD), have also struggled to produce growth.But the strategy of concentrating on same store sales has nevertheless produced success for some luxury brands. Arch-rival Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) revealed last week that it had enjoyed a strong rebound by investing heavily in exciting new products under new designer Nicolas Ghesquiere. It also halted the opening of new stores.PLAYING CATCH-UPWhen it floated in 2011, Prada's ambition was to catch up with bigger rivals by expanding. It spared no expense, splurging on ""key money"" - cash up front to secure the best locations.In Milan, Prada outbid Apple and Gucci to build a menswear shop opposite its historic boutique in the prestigious late 19th Century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade, paying more than 20 million euros to get the spot, real estate sources said. Prada declined to comment.In the plush ski resort of Courchevel, it financed the renovation of the entire Place du Rocher to make it a more fitting address for its new boutique.Meanwhile, some customers say the new shops carry handbags that have not evolved much in recent years, as if the company were afraid to change a product that worked well for so long.""Just arrived"" Prada handbags these days include two-toned satchels and new versions of the Twin Bag launched last year, fitted with a top flap and double zips. The product is similar in shape and carries many of the same features as previous best-sellers, such as the Double Bag or Galleria.Some bags start at 1,450 euros. In crocodile, they can reach 18,500 euros.""Unless you have strong feelings about sewn-on handles versus buckles, there's not much in the way of meaningful variety or novelty,"" wrote Amanda Mull on the widely-followed PurseBlog.Customers have become savvier and more demanding. Partly thanks to the Internet, they know more about a brand's new products than in the past, and will readily abandon brands that seem to trail in innovation.""They've lost their touch,"" said Sara, on a visit from Kuwait, pointing at handbags in a Prada shop window in Milan as she left the store empty-handed. ""They are not keeping up with changing trends as well as other brands like Fendi or Dior.""HSBC analysts upgraded their rating to overweight last month on the hope that its ""issues of innovation in handbags and accessories"" will eventually be solved.They forecast new product launches will help like-for-like sales grow by a modest 1 percent this year.Prada says it continues to work on improving its flow of new products and constantly recruits young designers. It has also pledged to improve its customer service and product mix in stores.But at Prada's Paris flagship, no boots were on display in spite of cold weather. Clerks said this was normal as they were selling spring/summer products. But at Gucci and Louis Vuitton, which were also selling summer collections, there were some boots on display too. Gucci even had fur-lined models on the shelves.Manfredi Ricca, an expert at consultancy Interbrand, said the focus now is not on building more stores but on maximising revenue from existing shops.""Having many retail outlets is less important than being able to offer the experience that clients look for in a brick-and-mortar shop,"" Ricca said."

86,"Jan 28, 2015 05:50AM ET",Apple takes high road in China smartphone standoff with Xiaomi,nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is steering clear of Chinese rival Xiaomi Inc's (XTC.UL) low-price online strategy, ramping up store openings in China to harness its premium edge and fend off the fast-growing No.3 global smartphone maker.The U.S. firm's quarterly results smashed Wall Street expectations with record iPhone sales in the holiday season and a 70 percent rise in China, powering the company to the largest profit in corporate history. Its result in China, as well as other emerging markets such as Brazil, marks a riposte to critics who questioned the firm's strategy a year ago not to launch a cheaper phone to lure cost-conscious buyers from Xiaomi and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930).""In the long run Xiaomi is more of a threat to Apple than say Samsung,"" said Ben Thompson, analyst at Stratechery.com. ""But the way Apple fights that is to further differentiate, not by trying to compete on Xiaomi's turf, which is low cost.""Instead, Apple plans to roll out around 20 new China stores by 2016, likely located in glitzy locations and rubbing shoulders with outlets for luxury brands such as Chanel and Hermes International SCA (PA:HRMS).For Apple, brick-and-mortar stores help it maintain a premium image, from the product to in-store service and even packaging, allowing the firm to charge far higher prices than rivals - vital to its enviable profit margins.""If you could only get an Apple product online, then there wouldn't be the same user experience and so people might not be so willing to buy. After all, it's an expensive product,"" said Shi Xinchao, 24, a civil servant in Jiangsu province.WHAT'S NEXT?Apple's quarterly leap may be hard to replicate, with the launch of large-screen iPhones and a tie-up with telecoms operator China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941) in late 2013 lifting last year's numbers.""People had been waiting for large-screen iPhones for a long time. The demand had piled up and Apple hadn't been able to meet it,"" said Nicole Peng, research director for Canalys in China.Canalys data showed Apple outsold all other smartphone makers in China by units shipped in October-December 2014, making it the country's top seller for the first time.However, some were already asking what Apple's next driver of growth in China would be and how the firm would fend off Xiaomi's longer-term challenge.Xiaomi unveiled the Mi Note earlier this month, its challenger to Apple's iPhone 6 Plus. At 2299 yuan ($371) for a model with 16 gigabytes of memory, the Mi Note costs almost two-thirds less than its Apple rival.The Chinese firm, which sold its first phone just over three years ago, has also been moving into other personal and home devices that would be compatible with Xiaomi phones, helping it retain users.""This could lock in Xiaomi's younger generation, low-income users from migrating to other brands like Apple,"" said Gartner analyst C.K. Lu.""The large screen has given Apple a big core, but what's after the large screen? That's what we need to address.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

88,"Nov 17, 2014 10:48AM ET","Gucci needs new ideas, talents to combat brand fatigue",nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci holds the luxury spending downturn mainly responsible for its poor performance but the Italian fashion brand may also have itself to blame, suggesting it could be time to change strategy and hire fresh talent. Every major luxury goods maker has been hit by the worst spending slump in five years as concerns about economic growth and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine hampered demand from the Chinese, Russians and Europeans. Big brands have also been suffering from consumers' growing appetite for smaller, less widely distributed labels, particularly in key markets such as China, which was the luxury goods industry's main growth engine until 2012. ""I think for some brands there is a saturation and a brand fatigue issue in certain markets like Asia,"" said Scilla Huang Sun who runs the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund. Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton, part of industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), have all worked hard in the past three to five years to rebuild the aura of exclusivity they lost by going too mass market and milking the label too hard in the mid to late 2000s. The volume-based strategy made shareholders rich but also diluted the brand. Based on sales performance, some big fashion labels, such as Louis Vuitton or Hermes, appear to have done a better job than Gucci at rebuilding or supporting that exclusive image. Gucci's sales have been steadily declining over the past year while Louis Vuitton's revenues are still growing, albeit in low single digits, and Hermes -- which always kept volumes under control -- together with Burberry, are still enjoying sales growth of more than 10 percent. Prada could be the next victim of brand fatigue, having warned that it expected no sales growth this year. Prada was one of the brands that opened the most shops last year, leading analysts to wonder if it was not starting to be over-exposed. Analysts and investors say Gucci got rid of too many accessible items and on average, raised prices too much. They also mention lack of innovation, which affects brand desirability and ultimately investor sentiment and growth prospects. A spokeswoman for Gucci's parent Kering (PA:PRTP), which also owns Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, maintained it was ""satisfied with Gucci's upscale strategy that is underway,"" making reference to its third-quarter sales presentation. PAST ICONS Gucci says it is pleased with how new products have been received. These include a $4,500 python backpack with bamboo handles, a central fixture of Gucci bags for decades. ""You cannot just keep reviving past icons, you also need to have breakthrough innovation,"" Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst Luca Solca said citing designer Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent as a successful example. At Hermes, the most expensive European luxury stock -- trading at 27 times forward earnings while Kering is on 15 times and Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) on 18 times -- there is a ban on re-launching old classics. New designs and the rarity of its Kelly and Birkin bags have helped the brand retain its cachet. At Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld helps the brand preserve its edge by putting out six collections a year, which produce at least one best-selling item. Last season, it was a pair of $1,100 iridescent tweed sneakers that sold out. Nicolas Ghesquiere, the star designer hired by LVMH last year, recently created a new ""V"" logo for Louis Vuitton and an exclusive line of handbags costing more than 20,000 euros. Louis Vuitton also gained momentum last month with the opening of its art museum outside Paris designed by Frank Gehry and a limited bag collection created by celebrities such as shoe maker Christian Louboutin to mark its 160th anniversary. Louis Vuitton has benefited from new ideas and leadership, while Gucci has been run by chief executive Patrizio di Marco since 2009 and for most of the past decade by designer Frida Giannini, who is also now his partner and mother of his child. Some fashion critics say Gucci has been struggling to regain the sparkle and fashion authority it had when chief executive Domenico de Sole and designer Tom Ford ran it until 2004. ""They lost something special when Tom left,"" said Tamara Mellon, the woman who built Jimmy Choo into a global luxury shoe brand and is now developing her own fashion brand. Gucci customers may also have been driven away by sharp price rises - more than 40 percent in the past four to five years - sending them to more accessible luxury brands such as Michael Kors in the United States and Longchamp in France. Louis Vuitton also raised prices but more progressively and conducted a less radical shake-up of its product offering. Gucci has provided extensive details on the results of its upmarket strategy while Louis Vuitton has not. Rivals such as Mulberry and Lancel, part of Cartier owner Richemont, also saw sales plummet after raising prices too much. Gucci has also had to clean up its wholesale distribution network, affecting revenue, after department stores offered too many discounts, devaluing the brand. Louis Vuitton never does sales and has no wholesale account.  (Additional reporting by Pascale Denis in Paris; Editing by Anna Willard) "

93,"Jul 07, 2014 02:10AM ET",What's in a scent? Perfume makers adapt to EU rules,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Seaweed may not be the first ingredient that springs to mind for perfume. But algae are among obscure ingredients to which perfume makers are turning to preserve the scent of their fragrances in the face of new EU anti-allergy restrictions. The global high end perfume industry, generating $25 billion in annual sales, is readying itself for EU regulations that will come into force in early 2015.  These will ban widely-used ingredients such as oak moss, a natural substance, that was found in the original versions of best-sellers including Chanel's No.5 and Miss Dior.  Perfume creators say they love oak moss for its woody, earthy notes which give it depth and help make scent last longer. But on the grounds that between one and three percent of the EU population could suffer an allergic reaction - such as dermatitis - Brussels is banning two of its core molecules, atranol and chloroatranol. Perfume makers will only be allowed to use oak moss from which these two molecules have been removed. The makers say this results in a much lighter and less vigorous scent. ""I am crazy about oak moss, it is one of my favorite ingredients,"" says Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, perfume creator or ""nose"" at his niche Parfum d'Empire brand. A 100 ml bottle of scent costs 120 euros.  Corticchiato, like many other ""noses,"" is anxious about the new wave of potentially costly rules emanating from Brussels. The fragrance industry that supplies perfume makers like Corticchiato already has its own self regulation body - the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) - financed by providers such as Givaudan, New York-listed International Flavors & Fragrances, and Germany's Symrise. It has imposed restrictions on a growing list of ingredients over the years for various health reasons.  In addition, perfume makers do a lot of their own in-house and post-market surveillance and do their own testing, which can cost several hundred thousands euros a year, depending on the number of products and ingredients involved. Leading brands such as Chanel, Dior and Hermes have 'noses' and their own research laboratories. They do not publish figures for the costs associated with them but industry experts estimate them to be in the order of several million euros a year.  A TOUCH OF ALGAE One solution for oak moss, Corticchiato says, is to add a touch of algae as its wet, iodized smell coupled with other ingredients, can help recreate oak moss' moldy character.  The European Commission is also banning a synthetic molecule called HICC, or lyral, which replicates the smell of lily of the valley. It too can cause dermatitis in allergy sufferers. L'Oreal, which makes Lancome and Armani perfumes, said it was looking for alternatives. It declined to say which of its perfumes contained lyral.   Perfume makers say they understand that their products need to be safe and recognize how damaging to their reputation any serious allergic reaction would be. But some say the industry is being unfairly targeted. Up until now, they say, there have only been minor cases of allergies manifested by skin irritations or eczema. ""I think Brussels' focus is a little exaggerated specially compared to alcohol and cigarettes which are sold freely and do more harm than perfume,"" says Patricia de Nicolaï who created the French Nicolaï perfume brand with her husband 25 years ago.  She says she has never received a complaint about allergy but has reformulated some of her best sellers such as New York and Eau d'Ete because they used oak moss and lyral respectively. The European Union denies targeting perfume any more than any other industry and says its new regulation seeks to address scientists' and doctors' concerns about the health hazards related to the use of perfume.   NORTH-SOUTH PERFUME LINES Some inside the perfume industry say lobby groups representing the interests of tobacco firms are better financed and better organized than those representing perfume makers. One reason is the sheer size of the global cigarette industry. In sales terms, it is more than three times the size of the perfume industry. Cigarette lobby groups include the tobacco manufacturers' association and the tobacco retailer's alliance. By comparison, perfume makers rely on Cosmetics Europe, a bulky organization that represents 4,000 companies including deodorant, toothpaste and perfume providers which have very disparate interests. Even within the perfume industry, there is no united front as some brands are more affected than others by IFRA and new EU regulation. One of the industry's biggest players, L'Oreal, says it uses mainly synthetic ingredients in its perfumes. These ingredients raise fewer allergy concerns than natural products found in niche perfumes and brands such as Chanel and LVMH's Dior and Guerlain. Another issue is that perfumes are not protected by intellectual property rights. The composition of a perfume is not legally recognized as a ""creation of the mind"" but rather an industrial formula that can be replicated and altered. ""Many perfumes have had to be reformulated even though they were considered masterpieces due to changing legislation,"" said Olivier Maure, head of Accords et Parfums, a supplier of major brands including Dior based in Grasse, likening it to ""changing the colors of the Mona Lisa"". Some industry executives say Brussels' recent focus on the perfume industry stems from its main advisory body, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). Many of the committee's members come from northern countries such as Sweden and Denmark where there is opposition to perfume on health grounds.  ""Clearly, there are more experts at the SCCS who are based in northern Europe than in the south but it is not a deliberate choice,"" said David Hudson, spokesman for consumer policy at the European Commission. ""We strive for geographic and gender balance but the primary selection criteria is expertise."" Perfume is not as important to the economies of northern Europe as it is to southern countries. Perfumes and cosmetics are among France's top five exports and the southern city of Grasse is the historic capital of the perfume industry where many leading brands such as Chanel, Hermes and Dior source their essences.  Added to that, research shows people from northern regions tend to be more vulnerable to allergies than those living around the Mediterranean. One theory is that people in northern countries are more susceptible because of their lifestyle and generally cleaner environment.  MORE RESTRICTIONS TO FOLLOW? The SCCS published a report in July 2012 which recommended banning oak moss's core molecules and severely restricting the use of many core ingredients such as linalool, found in lavender, a move that threatened the high end of the perfume industry which relied heavily on these ingredients. Brussels included a few of the SCCS's recommendations, such as its ban on oak moss, and pledged to investigate what levels of concentrations could be considered safe for natural ingredients so that consumers did not develop allergies to them over time.  Perfume makers are worried that this will lead to more restrictions. There have been suggestions that they should offer two types of perfumes - some with allergens in them and consumer advice about the content, and others with no allergen. ""I expected big groups to take the initiative on this matter but it turns out that they are the most risk averse,"" said Corticchiato. One problem for big perfume brands is that their label sells a dream which is incompatible with the message ""this product may cause allergies."" Dior, Guerlain and parent LVMH declined to comment for this article as did Hermes. Chanel said it stopped using lyral in 2010 and has been evolving its formulas in anticipation of new rules. ""At Chanel, we follow very closely talks about regulation and scientific findings concerning raw materials,"" Jacques Polge, Chanel's chief perfume creator for 36 years, said in an emailed response to questions. Polge said Chanel controls its formulas and supply chains to ensure its natural oak moss is bereft of the allergens targeted by Brussels. That way, ""we can respect the original scent"". But ""once you change an ingredient or two it can be very difficult to keep the scent absolutely intact, especially if those ingredients played an important role in defining the scent,"" says Maurice Roucel, creator of many perfumes including L'Instant for Guerlain and Hermes's 24 Faubourg.  A few years ago, Roucel reformulated Dior's Fahrenheit perfume to remove lyral along with a few other ingredients and he is now working on the reformulation of about eight perfumes to make them meet new regulation.  ""Big brands tell me: replace this and that and make sure it smells the same and costs the same to produce,"" Roucel said.    (Editing by Janet McBride) "

 (Adds details, quote, shares) MILAN, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Italian luxury shoe and bag maker
Tod's turned in a 3.1 percent rise in first-half net profit on
higher revenues and said on Wednesday the second half of the
year could give ""good results"". Tod's, famed for its soft loafers and bags, said in a
statement net profit was 41.9 million euros ($60 million). Revenues rose 3.4 percent to 359 million euros, boosted by
demand for its shoes. The company had published first-half sales
figures in July. ""In the light of the signals in our shops in the last few
weeks, I believe the second half of the year could also give us
good results,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Diego Della Valle
said. Shares rose 3.57 percent to 42.88 euros at 1105 GMT. French fashion-to-handbags group Hermes International posts
results on Friday. It has weathered the downturn better than
many of its peers partly due to the strength of its brand, seen
by consumers as a safer investment then younger, more fickle
luxury names.
