The plan is to expand wholesale deliveries to other regions in Brazil in coming years, according to Rivero.GPA shares have risen almost 8% so far in 2019, well behind rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA, which has gained more than 24%."

There will be difficulties and consolidations in coming years,"" Bompard said.""My mission is to be in the winners' camp and the transformation we are conducting will put us among winners,""Last year, Carrefour and French rival Casino were locked in a dispute after Casino said it had rejected a tie-up approach from Carrefour that Carrefour denied making.Since then, Casino's parent Rallye has filed for protection from creditors.Meanwhile, French rival Auchan has sold most of its loss-making business in Italy, while it also faces tough market conditions in France.Last month, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Carrefour was exploring the sale of a minority stake in its loss-making business in China and had started sounding out potential buyers.The group has, however, said a sale of the business in China was not on the agenda.In line with Carrefour's ambition to become a leader in the global transition towards healthier and more sustainable food, its shareholders on Friday approved a new mission statement to include its commitment to the transition in its bylaws.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

4,"Jun 05, 2019 04:40PM ET",New Tech Unicorn Aims for Next-Day Delivery Anywhere in Brazil,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Latin America’s newest tech unicorn has an ambitious goal: next-day delivery to nearly anyone in Brazil. That’s no easy feat in the world’s fifth-biggest country -- where infrastructure networks lag far behind those of most developed nations.Loggi is now valued at $1 billion, after raising $100 million this month in a funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund, the company said Wednesday. SoftBank’s Latin America Fund is considering joining the round with an additional $50 million investment, according to the company. The cash infusion comes on the heels of a $100 million investment the Vision Fund made in the company last year.The startup, which launched in 2014 delivering documents on the chaotic streets of Sao Paulo, is using the investment to build a team of more than 1,000 engineers as it constructs a Brazil-wide logistics service. The company currently covers about 35% of the population, and makes about 100,000 deliveries a day for clients including French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA, e-commerce giant MercadoLibre Inc. and fast-food restaurants McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. and Burger King. Chief Executive Officer Fabien Mendez said the company aims to increase its coverage to 95% of the country by the end of next year and boost its delivery frequency to about 5 million a day within five years.“Our philosophy is that we deliver anything for anyone,” Mendez said in an interview. “By the end of 2020, we want to connect all Brazilian cities. The idea is to offer next-day delivery to all Brazilians.”Loggi will have to overcome obstacles that have made Brazil a notoriously difficult country for shippers, including poor infrastructure, crime, thick bureaucracy and sheer size. Brazil is bigger than the continental U.S. but its transportation infrastructure ranks near that of Rwanda, according to the World Economic Forum.“When you operate in logistics in Brazil, it’s a death by a thousand cuts,” Mendez said. “The only way to leapfrog the structural barriers is through the use of technology.”The company is opening a network of distribution centers across the country, including small warehouses in neighborhoods. It says it relies heavily on robotics, artificial intelligence and algorithms to find the most efficient route to air ship packages to those centers. The system alerts a nearby freelance courier -- around 25,000 of them deliver packages for Loggi -- to make the final drop off. The goal is to have minimal labor involved in the process, with only one set of human hands touching the package during each step of the delivery process, Mendez said.The company is betting the country of 209 million people will rapidly adopt e-commerce. Sales in the sector are expected to rise 15% this year to about $15.5 billion, after rising 12% last year, according to Ebit|Nielsen, a research firm.That growth has attracted other startups, including the  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).-backed CargoX. Last-mile delivery companies, including Colombia’s Rappi and homegrown iFood, are also expanding in the country.But instead of competing with other existing players, Mendez said Loggi is working with them, providing delivery services for both Rappi and iFood, as well as retailers including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). “Loggi is emerging as a key enabler for Brazil’s burgeoning gig-economy and e-commerce sector,” said Akshay Naheta, a managing partner at SoftBank.GGV Capital,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Fifth Wall Ventures and Velt Partners joined the Vision Fund in the latest Loggi round. SoftBank’s Latin America Fund launched a $5 billion tech fund for the region this year. Already this year, SoftBank agreed to invest $1 billion in Rappi, and is said to be in talks with Brazilian lender Creditas.Venture capital funding in Latin America has roughly doubled for each of the past two years and is on track to surpass the 2018 record of $2 billion. More than half of that funding last year went to Brazilian companies, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America.As Brazil’s growing population of smartphone users place more orders online, automating logistics for food and package deliveries will be essential for the economy’s growth, Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV, wrote in an email. “We are seeing this as a global trend from the U.S. and China to Latin America, Southeast Asia and India,” Tung wrote.If it’s able to establish its service across Brazil, Loggi will look to expand into other Latin American markets, Mendez said.The 33-year-old, who was raised in a small village in the south of France and moved to Brazil in 2010, said he plans to grow the company’s employee headcount to 1,500 people, from the current payroll of 600. The company charges sellers a delivery fee based on the weight and destination of the package, plus an insurance charge. As a private company, it doesn’t release sales figures, but Mendez said Loggi expects to turn a profit next year, and was profitable in 2017.Mendez said the startup had no immediate plans to have an initial public offering or to be acquired. But “the plan is to get the company to be IPO-able,” he said. “We want to show exponential growth, but also the Ebitda to make ourselves attractive to the market.”(Updates with details of $50 million in additional funding in second paragraph, and total investment in first deck headline)"

6,"Jun 03, 2019 01:10PM ET",Carrefour says blockchain tracking boosting sales of some products,nan,"By Emma ThomassonBERLIN (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA has seen sales boosted by the use of blockchain ledger technology to track meat, milk and fruit from farms to stores and will extend it to more products to increase shopper trust, an executive said on Monday.Blockchain's digital tracking technology allows customers to see detailed information on products like when it was harvested or packed - reassuring them on the quality of items they buy and allowing them to avoid products with genetically modified organisms, antibiotics or pesticides if they want. Carrefour has launched blockchain information for 20 items including chicken, eggs, raw milk, oranges, pork and cheese, and will add 100 more this year with a focus on areas where consumers want reassurance, like baby and organic products.""You are building a halo effect - 'If I can trust Carrefour with this chicken, I can also trust Carrefour for their apples or cheese,'"" Emmanuel Delerm, Carrefour's blockchain project manager, told Reuters at a conference.Carrefour is among several leading companies tapping into the growing use of blockchain to track where products come from, as consumers increasingly look to ensure that products meet standards on ethics and general safety.Carrefour has worked on the blockchain system together with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), which is collaborating with a number of retailers, logistics firms and growers on systems to track and secure their global supply chains.Blockchain, best known as the technology underlying cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of data kept by a network of individual computers rather than a single party.Customers can scan a QR barcode on a pomelo grapefruit with their phone and find out the date of harvest, location of cultivation, the owner of the plot, when it was packed, how long it took to transport to Europe and tips on how to prepare it.""The pomelo sold faster than the year before due to blockchain,"" Delerm said. ""We had a positive impact on the chicken versus the non-blockchain chicken.""The initiative has proved most popular so far in China - where it is already common for shoppers to scan QR codes, followed by Italy and France, with some people spending as long as 90 seconds reading the provenance information.They are interested in information about the origin of products and how animals are cared for, with one video of a farmer with his chickens proving popular, he said.""Millennials are buying less but buying better products for their health, for the planet,"" Delerm said.There are still challenges to overcome, such tracking fruit and vegetables sold loose that come from different farms, and resistance from farmers to sharing too much information, he added.Carrefour wants to add non-food lines in future like clothing, as well as more information, such as how much the farmer gets out of the shelf price. It is also experimenting with ways to identify products that do not rely on a QR code.While Carrefour is focusing the project on its own brands, it has also worked with Nestle on giving consumers access to blockchain data for its Mousline potato puree, allowing them to see it is only made from French potatoes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

8,"May 14, 2019 12:15PM ET",Carrefour and TerraCycle launch 'Loop' test in Paris to tackle waste,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and U.S. waste recycling company TerraCycle launched on Tuesday the test for their 'Loop' initiative which they hope will tackle the problems of plastic waste threatening to destroy the environment.The 'Loop' online platform will allow shoppers in the Paris area to buy orange juice, powder detergent or shampoo in reusable containers that do not result in waste.The initiative was first announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, with over 25 big-name consumer goods and retail partners on board.Users put down a refundable deposit via the Loop website when ordering products, which are delivered in reusable glass and metal bottles, and shipped in a tote bag to shoppers' doors. Loop then retrieves the empty products for cleaning and reuse.Plastic production has surged over the last 50 years, leading to the widespread use of disposable bottles, cups and containers, but this has also resulted in millions of tonnes of plastic waste ending up in landfills and oceans.Government bans on products such as single-use plastic water bottles, shopping bags and polystyrene cups have sent retailers and consumer goods companies looking for alternatives.Carrefour, which is Europe's largest retailer, aims to reach a 100% rate for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging for its own brands by 2025.Carrefour is Loop's founding retail partner for France.It will be offering around 200 products - including around 30 of its own private label and organic products such as honey, oil or spices - during the initial trial in the Paris area.These products will come alongside those of international brands that have already joined Loop such as Danone's Evian mineral water, Pepsico's Tropicana juice, Quaker Cruesli cereal or Unilever's 'Signal' toothpaste.NEW YORK TO FOLLOWCarrefour General Secretary Laurent Vallee said Loop would tie in with a broader strategy overhaul at Carrefour to focus more on areas such as fresh local produce and organic food, under a global five-year plan to boost sales and profits.""We hope other international manufacturers and retailers will join us to adopt new standards and scale up this concept in order to fight waste,"" said Vallee.The Loop trial launches first in Paris and then New York on May 21. A London launch via supermarket group  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) is slated for later in 2019, with Toronto, Tokyo and California to follow next year.The products available on www.maboutiqueloop.fr http://www.maboutiqueloop.fr will cost roughly the same as those in single-use containers but shoppers will have to pay a deposit, which for instance amounts to 25 euro cents for a 4.50 euros 75 cl bottle of Carrefour organic sunflower oil.From October onwards Carrefour will also integrate Loop in its own e-commerce website www.Carrefour.fr/clvc, in a bid to boost traffic on its site and build up customer loyalty.Partners in the Loop trial, many of which are re-designing their traditional packages, will test how the system works in general, and above all whether consumers are prepared to put up a deposit and then re-order products this way. Customers can opt to have the product automatically replaced.Eventually, Carrefour could roll out the service in its stores.""We want to reach 5,000 users in the trial. The percentage of clients loyal to Loop will be key. We aim for over 50% of re-order,"" Bertrand Swiderski, Carrefour's sustainability director, told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

9,"May 10, 2019 01:35PM ET","Walmart Brasil to ditch e-commerce, focus on brick and mortar",nan,"By Gabriela MelloSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Brasil will close down its e-commerce operation in Latin America's biggest retail market to focus on brick and mortar locations, converting underperforming hypermarkets into wholesale stores. Wholesale has become increasingly popular in Brazil as the country slowly exits from a harsh recession. ""The company is working in a new omnichannel strategy which will be later announced"", Walmart Brasil said in a statement on Friday, without giving details. News of the decision was first reported by newspaper Valor Economico. The move is likely to open room to local and international retailers currently focused on exploring still incipient e-commerce in Brazil. Walmart's decision caps years of efforts that never really took off. It precedes the long-awaited launch of Amazon's fulfillment center, which will enable it to sell directly to consumers in Brazil. Part of Walmart's struggles, had to do with tough competition from local players in the e-commerce segment, including B2W, Via Varejo and Magazine Luiza SA.Walmart launched an e-commerce division in Brazil in 2011, selling directly to consumers. But by 2017, the retailer discontinued direct sales, focusing only on running as a marketplace for third-party sellers, which it had launched in 2015. Walmart never disclosed how much online sales contributed to its top line in Brazil. In mid-2018, buyout firm Advent International acquired an 80% stake in the Brazilian operation, unfolding a broad revamp. By then, the e-commerce division was already in decline. As part of the decision to exit e-commerce, the company laid off 70 of its 90 employees working for the marketplace platform, with the remaining 20 fully dedicated to manage ongoing orders.Walmart's decision could be a boom for its competitors. ""Walmart's (e-commerce) operation has been shrinking for a while now, but we are prepared to direct their consumer traffic to Carrefour"", Chief Executive Officer of  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) eBusiness Brasil, Paula Cardoso, told journalists on Friday in a call to discuss quarterly results.In a separate statement, Walmart Brasil said it plans to convert 10 underperforming hypermarkets into wholesale stores Maxxi Atacado by the end of 2020. The first one was opened on May 9 in the city of Diadema, near Sao Paulo. Another 10 hypermarkets will be converted into Sam's Club stores, the company said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Carrefour aims to sign an agreement with unions in mid-May and to carry out the plan in the second half of the year. In January 2018, the group launched a five-year plan a year ago to cut costs, boost E-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China with tech giant Tencent .The plan notably includes expanding into convenience stores to reduce exposure to large hypermarket stores and having a greater focus on organic products and private labels.Carrefour achieved savings of 1.05 billion euros ($1.18 billion) in 2018, the first year of the plan.($1 = 0.8933 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Apr 23, 2019 07:08AM ET",Amazon strengthens ties with French food retailer Casino,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and French retailer Casino are expanding their partnership, with Amazon installing pick-up lockers in Casino stores and making more of the French company's products available on Amazon.The move, which follows an initial co-operation between Casino's upmarket Monoprix supermarket chain and Amazon in Paris, could re-ignite speculation of a bigger deal later on.An Amazon spokeswoman said it had a policy of not commenting on market speculation. Amazon's purchase of bricks-and-mortar U.S. food retailer Whole Foods Market last year has raised speculation it could buy a European food retailer.The extended partnership comes as Casino is selling assets and cutting debt to try to allay investor concerns over its finances and those of parent company Rallye.The deal, unveiled on Tuesday, will see Amazon lockers installed in 1,000 locations across France in nine of Casino's brands, including Monoprix, Monop, Geant, Hyper Casino, Casino Supermarche, Leaderprice, Viva and Spar by the end of the year. The lockers store Amazon products to be picked up by customers.Tina Schuler, CEO of LeaderPrice, Casino Supermarches, Geant Casino and Casino Proximites, told a conference call that the deal - whose financial terms were not disclosed - will help Casino ""boost traffic and revenues in e-commerce and in stores"".For Amazon, a key attraction was ""Casino's dense store network, which it views as a real strength,"" she added.Some 3,500 Casino-branded products will also be available on Amazon, while Amazon and Monoprix will extend their partnership on Amazon's Prime Now grocery delivery service outside Paris and into new cities in the next twelve months.""This co-operation should help Casino further strengthen its e-commerce footprint as part of its goal to generate revenue of 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) from the sale of groceries online,"" said Gregoire Laverne, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.CASINO SHARES DIPNevertheless, Casino's shares fell 0.9 percent by 1113 GMT, after Standard & Poor's cut its credit rating on Casino to 'BB- negative outlook', pushing it further into junk territory. Investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also kept an ""underweight"" rating on Casino's shares.Monoprix, seen by analysts as similar to Whole Foods, started filling orders for subscribers to Amazon's Prime loyalty program in parts of Paris last September.This partnership has been closely watched as Monoprix was the first French retailer to agree in March 2018 to sell products via Amazon, causing a stir in the fiercely competitive domestic market.France is Amazon's third largest market in Europe, after Britain and Germany. Amazon is the e-commerce leader in France with a market share of 17.3 percent, but its grocery market share stands at just 2 percent, according to Kantar data.The U.S. group, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.But the French supermarket sector has powerful incumbents such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Leclerc, operating at low margins and with a dense network of stores. Earlier this week, Casino said it would sell 12 Casino hypermarkets and 20 supermarkets to Apollo Global Management in a deal worth up to 470 million euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

19,"Apr 14, 2019 12:07PM ET",Gilbert wins another Monument with Roubaix triumph,nan,"ROUBAIX (Reuters) - Belgian Philippe Gilbert added to his impressive haul when he claimed his fourth 'Monument' classic by mastering the cobbles to win the Paris-Roubaix on Sunday.The former world champion, who has won the Tour of Lombardy twice, the Tour of Flanders and Liege-Bastogne-Liege, beat German Nils Politt (Katusha) in a sprint finish on the Roubaix velodrome with his team mate and compatriot Yves Lampaert coming home third.The Milan-San Remo, in which he has twice finished third, is the only Monument one-day race he has not won. Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck have won all five Monuments while Ireland's Sean Kelly was the last man to win four in his career, when he won Milan-San Remo in 1986. ""It's hard to believe. I was ill before the Tour of Flanders last week but I trained very well and I was feeling the form was there,"" said Gilbert, the 2012 world champion, his face covered in sweat and dust.""I've always wanted to win all the Monuments, and I'm getting closer now.""A lot of people thought riding on the cobbles was too hard for me,"" added Gilbert, also a stage winner on the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta.Gilbert was one of the main attackers of the day, making his first move about 70km from the finish.There were six riders fighting for victory with 48km left after the 36-year-old Gilbert was joined by Politt, Wout van Aert, Peter Sagan, Sep Vanmarcke and Yves Lampaert.One of the pre-race favorites, Belgian Tiesj Benoot, abandoned after crashing onto the rear window of a team car as he was chasing the pack following a mechanical problem.With Sagan expected to be the fastest in a sprint finish, his opponents tried to shake him off with Gilbert accelerating first 22km from the line.The Slovak followed, as well as Politt, but the move was fatal for Van Aert, who paid for his efforts after a mechanical problem, a bike change and a crash earlier in the race.Lampaert and Vanmarcke closed the gap on a cobbled sector.Gilbert brutally accelerated again on the  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) de l'Arbre, one of the most feared cobbled sectors, and Lampaert was immediately dropped.In the Gruson sector, it was Politt who made his move with only Gilbert able to jump onto his wheel.With much more experience than his 25-year-old opponent, Gilbert easily won the sprint to give his team their second Monument title of the season after France's Julian Alaphilippe won Milan-San Remo last month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

20,"Apr 11, 2019 03:10PM ET",Anxiety Grows Among Brazil Businessmen Over Delayed Economic Rebound,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian businessmen that began the year with high hopes the economy would finally rebound amid optimism with President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration are growing increasingly impatient at just how slow things are going.In private talks at an event last week, a handful of executives from some of the country’s largest companies expressed disappointment at the pace of the economic recovery, worry about the persistently high unemployment rate and, most of all, frustration about the progress being made on the economic agenda. They’re still optimistic the administration’s proposed pension reform will be approved in Congress, but with less savings and potentially later in the year than previously expected.Bolsonaro’s first 100 days in office have been anything but smooth, marked by infighting, communication bungles and a heavy use of Twitter both for official announcements and rallying his voter base. The government’s failure to forge a working majority in Congress and frequent sidetracking into controversial topics has slowed progress of plans to overhaul the pension system. The issues have led traders to pare back on some of their optimistic bets, and kept foreign investors mostly on the sidelines.At the event last week, some 450 executives and officials gathered in Campos do Jordao, a Swiss-inspired town about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northeast of Sao Paulo, to talk about the outlook for Latin America’s largest economy and hear from some government heavy-hitters, including Economy Minister Paulo Guedes. Concerns about the slow pace of the recovery were prevalent in conversations -- and already show up in business confidence, which last month fell to the lowest level since October, according to a survey from Fundacao Getulio Vargas.While most of the businessmen still decline to be named openly discussing politics, some are speaking out -- mostly in defense of the government’s agenda, like banker Andre Esteves did, and especially of the pension reform seen as key in fixing the country’s accounts. But some are also calling out what they see as missteps.“What keeps us up at night is this belligerent group in the government that seems to not have switched from campaign mode to governing mode,” retail magnate Flavio Rocha, who mulled a presidential run himself, said during the event. “That’s the biggest threat to the reform.”The disappointing pace of the economy and still-cloudy outlook has some companies that depend on the domestic economy keeping their planned investments in check. Retail giants including Magazine Luiza SA and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) Brasil are either leaving their forecast investments on the same level as 2018 or expecting only slight increases."

27,"Mar 19, 2019 06:00AM ET","Exclusive: Metro kicks off China unit sale, likely to fetch $2 billion valuation: sources",nan,"By Kane Wu and Julie ZhuHONG KONG (Reuters) - German wholesaler Metro AG has kicked off the sale of its China operations by calling for bids, in a deal that would value the business at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the deal said.Metro, which owns 95 stores in China and real estate assets in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, is planning to offload a majority stake in its China business, said the people.The sale move is part of a global reorganization of the wholesaler and comes as China's wholesale and retail sectors are experiencing disruption from e-commerce players. Metro's China business could yet be valued at up to $3 billion, said two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Potential bidders include electronics retailer Suning Holdings Group, supermarket chain operators Wumart Stores Inc and Yonghui Superstores, according to three of the people. Private equity firms such as Hillhouse Capital Group and Bain Capital are also studying a potential deal, they added.Property makes up the bulk of the value in Metro's China business, the people said, cautioning, however, that there is a large gap between price expectations among buyers and the seller.A Metro spokeswoman in Germany said the company is in talks with potential partners concerning the further development of its China business but declined to comment on details of its exchanges with potential partners or the sale process. Bain and Suning declined to comment. Yonghui and Hillhouse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Calls to Wumart went unanswered.First-round, non-binding bids are due in the second week of April, said two of the people.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are advising Metro, the people said. The banks declined to comment.All the sources declined to be named as the deal talks are not public.E-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings has also been in talks with Metro about taking a stake in the China business, Reuters previously reported.Tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent have been investing in supermarkets and shopping malls to help develop their online-to-offline strategy.Alibaba in 2015 poured $4.6 billion into Suning's listed entity - Suning.Com Co Ltd and holds a 19.99 percent stake, its biggest step towards integrating online and store-based shopping at the time. Tencent, which has invested 4.2 billion yuan in a 5 percent stake of Yonghui, is also forming a partnership in China with Europe' s largest retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).The German wholesaler opened its first China store in Shanghai in 1996 and now has over 11,000 employees in the country. Its sales in the country reached 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion) in the financial year of 2017-2018, according to its website. Once a sprawling retail conglomerate, Metro has been restructuring in recent years to focus on its core cash-and-carry business, selling Kaufhof department stores and then splitting from consumer electronics group Ceconomy.Metro is also trying to offload its loss-making Real hypermarkets chain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

28,"Mar 18, 2019 02:52AM ET",Walmart Japan's new CEO: Seiyu 'absolutely' not for sale,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The newly appointed chief executive of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu on Monday denied the business was up for sale, following reports last year that the U.S. retail giant was looking for a buyer.""I'm not here to sell a business,"" Lionel Desclee told reporters in Tokyo in his first public remarks since his appointment on Friday. ""Absolutely not at all.""Japanese media reported last year that Walmart considered selling Seiyu, and that a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.69 billion to $4.48 billion).Desclee, who has worked for European food retailer Delhaize Group and was previously CEO of pet shop chain Tom & Co, said he was too new in the job to discuss strategy but was sure that a sale was not in the works.He joked of ""sleepless nights"" as he read media reports of a possible sale just as he was considering the Tokyo job.""Thanks to this article I did thoroughly discuss Walmart's intentions,"" he said, adding that officials in Bentonville, Arkansas, assured him that he was being hired to grow, rather than sell, the Japanese business.Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6 percent stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008. Japan has proven a difficult market for many foreign entrants such as  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) PLC and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA. Consumers demand fresh food and high levels of customer service in a highly competitive industry where margins are razor thin after years of deflation.Under Walmart, Seiyu has closed unprofitable stores. It also launched an online grocery venture with Rakuten Inc last year, although it meets tough competition from rivals which will include Amazon's Fresh service.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

31,"Mar 03, 2019 08:35AM ET",French tax on internet giants could yield 500 million euros per year: Le Maire,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - A three percent tax on the French revenue of large internet companies could yield 500 million euros (568.5 million pounds) per year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. Le Maire told Le Parisien newspaper the tax is aimed at companies with worldwide digital revenue of at least 750 million and French revenue of more than 25 million euros. He said the tax would target some 30 companies, mostly American, but also Chinese, German, Spanish and British, as well as one French firm and several firms with French origins that have been bought by foreign companies. The paper listed Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (the four so-called ""GAFA"" companies) but also Uber, Airbnb, Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) and French online advertising specialist Criteo as targets.""A taxation system for the 21st century has to built on what has value today, and that is data,"" Le Maire said. He added it is also a matter of fiscal justice, as the digital giants pay some 14 percentage points less tax than European small-and-medium sized companies. Fairer taxes are a key demand of the ""yellow vest"" protests seen across France in the past three months. Le Maire said the tax would target platform companies that earn a commission on putting companies in touch with customers.Companies selling their products on their own websites would not be targeted, such as French retailer Darty which sells TVs and washing machines via its website.But companies such as Amazon earning money as a digital intermediary between a producer and a client would have to pay. The tax would also target the sales of personal data for advertising purposes. In order to avoid penalizing companies who already pay taxes in France, the amount paid will be deductible from pretax income, Le Maire said. He will present a draft law to the cabinet on Wednesday before it is presented to parliament. France has led a push for firms with significant digital revenue in the European Union to pay more tax at source, but has made little headway as Germany is cool to the idea, while member states with low corporate tax rates such as Luxembourg and Ireland firmly oppose the proposal. In an interview with weekly Journal du Dimanche,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) CEO Alexandre Bompard said it is high time to end the fiscal imbalance between brick-and-mortar firms like his and the U.S. and Chinese internet platform companies.""They pour their products onto markets without even paying value-added tax, and hardly any other tax at all, it is intolerable. On the same turnover they should pay the same tax,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Alibaba's interest comes after rival Tencent last year signed a partnership deal with France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).U.S.-listed Alibaba, which runs consumer-facing online shopping platforms Taobao and TMall and food delivery app Ele.me, is looking to develop a business-focused retail strategy, said one of the sources. Teaming up with a wholesaler like Metro could also bring synergy to its fresh produce units Hema and Yiguo, the source added.Any deal would add to the HK$22.4 billion ($2.87 billion) Alibaba spent in 2017 on a major stake in China's top hypermart operator, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd, as part of a push to build big-data capabilities in the offline retail market.For its part, Metro was once a sprawling retail conglomerate but has been restructuring in recent years to focus on its core cash-and-carry business, selling Kaufhof department stores and then splitting from consumer electronics group Ceconomy.It is also trying to offload its loss-making Real hypermarkets chain, saying on Tuesday that the sale is progressing.Metro shares, which have gained 16 percent this year on speculation of a possible bid for the company and news on divestments, were up 0.6 percent after the Reuters report.""Initial excitement about a bid premium will soon be replaced by worries about hollowing out the business and removing one of the few paths for sustainable growth,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyn.Metro has 95 stores in China and real estate assets in major centers, such as Beijing and Shanghai, one of the sources said.Apart from Alibaba, there are other parties involved in early discussions with Metro, according to the sources, with an official sale process expected to kick off soon. Metro Chief Executive Olaf Koch said on Tuesday that the German firm was reviewing potential partnerships with local players in China. Metro and Alibaba have already partnered in online retail in China. ""We are growing continually and we are profitable there,"" Koch said when Metro presented first quarter earnings.Metro reported that same store sales in Asia rose a currency adjusted 7 percent to 1.04 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in the October to December quarter.The possible China move comes as Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky is preparing a potential bid for Metro, people close to the matter told Reuters last month.Global Commerce (EPGC), a vehicle co-owned by Kretinsky and Slovak investor Patrik Tkac, is expected to have the financing and other arrangements in place to be able to announce a tender offer for Metro as early as March, the people added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

38,"Feb 01, 2019 03:45AM ET",French food law will not squeeze household budgets: minister,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - France's agriculture minister sought to reassure households that food shopping bills would not jump dramatically as a rise in minimum food prices aimed at raising farmers' incomes came into effect on Friday.The government had postponed introducing the measure in December as France reeled from nationwide unrest and sometimes violent ""yellow vest"" protests over high living costs and the squeeze felt on household budgets.Didier Guillaume said prices would increase on only 5 percent of products sold in supermarkets, including the chocolate spread Nutella, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and granola - items retailers often sell at a discount to draw consumers in.The ""field-to-fork"" bill was a campaign promise of President Emmanuel Macron to win support among farmers, an important voter constituency in France, who have long complained of being hit by low margins and ending up the victims of retail price wars.""Households will only end up paying more if their trolley is full of Nutella and Coca-cola. The price of loss-leader goods will increase, while the price of meat, fish, cheese, vegetables will not,"" Guillaume told CNews.The new legislation includes a 10 percent increase in the price floor for food products and curbs promotional offers so that retailers cannot discount products by more than 34 percent of their value.Guillaume said the average household shopping bill would increase by just 50 cents to 3 euros a month. Supermarket retailers like  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Casino and privately-held Leclerc typically made a margin of 30-40 percent on farmers' products, the minister said, adding: ""I ask them to stop doing that.""Michel-Edouard Leclerc, chief executive of supermarket chain Leclerc, France's largest food retailer by market share, has branded the food price measures a ""scam"" and said farmers would not see higher prices.Separately, Guillaume confirmed that a Polish abattoir had sold nearly 800 kilograms of rotten beef to nine French companies. Polish authorities acknowledged on Thursday that 2.7 tonnes of suspect beef had been exported across the European Union. ""It's an awful fraud,"" Guillaume said.The trial of two former managers of French meat-processing firm Spanghero and two Dutch meat traders accused of passing off cheap horse meat as beef in ready-made meals and burgers brought food safety standards into focus in France in January.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

45,"Jan 16, 2019 12:10AM ET",Ford and IBM among quartet in Congo cobalt blockchain project,nan,"By Barbara LewisLONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford (N:F), technology giant  IBM  (N:IBM), South Korean cathode maker LG Chem (KS:051910) and China's Huayou Cobalt (SS:603799) have joined forces in the first blockchain project to monitor cobalt supplies from Democratic Republic of Congo.The pilot, overseen by responsible-sourcing group RCS Global, aims to help manufacturers ensure that cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries has not been mined by children or used to fuel conflict.Companies are under pressure from consumers and investors to prove that minerals are sourced without human rights abuses, but tracking raw materials throughout their journey is challenging. The project announced on Wednesday has been quietly under way since December. Starting with industrially mined cobalt in Congo, it is monitoring supplies all the way to lithium-ion batteries for Ford vehicles.Supplies of cobalt, expected to be needed in huge quantities for electric vehicles and electronic devices, are concentrated in Congo, a sprawling, volatile nation that has been racked by civil war and political tension. The outcome of elections in December, which had been intended to be Congo's first democratic transfer of power in six decades, is contested. [nL8N1ZB393]RCS says the IBM blockchain platform could be used to include other minerals and to allow artisanal miners, which analysts say are the biggest issue with regard to ethical sourcing, to join a blockchain-based network of validated participants.Blockchain, famed as the technology behind cryptocurrency bitcoin, works by providing a shared record of data held by a network of individual computers rather than a single party. For the pilot project, which should be completed around the middle of the year, cobalt from Huayou's industrial mine will be placed in secure bags, entered into a blockchain and traced from the mine and smelter to LG Chem’s cathode and battery plant in South Korea and then on to a Ford plant in the United States. Because minerals are often combined with metals from various sources when they are smelted, they are particularly difficult to track.The RCS project seeks to enforce best practice by using guidelines drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.IBM said it was exploring the potential of chemical analysis using artificial intelligence to pinpoint the origin of cobalt and ensure so-called clean cobalt was not smelted with minerals sourced less responsibly.""There is no fool-proof method, but you have to keep the ball moving forward, to keep raising the level of accuracy,"" Manish Chawla, general manager of IBM's mining and industrial sector business, told Reuters.""Blockchain has been proven to be a very effective technology in raising the bar.""IBM has already worked with retailers including Walmart (N:WMT) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) to trace food through supply chains.

47,"Jan 10, 2019 09:50AM ET",French companies bruised by 'yellow vests' protests,nan,"By Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - French companies have this week revealed some 60 million euros ($69 million) of lost business from anti-government protests rocking the country, which could augur badly for the likes of supermarket chains Casino and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Shares in retailer FNAC Darty fell on Thursday after the electronics goods retailer estimated a revenue hit of some 45 million euros from the closure of stores during the protests and fewer shoppers.With no sign of the protests ending, Air France KLM said the unrest had reduced sales by 15 million euros -- a relatively small figure for the Franco-Dutch airline but enough to push its shares down too.The ""yellow vests"" ('gilets jaunes') movement - named after the fluorescent jackets all French motorists carry in their vehicles - started in the middle of November as a protest against a fuel tax but has since grown into a broader backlash against the government. The demonstrations have been marred by violence that has led to shopping districts and tourist hotspots having to close down on some weekends.""The impact will be felt first and foremost with those companies with a physical presence on the high street, such as FNAC Darty. But others will also be impacted, such as hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) since the 'gilets jaunes' has been negative for tourism in Paris,"" said Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.Data on Wednesday showed consumer confidence last month fell to its lowest level in four years as consumer fretted about their purchasing power and ability to make large purchases - and figures later in January from Casino and Carrefour could reflect that.Confidence was also down in France's construction industry as a result of the protests, said HSBC, which said it was revisiting its valuation of Bouygues' construction related business to better reflect the global environment.""STANDSTILL""Catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) warned it had concerns for later this year. Sodexo owns Paris cabaret Le Lido, the Yachts de Paris luxury river cruising business and has the catering contract for a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.""We are more worried about the impact of the protests on the spring-summer tourism season,"" said CEO Denis Machuel.The FCD French retail association, which speaks for both supermarket retailers and upmarket department stores, estimated that there had been a revenue loss of around 2 billion euros over the course of November and December.""Needless to say, you will have similar warnings from other big Paris shops. In essence the Champs Elysees has been closed every weekend for the last two months, so outlets such as LVMH and Le Bon Marché will get hit,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Clairinvest.""The companies in Paris' CAC-40 index will get impacted to a certain extent because the 'gilets jaunes' have brought the French economy to a standstill,"" added Valahu.The signs of bruising to French companies comes after a study in financial daily Les Echos this week showed that the country's top companies had paid out dividends worth 57 billion euros last year, as President Emmanuel Macron pursued his reform drive.Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Swiss investment firm Prime Partners, said that given the risks from the protests he would favor international companies over those exposed to the domestic French economy, such as Casino and Carrefour.(GRAPHIC: Paris riots roil French equities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QgkZSn)(GRAPHIC: Protests slow French GDP - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zQhrf0)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

From tracking the quality of food to facilitating international trades in grain, blockchain technology has been turning up repeatedly in recent months; and while many deployments of such tech have been conducted on a trial basis, a growing number have been implemented permanently.However, as much as it now seems that blockchains are becoming a familiar feature of the food industry, they aren’t an infallible solution to every problem it faces. Even though many blockchains will provide an 'immutable' and 'trustless' record of the distribution of certain foods, this doesn't mean we don't have to trust the parties that first registered these foods on them. And similarly, even though such multinationals as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) are using solutions offered by the  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Food Trust, they don’t use blockchains in the original sense of the term.Continue Reading on Coin Telegraph"

Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and AMS (S:AMS) gained 5.8 to 6.7 percent. Overall analysts have cut their 2019 earnings growth expectations for world stocks over the past month as concern grew that a trade war would compound the impact of a slowing global economy. The oil sector (SXEP) also jumped 2.7 percent as crude soared ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting, expected to result in a supply cut.Luxury stocks highly sensitive to China were also among top gainers, with heavyweight conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH) up 5.9 percent and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) rising 6.1 percent.Away from the trade war relief, shares in French supermarkets  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), underperformed after riots in Paris on Saturday.Carrefour was down 1.1 percent and Casino was up just 0.5 percent, while France's main CAC 40 rose 2 percent.Argenx (BR:ARGX) topped the STOXX with an 11.3 percent gain after the Netherlands-based biopharma company said it signed a deal worth potentially up to $1.6 billion with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) affiliate Cilag to develop its Cusatuxumab drug in certain types of cancer.Graphic: global earnings growth expectations dec 3 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Q9fNPZ  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Nov 23, 2018 11:20AM ET",Black Friday misery for French shops as Macron and protesters lock horns,nan,"By Richard Lough and Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French retailers warned after days of unrest over fuel taxes on Friday that prolonged protests could spoil the Christmas shopping season and threaten jobs, while President Emmanuel Macron showed no sign of backing down.For a week, protesters clad in fluorescent yellow jackets have blocked highways across France with burning barricades and convoys of slow-moving trucks, obstructing access to fuel depots, shopping centers and some factories.The unrest is a dilemma for Macron who casts himself as a champion in the fight against climate change and wants the French to switch to greener energies. He has been derided as out of touch with common folk and is fighting a slump in popularity. Now he faces upsetting businesses with a warning from retailers that the protests are damaging trade and could harm the economy.Retailers' daily revenue fell 35 percent last Saturday, the first day of the so-called ""yellow vest"" protests, when nearly 300,000 people took part. ""We have a real problem as some stores have been closed for a week now because of the blockades,"" said Jacques Creyssel, head of the French Retail Federation (FCD). ""One week without revenue is dramatic for a company.""The FCD represents retailers including  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Casino and Fnac Darty, for whom Black Friday, a now annual event imported from the United States on the day when retailers traditionally begin turning a profit, marks the start of the Christmas shopping season.""It's a crucial time for retailers. If retailers cannot work and customers cannot shop, it's bound to have a major impact on employment,"" said Creyssel.The protests will enter a second week on Saturday with police braced for confrontations with violent fringe elements though the overall number of protesters has fallen sharply.Tourism is also being affected. The Eiffel Tower in Paris will be closed on Saturday because of the planned protests, its operator said.And the disruption has spread to carmaker PSA Group, which was forced to temporarily halt two production lines on Wednesday at its Sochaux plant, where it assembles Peugeot and Citroen vehicles, because of problems getting supplies delivered.""GENTLE TOUCH"" NEEDEDThe government has sought to calm the uprising by earmarking 500 million euros to double a 2,000 euro bonus granted to motorists on low incomes who change old-model cars for cleaner ones.But it was enough. The ""yellow vests"" demand the government reverse fuel tax hikes which, combined with higher global oil prices, have led to a roughly 20 percent rise in the pump price of diesel in the last year. Diesel now retails at about 1.50 euros ($1.70) per liter in the Greater Paris region.Macron's decision to dig in his heels is showing signs of upsetting the young, centrist En Marche party. There is simmering dissatisfaction, in particular among left-leaning lawmakers, over policies perceived as favoring the rich.""It we want France to change its course, it requires a gentle touch and flexibility,"" said En Marche legislator Patrick Vignal. ""And my government is showing neither.""Matthieu Orphelin, an En Marche MP who wants Macron to move faster on clean energy, said: ""To be heard, you first have to listen. We need to get out there, get shouted out and reply to their anger in concrete terms.""Diesel tax opponents argue that the government lacks a clear vision on switching to more environmentally-friendly energy sources, citing foot-dragging by Macron on reducing France's reliance on nuclear power.The president and his ecology minister will on Tuesday lay out their blueprint for an ""energy transition"", including a timeline for reducing France's reliance on nuclear, which currently delivers about 75 percent of French power.""We're working more to a target of 50 percent nuclear by 2035,"" Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy said on Thursday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

President Emmanuel Macron has also defended the rising price of fuel at the pumps, which have prompted activists to plan protest blockades on Nov. 17 across France, stating they are due mostly to rising oil prices.Consumers' anger over the fuel tax is the latest sign of discontent facing Macron.France's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party jumped ahead of Macron's LREM for the first time in a poll of voting intentions for May 2019 European Parliament elections.Macron's standing in opinion polls has also been hit by the departure of two high-profile ministers, while stubbornly high unemployment, high taxes and rising fuel prices have added to signs of malaise.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

69,"Oct 10, 2018 10:36AM ET",France's Monoprix says grocery alliance with Amazon Prime tops expectations,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) -  Casino 's (PA:CASP) upmarket Monoprix supermarket chain said the start of its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime's (O:AMZ) delivery service for Paris had been better than expected - an alliance that could prove crucial for debt-ridden Casino's fortunes.Monoprix Chief Executive Regis Schultz told Reuters that orders had been beating expectations, and that he hoped the delivery service could be extended elsewhere in France, although the decision was in the hands of e-commerce giant Amazon.Nearly a month after the launch, the number of orders was exceeding by 2-3 times the expectations of the two partners, he said.""A first assessment is very, very satisfactory. Our priority is now to expand the service,"" said Schultz.Monoprix, which is seen by analysts as being similar to U.S. retailer Whole Foods, started filling orders for subscribers to Amazon's Prime loyalty program in parts of Paris on Sept. 12 through a two-hour delivery partnership.The performance of the alliance is being closely watched since Monoprix was the first French retailer to agree in March to sell its products via Amazon, causing a stir in the fiercely competitive domestic French market.Monoprix, one of Casino's most valuable assets, is also under scrutiny as parent Casino faces concerns over its debts and has been selling assets to cut debt.The Amazon Prime service currently covers a third of the French capital, generating sales of 10 million-20 million euros ($11.5 million to $23 million), equivalent to the food sales of a Monoprix store. It should cover the whole of Paris next year.Asked if there were plans to expand elsewhere in France, Schultz replied: ""We are ready to follow Amazon's deployment in all big French cities. They are likely to make the announcement when they are ready. It's part of their plans for sure.""Asked if the partnership paved the way to other deals with Amazon, he added: ""Today this is not the spirit of our agreements.""The U.S. e-commerce giant, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.OTHERS TARGET PARIS MARKETAmazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (L:MRW), have led to speculation it could target the European food and supermarket sector next.Amazon Prime currently offers 6,000 new products chosen by Monoprix. The products are prepared in one Monoprix store and delivered by Amazon. Delivery is free for orders over 60 euros. For those under 60 euros, a 3.90 euros fee is charged.Monoprix had 2017 sales of 5 billion euros and a margin estimated by some analysts at 5-6 percent. A key contributor to parent Casino's overall profit, it makes over 30 percent of its sales in the lucrative Paris market.Schultz said the deal with Amazon gave Monoprix access to the 70 to 80 percent of Amazon Prime clients who were not already Monoprix clients, including many offices.""We clearly are getting new clients from Prime. There are no elements showing a cannibalisation of Monoprix or Monoprix.fr.""However, competition in the sector is looming in Paris.Leclerc, France's largest grocer by market share and which has built its reputation on low prices, also has its sights on Paris, giving itself three years to establish a solid foothold in the capital.Rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which has 250 convenience stores in Paris, has launched six pickup points in the capital, where customers can order 15,000 products online and collect them in store.Shares in Casino - which has also been linked with Carrefour - are down nearly 30 percent this year.Worries over its debts and the competition it faces in France have led some analysts to speculate that Casino may have to sell Monoprix, but Schultz played this down.""This is mere speculation. This is not what I focus on.""($1 = 0.8693 euros)"

71,"Oct 09, 2018 07:21AM ET"," IBM Food Trust Becomes Generally Available, Carrefour Joins Alliance ",nan," IBM  (NYSE:IBM) announced on Monday its blockchain-based food supply chain network, IBM Food Trust, had become generally available as a subscription service. The consortium members, which include retailers and suppliers operating in the food industry, benefit from distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions to ensure the traceability and transparency of processes within the food market.After being tested for about 18 months, the network is now open to relevant new members. One new addition is French multinational retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which announced on Monday it would use IBM Food Trust to increase its food excellence actions. Carrefour operates over 12,000 stores in 33 countries worldwide. Initially, the blockchain solution will be used to track tomatoes, chicken, and eggs as they move from farms to stores. In the future, the retailer plans to apply the technology to all of its fresh products. The solution is part of Carrefour’s Act for Food program and will reach all of its brands by 2022.Carrefour general secretary Laurent Vallée commented:“Being a founding member of the IBM Food Trust platform is a great opportunity for Carrefour to accelerate and widen the integration of blockchain technology to our products in order to provide our clients with safe and undoubted traceability.”“This is a decisive step in the roll-out of Act for Food, our global program of concrete initiatives in favor of the food transition,” he added.IBM Food Trust, which runs on the IBM Cloud, offers three software-as-a-service (SaaS)..."
72,"Oct 08, 2018 10:37AM ET",Chickens and eggs: Retailer Carrefour adopts blockchain to track fresh produce,nan,"By Tom Wilson and Eric AuchardLONDON (Reuters) - Europe's largest retailer  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) has adopted blockchain ledger technology to track and trace chicken, eggs and tomatoes as they travel from farms to stores, and will deploy it across all of its fresh product lines in coming years.The French retail giant said it will rely on blockchain technology developed by  IBM  (N:IBM), which is working with a number of retailers, logistics firms and growers to roll out systems to secure their global supply chains.IBM Food Trust allows the industry to track and share information on how products are grown, processed and shipped. The technology cuts the time for checking the provenance of food from days or weeks to seconds, IBM said. Blockchain, best known as the technology underlying cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of data kept by a network of individual computers rather than a single party.Proponents say it has the power to transform industries from finance to real estate, but so far there have been few examples of its large-scale application.Carrefour Secretary General Laurent Vallee said the group would widen its use of the system to its 300 fresh products across the world by 2022, securing a safe supply chain and allowing customers to trust in their food.""The key thing for us as Carrefour is to be able to say when there is a crisis that we have the blockchain technology, so we are able to trace products and tell the story of the products,"" he told Reuters.Outbreaks of salmonella linked to eggs and poultry are a major challenge for the food industry. Nearly 207 million eggs from a North Carolina farm possibly contaminated with the organism were recalled in April, while the number of salmonella food poisoning cases in the European Union is rising.Global businesses will pay around $212,000 a year for full use of Food Trust, which is now available worldwide, IBM said. Still, mass adoption of the technology could face hurdles, said Simon Ellis of U.S.-based market research firm IDC.""The efforts to convince growers to participate is not a minimal one,"" he said. ""Growers and farmers exist at dramatically different levels of technological sophistication."" Pork processing giant Smithfield Foods  is among other firms joining the project, IBM said, while science and technology companies contributing data to the blockchain now include Minneapolis-based 3M (N:MMM).Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said last month it would ask leafy greens suppliers to implement real-time, farm-to-store tracking using IBM's technology.Last year, 10 retail and food companies including Nestle SA (SIX:NESN),  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) and  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) joined the project.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

This is a big challenge. We absolutely must prove our new positioning to the customer through very strong, precise and coherent actions,"" CEO Alexandre Bompard told journalists on Monday.The new food advisory committee will be led by Carrefour's Group Secretary General Laurent Vallée, who in January was tasked to spearhead food transformation across the Carrefour group.It will include seven people from outside the group including a French chef, a farmer, a cancer researcher, as well as Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber, who has said he wants the world's biggest yogurt maker to play a central role in the revolution sweeping the global food industry.As more consumers, notably the “Millennial” generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, retailers as well as large consumer goods group such as Danone or rival Nestle (S:NESN), have been seeking to adapt.Danone bought U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave in a $12.5 billion deal, bringing the company more into line with healthier eating trends and its boss will part of a committee that shares best practices and ideas with Carrefour.Carrefour's five-year overhaul announced in January also entails cutting costs, boosting E-commerce investment and expansion into convenience stores in the face of fierce competition from more agile rivals like Leclerc, and challenges from online retail giants like Amazon (O:AMZN).Under the plan, Carrefour, which is France's top organic food retailer, targets 5 billion euros in organic food sales by 2022, compared to 1.2 billion generated in 2017.""Changing lifestyle habits, an increasing focus on health and food quality as well as growing distrust of the food industry in the wake of recent health scandals is propelling fresh and organic food sales higher in France, allowing retailers to benefit from higher prices and strengthen their earnings and margins, amidst a fiercely competitive environment,"" Vincent Gusdorf, senior analyst at Moody's said in a recent note.In 2017 organic food sales in France rose 17 percent to 8.4 billion euros from 2016, according to organic food agency Agence Bio.Carrefour also on Monday unveiled Act For Food, a worldwide program to educate customers about its initiatives to tackle issues such as food safety, product origin and relationships with farmers.In July, Carrefour bought So.Bio, specialized in the distribution of organic products, with revenue of nearly 40 million euros.

79,"Aug 23, 2018 02:01AM ET",Major Players Use Blockchain to Streamline Agribusiness’ Creaking Supply Chain,nan,"Agriculture is proving to be one of the most promising sectors for the growth and implementation of blockchain technologies. The mammoth industry suffers from a number of endemic issues. Agricultural trade relies on complex relationships between farmers and retailers, as well as convoluted supply chain procedures which can complicate payments and product providence. As demand for agricultural trade becomes increasingly international, suppliers and innovators alike are looking to bring the trade into the twenty first century by capitalising on blockchain’s distributed ledger technology.One of blockchain’s most commonly promoted attributes is transparency. GlobalData’s How Britain Shops survey reveals that consumers are increasingly concerned with the quality of the food they purchase from retailers. In a time where knowledge about food and nutrition is rapidly expanding, blockchain gives shoppers the ability to track the origins of store stock, helping them to guarantee purchasing a safe, quality product. Retailers and manufacturers are able to benefit from preventing flawed products from ever hitting the shelves by tracing information for individual items back to the farm where they were produced. Although this technology is in its early stages, the French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) has implemented blockchain to display information about their free-range chickens, the Retail Insight World reports. Customers have access to a plethora of data about their fateful chicken of choice, including the time it was laid, the hatchery and the name of the farmer.Continue Reading on Coin Telegraph"

This is possible thanks to a partnership with UK-based startup WeGift. Under the new deal, Coinbase users would be able to cash out their coins for gift cards from over 120 merchants.Initially, the program will be open for clients in the UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, and Australia. In the future, Coinbase intends to reach other countries as well. Customers can spend their crypto coins with retailers like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play, Uber,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE),  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), Ticketmaster, Costa,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), and Zalando among others.Coinbase reportedly stated:“Whether it’s converting Bitcoin into Uber credits or Ethereum into an ASOS (LON:ASOS) e-gift card, customers will have greater flexibility and control over how they use their crypto.”“With the launch of e-gift cards, customers have a new option to spend their crypto balances, realizing its value to buy tangible things or experiences,” the exchange operator added.Clients looking to buy digital gift cards will get zero withdrawal fees with Coinbase and will enjoy bonuses on certain e-gifts.The current initiative comes from one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world in an attempt to boost the functionality of major crypto coins. Currently, most crypto traders see cryptocurrencies mostly as a way to store value or generate profits rather than a means of payments.Currently, Coinbase customers can trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, and Litecoin. Recently, the exchange operator announced that it would add Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT (LON:BATS)), Stellar (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and Ox (ZRX).To access the e-gifts, the customers have to use Coinbase login details via a special WeGift page powered by Coinbase. However, when we tried to sign in, the page wasn’t working as it seemed to load continuously."

91,"Jul 11, 2018 10:31PM ET",Walmart looks to exit Japan with Seiyu supermarket sale: NIkkei,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) has decided to sell Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu and has already approached major retailers and private equity funds, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.If realized, the sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.7 billion to $4.5 billion), the Nikkei said, without citing its sources.Walmart said it does not comment on market speculation.A sale would be the latest exit by Walmart from a lower-growth market as it looks to shake up its overseas business and invest in places like China and India.The world's biggest retailer said last month it had sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International, exiting an underperforming business in its third major international deal since April.In addition to competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Japan's supermarkets are being squeezed by chains such as convenience stores and discount drugstores in a sluggish consumption environment.In January Walmart said it was launching an online grocery service with  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755), in what Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said he hoped may be a precursor to greater global cooperation.Walmart has struggled to replicate the success of its low-price model with Seiyu despite the introduction of an ""everyday low price"" pledge and frequent discounting.Japanese supermarkets, with lots of workers preparing fresh food and high levels of customer service, are famous for their low margins and are proving a drag for many retailers.Recent industry consolidation saw the creation of FamilyMart Uny Holdings Co Ltd (T:8028) in 2016, a deal that focused on expanding the number of FamilyMart convenience stores. Such stores have increasingly become a priority for retailers as a growth driver.Discounter Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd (T:7532) has taken a 40 percent stake in Uny as it looks for room to expand. Earlier this year Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382) announced a tie-up with regional general merchandise store chain  Izumi Co Ltd  (T:8273).Japan's supermarket industry has proved difficult for foreign retail giants, with exits by  Tesco  (L:TSCO) in 2011 and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) in 2005."

94,"Jul 03, 2018 02:20PM ET","Carrefour, Tesco deal to squeeze suppliers, big and small",nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and James DaveyPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - A deal between  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) to team up on global purchasing will help them not only cut prices but also expand their own-label ranges, tightening a squeeze on major brand producers such as Nestle and Kraft Heinz.The Carrefour-Tesco alliance will reset relationships with global suppliers like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), at a time when they are already battling sluggish demand and start-up rivals.In a further blow to major consumer goods firms, the pair will also jointly source own-brand products, sales of which are growing rapidly in Europe due to the expansion of discounters like Aldi and Lidl which mostly stock private-label goods.""Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain,"" said Mella Frewen, director general of FoodDrinkEurope, an industry lobby group.However, the alliance could also allow smaller suppliers that only supply one of the retailers to double their business:""They could be into a massive opportunity for which they might very well drop their prices and compete,"" said David Sables, CEO of Sentinel Management Consultants, which coaches suppliers on how to negotiate with big supermarket groups.Sales growth at Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Unilever has been driven almost entirely by shifting more goods this year, rather than price rises given a tough retail environment.In the latest salvo from an activist investor seeking to shake up the sector, Third Point on Sunday recommended a series of steps to boost earnings at Nestle, whose brands include KitKat chocolates and Thomy sauces.Faced with consumers shifting towards healthier food and independent brands, manufacturers like Nestle are responding by trying to sell more premium, higher-priced items.But retailers are reluctant to put up prices as they face their own battle with discount groups and online players like internet giant Amazon (O:AMZN). Top brands have long taken a hard line in negotiations with retailers, assuming that stores are loathe to remove consumers' favourite products from their shelves. That approach backfired for Nestle earlier this year when a buying group representing six European retailers flexed its muscles with the Swiss group, pulling some of its products for months during a pricing row that was only settled in May.The Carrefour-Tesco alliance is just the latest purchasing agreement struck by major European retailers in recent years. German retailer Metro (DE:B4B) agreed a similar partnership with Auchan, Casino and Schiever of France last week.The deals compound pressure on suppliers after Britain's second-ranked Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) agreed to buy Wal-Mart owned (N:WMT) Asda, the number three player.PRIVATE-LABEL SALES RISING FASTTesco CEO Dave Lewis, a former Unilever executive, said branded giants were being outflanked by start-ups and retailers when it comes to developing new products.""For a lot of branded manufacturers ... agility is not always there and so they are getting out innovated by a lot of small players,"" Lewis said last week.While about half of Tesco's sales already comes from private label goods, which tend to be more profitable for retailers than branded ones, the figure is only about a quarter at Carrefour. The French firm aims to raise that to a third by 2022, while it is expected to cut the branded goods it offers by 20 percent.Retailers creating their own products is seen as a major challenge by a quarter of top executives at consumer goods firms, according to a recent survey by consultants KPMG.Private-label goods grew to account for more than 31 percent of sales in the European Union in 2016, and are set to keep growing, according to Nielsen, eroding demand for big brands.As Lewis has sought to rebuild trust in the British retailer since an accounting scandal in 2014, Tesco has operated in a more collaborative way with suppliers, in contrast to a confrontational approach at Carrefour, Sables said.""Suppliers to Carrefour might think if any of Tesco’s attitude in dealing with suppliers rubs off on Carrefour – that’s a positive thing,"" he said, adding Tesco could recommend its private-label suppliers to Carrefour and vice versa.The alliance could impact companies like Biscuit International, a leading producer of own-label sweet biscuits owned by private equity firm Qualium Investissement, according to Yves Marin, an associate at Bartle Business Consulting.The deal could take time to take effect as private-label contracts run for one to two years and suppliers will have to cross check prices of products sold by Tesco and Carrefour, Marin added.POWER SHIFT In another sign of the shifting balance of power towards retailers, British supermarkets are taking longer to pay their suppliers, according to Duncan Swift, who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens.""The swelling ‘piggy-bank’ of supplier monies held by supermarkets exacerbates the risk of them making unwarranted deductions which causes suppliers financial distress,"" he said.Swift said retailers had to be careful about how they implement purchasing alliances so they do not ring alarm bells with competition authorities, adding they do this by not sharing too much information.Ian Wright, chief executive of Britain's Food and Drink Federation, said the Tesco-Carrefour deal would increase concerns about buyer power stoked by the Sainsbury-Asda merger and the risks they impose on suppliers, mostly smaller firms.""It is imperative that these important changes to retailer/supplier market dynamics are properly examined by the competition authorities – in the round,"" he said. Britain's Competition and Markets Authorities is already examining the merger of  Sainsbury  and Asda, which are expected to argue their deal is justified given the shake-up of the market due to the rise of the discounters and Amazon.Discounters now account for 22 percent of sales of fast moving consumer goods in Europe, up from 17 percent a decade ago, according to data analytics firm Nielsen.Analysts at Fitch Ratings do not expect the Tesco-Carrefour partnership to be subject to competition scrutiny as they have hardly any geographic overlap, although regulators could start paying more attention if more alliances emerge.David McCarthy, HSBC head of consumer retail research, said buying alliances have not worked well in the past as retailers have failed to secure standardised prices. But he said Tesco and Carrefour now have a strong incentive to succeed.""New ways of doing business are needed to deal with exogenous threats such as Amazon and discounter expansion,"" he said. ""What is different this time is both the desire and need for the deal to work.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""As has become the pattern of late, the markets sank on Monday morning following the latest weekend tariff talk from (U.S. President) Donald Trump, presumably to leave investors scrabbling about for any signs of trade war-avoidance across the rest of the week,"" commented Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.The European Union has warned the United States that imposing import tariffs on cars and car parts would harm its own automotive industry and likely lead to counter-measures. Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) was down 0.6 percent. Merkel is to make a last-ditch effort to end a migration row with her conservative CSU allies by holding talks with her interior minister, whose offer to resign cast doubt over whether her fragile government can survive.""The risk that the CSU may walk out of the government in Berlin, turning Merkel into the leader of a minority government, remains serious"", said Holger Schmieding from Berenberg.In Frankfurt, shares in consumer electronics retailer Ceconomy (DE:CECG) were up 10 percent after news that telecoms company  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn), down 4.9 percent, would acquire a 9 percent stake. In Paris, Airbus (PA:AIR) shares fell 2.2 percent after Bloomberg News reported the European planemaker would miss its delivery target for Pratt & Whitney-powered (N:UTX) A320neo narrow-body jets this year.French supermarket retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and British peer  Tesco  (L:TSCO) lost 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively after they announced plans to form a global long-term purchasing alliance, as they seek to cut costs. ""An entente cordiale between the two giants of British and French retailing is yet another sign that squeezing the cost base is the biggest priority for supermarkets as they seek to contain the discounters and protect margins"", said Neil Wilson chief market analyst at Markets.com.In London, the FTSE 100 was down 0.9 percent as tensions over Brexit continue within Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet and a new poll showed a record 75 percent of major British companies were now pessimistic about leaving the EU.British gambling technology company Playtech (L:PTEC) posted the worst performance, losing over 20 percent after it disappointed investors with a trading update.Among rare winners, British software company  Micro Focus  International (L:MCRO) was up 5 percent after it said it had agreed to sell its Linux operating system SUSE business to a private equity fund advised by Sweden's EQT Partners for $2.535 billion.In the mid-cap segment of the market,  Vedanta Resources  (L:VED) surged over 25 percent after chairman Anil Agarwal's family trust agreed to a deal that values the mining conglomerate at 2.3 billion pounds. Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) was down 1.5 percent with Italian pharmaceutical group  Recordati  (MI:RECI) falling over 15 percent after a consortium of investment funds controlled by CVC Capital Partners has agreed to buy a stake at a discount.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Carrefour  said on Saturday that Plassat, who stepped down in July 2017, had decided not to apply a clause in his departure package under which he would get nearly 4 million euros for committing not to join a competitor.""When you've failed at the head of a company - and that's the case - you don't leave with 13 million euros. He gives up 4 million euros in a non-competition clause at the age 69, it's a joke,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told France 3 television.""He gets 500,000 euros in retirement a year, 40,000 euros a month, I think that's enough and he should have given up his 13 million euro package, the whole thing, not just 4 million,"" Griveaux added.Since Plassat's departure, his successor Alexandre Bompard has had to announce job cuts and store closures to boost performance while also launching an e-commerce offensive and seeking a Chinese partnership.Griveaux said that Plassat's package amounted to ""thuggish behaviour"" and urged the AFEP and Medef employers' federations to ensure companies stuck to their executive pay guidelines.The two federations said on Saturday they would revise their non-binding guidelines, which most large listed French companies currently follow.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Bompard, who took over as CEO in July 2017, said accelerating the company's digital commerce expansion was an ""absolute"" priority in the face of competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online rivals.""Six months ago we were isolated. All the retail alliances were taking place without us. Now we have deals with Tencent and Google,"" Bompard told the company's annual shareholders meeting.""Your company has become attractive again and is resolutely offensive. I am very proud of the Google partnership which shows that  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is back at the highest level worldwide,"" he said.Europe's largest retailer in January announced plans to cut costs and jobs, boost e-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China in an effort to lift profit and revenue and beat domestic rivals in the race to develop digital shopping products.As part of these plans, Carrefour announced on Monday it was teaming up with Google to boost e-commerce on its home turf. Carrefour has been a laggard in e-commerce and the Google deal is in line with Bompard's plans to invest 2.8 billion euros in the sector by 2022, six times its past rate of investment. It comes after a deal in March between Amazon and upmarket French chain Monoprix saw the U.S. online giant make further inroads into food retail in France.Other digital initiatives from Carrefour have included the opening of its first high-tech store in Shanghai last month in partnership with Tencent. The group also announced a five-year purchasing alliance with Systeme-U to makes Carrefour the biggest buyer in its competitive home market.In April, however, Carrefour gave a cautious outlook for this year after sales growth slowed in the first quarter, with continued weakness in its core French market suggesting the supermarket chain faces a long road to recovery.PAY CONTROVERSYShareholders on Friday backed Bompard's 2017 pay plan and the package paid to former CEO George Plassat, who left on July 18, 2017.Over 68 percent of votes cast approved Plassat's 2017 payout, which included nearly 4 million euros in exchange for him committing not to join a competitor. The package drew whistles and boos from trade union representatives and individual shareholders at the meeting.Advisory firm Proxinvest had recommended voting against Plassat's payout, saying it was ""too big in view of the group's performance"".In March, Carrefour unveiled a 34 percent cut to its annual dividend after it reported a net loss of 531 million euros for 2017 and a 14.7 percent fall in operating profit.Bompard told shareholders he would make proposals to the board so that his own future departure package would not ""stir a debate"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

102,"Jun 13, 2018 11:10AM ET",Why are grocery retailers teaming up with tech giants?,nan,"By Emma ThomassonBERLIN (Reuters) - France’s  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) announced a deal this week with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to boost its online shopping business. It is the latest in a string of partnerships between traditional food retailers and tech companies as grocery ecommerce takes off.HOW BIG IS GROCERY ECOMMERCE?Global grocery retailing is worth $5.9 trillion, according to figures from market research provider Euromonitor. Online sales of food and drink only accounted for about 1.5 percent of that in 2017, but are growing fast in some key markets.The figure is much higher in countries where retailers have quickly embraced ecommerce. The online share of food retail in Britain is 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent in France, according to business intelligence firm Planet Retail RNG.China's online grocery market is expected to almost triple by 2022 to account for 11 percent of spending, according to grocery industry research group IGD.The United States is a laggard on just 1 percent but is expected to more than double by 2022, according to IGD.WHY DO RETAIL GIANTS NEED TECH PLAYERS?Many traditional grocers need help with automatically replenishing products in stores, shopper subscription, artificial intelligence, voice technology and digital assistants, according to UBS analyst Daniel Ekstein.""This is bringing together previously unlikely bedfellows,"" he said. ""Google has positioned itself an ally in the tech arms-race and so partnership seems a pragmatic, capital light solution to build skill and scale.""By 2022, Chinese internet giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) will have overtaken Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to become the world’s biggest retailer. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be third with China's JD.com in fourth place and Carrefour in fifth, Planet Retail predicts.While retailers possess a huge amount of data on shopping habits, particularly through their loyalty schemes, they are not as good as big tech companies at using it to make personalized offers to customers, said Planet Retail director Boris Planer.""The online and offline worlds are coming together. This ability to connect with the customer and mine data is going to be one of the main capabilities for the future,"" he said.""Retailers are beginning to understand that it would be a big mistake to think they can do it on their own.""They also need help in setting up automated warehouses to enable fast picking of online orders, an area where Britain's Ocado (LON:OCDO) has taken the lead.WHAT IS IN IT FOR THE TECH TITANS?Storing and delivering food, especially fresh and frozen products, is a major headache. Many British retailers have struggled to turn a profit even after two decades of experimenting with different ways to handle online grocery.However, bricks-and-mortar retailers have major advantages over pure online players: they have long established relationships with suppliers, trusted own brands, logistics expertise and stores that can be used as a distribution network.In Britain and France, online grocery was first offered by incumbents such as  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) and Carrefour, while in China, the development has been led by Alibaba and JD.com partnering with traditional supermarkets.Consumers shop for food on a more regular basis than most other categories - it accounts for third to a half of all spending in many developed countries.That is the main reason why Amazon has persisted with its Fresh grocery service, launched in 2007, despite its logistical challenges and slow progress in winning customers.Bernstein analysts say: ""Once a retailer cracks the logistics path for grocery ecommerce, it provides a high frequency platform from which other categories can be approached. Grocery retail can therefore not be ignored.""RACE TO PARTNERThe need to combine expertise in food with digital capabilities has triggered many deals in recent years.Here are some of the biggest recent ones:2018- Kroger (NYSE:KR) seals warehouse deal with Ocado- Walmart pays $16 billion for 77 percent stake in Indian ecommerce firm Flipkart- France's upmarket Monoprix chain, owned by Casino, agrees deal to sell groceries via Amazon- Carrefour announces deal with Internet giant Tencent2017- Amazon buys Whole Foods for $13.7 billion- Walmart and JD.com expand strategic cooperation2016- Walmart buys ecommerce start-up Jet.com for $3 billionWHO IS NEXT?- While Alibaba and JD.com say they want to focus on China and southeast Asia for now, they have global ambitions and analysts expect they might eventually make moves into North America or Europe, perhaps with local partners.- Bernstein analysts speculate that Alibaba might seek to partner with Kroger or Britain's Tesco, while they predict Walmart could also deepen its cooperation with JD.com.- Amazon could roll out its Fresh service to more markets; it also plans to offer Whole Foods groceries via its fast-shipping Prime Now scheme in select U.S. cities- Ocado is expected to sign more deals with retailers in other countries, particularly continental Europe- U.S. grocery delivery start-up Instacart, which picks and delivers groceries for retailers, might need to make a strategic shift after Kroger's deal with OcadoWHAT IS THE DOWNSIDE?Grocery margins are already razor thin and ecommerce is expected to erode those further due to the high costs of delivery and the need to invest in technology and logistics.McKinsey estimates that the additional expense of selling groceries online amounts to between 4 and 7 euros per transaction, largely due to delivery costs.""Bricks-and-mortar grocers will feel a significant financial impact, as their slender margins make them sensitive to even a small loss in market share,"" according to a recent report by management consultants Oliver Wyman.Up to 30 percent of store space could close in most of the countries it has modeled if online grocery reaches about 8 percent market share, Oliver Wyman predicts.However, online could provide just as high a return on capital as offline retail, as it requires less investment than running and owning stores, according to Ahold Delhaize.Grocery delivery is much more efficient in urban areas as retailers can maximize the number of orders each driver unloads in a fixed period, part of the reason it has taken off in densely populated places like Britain and Chinese cities.In suburban or rural areas, it makes more sense to encourage shoppers to collect orders themselves from stores or curbside pick-up points, an approach pioneered in France that is now gaining favor in the United States.""It is still a category that needs a lot of work. The cost of delivery needs to be brought down, infrastructure needs to be built, and shopper trust needs to be established. This will take years,"" Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett""Retailers and suppliers cannot wait for it to become mature and figure it out then. As with all paradigm shifts, true leaders will have established their presence and expertise for years before the trend hits the masses."""

107,"Jun 04, 2018 01:08PM ET","Walmart sells majority of Brazil unit, takes $4.5 billion charge",nan,"By Nandita Bose and Tatiana BautzerNEW YORK/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Monday that it has sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International, exiting an underperforming business in its third major international deal since April.The world's biggest retailer has been looking to jumpstart its overseas business by retreating from lower-growth markets and investing in places like China and India. Brazil had for a decade been the focus of expansion but the unit stumbled in recent years as operational issues compounded the effects of a deep recession. Walmart did not disclose the value of the transaction but said it would record a noncash charge of roughly $4.5 billion related to the deal in the second quarter. The retailer will retain the remaining 20 percent stake in Walmart Brazil. Shares in Walmart rose more than 2 percent, with analysts saying the deal allows the company to focus on more promising markets. Two people involved in the deal said that the charge is close to the value of the Brazilian unit on Walmart's books, meaning the deal value was close to zero. The sources declined to specify the exact value of the deal and one of the sources said the final value of liabilities was not yet determined.Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the retailer will not receive payment for the unit but could receive up to $250 million from Advent based on the unit's performance. Walmart does not disclose detailed financial statements for Brazil. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is trying to catch up with competitors ranging from grocer Aldi Inc to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in key markets. Walmart's underperforming international business made up less than one-quarter of total revenue of $500.3 billion in fiscal 2018.In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run the international unit.Walmart recently sold a majority stake in its UK arm ASDA to J  Sainsbury  Plc (L:SBRY) and paid $16 billion for a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.Steven Roorda, portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors and holds Walmart shares, said the retailer has struggled outside North America and ""CEO McMillon (is) picking markets that he thinks he can scale and win in."" The move is credit positive as it allows Walmart to make investments in places that have more long-term potential, said Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea.Walmart had been looking for buyers for its Brazilian business and sounded out possible investors last year but received no interest from rival retailers, according to a source. Reuters had reported in January that Walmart was shopping its Brazilian unit to private equity firm Advent and others.In March, Reuters reported that in the due diligence process potential buyers estimated Walmart owes up to $3 billion in back taxes to state governments in Brazil, potentially adding to pressure for a discount sale. Walmart entered Brazil in 1995 and had grown into the country's third-largest retailer following two major acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 and a period of rapid store expansion that came to a halt in 2013. It operates 471 stores in Brazil, according to the company's local website. The Brazilian unit reported sales of more than $25 billion Brazilian real ($6.68 billion) in 2017. Walmart has posted operating losses in Brazil for seven straight years after the aggressive, decade-long expansion left it with poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices. (http://reut.rs/2DWNOtp)A source with knowledge of the deal said Walmart's operations in Brazil had not improved over the last two years, which coincided with the country's harshest recession in decades. Walmart's brand Maxxi has been underperforming the Atacadão SA (SA:CRFB3) division of  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) and GPA SA (SA:PCAR4) unit Assaí. CASH AND CARRY One of the sources, who requested anonymity because details of the transaction have not all been made public, said Advent is expected to invest mainly in the cash-and-carry business, where big box stores sell groceries and other staples in bulk quantities.That format has soared in popularity during Brazil's recent recession, with stores acting as a wholesaler but also attracting bargain-hunting consumers. The deal includes a commitment from the buyout firm to invest in the business in coming years, the source said, giving Walmart potential upside from its remaining stake. ""We plan to invest in the business, work with the Walmart Brazil management team ... to create a more agile and modern company,"" Patrice Etlin, a managing partner at Advent International in Brazil said in a statement. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and the retailer expects it to close later this year.A significant portion of the expected $4.5 billion net loss will be due to foreign currency translation losses, and the final loss could fluctuate significantly due to changes in forex rates up to the closing date, the retailer said. The retailer expects no material impact to earnings per share in the current fiscal year and a slight positive impact next fiscal year. Walmart was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Advent was advised by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Euro Latina Finance. Law firms in the deal were Skadden, Mattos Filho, Veiga Filho, Marrey e Quiroga Advogados and Saiani & Saglietti.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

108,"Jun 04, 2018 10:20AM ET",Carrefour sees China as testing ground for new retail methods,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which opened its first high-tech store in Shanghai last month in partnership with tech giant Tencent (HK:0700), sees China as the ideal location to develop new methods for attracting shoppers.More such stores were on the cards in China, including two in Shenzhen in the coming months, Thierry Garnier, Carrefour Executive Director for Asia, told Reuters.Europe's largest retailer was ""very positive"" on the market in China, where with the help of Tencent it plans to use facial recognition technology to help make the check-out process quicker.""We consider the Chinese market as a true laboratory that can inspire the rest of the group,"" Garnier said in a telephone interview.The company launched the ""Carrefour Le Marche"" store in the center of Shanghai on May 20, featuring functions such as cashierless checkouts supported by Tencent's popular social media app WeChat.""We are going to open two more ""Carrefour Le Marche"" stores in the coming months in Shenzhen. We are convinced this is a growth format for the future in China,"" Garnier said.The store, spread over two floors totaling 4,335 square meters -- only half the size of a regular Carrefour hypermarket -- is the fruit of a partnership sealed in January 2018 when Carrefour unveiled global plans to invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in digital commerce by 2022.At the time, Carrefour also announced the potential acquisition of a stake in Carrefour China by Tencent, and Yonghui, a retailer specialized in fresh food and small formats.This investment has yet to be finalised.SEEKING CHINESE REVIVALFor Carrefour, the partnership with Tencent is the latest step in its attempts to stem a decline in sales in China amid competition from local rivals and a buoyant online market.Tencent itself is in a race with  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to boost their reach online and in brick-and-mortar stores in China.Alibaba's Hema supermarket chain in China is already a test bed for the e-commerce firm's move into traditional retail, where mobile phones are used to order, pay and get information about items, the so-called ""New Retail"" strategy.Carrefour has been trying to reposition itself in China, where it makes 5 percent of group sales, having previously been overly focused on large hypermarkets. Carrefour sales were still down 6.6 percent year-on-year in the first quarter 2018.The new store features 25,000 products mostly in food, 20 percent imported products, as well as cosmetics and fashion products. It offers free home delivery service within three km for any purchases in the store over 188 yuan ($29), in-house cooking services and nine self checkouts.""What is the role of the store in a world as digital as China, with such strong growth of e-commerce? Our answer is that it's firstly a place to spend (quality) time,"" Garnier said.Chinese shoppers will be able to create a Carrefour account before they enter the store and link it to their WeChat profile and pay with just a face scan, or use WeChat to pay online.With more than 1 billion users, WeChat is China's most popular messenger-to-payment app.Carrefour, which opened its first store in China in 1995, operated 220 hypermarkets and 39 Easy convenience stores in the country, generating sales of 4.619 billion euros in 2017."

112,"May 24, 2018 05:52AM ET",Argentines brace for crisis as nation again seeks IMF help,nan,"By Eliana RaszewskiBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Maria Florencia Humano opened a clothing store in 2016, convinced that Argentina’s long history of economic crises had ended under pro-business President Mauricio Macri.She will shutter it later this month, unable to make rent or loan payments. Soaring interest rates and a plunging currency have upended her dream and returned Argentina to a familiar place: asking the International Monetary Fund for a lifeline.Humano’s decision comes just weeks after a somber Macri announced in a televised May 8 speech that Argentina would start talks with the IMF. He is seeking a credit line worth at least $19.7 billion to fund the government through the end of his first term in late 2019.The unexpected move surprised investors and stoked Argentines' fears of a repeat of the nation’s devastating 2001-2002 economic collapse. Many here blame IMF-imposed austerity measures for worsening that crisis, which impoverished millions and turned Argentina into a global pariah after the government defaulted on a record $100 billion in debt.Word of a potential bailout sent thousands of angry Argentines into the streets this month, some with signs declaring “enough of the IMF.”As recently as a few months ago, analysts were hailing Argentina as an emerging-market success story. Now some are predicting recession. Macri's popularity has plummeted. Supporters such as business owner Humano say they feel swindled.“I voted for him. I made a bet and believed in him,"" said Humano, 46, who recently moved in with her sister to save money. ""Now I don’t believe anyone.""SHOW OF SWAGGERIt was not supposed to be this way. Macri, a business tycoon, rose to power in 2015 vowing to end capital controls and reincorporate Argentina into the global economy.He settled with the nation’s remaining creditors and vowed to unwind big-spending policies of his populist predecessor, Cristina Fernandez. The economy grew and unemployment fell. In a show of swagger, Argentina last year issued $2.75 billion of dollar-denominated bonds with a 100-year maturity; investors snapped them up.Macri’s free-market credentials earned him a 2017 invitation to the White House to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, who just last week on Twitter hailed the Argentine leader’s ""vision for transforming his country's economy.""But economists say Macri badly damaged his credibility in December when his administration weakened tough inflation targets. The central bank followed with a January rate cut to goose growth, even as consumer prices kept galloping.Rising U.S. interest rates did not help. Argentina is saddled with more than $320 billion in external debt, equivalent to 57.1 percent of GDP, much of it denominated in dollars. Jittery investors hit the exits. The peso swooned. The central bank sold $10 billion in reserves trying to prop up the peso, forcing Macri to seek assistance from the IMF.Marcos Pena, Macri's cabinet chief, said this week that changing the inflation targets ""may have damaged the perception of an autonomous central bank.""Macri, meanwhile, has defended his quick outreach to the IMF as a way to head off a crisis like those of the past. Market response has generally been positive. After shedding a quarter of its value this year, the peso has stabilized at around 25 per dollar.Still, the fallout is hitting Argentina’s economy hard. The central bank has hiked its benchmark rate to 40 percent, the highest in the world. Even so, inflation is still running at an annual rate of around 25 percent.Businesses are already hunkering down. French Supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which employs 19,000 people in Argentina, said last month it will lay off an unspecified number of workers as part of a “crisis prevention plan.""Small businesses, too, are preparing for the worst, said Eduardo Fernandez, head of APYME, which represents about 10,000 small firms nationwide. The group says Argentina's return to the IMF represents a failure of Macri’s economic policies, which are now clobbering mom-and-pop operators.""With this rate increase we can't request credit, we are in a very difficult situation,"" Fernandez said.A few consultancies, including London-based Capital Economics, predict high interest rates will tip Argentina into a recession this year.DOLLARS IN MATTRESSESThat remains to be seen. Still, economic cracks are showing. Retail sales contracted 3 percent in April as Argentine consumers curbed spending due to the shaky peso. Consumer confidence fell 8.5 percent in April from March and 13.5 percent from a year ago to its lowest level in four years, according to an index from Torcuato Di Tella University in Buenos Aires.Some nervous Argentines have returned to an old habit of hiding greenbacks under their mattresses. Dollar deposits in Argentine banks fell 2 percent between April 27 and May 14, according to Reuters data .Dollar-denominated accounts are a popular hedge against inflation in Argentina. But the government froze these instruments during the 2001-2002 crisis, forcing millions of savers to accept devalued pesos instead. Some are not taking any chances this time around.Fabian Castillo, owner of a Buenos Aires shoe factory, is holding out hope the peso will recover some value. Still, he is struggling mightily with soaring prices for rent, utilities, labor, leather and glue. Meanwhile, cautious consumers are paring extras from their budgets, including his wares.""Anyone selling perfume, clothes or shoes is having a hard time getting to the end of the month,"" Castillo said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

113,"May 14, 2018 06:20PM ET",Reeling peso to boost some Argentine companies despite debt woes,nan,"By Luc CohenBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - While many Argentines fret about how a plunging peso may wreak havoc on the economy, some of the country's biggest export-focused companies stand to win big from a weaker currency, according to a review of earnings calls, regulatory filings and recent public comments.A more than 25 percent rout in the peso against the dollar <ARS=RASL> this year has spurred deep concerns over Argentina's finances, driving President Mauricio Macri to negotiate a lifeline with the International Monetary Fund last week.But a currency at all-time lows has also provided relief to exporters who have complained about the so-called 'exchange rate delay,' or a peso they believe was artificially strong, since Macri took office in December 2015.""I care a lot about exports - I have a new factory, I need to export,"" Cristiano Rattazzi, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Argentina, said in a television interview before meeting with Macri and other businessmen on Friday. He added that 26 pesos per dollar - or another 4 percent below the all-time low hit by the currency on Monday - would be a fair exchange rate.After Macri let the peso float early in his term, portfolio investment flowed in and Argentines repatriated funds stashed abroad due to high interest rates on public debt and optimism about market-friendly reforms. That kept the peso strong despite inflation of around 40 percent in 2016 and 25 percent in 2017.The strong currency was a problem for companies like Buenos Aires-based IT services company  Globant  SA (LU:GLOB), whose Chief Executive Martin Migoya also attended the Friday meeting at Macri's residence.The company has 37 percent of its workforce in Argentina and pays in pesos at wages that rise with inflation. But it earns most of its revenue in foreign currency from clients in the United States and elsewhere in Latin America.Globant said in an April filing that a stronger dollar ""could result in favorable variations in our operating margins.""For conglomerate Corporacion America, whose billionaire owner Eduardo Eurnekian attended the meeting, the devaluation could come as a relief for its airport unit (N:CAAP), which recently debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.""Any depreciation in the value of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar may increase our cash flows,"" the company wrote in an April 27 filing, noting that air tickets in the region are denominated in U.S. dollars.Though not primarily an exporter, state-owned oil company YPF SA (BA:YPFD) also told investors on a conference call last week that the devaluation would help bring down costs and lower the debt burden.In a Monday report, ratings agency Moody's said YPF and companies like  Telecom  Argentina (BA:TEC2) and cement producer Holcim (BA:HARG) were exposed to the depreciation due to large foreign currency debt. But Moody's also said the companies keep much of their cash in foreign currencies, giving them ""natural hedges.""RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS PRESSUREDTo be sure, the financial turmoil of recent weeks holds risks for large swaths of Argentina's economy. A weaker peso makes it more difficult for the central government and provinces to meet foreign currency debt obligations, and the central bank has warned that it could lead to more inflation.That would come as the country's retailers and manufacturers who produce goods for the domestic market are already struggling with consumer price hikes and growing competition from imports, as Macri has opened trade.Last month, supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said it would offer voluntary buyouts to workers in Argentina to stem three years of losses, while more than 60,000 jobs in the industrial sector have been lost since Macri took office.The Treasury Ministry's announcement last week that it would reduce infrastructure spending by 30 billion pesos was likely to hit the booming construction sector and the cement and steel producers that supply it.Higher interest rates after the central bank hiked the policy rate to 40 percent were likely to reduce credit demand and hurt banks such as Banco Hipotecario (BA:BHI), Banco  Macro  (BA:BMA) and Grupo Financiero Galicia (BA:GFG), according to a Monday report by Exotix Capital.Yet companies more focused on exports have long said they were hurt by a strong peso, which contributed to the country's $8.5 billion trade deficit last year.Eduardo Buzzi, former head of a farmers' group in the world's top exporter of soymeal and soyoil, said the weaker exchange rate would benefit the country's key agriculture sector.""Farmers have always done better at a higher exchange rate,"" Buzzi said in a weekend interview with local radio."

120,"Apr 05, 2018 01:01PM ET",France says university exams to take place despite protests,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - End-of year university exams will be held in France despite students blockading some campuses, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Thursday as young people joined a wave of demonstrations against proposed economic reforms. French unions launched three months of rolling work stoppages on Tuesday, crippling rail services, in what is shaping up as the toughest challenge yet to President Emmanuel Macron's push for liberalization of the economy.Students opposing a reform that allows the most pressed universities to select students on merit have blocked three universities and disrupted eight others, the government said.In the rue de Tolbiac branch of Paris 1 university, students have been blocking access for several days, piling up tables and chairs to control who is coming in, setting up communal kitchen and dormitories and organizing non-curriculum classes.""There is, in these blockages, a lot of violence,"" Prime Minister Philippe told France Inter radio. Asked if exams would still take place in good conditions, he replied: ""Obviously.""Currently, students who pass high school exams have the right to go to university in their home area. But this has led to popular subjects such as law and psychology being heavily oversubscribed and prompted the introduction of an unpopular lottery system where demand is highest.The lottery system would be scrapped under reforms with the most in-demand universities allowed to choose students on merit.""The government seems to be determined, but so are we,"" said Franco-Italian student Cosimo, who declined to give his full name, like all other students interviewed within the premises of the blockaded university, decorated with posters of a ""Free Tolbiac"" recalling the May 1968 uprising in France. ""Our core demand is that the government scrap the university reform. But we're also trying to see how to link our battles with others as Macron is targeting a lot of people these days: rail workers, garbage collectors and others.""Most French university exams are held in late April and May.It will be worrying for the Macron government if there is any fusion of the various protests springing up in France, including lower-profile disputes over nursing home workers or job losses at the  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) supermarket chain.Students, in particular, have forced past governments into policy u-turns with protracted protests and blockades. The main student union Fage opposes the blockades and its chief Jimmy Losfeld told French media that some of the student protesters had threatened Fage members.The University of Grenoble filed a complaint after what it said was theft of materials and damage to university buildings. Other universities affected by the blockages are Montpellier, Toulouse and Nantes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and  Casino  were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino's local appliance and electronics chain  Via Varejo SA  (SA:VVAR3).Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.Amazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (L:MRW), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.Asked if the partnership paved the way to other deals with Amazon, Schultz said: ""We do not discuss the future.""Monoprix is one of France's best-known store chains, with a network of nearly 800 upmarket stores in more than 250 cities. It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.""We consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,"" Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a ""profitable"" one for Monoprix.COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEALCasino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (L:OCDO), signed last year.The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings. Carrefour  (PA:CARR) announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment. Leclerc, France's biggest food retailer by market share, privately held operator Systeme U and Casino have all been linked in recent months with Amazon, which has steadily been building its presence in France. Leclerc launched its own home delivery service in Paris on Monday.""Since the deal with Ocado will not start working until 2019, Casino needs to protect Monoprix from Leclerc, which has started home delivery in Paris,"" wrote Kepler Cheuvreux analysts.($1 = 0.8019 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Together, they submitted 68 patent applications related to the technology.The second biggest Chinese entity to file blockchain patents was  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) with 43 to its name.One of the bank’s branches — the digital currency research institute — has the ambitious goal of establishing a cryptocurrency ecosystem, director Yao Qian said during a talk he gave at the end of last year.If this means that the bank wishes to issue its own cryptocurrency, it could also explain why the Chinese state was adamant about clamping down on the free trade of Bitcoin and its ilk.Aside from its digital currency ambitions, China’s central bank has yet to give any indication of what it plans to do with all the patents filed last year.The most notable recent projects, however, come from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), both of which have established their own blockchain-based frameworks to enhance transparency and food safety for their customers.In both instances, customers in select countries will be able to use their smartphones to find the source of their food as they are browsing.The information includes where the food was harvested, transported, and handled.The fact that the PBOC filed so many patents throughout 2017 suggests that it has major plans and projects that may put blockchain technology into practice across many areas of China’s economy and industries."

Tackling the lucrative Paris market is its next frontier for expansion and Chief Executive Michel-Edouard Leclerc said it will take three years to establish a solid foothold in the city.The home delivery service launches on March 26 and the group hopes to open about 15 click-and-collect stores in Paris to pick up goods ordered online, and 40-50 delivery points, Leclerc told Reuters.Leclerc currently has no stores in Paris, but in a challenge to domestic rivals  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Casino, plans to open a hypermarket in 2020 near Montparnasse train station and possibly more hypermarkets in the capital.""Leclerc lands in Paris the multi-channel way.

133,"Feb 26, 2018 01:20PM ET",Visa to defend tourists' card fees at EU antitrust hearing,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa (N:V) will on Tuesday try to fend off European Union antitrust charges that it subjects foreign tourists to excessive fees when they use their cards in the EU, people familiar with the matter said.The world's largest payments network operator will present its case before senior European Commission officials and national competition officials at a two-day closed hearing, six months after charges were filed against the company. An adverse ruling could leave Visa subject to a hefty fine.The EU competition enforcer said in August last year that fees charged to retailers when they accept Visa cards issued outside the EU could raise prices for consumer goods and services.Such fees have long been a sore point with retailers, who see it as a hidden cost for consumers. The case is important for the EU, which wants to trim such costs and improve cross-border trade.""We welcome the opportunity to meet with the European Commission to outline our position regarding inter-regional interchange fees,"" Visa spokesman Richard Braham said.""Visa firmly believes that payment card transactions by international tourists are an important contributor to European economies.""The Commission declined to comment.Visa could face fines of up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.MasterCard (N:MA), which will also attend Tuesday's hearing, faces similar charges by the Commission, and it has warned it might be subject to a fine in excess of $1 billion.In July 2015, the Commission accused MasterCard of levying excessive fees on non-EU issued cards used in the bloc. It also charged that MasterCard rules prevented banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country where interchange fees may be higher.To end another EU investigation, Visa and MasterCard have capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country.Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose members include Swedish retailer Ikea [IKEA.UL], French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Spanish clothing retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), will also take part in the event.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

136,"Feb 19, 2018 04:32AM ET","Alibaba, Tencent rally troops amid $10 billion retail battle",nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's tech giants  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), worth a combined $1 trillion, are on a retail investment binge, forcing merchants to choose sides amid a battle for shoppers' digital wallets. Since the start of last year, the two companies have between them spent more than $10 billion on retail-focused deals, boosting their reach online and in brick-and-mortar stores. The aggressive drive, supported by large cash piles and soaring share prices, is part of a battle to win over consumers and store operators to the two firms' competing payment, logistics, social media and big data services. The result: fewer and fewer retailers left without allegiance to either Tencent of Alibaba. ""All of the retailers in the brick-and-mortar world are very worried. They have to take a side,"" said Jason Yu, Shanghai-based General Manager of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. ""Otherwise they are afraid they will be eaten alive in the future.""Alibaba is China's top e-commerce player and its affiliate Ant Financial leads in mobile payments. Tencent's strengths lie in social media, digital payment and gaming. It also has a major stake in the second-largest online retailer, JD.Com (O:JD). Tencent and JD.com have a growing range of allies, including French grocer  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR), which has announced a potential investment from Tencent, and U.S. retail giant Walmart (N:WMT), which has a stake in JD.com. Tencent also bought a stake in Yonghui Superstores Co Ltd (SS:601933), apparel retailers  Vipshop Holdings  Ltd (N:VIPS) and  Heilan Home  (SS:600398), mall operator Wanda Commercial, and this month snagged a strategic tie-up with grocer Bubugao. In the other corner is Alibaba, which has invested even more heavily in Suning.com (SZ:002024), Intime Retail, Sanjiang Shopping Club (SS:601116), Lianhua Supermarket (HK:0980), Wanda Film (SZ:002739) and IKEA-like home improvement store Easyhome.Key to the battle is China's nearly $13 trillion mobile payment market, where Alibaba and Tencent are going head-to-head. Alibaba took a 33 percent stake in its payment affiliate Ant Financial this month ahead of an expected mega IPO. Ant operates China's top mobile payment platform, Alipay, while Tencent's payment system on its hugely popular Weixin chat app is catching up fast. Both firms are also making a big push in cloud computing and data. ""I think for payment (the retail push) is a very critical part because it's almost a gateway,"" said Yu. Brick-and-mortar stores in China account for about 85 percent of retail sales, creating a huge lure for tech giants. ""That's the pot that Alibaba, JD.com and even Tencent want a slice of,"" Yu added. ""That's the majority of the business where they can actually look for future growth."" In return, the physical stores get access to payment systems, logistics networks and other services - not to mention the reams of data on consumers that the tech firms control. Alibaba invested $486 million this month in a retail-focused big data firm, saying the deal meant it could better ""help brick-and-mortar retailers succeed in the digital age.""GRAPHIC: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BucWshGRAPHIC: http://tmsnrt.rs/2syKYsq  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

China's second-largest e-commerce company JD.com Inc and online clothing platform Vipshop Holdings Ltd will also be among the group that plans to acquire less than 10 percent of the company for 5 billion yuan, one source said. Another 5 billion yuan would help set up an industrial investment fund to focus on deals that fit with Heilan's business, the person said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Heilan had a market value of about $8.13 billion as of Monday, when it halted shares from trading, pending deal announcements. Tencent, JD.com and Vipshop declined to comment. A Heilan spokesman was not immediately available to comment. The proposed deal, which could be announced as early as Friday, extends a recent push by Tencent, China's biggest social network and gaming company, into bricks-and-mortar retail to further compete with Alibaba. Heilan which has clothing brands such as HLA and SANCANAL, has been a long-time partner of Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall. But last month Tencent, which has a market capitalization of $563 billion, said it would invest 4.2 billion yuan for a stake in Yonghui Superstores. It is also looking to take a stake in the China business of French supermarket retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).The recent moves reflect a wider, long-running stand-off between Tencent and Alibaba, which have made competing investments in areas as diverse as bike-sharing apps, food delivery and gaming.JD.com, in which Tencent is a top-10 investor, traditionally leads against Alibaba in online retail sales of electronics and home appliance products, but lags behind in the fashion business. Tencent and JD.com last month jointly made an $863 million investment in Vipshop, in a bid to tap the country's young female shoppers and gain access to consumer and transaction data to help them compete with Alibaba's online payment platform Alipay. Jiangsu-based Heilan was set up by Zhou Jianping, one of the richest people in China's fashion industry, in 1997. It runs more than 5,000 stores, mostly in China, and recorded 12.5 billion yuan in operating income in the first three quarters last year, its website showed.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

WPP has lost about one-third of its value since the start of 2017.WPP, the industry leader, has taken the biggest hit, with leading clients such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG) cutting spending as consumers turn to more niche brands.In its most recent earnings conference call, P&G said it aimed to save another $400 million in agency and production costs, on top of the $750 million it had already saved. P&G did not give any time frame for the cost savings goal.""We view this as a trend, not a one-off,"" BAML added, saying it expected the agencies' organic growth to flatten out by 2020.The analysts believe consulting companies, such as Accenture (N:ACN), Deloitte or  IBM  (N:IBM) will start to have a ""bigger impact from 2018 onwards, leading ad agencies to lose market share to the consultancies."" ""The lucrative media planning/buying space will start being disrupted by consultancies, helped by the rise of AI and their edge in data analytics.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

145,"Jan 23, 2018 10:20AM ET",Wal-Mart may have to unload stake in Brazilian unit at discount,nan,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Nandita BoseSAO PAULO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) is looking to sell part of its operations in Brazil, where it has struggled for a decade, yet missteps by the U.S. retail giant have narrowed the field of potential buyers and could lower the value of any deal.The world's largest retailer is shopping a major stake in its Walmart Brasil Ltda unit to buyout firms with Latin American experience, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.Wal-Mart's operating losses in Brazil, which began in 2009, will likely attract investors with turnaround plans and modest valuations in mind, according to one of the sources, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the talks.The company reported almost 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) of Brazilian revenue from about 500 stores in 2016, but poorly integrated acquisitions, labor disputes and headwinds from Brazil's economic downturn have hurt its bottom line. (http://reut.rs/2DWNOtp)Making matters worse, some stores Wal-Mart opened during Brazil's economic boom a decade ago are poorly located and have little appeal to rivals. Several retailers passed up the chance last year to make an offer on them, the same source said.To lure buyers with the prospect of robust online growth, Wal-Mart combined its local e-commerce unit with its Brazilian brick-and-mortar operations in December, according to two people with knowledge of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's plans.The company declined to comment on the talks with buyout firms or its problems in the Brazilian market.Investors were largely unsurprised by reports of Wal-Mart shopping a stake in the Brazilian unit. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon announced in 2016 that he was planning to review global operations.""If they have decided to pull out of Brazil after being there for as long as they have, they have realized their model is not working,"" said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns shares of Wal-Mart.""I can definitely see Wal-Mart making similar decisions about other international businesses going forward,"" he added. Wal-Mart shares closed higher on Monday but gave back some of those gains on Tuesday.FOCUSING ELSEWHEREWal-Mart's struggles in Brazil are a far cry from its performance in Mexico, the company's largest market outside the United States. Wal-Mart de Mexico SA de CV (MX:WALMEX) is Mexico's No. 1 retailer.That success is due to Wal-Mart's decision to partner with Mexican retailer Cifra to launch the operation in the 1990s as well as help from local executives who have kept it attuned to the market, according to Carlos Bernal, an analyst with brokerage Actinver in Mexico.In contrast, Wal-Mart struggled to gain traction from the $1 billion it spent in 2004-2005 on a patchwork of acquisitions in northeast and southern Brazil, two regions with stark economic, geographic and cultural differences.Poor real estate investment decisions, incompatible computer systems and unforeseen tax and labor costs added to the difficulties integrating the disparate network of stores, dragging on the Brazilian unit's earnings for years. Analysts and former executives in Brazil said one of Wal-Mart's biggest setbacks in Brazil was losing a bidding match for cash-and-carry wholesaler Atacadão to rival  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR), which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.Atacadão and rival Assaí, which was acquired in the same year by French retailer Casino's (PA:CASP) subsidiary GPA (SA:PCAR4), went on to dominate the booming cash-and-carry segment, delivering profits even during the country's recent recession. Wal-Mart's entry into the segment was largely a flop.Wal-Mart now looks ready to focus elsewhere while retaining what may be a more passive interest in Brazil, said one of the sources familiar with the conversations between the company and private equity firms.The source added that the details of a partnership have not been clearly established.""They still want to retain a stake there so they can be around and not take attention away from what they must focus on,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""This does fit into the strategy that Doug McMillon laid out a couple of years ago. Wal-Mart is focusing more domestically where they have a dominant share.""One of the funds that Wal-Mart has spoken to, according to one source, is Acon Investments LLC, which bought regional Brazilian retailer GBarbosa in 2005 and resold it two years later to Chile's  Cencosud  SA (SN:CEN).Another is Advent International Corp, which invested in Brazilian apparel retailer Restoque Comercio e Confeccoes de Roupas SA (SA:LLIS3) and home improvement chain Quero Quero. A third, GP Investments Ltd , has a stake in sporting goods retailer Lojas Centauro, which recently filed for a Brazilian initial public offering.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

146,"Jan 23, 2018 05:10AM ET","Carrefour steps up e-commerce push, chases deal in China",nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - Carrefour's (PA:CARR) new chief executive promised to slash costs, step up e-commerce investment in the face of competition from Amazon (O:AMZN) and open up  Carrefour  China to local investors, sending its shares higher on Tuesday. Alexandre Bompard, at the helm only since July and tasked with boosting cash flow, promised to invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in digital commerce by 2022, six times its current investment, as Carrefour plays catch-up in online retail.Under pressure to lift profits, Bompard also announced cost savings of 2 billion euros by 2020, including a voluntary redundancy plan for 2,400 employees at its French head office.""We must revamp our model by simplifying our organization, opening ourselves up to partnerships, improving our operational efficiency... (and) building an efficient omnichannel model,"" Bompard said in a statement.Carrefour shares leapt 6.3 percent, the biggest one-day gain since October 2015, as investors cheered the five-year strategic plan's focus on investing in online and competitiveness.Carrefour has spent years trying to reduce its reliance on hypermarkets, particularly in France, a model that once drove its bricks-and-mortar retail business but which has come under crushing pressure from digital commerce and the rise of online giants such as Amazon (O:AMZN).Former Fnac executive Bompard unveiled the plan after Carrefour said last week that its 2017 operating profit could fall by 15 percent amid weak sales. This marked its second profit warning in six months.The retailer, the world's largest after Wal-Mart (N:WMT), with more than 380,000 employees, said it was targeting a 20 percent market share in food e-commerce in France by 2022.Carrefour's online sales accounted for just 1.7 percent of its total French food sales in 2016, while more digital-savvy rival Leclerc managed 8 percent, according to Bernstein analysts. CHINA PARTNERSHIPIn China, Carrefour remains loss-making amid fierce competition from local players and a buoyant online market.In response, Bompard announced the possible acquisition of a stake in Carrefour China by Internet giant Tencent (HK:0700) and local retailer Yonghui (SS:601933). Carrefour would remain the largest shareholder of Carrefour China.""While some will be disappointed not to see an outright sale of China, these are both strong strategic partners and we would argue give the group the best possible ability to turn the business around,"" brokerage Bernstein said in a briefing note.Amazon's acquisition of U.S. food retail chain Whole Foods has fueled speculation that the U.S. online group is looking to crack the European market next. It has held exploratory talks with some of Carrefour's rivals, the companies have confirmed. Carrefour's five-year plan was welcomed by investors and analysts who had wanted the retailer to make further moves into e-commerce after it acquired a stake in online fashion retailer Showroomprive.com (PA:SRPG) this month. It is the largest private sector employer in France, where its weak performance have weighed on group profitability and performance of its shares. France accounts for 44 percent of the operating profits.Targeting 1 million additional fresh food customers by 2022, Carrefour said it would accelerate growth in supermarkets and convenience stores and improving the efficiency of its hypermarkets, including by reducing sales areas.No hypermarket closures were planned, it said.Bompard's plan to shed 2,400 jobs out of a total French HQ workforce of 10,500 could set the chief executive on a collision course with France's muscular trade unions, including Force Ouvriere, which has already called for a walkout on Feb. 8. Britain's supermarket group  Tesco  (L:TSCO) said on Monday it will cut a net 800 jobs from its UK business to simplify operations and achieve targeted cost savings.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The pressure on the UK high street may indeed make this the time for Whitbread to at least look at its options.

The STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.3 percent at 0947 GMT with tech stocks (SX8P) up 0.5 percent but financials, industrials and healthcare shares also adding points to the pan-European index.Sylvain Goyon, an equity strategist at France's Natixis, said the recent sell-off in technological shares was not driven by a change in the fundamentals of the sector and was not likely to be longlasting.""The key drivers of the industry are still there"", he said.He said a number of investors had just decided, as year-end neared, to cash in some profits from tech stocks, which have outperformed the market. They have reinvested in cheaper financial shares, which are set to benefit from the U.S. tax cuts plan.Oil and gas stocks (SXEP) which had weighed overnight on indices in the United States and Asia were also slightly in positive territory, up 0.2 percent after oil prices gradually edged up.Shares in Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) plunged more than 30 percent, extending dramatic losses of over 60 percent suffered during the previous session after the South African retailer revealed accounting irregularities and its chief executive quit.In London, shares in  Ladbrokes  Coral (L:LCL) surged 28 percent after Bookmaker GVC Holdings (L:GVC) said it had offered up to 3.9 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) to create a betting giant.

167,"Nov 29, 2017 08:00AM ET",Casino-Ocado deal could push Carrefour into Amazon's arms,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) could be under pressure to do a deal with the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN), after a deal between its French rival and a British online specialist threatened to leave it trailing behind in e-commerce.Alexandre Bompard took the helm at Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), in July. Its online sales lag rivals and in August the company issued a profit warning. Bompard is preparing to unveil his turnaround plan.French rival Casino on Tuesday agreed to use British online retailer Ocado's e-commerce platform to expand its e-commerce grocery business in a deal that analysts say will allow Casino to outpace domestic rivals.""Casino is taking a key technological advantage in France and will drive Auchan and Carrefour to react ... The read across for Carrefour implies an alliance with a partner which can only be Amazon,"" Natixis analysts said in a note.Analysts think it is only a matter of time before Amazon makes either a bid for a French retailer, or forms partnerships along the lines of what it has established in Britain and Germany, or becomes a provider of logistics and delivery services. France's grocery market is worth $230 billion a year.""Such a deal would be well received by the market and even more so if its announcement came on Jan. 23 during Mr Bompard's group's strategic review,"" Natixis said.Carrefour declined to comment on the review.By 1037 GMT Carrefour shares were up 2.38 percent and leading CAC-40 (FCHI) gainers while Casino shares were up 2.41 percent, outperforming the European retail sector (SXRP).The Casino-Ocado deal comes as French brick and mortar retailers feel the heat from Amazon, whose acquisition of U.S. upmarket food retail chain Whole Foods, has triggered speculation the online giant is looking to crack the European grocery market next.Last month, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, the head of French retailer Leclerc, which recently overtook Carrefour to become France's largest grocer, said he had talked with Amazon.""Yes, we have been approached by Amazon. They could -- why not? -- be our logistics partner,"" he told Reuters on October 4.Meanwhile, Carrefour is working on a turnaround to stem its sliding market share at home, now at 20 percent.Having been slow to embrace digital, in part due to its focus on the large hypermarket format, it is ramping up investment.The online operation accounted for just 1.7 percent of Carrefour's total French food retail sales of over 30 billion euros last year, while more digital-savvy rival Leclerc managed 8 percent, according to Bernstein analysts.Bompard told analysts in August that there had been an acceleration of partnerships between bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce and that ""in such a context Carrefour needs to accelerate the digital transformation and become truly omni-channel to compete in the new retail landscape.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Asked if this would be in the January presentation, he said: ""Yes."" ""Until now, the only Western retailers to have successfully established themselves in this country have done so via partnerships with local retailers, like Auchan with Sun Art Retail,"" Bryan Garnier analysts said in a research note.""A combination of offline and online is also an option, as seen with the recent agreements between Wal-Mart and JD.com ... and Auchan and Alibaba ... Failing the rapid conclusion of such a partnership, a decision could be taken at Carrefour to sell assets in China,"" they added.On Monday, Alibaba announced a HK$22.4 billion ($2.9 billion) investment in a stake in Sun Art, China's top hypermarket operator, in which Auchan also has the biggest stake.Carrefour has been trying to reposition in China, where it makes 5 percent of group sales, having been too focused on large hypermarkets there. It has been expanding into e-commerce and convenience stores and opening logistics centers to cut costs. Former CEO Georges Plassat repeatedly said Carrefour would stay in China and did not rule out a deal with a local partner, although nothing materialized.RIVALS HAVE CHANGED TACTICSMeanwhile, rivals have taken action.In 2013, Britain's  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) gave up on cracking China alone, folding its unprofitable business there into a state run company as a minority partner.In 2016, Wal-Mart sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce firm, Auchan's partnership with Alibaba risks further relegating Carrefour to the sidelines in China, analysts said.""Sun Art is the largest grocery retailer in China and often considered as the one with the best operations and the best integration within the local culture,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.""After a deal with Sun Art, there seems to be little incremental value in doing a deal with Carrefour for Alibaba.

172,"Nov 20, 2017 08:00AM ET",Retailer Auchan says it has not been approached by Amazon in Europe,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French retailer Auchan [AUCH.UL] said on Monday it had not been approached by E-commerce giant Amazon (O:AMZN) about deals or partnerships in Europe, with speculation still rife that Amazon may be eyeing European transactions.Auchan Retail head Wilhelm Hubner also told journalists that co-operation between Auchan and online giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) would focus on China for now, after Alibaba announced a deal with Auchan in China.Amazon's $13.7 billion takeover of U.S. retail chain Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) this year sparked speculation that it might be examining further tie-ups in Europe, possibly involving logistics partnerships with French supermarket operators.""No. We have not been approached by Amazon on Europe or on any country. I consider that Amazon has a very industrial approach of commerce, not a very humanized one. This is not our vision and so we could not have started discussions,"" said Hubner, regarding the speculation concerning Amazon.Hubner was speaking after Alibaba announced a HK$22.4 billion ($2.9 billion) investment for a major stake in China's top hypermart operator, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd (HK:6808), as part of a wider push into offline retail.As part of an alliance with Sun Art's top shareholders Auchan Retail and Taiwanese conglomerate Ruentex Group, Alibaba would buy the stake from Ruentex while Auchan Retail would boost its own stake.""This partnership is for China and the priority is to make it a success. The future will tell if there will be other partnerships (with Alibaba) in other countries,"" said Hubner.Hubner, however, added Alibaba was keen on sourcing French, Italian and Spanish products through Auchan for its digital platforms and for the Chinese market.Auchan has been present in China since 1998. The country is its second-largest market, making around 30 percent of Auchan Retail's annual sales of 52 billion euros ($61 billion).Last month, French supermarket operator Leclerc said it had been approached by Amazon over a possible logistics partnership, while there has been speculation Amazon may eye deals with rivals  Casino  (PA:CASP) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).($1 = 0.8487 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

175,"Nov 09, 2017 11:11AM ET",Kenya's Nakumatt supermarket chain foiled by explosive growth,nan,"By Duncan MiririNAIROBI (Reuters) - The implosion of a family-owned Kenyan mattress shop that grew to become East Africa's biggest supermarket chain is a cautionary tale about trying to grow too far, too fast to cash in on the rapid growth of the country's middle class.    Kenya's High Court will rule on Nov. 16 on Nakumatt Supermarkets' petition for protection from creditors to whom it owes more than $300 million. Thousands of jobs are at stake, and France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and South Africa's Shoprite (J:SHPJ) are already moving to fill the gap. It's an ignominious fall - with more than 60 outlets and 1,500 suppliers, turnover at the company once equaled nearly one percent of Kenyan GDP. Former employees, suppliers, fellow business people and private equity investors paint a picture of a firm whose management capacity did not keep up with its prodigious growth.""It's a tragedy that needn't have happened,"" said Andrew Dixon, who was hired in a scramble to revamp management. A former executive at  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) and Burt's Bees, Dixon quit as chief marketing officer last month and this week took a job with Uchumi, another struggling Kenyan chain.A fatal fire in one store, the demolition of another and an attack by militant Islamists on their flagship Westgate outlet in 2013 created a ""perfect storm"" of disasters for Nakumatt, Dixon told Reuters. Outdated management practices exacerbated other problems like endemic theft of cash and stock, he said.""The business outgrew the management capacity,"" said another Nairobi businessman familiar with the company, asking not to be named so that he could speak candidly. He pointed to a balance sheet loaded with short-term debt, problems paying suppliers and outdated IT systems.Answering questions through his publicist, Managing Director Atul Shah, of the founding Shah family, rejected the idea that management was not modernised fast enough. Over the past decade, when the business was thriving, the only family member of management was Shah himself, he pointed out.He acknowledged that theft of 10-15 percent of goods or stock did not measure up well against a global average of 2-3 percent, and investment in a modern warehouse management system from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) two years ago came too late.But he said the chain’s main undoing was the significant costs of a 2010 expansion plan that assumed sustained Kenyan economic growth of more than 10 percent per year. The chain went from 36 shops in 2011 to a peak of 62 in 2016. ""By now we would be talking about over 100 branches. In terms of revenue, a significant growth was also expected which never materialized but even if it didn't materialize, investments and related financing were undertaken,"" the publicist's statement said. Shah wants to restructure Nakumatt so it can re-emerge as a leaner chain, according to public court documents.The court's protection ""is reasonably likely to achieve a better outcome for the company’s creditors as a whole and ensure continuity of the business ... as opposed to the drastic action of winding up the company,"" Shah said in the documents.WELCOMING ELEPHANTSFor more than two decades, Nakumatt's blue-and-white signage and large bronze elephant statues enticed well-heeled Kenyans into its shops to buy anything from imported meat to the latest flatscreen TV sets. Atul Shah's father started Nakumatt in the Rift Valley town of Nakuru. The family still owns the bulk of Nakumatt shares.Atul, the fourth child, moved to the United States in his early twenties and worked on the shop floor at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). He came back to open the first Nakumatt superstore in Nairobi in 1992.While the scale and ambition of the business expanded, many aspects of the way it was managed remained the same, however. The company hired three top managers from outside the company, including Dixon, only this year. But it was too late.""Investing in family businesses can be challenging ... past success blinds them to the fact there are certain roles that require professional management,"" said Ayisi Makatiani, managing partner at private equity firm Fanisi Capital.Foreign investors could have helped overhaul management and inject cash, but despite a swarm of suitors, no deal was made. One concern for investors was the stake held by former lawmaker Harun Mwau, who was named in 2011 under the U.S. Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Act for alleged drug trafficking, which he has denied. Two sources with knowledge of potential investments said the role of Mwau in the company was the main stumbling block because they did not want to fall foul of U.S. law enforcement, who froze Mwau's U.S. assets after the designation. Nakumatt has said in the past that Mwau holds shares in the company but declined to confirm or deny it to Reuters. Mwau did not respond to Reuters calls and text messages seeking comment. ""Nobody acquiring was prepared to have him remain on the shareholder register,"" said a source involved in one transaction with a London-based fund that fell through in 2011.""They would have walked with about $110 million cash and the debt would had been taken over,"" said the source, an account backed by several other sources with knowledge of the deal, including a Nairobi fund manager and an ex-employee.Nakumatt declined to comment on the deals.CARREFOUR, SHOPRITE What happens to Nakumatt could have far-reaching effects for Kenyan retail and the wider economy, which has been expanding by more than 5 percent in recent years and is expected to grow by 5 percent this year. The World Bank designated Kenya a low-middle income country in 2014.Nakumatt has estimated in court papers that closing the chain would affect the livelihoods of more than 30,000 people, including 6,720 direct employees.Finance Minister Henry Rotich told reporters on Tuesday that while the government did not want to interfere in private businesses, it was looking at how to protect suppliers from non-payment so that debt didn't build up all along the chain. Kimani Rugendo, chairman of the Suppliers Association of Kenya with more than 2,000 members, said Nakumatt collectively owes them more than 30 billion shillings ($289.86 million).His company, Kevian Ltd, which manufactures juices, bottled waters and sauces, is owed 90 million shillings. Nakumatt declined to comment on the claim.""It is hurting the production and distribution trade,"" he said. He stopped supplying Nakumatt two months ago. Wambui Mbarire, the CEO of the retail trade association of Kenya, said Nakumatt's woes had forced suppliers to tighten their credit terms, demanding payment upfront. The big international supermarket chains sense an opportunity. Shoprite confirmed to Reuters it wants to take Nakumatt's lease in one prime shopping mall after it was kicked out last month over rent arrears.Carrefour, which opened two hypermarkets in Kenya last year through its UAE-based franchisee Majid Al Futtaim, will open a third this month in another shopping mall vacated by Nakumatt. ""The success of the stores has given us the impetus to plan a greater expansion of our footprint in Kenya,"" said Frank Moreau, the Kenya head of Majid Al Futtaim retail, adding the first two stores are among the most successful in the franchise.But Carrefour Kenya cannot fill Nakumatt's big shoes just yet, said Boris Planer, the global chief economist at Planet Retail, a global retail consultancy.Two decades of growth and peak annual turnover of $700 million would be hard to replicate anytime soon, he said. Rugendo said that he would miss the retailer if it folded, even as he counted his losses. ""It is better the devil you know than the angel you don't,"" he said with a sigh.($1 = 103.5000 Kenyan shillings)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

178,"Oct 31, 2017 12:26PM ET",Exclusive - Orange is the new bank? Telecoms giant ventures into lending,nan,"By Maya Nikolaeva, Sophie Sassard and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Telecoms giant Orange (PA:ORAN) launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25 percent of France's online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal share from established lenders with inferior technology. The launch is part of a push by the French firm to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector. It is also a test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank. ""We are targeting 2 million clients in ten years. That would represent 25 percent of the (online banking) market, but I hope we will not stop there ... and we will be the market leader in several years,"" Andre Coisne, chief executive of Orange Bank, told Reuters in an interview.Coisne has previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.Orange is starting from a small base - Coisne says it has 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch, a tiny fraction of the company's 21 million mobile clients. But the timing of its entry gives some room for optimism. In France, 793.4 million online banking e-payments were made last year according to the European Central Bank, up from 586.2 million in 2014. Consultancy Ernst & Young predicts the number of customers going online to open an account in France will surge nearly six-fold to 17 million in the next ten years. The regulatory environment is also becoming more favorable - next year new European Union rules will start to force banks to allow customer data to be made available to other companies, if the customers agree. That will help the likes of Orange to identify potential customers and offer them better deals than their current lenders. ""This is a good start,"" said Coisne, who will also face competition from telecoms rival Altice, which launches its bank in 2019. ORANGE IS THE NEW BANKOrange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past ten years under several brands, such as Orange Money and Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.It targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.Africa is the world leader in mobile banking. Around 12 percent of adults there have a mobile money account against 2 percent globally, according to a 2014 World Bank survey.Telecoms operators have long hoped to repeat their banking success in Africa and other developing markets in advanced economies, but until now have only done so by relying on partnerships with existing banks, with little success. So far most telecoms operators have sought to retain customers by offering media content such as free access to music streaming apps like Spotify or movie streaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as well as exclusive sports broadcasts.But a minority investor in Orange told Reuters that diversification through banking could prove smarter because these services are essential and sticky.""To me, it is smarter than spending millions on sport rights that expire every two or three years"", the investor said.There is no clearly successful precedent in major Western markets, which makes Orange's move so brave, said Tom Levine, global head of telecoms practice at Allen & Overy.""I hope their ambition goes beyond retaining customers through bundles because there is a real opportunity for telcos in banking to be a platform, thanks to the trust they inspire, their strong brand, and large customer base"".Orange is betting on a wide range of services - mobile, internet, TV, videos and music, and now banking - to help generate enough revenue to offset costs on infrastructure investments.""Our ambition is to offer everything, we are a complete bank,"" Coisne said.From Nov. 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings accounts. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android wallets.Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year.BANKS COUNTER ATTACKOrange is not the only new entrant. Established banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are competing with new online low-cost banks such as N26, and retailers such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Some French banking executives have expressed concern about the entry of Orange Bank into the market and the impact on profit margins.Orange is ""potentially a very important competitor"", Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Credit Agricole, said in May.Banks are making investments to increase the appeal of their services to smartphone users, while also cutting branches to keep costs down.France's BNP Paribas upgraded its mobile app this year and hired a former marketing and digital executive at  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom to head its online Hello Bank! in France, while Credit Agricole is set to announce a new online banking offer in November.If Orange meets its target of 2 million customers in the next 6 to 10 years, it would likely be at the expense of these rival online businesses. But for Orange, banking would remain a small business relative to its overall size, says Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), CEO of telecoms consulting firm Northstream.""This would only bring a very small stream of additional revenue relative to the scale of Orange,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) accelerated losses to 0.6 percent after Catalonia failed to meet a deadline set by Madrid to renounce its independence bid, setting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on course to impose direct rule on the region.Madrid's IBEX (IBEX) was down 1 percent, lagging other markets.London's FTSE (FTSE), Paris's CAC 40 (FCHI), Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) and Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) were down 0.6 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.Bank stocks (SX7P) fell back 0.7 percent as Spanish lenders came under pressure, while Spanish government bond yields rose. ""The market is going in risk-off mode"", said Pierre Martin, a senior sales trader at Saxo Bank a few minutes after the latest developments in the Spanish crisis hit the headlines. Earlier, markets had retreated only slightly, after underwhelming third quarter trading updates. Shares in advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) fell more than 6 percent after third-quarter sales were below market forecasts, while German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion (DE:KGX) was down 9.2 percent after it cut its 2017 guidance.  Unilever  (L:ULVR) fell 4.5 percent as its underlying sales growth missed analysts' consensus.Martin argued that while the initial reaction from investors seemed to be negative, it was still too early to get a clear picture of Europe's third quarter earnings season. French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) were up 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent respectively after their results.But Martin said the situation in Catalonia was likely to set the tone for the day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

184,"Oct 16, 2017 05:29AM ET",Carrefour turns to Fnac Darty again for new finance chief,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - New Carrefour (PA:CARR) boss Alexandre Bompard has turned to a former colleague from Fnac Darty to be his finance chief as he strives to revive the world's second-biggest retailer. Carrefour said on Monday that former Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC) chief financial officer Matthieu Malige, 43, would start with immediate effect, replacing Pierre Jean Sivignon, 60, who is stepping down for personal reasons.The French company's shares, which plunged in August after it warned 2017 operating profit could fall by as much as 12 percent, were up 1.8 percent in early trading, the top performer on the CAC-40 (FCHI) index of French blue-chip stocks.""Matthieu Malige and Alexandre Bompard successfully turned Fnac around .... We have been impressed by the complementary nature of this team at Fnac, where Matthieu Malige built a strong track record in managing cost-cutting, working capital, and cash,"" wrote analysts at brokerage Raymond James.""We believe, just as at Fnac back in 2011, Carrefour needs to make some progress on these three metrics,"" they added.The new Carrefour team faces a challenge to improve the performance of its French hypermarkets, a goal that has eluded several predecessors. Carrefour is up against fierce competition in France, which accounts for nearly half of group sales and 44 percent of operating profit, from online and other rivals.A union official said last month that Carrefour's options included closing some hypermarkets, turning some into franchises or introducing Sunday opening for others.Malige should know the challenges ahead of him, as he worked at Carrefour between 2003 and 2011, holding several positions including finance chief of Belgium and France.NEW TEAMHis appointment comes at a crucial time as Bompard, who joined from music, books and electricals chain Fnac Darty in July, has yet to unveil his turnaround plan.""It's a bit of a surprise, but it confirms the idea that Bompard wants a new team around him. Shareholders will want Malige to review the hypermarkets business, which is losing market share, and to accelerate Carrefour’s online strategy,"" said Benoit de Broissia, a fund manager at Paris-based Keren Finance, which owns Carrefour shares.Bompard has already made other management changes as he looks to revive the company's fortunes.Carrefour said Sivignon, who had been group finance chief since 2011, would stay on as an adviser to Bompard.""The lack of a robust and or effective capital allocation framework is one of the big reasons that Carrefour is in its difficult situation today. As a CFO, Mr. Sivignon stood over that capital allocation framework. Therefore a clean start will help convince investors that things might change for the better at Carrefour,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.Carrefour shares have fallen around 24 percent this year, underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 index (STOXX) and France's benchmark CAC-40 (FCHI), which are both up by roughly 10 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

196,"Aug 31, 2017 05:00AM ET",Carrefour plunge rattles retail stocks as Europe extends gains,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Europe's shares extended their relief bounce on Thursday but were unlikely to avoid a third straight month of losses as they entered the last trading day of an unusually turbulent August, and a profit warning from  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) sank the retail sector.The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 0.5 percent while euro zone stocks and blue-chips rose 0.6 percent, boosted by strong gains from miners and construction stocks, while the retail sector dropped 1.3 percent.Carrefour shares fell 14 percent, set for their worst daily dive in 20 years, after the French supermarket chain warned 2017 profit could fall by 12 percent and cut its sales growth target.It reported weaker than expected first-half earnings as intense competition in the retail sector weighed on margins.""Although Carrefour's weak first-half results are partly related to some external or non-recurring factors (integration of Eroski stores in Spain, change in credit regulation in Brazil), they also illustrate the group's structural challenges,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts.French peer Casino also fell more than 5 percent as investors saw similar pressures hitting it. Analysts at Jefferies said Carrefour's results forced a re-evaluation of their investment thesis.The retail index has been one of the worst-performing in Europe this year as competition and structural pressures mount.""It's been a tough time for the sector, with the more macro theme that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is slowly eating everyone's lunch, though that's not the case in Europe to the same extent as the U.S.,"" said Paul Harper, equity strategist at DNB Bank.""Another problem is that the retail sector is relatively highly priced, so there's not really much room for disappointment,"" he added. Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) shares slipped 4.1 percent after the world's second biggest spirits group said currency exchange would be a bigger weight on earnings than previously expected.Meanwhile,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), up 2.4 to 4.2 percent, helped lift the index as copper prices rose on stronger Chinese demand.Chipmakers AMS and Dialog Semiconductor rose 3.2 to 3.7 percent as the suppliers to smartphone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) benefited from increased investor enthusiasm ahead of Apple's next iPhone release, a trader said.Though banking stocks helped stoke gains on Thursday, they were headed for their worst monthly losses since June last year when Britain's vote to exit the EU roiled markets.The STOXX 600 was set to close in the red for a third month.While a global consensus has formed this year around stronger prospects for European equities, the region’s main benchmarks have slipped in the summer as company earnings were measured up against lofty expectations and a surging euro reined stocks back.""You can explain a significant chunk of the dip by the currency,"" said Paul Harper. ""Consensus earnings for the MSCI Europe peaked in mid-May and estimates started lowering in the second quarter as analysts had to mark to market their currency assumptions.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares in the Dutch supermarket, which has a strong presence on the east coast of the U.S., fell as much as 7.6 percent to their lowest level in 16 months, the biggest decline among European shares.""Amazon's price cuts add to the price pressures that already exist in the US,"" said AFS Group analyst Jauke de Jong. ""About two-thirds of Ahold's revenue stems from the U.S., so the news is quite negative as it could need to follow suit by lowering prices as well to defend its market share,"" he added.Gains among financials and energy stocks were not enough to support the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index, which was down 0.1 percent at its close, having spent the large part of the session in positive territory, while Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50) also ended 0.2 percent lower.The STOXX fell as the euro  spiked and the dollar dropped back after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen made no reference to U.S. monetary policy in her speech at the Jackson Hole symposium.Investors stayed cautious before ECB President Mario Draghi was set to deliver his speech after the market closed, even though no major new policy messages are expected.""Draghi will certainly not breathe a word about the ECB's bond purchases program, which is due to end in September,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group.Ozkardeskaya said she saw limited potential for European stocks before the ECB details plans to phase out its big bond purchase program, likely at its September meeting. ""European equity funds redeemed $231 million in the week to August 23.. hinting that some investors may prefer to turn flat before the ECB’s critical announcement,"" she said.The retail index (SXRP) fell more than 1 percent, leading sectoral fallers in the region. In the sector, French supermarkets  Casino  (PA:CASP) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) fell 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent respectively, while  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and  Sainsbury  (L:SBRY) were also lower.  Provident Financial  (L:PFG) led gainers on the STOXX, up 22.5 percent. The UK subprime lender, which has lost around half of its market value this week after a second profit warning in quick succession, said it had replaced the managing director of its beleaguered home credit business. Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) rose as much as 2 percent after saying it would evaluate any inquiries about potential tie-ups.Fiat, however, ended the session 0.7 percent lower, though it has gained nearly 16 percent this week after China's Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) said it was interested in possible deals with Fiat, sending shares in the Italian American carmaker to a fresh record high.For a graph on retail stocks click here: http://reut.rs/2gaNM9o  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He is someone who will not be easily deterred,"" said billionaire businessman Xavier Niel, who knows him well.Since taking the reins at Carrefour in June 2012, Plassat has led a recovery focused on price cuts, accelerating expansion into convenience shops and renovating stores.The 68-year-old, credited with saving Carrefour from a possible break-up, leaves a group which has progressed in most of Europe and in Brazil, its second-largest market.But a more sluggish performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has hampered the stock's performance. In March, Carrefour reported its first fall in operating profit since 2012.For some, Bompard ticks many boxes for the task ahead, with a track record of cutting costs and growing online operations - both of which could be central to reviving French hypermarkets. Shares in Fnac, which Bompard has led since January 2011, have nearly tripled in value since their stock market listing in 2013.And if radical action is needed, the avid Twitter user with a fascination for the French World War II resistance movement, will not shy away, those who know him say.""His image with the market changed with the Darty deal. He beat a large company, showing swift decision-making and daring,"" said French businessman and political adviser Alain Minc.'NO LIMITS'Arnaud Lagardere, owner of the Europe 1 radio station that Bompard headed between 2008 and 2010 and who shares with him a passion for tennis, said: ""He is very friendly but he is not naive. He is extremely resolute and if he thinks he has the right strategy, he will forge ahead, with no limits.""Such determination could be crucial when dealing with Carrefour's powerful shareholders, who include the Moulin family, owner of department store Galeries Lafayette, France's richest man Bernard Arnault, and the family of Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz.Some at Fnac Darty, however, are more critical of Bompard, disappointed that a highly paid boss is leaving with the integration of the two merged companies far from complete.""He is a man in a hurry and demanding,"" said Philippe Coutanceau, a representative of the CGT trade union. ""We will remember an astronomical remuneration, out of line with the group's size or results."" Fnac Darty shareholders on May 24 approved Bompard's pay package of 13.8 million euros for 2016.At Carrefour, Force Ouvriere union representative Dejan Terglav is cautious: ""We will judge him on his actions. He has a reputation for cutting heads. We await his strategy on hypermarkets and new technologies where Carrefour lags,""(Additional reporting Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

214,"Jun 07, 2017 02:36AM ET",Carrefour board set to nominate Bompard as new CEO: sources,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - The board of French supermarket retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is set to nominate on Monday at the latest Alexandre Bompard, chief executive of consumer electronics retailer Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC), as its chosen CEO, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.The board of Europe's largest retailer is slated to meet on Friday or Monday and an announcement could be made afterwards, one of the sources said.French newspaper Le Figaro had reported earlier on Wednesday that the Carrefour board could meet as early as Friday.Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart (N:WMT), has been searching since October for a successor to Georges Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive expires in May 2018.Bompard, 44, has led Fnac - which sells books and music - since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013.Carrefour and its major shareholders could not be immediately reached for comment, while Fnac Darty declined to comment on the matter.Carrefour shares, which had fallen to 14 euros at the time of Plassat's appointment in June 2012, more than doubled to 32 euros in April 2015 but have since fallen back.Carrefour shares are up by around 1 percent so far in 2017, underperforming an 8 percent rise on France's benchmark CAC-40 index (FCHI). The stock fell 14 percent last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

215,"Jun 03, 2017 07:40AM ET",Fnac Darty's Bompard set to be named Carrefour CEO next week: sources,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Alexandre Bompard, chief executive of French consumer electronics retailer Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC), is set to be appointed CEO of French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.Europe's largest retailer has been searching since October for a successor to Georges Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive expires in May 2018.Bompard, 44, has led Fnac - which sells books and music - since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013.Under Bompard's leadership, Fnac last year won a bidding war with Conforama for control of household goods and electronics equipment maker Darty, creating a French market leader with sales of more than 7 billion euros.""He is the big favorite, but certain things still have to be discussed,"" one of the sources said. Talks are focusing on the extent of the new CEO's control over corporate strategy, the sources said.A second source said that a final meeting of the Carrefour nomination committee is planned for the end of next week. The Bompard appointment could be announced shortly afterward, and ahead of the retailer's June 15 shareholders' meeting. Carrefour and its major shareholders all declined comment.The Moulin family, owner of department store Galeries Lafayette, is Carrefour's top shareholder with a 11.51 percent stake, followed by Groupe Arnault with 8.95 percent, the family of Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz with 8.05 percent and private equity firm Colony Capital with 5.23 percent.Remuneration is not a key issue in the talks, sources said. At Fnac Darty, Bompard's pay and benefit package added up to 13.8 million euros in 2016, compared to 11.5 million in 2015, thanks to free shares and performance options granted in 2013-14.Investors want Carrefour's new CEO to boost performance of the French hyper markets and to catch up in the digitalization of retail.Since taking over as CEO in June 2012, Plassat has led a recovery at Carrefour, focusing on price cuts, accelerating expansion into convenience stores and renovating stores.Plassat won a second three-year mandate in June 2015. Earlier that same year he underwent surgery and named Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon and Secretary General Jerome Bedier as deputy CEOs to assist him. He told shareholders in 2016 that he was going to prepare his succession.Carrefour shares, which had fallen to 14 euros at the time of Plassat's appointment in June 2012, more than doubled to 32 euros in April 2015 but have been on a downward slope again since then. They were down 27 percent from that high at their 23.4 euros close on Friday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

235,"Jan 12, 2017 04:40PM ET",Protests will aim to disrupt Trump inauguration: organizers,nan,"By John ClarkeWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of demonstrators are expected to turn out in Washington next week for protests aiming to ""shut down"" the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president, organizers said on Thursday.Protesters will attempt to close down 12 security checkpoints at the U.S. Capitol, where Trump will take the oath of office on Jan. 20, and along the 2.5-mile (4-km) parade route down Pennsylvania Avenue, according to leaders of a group called DisruptJ20.""We want to shut down the inauguration,"" organizer David Thurston told a news conference. ""We want to see a seething rebellion develop in this city and across the country.""A representative of the Trump transition team could not be immediately reached for comment, nor could a spokesman for the District of Columbia police.After a deeply polarizing campaign, Trump's surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election has inflamed passions across the political spectrum.The Republican president-elect's supporters embrace his brash, no-nonsense style and image as an astute problem-solver. His detractors are dismayed by what they see as an authoritarian bent and an array of provocative policy pronouncements.DisruptJ20, which is working with Black Lives Matter and other protest groups, said it also planned predawn blockades and disruptive demonstrations during inaugural balls in the evening.Some 300 DisruptJ20 volunteers will work to mobilize demonstrators for a series of protests the group has dubbed the ""Festival of Resistance."" ""We are not in favor of a peaceful transition of power, and we need to stop it,"" organizer Legba  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said.The group has three protest permits and ""promises other surprises,"" said spokeswoman Samantha Miller. All told, 27 protest groups have been granted permits, more than four times the average number for past inaugurations, according to the National Park Service. The Women's March, on the day after the inauguration, is expected to attract 200,000 people, said the park service, which issues permits. TIGHT SECURITYThe inauguration is expected to draw 800,000 spectators, according to officials. That compares with some 1.8 million attending Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration as America's first black president, one of the largest crowds ever to gather in the U.S. capital for such an event.Protest organizers said they were concerned with the potential for violent clashes with Trump supporters.""We are definitely worried about our safety, so we'll be training to help keep people safe,"" Miller said.The group will have to navigate tight security provided by three dozen law enforcement agencies, including the Capitol Police, FBI, Secret Service, National Park Service and National Guard. Security will include more than 3,200 police officers from departments across the country, 8,000 members of the National Guard and an additional 5,000 active-duty military members. Security costs have exceeded $100 million, officials said.Last week, interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters that authorities were ready for any attempt to disrupt the festivities.""The fact that you have some folks that are indicating on social media that they're coming to shut down the inauguration events is something that we will be prepared for,"" Newsham said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

238,"Dec 07, 2016 11:20AM ET",Knight Vinke warns European investment banks too small to thrive,nan,"By Anjuli DaviesLONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Knight Vinke expects European investment banks will have to merge with U.S. or Chinese rivals because they lack scale in wholesale trading and have no deep domestic market to subsidize their activities.Eric Knight, who founded the fund in 2002 and now has about $800 million under management, said that slimming down by cutting jobs and risk was not the answer to a progressive squeeze on margins driven by tighter regulation.""The problem for European investment banks is the lack of scale, not the quality of the banks. They're unprofitable because they're too small,"" Knight told Reuters.But Europe's fragmented capital markets means mergers within the region would not work and banks must look further afield, Knight, who is known for bets on companies including  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), HSBC and Swiss bank UBS, said.""Is there a future for investment banks in Europe? I think there is, but it comes from the outside. They need to merge and re-incorporate outside Europe. You could maybe merge one or two big banks, the rest will have to liquidate,"" he added.""One place is the U.S. and the other is China. European investment banks should merge with peers in those countries to create something viable. There would be tremendous value for shareholders,"" Knight said.Knight Vinke unsuccessfully tried to get UBS to split its wealth management business from its investment bank in 2013. It closed its position a year ago, although Knight said in February he could be tempted to reinvest.He remains particularly interested in UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and predicts that with risks growing in the economic system, change could come next year if there is another crisis.European banks have shed thousands of jobs and closed whole business lines to stay competitive since the financial crisis, but have lagged U.S counterparts in coping with low interest rates, regulation and sluggish economic growth.Many are still struggling, with Credit Suisse pledging another 1 billion Swiss francs ($991 million) in cost cuts and paring its profit targets.Activist investors buy shares in companies and then push them to change strategy, hoping the value of the stock rise.Knight Vinke's main fund is up about 50 percent so far this year, driven by its holding in electrical retailer Darty which was bought by French music and book chain Fnac.Knight invests across sectors in Europe as well as in banks, but is looking in particular at Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic nations.""I'm focused on countries that would survive a break-up of the euro zone,"" he said."

247,"Jul 25, 2016 06:30AM ET",SoftBank's robot Pepper to be rolled out in Taiwan later this year,nan,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - SoftBank Corp's (T:9984) human-like robot Pepper will be rolled out in Taiwan later this year with about 100 rented units making their appearance in some banks and  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) shops, executives handling Pepper's sales in the island said on Monday. Taiwan is set to become one of the first markets outside of Japan to launch Pepper, a key plank in SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision of future technology centered on 'internet of things', a network of devices, vehicles and building sensors that collect and exchange data.The island is also home of the robot's contract maker Foxconn, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co (TW:2317). However, Pepper won't be available for sale or to consumers yet in Taiwan, which like many other markets, has yet to widely adopt human-like robots as part of a regular lifestyle. The goal is to rent out 60 robots a month by sometime in the first half of 2017, Foxconn executive director Lu Fang-ming told reporters at a briefing.The banking units of First Financial Holding Co (TW:2892) and Taishin Financial Holding Co (TW:2887), the life insurance arm of Cathay Financial Holding Co (TW:2882) and Taiwanese telecommunication carrier Asia Pacific Telecom Co (TW:3682) are expected to put Pepper into their frontline service to support the basic needs of customers, said Lu, who is also chairman of Asia Pacific Telecom.Carrefour plans to start by putting two Pepper robots into its shops in Taiwan, said Marilyn Su, national marketing director for the French retailer. Su said the first mission for the robot is to get to know the customers and see how they interact with Pepper, especially children, before ordering any more. Foxconn unit Perobot Co, which is in charge of sales and maintenance for Pepper in Taiwan, said Pepper is available for lease in a two-year contract at T$26,888 ($836.67) per month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

254,"Apr 10, 2016 12:00PM ET",Veteran Hayman denies Boonen to take Paris-Roubaix win,nan,"By Julien PretotROUBAIX, France (Reuters) - Australian veteran Mathew Hayman deprived Tom Boonen of a record-breaking fifth Paris-Roubaix title when he won the Queen of the Classics on Sunday after the leading favorites got trapped behind a big crash.The Orica-GreenEDGE rider, 37, outsprinted Belgian Boonen on the final bend of the Roubaix velodrome as British rider Ian Stannard took third place at the end of a crash-ridden 257.5-km ride featuring 52.8 km of cobbled sectors.Pre-race favorites Peter Sagan, the world champion, and Fabian Cancellara, who was gunning for a fourth title, effectively lost the race when they found themselves on the wrong end of a bunch split after a massive pile-up some 115km from the line.Swiss Cancellara later crashed on the wet cobbles and finished more than seven minutes behind Hayman on his last Paris-Roubaix before retiring at the end of the season.""I can't believe it, I broke my arm five weeks ago and missed all the racing, I just raced a race in Spain last week,"" said Hayman, whose best previous result in the race was eighth place in 2012.""This is my favorite race but this year I didn't even dare to dream.""Hayman was in the day's breakaway and when the big guns caught the group he managed to keep with them. Despite a late mechanical problem, he stayed among the five riders who went on to contest the victory.Boonen attacked with 2.7km left but Hayman followed and countered, only for the 2005 world champion to rejoin him. The Australian, however, was the stronger on the final sprint.Belgian Sep Vanmarcke took fourth place ahead of Norway's Edvald Boasson Hagen. ""I knew I had to take it easy (in the breakaway) and I was waiting for the big guys to come, I saved all day,"" Hayman explained.""I wanted to be in front 0n the last bend because the one in front on the last bend in the velodrome always wins. But I was dead. We were all dead,"" said Boonen.When the Quick-Step team realized that Sagan, who won the Tour of Flanders last Sunday, and Cancellara were trapped behind after a huge crash, German Tony Martin pulled in front to help Boonen.Boonen and company caught the fugitives with 63km left. Three kms later, as the group entered a cobbled sector, Cancellara accelerated brutally and was followed by Sagan as the duo tried to bridge the gap.Sky, with four riders in the front group, upped the pace, only for Gianni Moscon to crash on a wet corner of the cobbled sector number 11, taking down team mate Luke Rowe in his fall.Cancellara crashed on the cobbled sector of Mons en Pevele, losing all hope of a victory. Sagan somehow managed to jump over the Swiss rider's bike to avoid crashing but he never made it back into the leading bunch.Twenty kilometers from the line, Stannard's brutal acceleration cut that group down to five men. Vanmarcke attacked in the  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) de l'Arbre, one of the most feared cobbled sectors, but Team Sky's Stannard worked hard to help rein in the Lotto-JumboNL rider and eventually Harman was the freshest man.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

259,"Feb 17, 2016 08:34AM ET",Insight: Lost in translation - Wal-Mart stumbles hard in Brazil ,nan,"By Brad Haynes and Nathan LayneCAMPO GRANDE, Brazil/BENTONVILLE, Arkansas (Reuters) - When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (N:WMT) first expanded into Brazil's midwestern farm-belt city of Campo Grande seven years ago, the economy was booming and executives were eager to open stores even in sub-prime locations on one-way streets heading out of town. It didn’t last. At the end of December, the U.S. retailer closed both of its Maxxi brand cash-and-carry stores in Campo Grande as part of a restructuring that shuttered 60 locations across Brazil, including some Supercenters. Shoppers said the stores could not compete on assortment, price or location. ""It was never clear who Maxxi was for. It wasn't cheap enough for the poor. But there was no appeal for the middle class,"" said Ordecy Gossler, 40, a public accountant filling his cart with cleaning supplies and toilet paper at Atacadão, a rival chain run by France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR). ""When they announced in December that both Maxxis were closing, no one in my office knew where they were."" Today, Wal-Mart has just one Supercenter left in this city of 850,000 people, whose demographic of thrifty shoppers had once seemed suited to the world's largest retailer. It shuttered the city’s other one at the end of the year, as traffic dwindled in the shopping mall it was meant to anchor. The retreat from Campo Grande is emblematic of Wal-Mart’s broader issues in Brazil, a once-red-hot destination for foreign retailers and other companies that has turned stone cold. And the lackluster performance in Latin America's largest economy shows how tactics that helped Wal-Mart build success in the U.S. sometimes get badly lost in translation overseas.International results have been anemic, despite $22 billion in capital investment over the past five years. Wal-Mart last year generated a 4.5 percent operating profit margin from international markets, well below the 7.4 percent return posted from the U.S. Seeking higher returns, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon in October announced a strategic review of the company’s global assets. Some securities analysts have speculated Wal-Mart could exit Brazil, as well as other markets in Latin America where it is already closing an additional 55 stores. The pullback in Brazil also has some worrying echoes of previous Wal-Mart debacles overseas, including South Korea and Germany, two markets it abandoned in 2006.LABOR PROBLEMS Brazil in particular has been dogged by poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices -- with some of the problems baked in during an aggressive, decade-long growth surge, according to interviews with a dozen former and current Wal-Mart executives, as well as analysts, shoppers and store employees. For a graphic showing some of Wal-Mart's Brazil problems, see http://tmsnrt.rs/1oH9pNuWal-Mart would not comment on financial results from Brazil ahead of the company's quarterly earnings on Feb. 18. People familiar with the numbers told Reuters that Wal-Mart has posted operating losses in Brazil for each of the past seven years. Jo Newbould, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said the store closures were part of its efforts to “actively manage” its global assets and that it has been working to lower costs in Brazil. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart’s international operations, said in an interview that it has no plans to quit Brazil. He pointed to the company’s decision to invest in completing an integration of legacy computer systems into the wider Wal-Mart platform as evidence of a commitment to the market. ""That's not the act of someone who is packing up the firm for other purposes,"" he said. Cheesewright expressed optimism about a turnaround. ""It's a market that has always been high on potential, but has been a roller-coaster ride in terms of its performance,"" he said. ""It happens to be on a downturn at the moment, and I'm sure it will do what it always has done, which is improve."" RUNAWAY GROWTH Wal-Mart first entered Brazil in 1995 and grew in measured steps for nearly a decade. That changed in 2004-2005, when it spent about $1 billion to buy two retailers, Bompreço S.A. Supermercados do Nordeste and Sonae Distribuição Brasil S.A. The deals expanded Wal-Mart’s operations into the northeast and south of Brazil, and marked the beginning of a spending spree aimed at building a national footprint. With the takeovers came an array of brands: Wal-Mart currently operates under nine different store banners in Brazil. At the height of the expansion, former Wal-Mart executives said, a land rush mentality took hold. Brazil’s thriving economy in those years convinced executives the biggest risk lay in moving too slowly. In response, they approved new store sites based on increasingly rosy forecasts of future sales.""Most executives didn't have the voice to say, 'Don't open this store; let's not approve more stores,’” a former finance executive recalled. “Why not? Because Brazil was the new country. We needed to put investment in before others do."" In a six-year stretch through the fiscal year ending January 2013, Wal-Mart doubled its locations, reaching nearly 560 at its peak. The rapid expansion strained Wal-Mart's logistics -- traditionally one of its strong points in the U.S. but a drag on performance in Brazil.In some cases, delivery trucks drove days to reach distant stores from centrally located warehouses. Executives from headquarters bickered with those running some kinds of stores about who should bear the distribution costs, the former finance executive said.Amid the focus on growth, executives never fully integrated the legacy information systems from Bompreço and Sonae. Disruptions in communication between headquarters and the many different store types allowed inefficiencies to take root. Buyers, for instance, found themselves using three laptops, one each for the two legacy systems and another for the Wal-Mart platform, people familiar with the matter said.TAX ISSUESCheesewright said he had put a priority on systems and would complete the integration by the middle of 2016. He said that would allow Brazil to benefit fully from system and process advancements made in the U.S., helping it to lower costs. He also said Wal-Mart was getting a grip on Brazil's complex tax system and litigious labor market, problems that have dogged it for years. In January 2014 Wal-Mart disclosed that unforeseen Brazil tax assessments and employment claims tied to a cost-cutting drive would slice 2 percent off its annual earnings globally. Labor claims in Brazil also hurt its results in the third quarter of the financial year that has just ended. Cheesewright said it was implementing a plan, including putting advanced time-keeping equipment in stores and getting workers to formally clock in, which should lower the risk of worker lawsuits.""A lot of the stuff in Brazil is just the basic stuff: do people properly clock out for their lunch breaks, do you manage overtime correctly, do they have the right breaks between shifts?"" he said. ""It's a lot of basic blocking and tackling.""Wal-Mart, whose sales at existing stores in the country edged down 0.6 percent in the August-October quarter, isn't the only retailer hurting in Brazil.With the economy in a deepening recession, market leader GPA (SA:PCAR4), controlled by France's  Casino  (PA:CASP), suffered a 2.3 percent sales drop at existing stores in the October-December quarter and has said it would slash investments in 2016. Carrefour bucked the trend, posting 8.5 percent growth in sales at existing stores, thanks to investments in hypermarkets and growth at Atacadão, the country’s biggest cash-and-carry chain.BEATEN ON ACQUISITIONThe cash-and-carry format, which features bulk sales of food and other items paid for in cash and carried out by the customers themselves, has emerged as a rare bright spot in Brazilian retail. Cheesewright said Maxxi was now one of Wal-Mart's best performing formats after it had narrowed its focus to small business owners, giving up on competing head-to-head with the larger warehouses of Atacadão, which caters to both business shoppers and an increasing number of thrifty families. But after paring back to 44 locations, Maxxi gives Wal-Mart far less exposure to the cash-and-carry business than Atacadão and GPA's Assai, which have 123 and 95 stores, respectively. Some analysts and former executives say one of Wal-Mart’s biggest missteps was losing a bidding match for Atacadão to Carrefour, which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.Cheesewright said Wal-Mart was piloting a larger version of its Todo Dia discount format in part as a way to attract some of the family shoppers now using rival cash-and-carry stores. Other plans include renovating supermarkets with a slightly smaller assortment and a focus on fresh food. The task of making all that happen falls to Flavio Cotini, who was promoted this month from chief financial officer to head the Brazilian operations. The reshuffle marked the fourth leadership change in Brazil since 2008 -- a lack of continuity at the top that has exacerbated problems, including hindering efforts to integrate operations, former executives said."" When you build a castle you build the foundation first. Wal-Mart did it in reverse in Brazil,"" a former senior executive in the international business said. ""It is so hard to build a national chain when your system backbone is not in place.""(reporting by Brad Haynes in Campo Grande and Nathan Layne in Bentonville; additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer in São Paulo and Dominique Vidalon in Paris; Editing by Martin Howell)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

First reported by Reuters, Apple itself has kept mum about the news. However, Apple has created the Chinese version on its website for Apple Pay, but as of yet hasn’t added direct links from the main Apple China site (page available here).Arriving in China with Apple Pay, the service was first unveiled by Apple in December 2015 as the company announced a partnership with China UnionPay. At the time, Apple provided an “early 2016” estimate for the Apple Pay launch that would become available to China UnionPay cardholders.According to the Chinese Apple Pay page, Apple has partnered with 19 banks in China that will support the mobile payment system for China UnionPay card holders. The figure expands the initial figure of 15 partners that had been announced in December. Among the partner banks are the ‘big four’- Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.Through their partnership with China UnionPay, Apple Pay will be available for mobile payments at all of the card network QuickPass participating merchants. Operating contactless payment terminals, according to China UnionPay, QuickPass merchants include many popular retail establishments such as 7-11, Starbucks (O:SBUX),  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and OK convenience stores. Along with contactless terminals, Apple Pay will also become available for transacting payments on mobile devices from online sites that support China UnionPay.Looking ahead, following Apple, Samsung (KS:005930) Pay is expected to be the next key mobile player launching its payment system in China. Similar to Apple, Samsung partnered with China UnionPay to support Samsung Pay to its card holders in China with an expected launch also slated to be in “early 2016”.Original Source"
261,"Feb 14, 2016 07:00AM ET",Africa's big cities offer investors hope in hard times ,nan,"By Joe BrockJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa's biggest economies have been hammered by the collapse in commodity prices over the past 18 months but there are still investment bright spots to be found.In cities such as Lagos, Nairobi, Accra, Kinshasa and Johannesburg, growth remains robust and investors are prospering in the retail, financial services, technology and construction sectors. This means investors can now re-adjust their strategy for Africa. Instead of taking a view on the continent as a whole, or choosing one country over another, they can seize opportunities city by city. Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing faster than anywhere else in the world and city dwellers have more money to spend. ""In the current economic environment, investors want areas where success is proven, growth is strong and will remain strong. Big African cities give you that,"" said Jacob Kholi, a partner at Abraaj, a private equity firm with $9 billion under management. ""It has become even more important to focus on these key cities than before,"" Kholi added.Nairobi is the most attractive destination for foreign investment, according to a 2015 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, followed by Accra, with Lagos and Johannesburg equal third. Consumption per capita in Accra is 1.6 times greater than the average in Ghana, 2.3 times bigger in Lagos than the average in Nigeria, and 2.7 times larger in Nairobi than nationally in Kenya, Abraaj estimates. Lagos, one of the world's fastest growing cities and with a population of 20 million, expects economic growth of 7 percent this year, twice the pace of the country as a whole.Even South Africa, which is grappling with youth unemployment of over 40 percent and could slip into recession this year, has areas where industry is booming.""Looking around here, you wouldn't know things were so bad,"" construction worker Sifiso Zwane told Reuters in Johannesburg's wealthy Sandton business district.""Rich people will always find a way to make more money,"" said Zwane, with cranes filling the skyline behind him and billboards advertising new retailers like Krispy Kreme doughnuts (N:KKD) and Hennes & Mauritz (ST:HMb).There are similar stories elsewhere.This year, Kenya is set to unveil the Two River malls in Nairobi, the continent’s largest shopping center outside South Africa, with brands like Porsche, Hugo Boss and France’s  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) already booking space.""The economy still has opportunities,"" said Gabriel Modest, a jeweler who says demand for the gold necklaces and bracelets he sells remains strong.""Sometimes you have to treat yourself,"" he added, ordering a bowl of muesli and yoghurt at an upmarket Nairobi coffee shop. In Lagos, plans are in place to develop the vast multi-billion-dollar Eko Atlantic city, a Dubai-style gated community that will boast chrome skyscrapers, business parks, palm trees and a marina.""MEGA-CITY"" By 2025, Mckinsey estimates that more than 80 cities in sub-Saharan Africa will have populations of more than one million, accounting for 58 percent of the region's growth.This rapid urbanization means Africa's big cities will need more roads, hospital and power stations, while growing numbers of new inhabitants will be buying consumer goods like instant noodles, washing powder and mobile phone cards. Though some big companies like Massmart (J:MSMJ),  Barclays  (L:BARC) and Nestle (VX:NESN) have slowed expansion plans in Africa in the last two years they are still making healthy profits in the big urban centers, according to banking sources. ""Our investment is focused on cities where we see the best opportunities even if the investment environment in the rest of the country isn't as robust,"" said Louis Deppe, partner at Actis, an emerging market-focused investment company. ""The 'mega-city' trend is still very much on the cards."" The share of Africans living in urban areas is expected to grow from 36 percent in 2010 to 50 percent by 2030, with cities expected to be home to 85 percent of the national population in some countries, according to the World Bank. The rapid urbanization of mostly the young and unemployed is placing a huge strain on infrastructure and will put pressure on politicians to direct more resources towards cities. Inequality in African cities is already among the highest in the world. African governments with stretched public finances will need to improve housing and social safety nets in cities and diversify their economies to support rural areas in order to avoid an increase in inequality that could stir up discontent. ""In a more risk-averse world, 'urban bias’ – where there are proven returns - is likely to be reinforced. Investors will look at urban areas,"" said Razia Khan, head of Africa research at  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN). ""This trend runs the risk of the rural electorate being marginalized – in especially unequal regions, it may raise political risks, and the potential for unrest.""Back in Lagos, business is still expanding for cab-owner Cyril Ugochukwu, whose earnings are running well above the target he set for his business, which has contracts with online firm Easy Taxi.""Individuals must make trips whether times are good or bad,"" he told Reuters.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Valor did not identify the source of its story. Two months ago Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon pledged to review Wal-Mart's global store base to eliminate underperforming units. It has begun selling noncore businesses in Latin America, including property in Chile and a restaurant chain in Mexico.If implemented, the decision could shutter about 5 percent of Brazil's current store base in Brazil, the newspaper noted. Wal-Mart has 588 stores in the country, it said on its website.Wal Mart is also considering leasing part of some stores to home furnishings retailers in several regions across Brazil to generate additional revenue, Valor said.Lagging behind rivals Casino Guichard Perrachon & Cie's GPA SA (SA:PCAR4) and  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, Wal-Mart has over the past four years cut prices that along with rising wage and operating costs have eroded profitability, analysts said. Net sales in Brazil fell 0.4 percent in the third quarter, below the performance of GPA and Carrefour, Valor reported, adding that sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.6 percent in the period.Wal Mart rose 0.6 percent in New York to $60.94.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

265,"Nov 12, 2015 11:25AM ET","In latest retail tech, Carrefour lights have eyes",nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Emma ThomassonLILLE, France/BERLIN (Reuters) - The strip lights in the hypermarket know where you are, and can tell you where to go.The new technology being trailed by French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) tracks your movements and beams data to your smartphone via light pulses undetectable to the eye, to guide you to the right shelves for tailored special offers.It is the latest attempt to combine the online and real-world shopping experience, regarded as the holy grail for the industry at the moment. As part of a new loyalty scheme launched last month, for example, Britain's Marks and Spencer (L:MKS) is sending promotional text messages to shoppers who are in or near its stores - but only those who have agreed to receive them.In fact almost three-quarters of British retailers are using technology, including facial recognition software, to track customers in stores, according to a survey of retail executives by IT services firm CSC. It is mostly for security purposes, but also to help provide a more personalized service.Even in Germany, where privacy is particularly closely guarded, major retailers have been signing up to U.S. app Shopkick, which rewards consumers with points when they enter participating stores and scan products with their phones. But retailers must tread with caution, especially among older customers.""We are already flooded with offers on smartphones. We are being tracked to death. I guess I'm old school, but I want to keep my privacy,"" said Yves, 50, an insurance executive shopping at the Carrefour store that is testing the new lights.The Carrefour project - a one-year joint trial with Dutch tech firm Philips - is at the sprawling store next to the train station in the northern French city of Lille, chosen for the test because of the young and urban crowd it attracts.The Euralille hypermarket replaced its fluorescent lighting with Philips LED lights that can transmit data via pulses which are registered by smartphone cameras, at this stage only iPhones.'NEW TOYS'Customers who have downloaded the ""Promo C-ou"" (Where is the special offer) app can let their smartphone camera point up so the lights in the ceiling determine their location. A blue arrow on the phone screen then guides them to the right shelf.""We want to facilitate the shoppers' experience and be more convivial,"" said Carrefour store manager Thierry Demettre.The service helps direct busy shoppers to the 200 to 300 different items on promotion each week, he said.Carrefour said the app was being used about 50-100 times a day in a store which serves 11,000 customers a day. It is recruiting students to help customers use the app during the busy holiday season.When Reuters visited the store, it was hard to find shoppers who knew about the app, despite banners advertising the service in the aisles.Karine, a 40-year-old civil servant who works nearby, said she could imagine using the app: ""I could save time when shopping,"" she said, adding she did not mind sharing her data. ""They would not be the first nor the last to send us messages."" Eight in 10 consumers around the world are willing to share key pieces of personal information with brands, but only about 8 percent feel they are receiving better offers as a result, according to a survey of 20,000 people in 11 major countries conducted by marketing and loyalty company Aimia.""Marketers have got lots of new toys in the toy cupboard but the risk is you end up doing cleverer versions of spam,"" said Aimia chief operating officer David Johnston.DATA MOUNTAINThe new M&S Sparks loyalty scheme aims to get around that by asking members to share their interests when they join so they can get tailor-made offers and invites to special events.""This personalization is a key aspect of what we will deliver,"" said Suzanna Broer, M&S director of customer insight and loyalty. ""People are getting tired of being completely spammed with untargeted, irrelevant offers.""Steve Laughlin, retail expert at  IBM  (N:IBM) Global Business Services, said stores were only just starting to work out how to make the best use of the mountains of data they are gathering and make money from it.When IBM analyzed customer data for a coffee chain, for example, it found the air temperature point at which people tend to order cold drinks over hot drinks was several degrees lower than the chain had expected, Laughlin said.""They were sending promotions for hot drinks when they should have been sending promotions for cold drinks,"" he said.Lasse Bolander, chairman of Denmark's largest supermarket chain Coop, said offering targeted discounts was particularly difficult for grocery retailers as customers shop so frequently and for a huge range of items.That explains why some retailers - like British upmarket supermarket Waitrose - are allowing loyalty card holders to pick the items on which they want special offers.But Bolander, whose Coop chain is owned by more than 1.5 million Danish customers who share their data in return for discounts, says retailers need to be careful.""We have to make it transparent what we use the data for and easy to opt out,"" he said. ""Until we are absolutely certain we can give people the right offer at the right time we should take a step back - otherwise people will get annoyed.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

267,"Oct 16, 2015 09:39AM ET",Rare store sales data highlights Wal-Mart's China challenge,nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - A rare glimpse at figures for a number of Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (N:WMT) China outlets shows sales slid 6 percent last year, casting a shadow over the firm's target for China to account for a quarter of its global retail growth over the next five years.The U.S. retail giant doesn't break out its China store sales, but a local joint venture partner submitted filings with the data to a Chinese asset exchange platform as part of a planned sale of minority stakes in 21 Walmart stores. Wal-Mart had 415 China stores at the end of August.Combined revenue at those 21 stores fell 6 percent to 26.6 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), the data show, illustrating Wal-Mart's challenge to drive sales growth in the world's second-largest economy, where retailers are under pressure from a cooling economy and the rise of shopping online.International firms from luxury brands such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) to global auto makers, are feeling the pinch as China's consumers tighten their belts.The data, released in filings from a unit of state-backed conglomerate China Resources Corp (CRC), show no obvious single factor impacting performance at the stores, which vary in size and age. The 21 stores, located across China from Beijing to far-western Sichuan, employ some 30,000 staff, including more than 20,000 at a single outlet in the southern city of Shenzhen. Wal-Mart says it has more than 100,000 employees in China.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon this week acknowledged China was a ""bit tough"", but the world's largest retailer by revenue maintains that in the long-term China is an ""exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market"". ""As the middle class continues to grow we see an incredible opportunity and we have been putting the pieces in place,"" McMillon said on an investor call on Wednesday. Wal-Mart plans to grow its China footprint by nearly a third with around 115 new stores to open by 2017.In August, Wal-Mart said comparative sales in China dipped 1.4 pct in May-July.TEMPERATURE CHECKTo be sure, the Chinese filings provide only a temperature check on part of Wal-Mart's China business, but analysts said the stores' combined sales slide was still a worrying sign. The filings, posted on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, show 18 of the 21 stores saw sales decline last year.""If on average across these 21 stores there's a 6 percent drop, that's more than you'd expect,"" said Torsten Stocker, Hong Kong-based retail analyst with AT Kearney. ""They've previously never really released China-specific data so it may well be concerning them. If I was in their shoes I'd be a bit worried.""He noted the data covers only a small selection of Wal-Mart's China stores, adding: ""It fits the story that the last couple of years have been pretty tough. It's still a very difficult environment for foreign retailers.""A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to comment beyond an earlier statement saying the firm respected the ""investment decision"" of its joint venture partner. China Resources, which is seeking more than $500 million for the stake in the stores, did not respond to queries about why it was looking to sell, though it does have other retail interests including a venture with Britain's  Tesco  PLC (L:TSCO).Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart slashed its global outlook on Wednesday for the next fiscal year, sparking the steepest one-day drop in the company's shares in a quarter of a century.TOUGH ROAD AHEADThe China filings show debt levels at the 21 stores have also risen, with total liabilities equal to around 80 percent of total assets as of end-May, up from 76 percent in 2013. Profits and margins, however, improved over that period, signaling a successful drive to rein in costs.China's food retail market has been cooling, while local rivals have eaten away at international firms' market share, according to market research firm CTR China. The market grew at 3.4 percent in the second quarter, down from closer to 10 percent in early 2013.This has seen Wal-Mart, France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Tesco all see sales growth slip, with average same-store sales growth dropping into negative territory last year, according to consultancy OC&C.""The ability of Western retailers to really compete in China isn't going to get any easier. Some advantages they had for a number of years - branding, supply chain, back office - the local guys are catching up on that,"" said AT Kearney's Stocker.Wal-Mart has been beefing up its online presence in China to counter slowing growth offline, buying out e-commerce firm Yihaodian.com in July.($1 = 6.3545 Chinese yuan renminbi)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

270,"Sep 25, 2015 03:51PM ET",Booming Ivory Coast faces elections with confidence,nan,"By Loucoumane CoulibalyABIDJAN (Reuters) - From Abidjan airport's packed arrivals hall to the hotels and plush villas mushrooming across the city, Ivory Coast is booming, a rare African bright spot as the world's biggest cocoa producer bounces back from years of turmoil and civil war.With elections due in a month, many Ivorians had expected a pause in the post-conflict growth spurt, but such is the confidence in a smooth vote and a second term for incumbent Alassane Ouattara that the expected blip has not materialized.The government is predicting growth of 9.6 percent this year, making the former French colony the stand-out performer on a continent being hammered by a slump in commodity prices, capital outflows and tumbling currencies.The International Monetary Fund's assessment is only marginally less bullish, while the bustle on the streets of the commercial capital attests to the turnaround in the four years since the nation's second civil war in less than a decade killed 3,000 people.""There are many European businessmen arriving these days,"" airport taxi driver Fabrice Toha said with a smile. ""All the taxi drivers can see that the country is doing well and many of us think that Ouattara has a good chance of another term.""The airport had 1.3 million passengers in 2014, double the tally from four years ago.A stone's throw away, dozens of construction workers swarm around the inside and outside of the 261-room Radisson Blu Abidjan, one of several high-end hotels due to open before the end of this year.Kome Cesse, the entrepreneur behind the project, said the investment was based as much on faith in the government's record since the war as the rosy outlook for Francophone West Africa's largest economy.For Cesse, fears of any repeat of the mayhem that followed 2010 elections, when then-president Laurent Gbagbo - now in The Hague accused of crimes against humanity - refused to accept defeat at the hands of Ouattara, are overblown.""All over Africa, whenever there are elections, there's tension,"" he said, raising his voice over the din of construction work. ""But for African investors like us, we are used to it and we deal with it.""Elsewhere, in the capital's chic Cocody neighborhood, Sofitel's lavish Hotel Ivoire - the pre-eminent symbol of Abidjan's post-colonial 1960s heyday - has undergone a face-lift. Its rooms, starting at over $250 per night, are regularly fully booked.RETAIL LEADERBesides the strong growth, businessmen point to generous terms offered by Ouattara's administration, such as VAT exemption, reduced customs duties and promises of compensation in the event of social unrest.The government has also sought to spur on the private sector with heavy investments in long-neglected infrastructure. New bridges and highways have eased traffic congestion in Abidjan and have cut travel times to other cities. And a revamping of the power grid, already the region's most reliable, has ensured that manufacturing and industrial sectors don't face the extended black-outs that plague Ivory Coast's neighbors.Those investments appear to have borne fruit already. On Friday, Dutch brewer Heineken [HEININ.UL] and French industrial group CFO laid the first stone for a new 150 million euro ($169 million) brewery. ""Our business is pretty simple. It's about population, urbanization, economic growth and a stable political setting,"" said Roland Pirmez, head of Heineken in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. ""Today we see that all of those parameters in Ivory Coast are extremely positive. It's the right moment to invest."" Ivory Coast ranked second behind Nigeria this year on Nielsen's African Prospects Indicator, an index combining macro-economic, business, retail and consumer outlooks. In the retail sector, where Neilsen ranked its prospects as the most promising on the continent, foreign companies - particular those from France - are piling in.Giant French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PARIS:CARR) plans to open a massive hypermarket in Abidjan - its first in sub-Saharan Africa - next month, shrugging off any concerns about violence linked to the Oct. 25 poll.FNAC, the French retail chain specializing in electronic and cultural goods, is also setting up shop, eager to tap into the rapidly expanding middle class in a nation of 24 million people and average per capita income of over $3,000 a year.""When you look at the big global brands coming to our country, it means that they are confident that it is lasting,"" said investment board director Emmanuel Esmel Essis, who is expecting a record of nearly $1 billion in private investment this year, almost double the 2014 total.BRIDGING THE WEALTH GAPBanks keen on bankrolling big deals are among the pioneers. South Africa's Standard Bank is seeking to establish a regional hub, and Germany's Commerzbank (XETRA:CBKG) has also opened a representative office.A member of the West African franc zone whose currency is pegged to the euro, Ivory Coast offers investors protection from inflation - now at just over 1 percent - and the currency collapses that have hit the likes of Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and South Africa.In another vote of confidence, the African Development Bank started moving its headquarters back to Abidjan last year, after instability forced it to take refuge in Tunis in 2003.Still, observers note that Ivory Coast remains a post-conflict nation. The benefits of the recent years of growth have been unevenly distributed and unemployment, particularly among the youth, remains a major concern for those seeking to stave off future instability.If he indeed wins a second term, Ouattara must use the next five years to improve financial inclusion, said Kevin Murray, Citigroup's managing director for West and Central Africa.""He's going to have to do some social safety net stuff. That will be a lot easier to do when he has some money to spend,"" he said. ""If he can get the middle class clicking, he'll make this economy thrive.""In the meantime, the signs that some people are already doing quite well abound. The residential property sector has seen an influx of Moroccan, Chinese, Turkish and European firms, some of them throwing up beach-front duplex villas worth $1 million or more for rich expatriates and well-to-do Ivorians.""We're very optimistic for everything that has happened since 2012,"" said Chadi Srour of SIPIM, a real estate promotion firm. ""There's nothing wrong with demand. As the country goes forward, we go forward.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

272,"Sep 02, 2015 12:27PM ET",Ex-president's backers in power struggle before Ivory Coast polls,nan,"By Joe BavierABIDJAN (Reuters) - Two years ago, Pascal Affi N'Guessan was in jail after backing the losing side in Ivory Coast's civil war. Now he is running for president, provoking a power struggle within the opposition whose outcome will help decide the country's future stability.While N'Guessan appears likely to lose in October, the fact that the former prime minister is even contesting the election for the main opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) ought to mark a step towards national reconciliation.But the party's founder, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is awaiting trial in The Hague over his role in the 2011 war, and FPI hardliners have called for an election boycott, which would be the party's third in the past four years.Under the incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast is emerging as one of Africa's star economies, but it also needs a credible election and political calm to maintain the revival.Support for the FPI remains relatively strong. Thousands of supporters, some waving signs reading ""Affi President"" and wearing pink and blue shirts emblazoned with his face, turned out last month to anoint N'Guessan as the FPI's candidate. ""We cannot remain eternally absent from political competition or we risk disappearing,"" the 62-year-old N'Guessan told Reuters. ""If a party doesn't participate in elections, it has no reason to exist,"" he told Reuters.Gbagbo's refusal to stand aside after losing the last presidential election in 2010 led to the civil war, in which more than 3,000 people were killed. This ended after the victor, Ouattara, was installed in power with French support the following year.The largest economy in French-speaking West Africa has grown by 9 percent annually for the past three years, helping to make Ouattara the runaway favorite for re-election. Hotels are mushrooming to accommodate an influx of business travelers to the commercial capital, Abidjan, along with supermarkets, including France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), catering to the region's largest middle class. But political reconciliation has moved at a crawl. The FPI says hundreds of Gbagbo supporters remain political prisoners, while tens of thousands of people displaced by the war live as refugees in neighboring countries. BOYCOTT MENACEN'Guessan's Abidjan house still bears the scars of the conflict. Graffiti scrawled by pro-Ouattara soldiers remains in a dark back stairwell, and he returned home to find a 6-metre (20-foot) pit in the atrium which they had dug, looking for guns and money. Nonetheless, N'Guessan has largely abandoned the rhetoric of the crisis for a more moderate tone, hoping to reposition his party. ""I proposed and continue to follow the path towards reconciliation, because the country has already suffered too much,"" he said.A sizeable FPI faction led by former foreign minister Aboudramane Sangare is not so ready to leave the past behind.""Just because there's no more bombing and no more shooting every day, doesn't mean the crisis is over,"" said Boubacar Kone, a spokesman for Sangare's faction, who still describes Ouattara's election as a ""coup d'etat"".Due to the FPI boycotts, Ivory Coast's parliament is dominated by Ouattara allies. Now the president needs peaceful and credible presidential elections contested by viable opponents to turn the page on the war, buttress his legitimacy and ease the minds of investors.Hoping to foster reconciliation, the government released dozens of FPI prisoners - including N'Guessan in 2013 - as well as unfreezing their bank accounts and restoring their property.Sangare's faction says Ouattara favored FPI moderates and accuse him of creating a toothless opposition that might lend the polls credibility but won't mount a serious challenge.Hardliners see N'Guessan as Ouattara's straw man, pointing to the trial of 83 Gbagbo allies accused of crimes committed during the war. Sangare was handed a five-year prison sentence in March, though he remains free pending a detention order. N'Guessan got only 18 months and was credited with time served earlier, meaning he will not return to prison.N'Guessan also won court decisions blocking attempts by the hardliners to strip him of the party presidency. Today, the two factions have rival leadership structures.""Of course, he's with (Ouattara),"" Kone said, accusing N'Guessan of ""working against the party"". FIGHT FOR THE FUTUREWhile analysts give N'Guessan little chance of winning the presidency, his party could gain a strong voice in the National Assembly in parliamentary elections next year.Even in defeat, Gbagbo won 46 percent of the vote in the 2010 run-off against Ouattara. N'Guessan will look to mobilize those supporters, but the split complicates his task.""Given the label of traitor that the Sangare faction has pinned on him, I'm wondering if that will not be a millstone around his neck,"" said Lori-Anne Theroux-Benoni, head of the Institute for Security Studies' West Africa office.A well-supported boycott would be another setback for national reconciliation by excluding Gbagbo's supporters from the political process. It could also embolden the hardliners in their withdrawal from the mainstream, a risky prospect given the country's history of violence.After the war, exiled Gbagbo allies in neighboring Ghana were behind months of attacks in Abidjan and along the border that began in late 2012, according to a U.N. panel of experts.N'Guessan believes the worst can be avoided and said some Sangare backers have begun to return to the fold. ""Their place is here in the heart of the party. I am optimistic that before October we will all be back together and continue the struggle to serve our country,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

273,"Aug 28, 2015 02:17AM ET",Days numbered for barcodes as shoppers demand more data,nan,"By Emma ThomassonBERLIN (Reuters) - Growing demand for more information about the products we buy could mean the end of the simple barcode - the blocks of black and white stripes that adorn most objects for sale and are scanned five billion times a day.First used on a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit chewing gum in 1974 in a store in Ohio, barcodes have revolutionized the retail world, allowing cashiers to ring up products much faster and more accurately, while also streamlining logistics.But shoppers are now demanding far greater transparency about products, and store owners need more information to help with stock taking, product recalls and to fight fakes. The basic barcode is just not up to the job.That could mean a costly upheaval for retailers and brands to change packaging and invest in new systems and scanners. But it should also bring benefits as more data helps them manage the flow of goods better.""The barcode did a great job, but it is now time for succession,"" said Capgemini consultant Kees Jacobs, who is working with the world's top retailers and food manufacturers to try to agree new global standards for labels and product data. ""The current barcode is not sufficient to be the carrier of much more granular information that is needed,"" Jacobs said.The most ubiquitous barcodes allow an eight to 14 digit number to be read by a laser scanner. For example, barcode 4-003994-111000 identifies a box as being a 375 gram pack of Kellogg's Corn Flakes.However, that number does not directly capture any other information that might interest a shopper - such as ingredients, allergens or country of origin - nor does it provide a retailer with useful details such as the batch number or sell-by date.That data is usually printed on the pack, but consumers increasingly want to read it online, or with a smartphone app such as one that measures calories. Retailers want data that can be scanned for tasks such as quickly locating faulty goods for recall or about-to-expire products for mark downs.SUSTAINABLE AND SAFE?GS1, the non-profit organization that assigns the unique numbers in barcodes, has developed a double-layered barcode it calls the ""data bar"" which can carry some extra details such as expiry date, quantity, batch or lot number.That has allowed German retailer Metro to launch PRO Trace, a smartphone app that shows, for example, that a filet of salmon on sale at a store in Berlin on Aug. 25 was caught at the Bremnes Seashore fish farm off the coast of Norway on Aug. 17 and processed in Germany on Aug. 21.The app also displays a map highlighting the fishing area of the catch and a detailed description of the Atlantic salmon.Metro says the app helps customers at its cash-and-carry stores such as professional chefs from hotels and restaurants, as they can now embellish their menus with information about the exact origin of pricey delicacies such as wagyu beef.""We are the only ones in Germany that can do this for fresh fish. It's about trust. Our customers challenge us to offer sustainable and safe products,"" said Lena vom Stein, a corporate responsibility project manager at Metro.Metro set up the tracking scheme to help it comply with European Union regulations aimed at stemming overfishing and started making the data available to customers in 2012. It now extends to meat, and fresh fruit and vegetables will follow.Other retailers are also opening up, often supplementing the barcode with a pixilated square known as a quick response (QR) code. It can store dozens more data points and can be scanned by a smartphone camera to lead to a web page, but can still not be read by the majority of store scanners.Dutch retailer Albert Heijn recently introduced ""Check Origin"" QR labels on locally-grown radishes and blueberries. Scan the sticker on a mobile phone and it plays a film that rewinds to show the journey from the shelf back to the packing factory, then back to the farmer's field.Such tools are likely to fuel demands for more transparency. A GS1 survey found consumers are most interested in nutritional and ingredient information, details on allergens, organic certification, environmental impact and ethical standards.HARMONIZING DATAMaking such a wealth of data accessible via codes that can be scanned is only part of the problem. A bigger challenge is gathering, storing and standardizing the information in the first place.Fiona Wheatley, sustainable development manager at British retailer Marks and Spencer (LONDON:MKS), says keeping tabs on all the company's suppliers can be a daunting task.""Your ability to give your customers more confidence that they can rely upon is proving to be increasingly challenging,"" she said, adding that M&S relies on certification schemes such as Fairtrade to help audit smallholder farmers.David Linich, supply chain expert at consultants Deloitte, advises retailers to find ways to work together to monitor the thousands of producers they buy from: ""If you go it alone it can be really burdensome, really cost prohibitive.""The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), a global network of some 400 retailers and manufacturers from 70 countries, is coordinating efforts to harmonize product data and labeling.Most firms accept that more transparency is needed after scares such as the 2013 scandal about horsemeat being sold as beef in Europe, but it is still proving hard to persuade them to share data that many see as commercially sensitive.Capgemini's Jacobs, who is working on the CGF project, hopes pilot schemes to standardize digital information, like one between rival retailers in Belgium including Delhaize,  Carrefour  (PARIS:CARR) and Colruyt, could be the precursors to new global data standards.GS1 already holds data from 30,000 companies on some 18 million products that its industry members share with each other behind the scenes to smooth logistics. It is trying to persuade its members to let consumers access more of this information, while keeping some of it confidential, such as detailed pricing and stock levels.Malcolm Bowden, president of global solutions at GS1, predicts agreement could come quickest - within a year - on sharing nutrition data as there are already broadly accepted standards, and calorie and allergen apps are proliferating. ""The will is there. It has to happen. Like any major change, big companies have to have time to think through the implications,"" he said.GS1 is also working to create identifier numbers for individual farms and is trying to harmonize standards on sustainability data, such as a measure of water efficiency for detergents and washing powders currently being piloted.But making such a wealth of data available will sound the death knell for the barcode. Only a QR code can carry that much information without taking up too much space on packaging.Longer term, more products could carry wireless tags such as the RFID labels that are being widely rolled out across the fashion industry. These tiny tags, which can be embedded in an object and, unlike a barcode or QR code, do not need to be within the line of the sight of a reader, were long too expensive for everyday goods but their price is falling fast.Bowden predicts different systems will probably have to coexist for the next decade or so as retailers and logistics providers gradually upgrade their scanning systems.""I am convinced we will have a day where pretty much all information about all products will be available to all consumers,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

274,"Jul 23, 2015 01:16AM ET",Wal-Mart buys out China e-commerce firm Yihaodian in online push,nan,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) has taken full ownership of Chinese e-commerce firm Yihaodian.com, buying out the 49 percent stake that it did not already own to accelerate its push online, the U.S. retail giant said on Thursday.The investment will help Wal-Mart target China's fast-growing online market at a time when largely brick and mortar retailers are feeling the pinch of competition from online rivals and a slowing of the world's second-largest economy.Wal-Mart's move also comes after China said last month it will allow full foreign ownership of some e-commerce businesses, with the goal of encouraging foreign investment and the development and competitiveness of the sector.""[Yihaodian's] local experience, combined with Walmart's global sourcing and our strong local retail presence and supply chain will allow us to deliver low prices on the products customers need in new and exciting ways,"" Neil Ashe, head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce division, said in a statement.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, added the purchase of the stake would help accelerate its e-commerce business in China and boost coordination between its physical and online stores. It did not disclose the price paid for the stake, which was bought from former executives and financial services group Ping An.Wal-Mart's Asia head Scott Price told Reuters earlier this year that online retail was important to help tap China's younger generations and that the firm would increasingly look to weave together its online and offline presence in the market.Wal-Mart, France's  Carrefour  (PARIS:CARR) SA and Britain's  Tesco  (LONDON:TSCO) PLC have all seen sales growth slip over the last five years in China, losing market share to local rivals, according to consumer analytics firm Kantar Worldpanel.The U.S. retailer also announced on Thursday that company insider Wang Lu will take the helm at Yihaodian. The e-commerce firm's CEO and Chairman had quit earlier this month ""to pursue their next venture"".In 2012, Wal-Mart took control of Yihaodian by bumping up its stake to 51 percent. Yihaodian, though, is dwarfed in China by e-commerce leaders  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc."
275,"Jul 20, 2015 08:56AM ET",Search for justice lags post-war boom in Ivory Coast,nan,"By Joe BavierBLOLEQUIN, Ivory Coast (Reuters) - Four years after the civil war ended in Ivory Coast the economy is booming, but for men like Yaboua Assie, who lost two young daughters in one of the conflict's most notorious massacres, the justice they seek remains as elusive as ever. The killings took place in a grassy lot behind the government offices in the small town of Blolequin, an event Assie relives almost nightly in his dreams. ""When I close my eyes, I'm here in this courtyard,"" he says, gazing around the walled compound, which was meant to be a refuge for those fleeing the 2011 war.He stands at the edge of a rectangular depression that until recently was a mass grave containing the remains of 45 massacred civilians. Two were his daughters: one 12, the other six months old.The bodies were exhumed by an investigative unit charged with prosecuting rights abuses during the conflict, in which campaigners say 3,000 people were killed.The war started when then-president Laurent Gbagbo refused to quit despite losing an election to Alassane Ouattara in late 2010.Four years later, with Ouattara in power, Ivory Coast is forging ahead - its economy forecast to grow 9 percent this year - but the quest for justice has lagged behind, hampered by lack of government support, rights groups say.Gbagbo was extradited to the International Criminal Court in The Hague charged with crimes against humanity. His top political and military supporters were jailed. Dozens, including his wife Simone who is also wanted by the ICC, were convicted in Ivory Coast this year.By contrast, Ouattara's military backers have received top posts in the army, despite allegations they too were responsible for civilian massacres.With elections in October, Ouattara is keen to face down accusations of 'victor's justice' from sections of Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front party and opposition groups. The president has pledged no-one will be above the law. Last week, rights groups revealed that around 20 former rebels serving in the army had finally been indicted for alleged crimes committed during the crisis. But the families of many victims have little faith that those who did the killing will pay for their crimes.When pro-Gbagbo mercenaries attacked his neighbors that March day in 2011, Assie saved himself and his 5-year-old daughter by playing dead as the bodies piled up on top of him.""It's war. They say to let it go. And we let it go,"" he says. ""When something is ruined, it's ruined.""A POINTLESS SPECTACLE?In Abidjan, commercial capital of the world's largest cocoa exporter, the completion of a long-awaited third bridge across the lagoon last year marked a symbolic end to a decade of stagnation following an earlier 2003-2004 civil conflict.The return of the headquarters of the African Development Bank, which had moved to Tunis in the wake of that conflict, is seen as a sign of a return to stability. An opinion poll last month by the Washington-based International Republican Institute showed public support for Ouattara. Two-thirds of respondents said the country was heading in the right direction, and more than three-quarters approved of the job being done by the president.Yet the same polls underlined one of the main failures of his first term: slow progress towards healing Ivory Coast's deeply divided society. The National Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up in the wake of the conflict recorded the lowest approval rating of the 14 institutions included in the poll at just 37 percent. And just 18 percent of the country's citizens believe justice had been served to all Ivorians following the post-election crisis. ""The slow judicial process and dubious impartiality cast a shadow on reconciliation and mid- and long-term stability prospects,"" said Gilles Yabi, an analyst and founder of the West Africa-focused think tank Wathi. Scepticism has bred resistance to the exhumations in some quarters. Justice Minister Mamadou Gnenema Coulibaly, who views them as critical to building criminal cases, questions the motives of those opposed to the process. ""Some think we are looking to incriminate Gbagbo. If they are pro-Gbagbo, they'll act in bad faith,"" he told Reuters. ""Others think we are looking for proof of their own involvement in the crimes and they try to block things."" The government's handling of previous investigations has contributed to the reticence. Julien Kpahi last saw his brother loaded into an army truck early one morning in 2012 after an attack on a camp for war-displaced civilians outside the town of Duekoue.Witness accounts implicated government soldiers and pro-Ouattara traditional Dozo hunters in the raid, which took place a year after Gbagbo fell. The government has never acknowledged any role in the violence. Months later, a survivor led Kpahi to a well where he said his brother's body had been thrown. Under pressure from human rights groups, authorities opened an investigation, removed six bodies from the well and brought them to Abidjan for autopsy. Kpahi has heard nothing since. Three years later, his brother's remains have yet to be returned.""I have no hope it will lead to anything,"" said Kpahi, who was recently prevented from visiting the well by U.N. peacekeepers. ""For me, it's pointless ... It's a spectacle.""FIRST STEPFor Human Rights Watch researcher Jim Wormington, this month's indictments of pro-Ouattara commanders were a promising sign but only a first step. Among those formally accused are Lieutenant Colonel Cherif Ousmane, the deputy head of Ouattara's presidential guard, and Lieutenant Colonel Losseni Fofana, another senior commander. ""To prove its commitment to impartial justice, the government should provide the judiciary with the support it needs to finish the investigations and bring the cases to trial,"" he said. In Duekoue's  Carrefour  (PARIS:CARR) neighborhood, there are plenty who doubt this will happen. On March 28, 2011, hundreds of people were killed in an area predominantly inhabited by Gueres, an ethnic group seen as among Gbagbo's staunchest supporters. Here, no amount of economic progress will convince the war's victims to turn the page. And residents like Georges Doue, 51, who lost seven members of his family in the massacre, have little faith the government will investigate the killings.""There's no trust,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

280,"Jun 02, 2015 09:20AM ET",Wal-Mart makes slow progress navigating Africa's challenges ,nan,"By Tiisetso MotsoenengJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - When Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) spent $2.4 billion on a stake in South Africa's Massmart (J:MSMJ) five years ago, the world's biggest retailer said it was buying a gateway to high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa.Despite its powerful U.S. backer, South Africa's number three retailer, selling everything from food to electronics, has added fewer than 10 stores to the existing 25 outside its home market since 2010, lagging rival Shoprite, which doubled its outlets to 300.Massmart's slow inroads into the rest of the continent, touted as the next big growth area, highlight the challenges of doing business in Africa, and raise questions about Wal-Mart's goal of rapid expansion abroad.""From the start the Africa Rising story was a bit euphoric when looking at it from a retail point of view, and Wal-Mart is now facing the reality,"" said Boris Planer, analyst at London's Planet Retail.South Africa's Shoprite, which many investors expected to be a casualty of Wal-Mart's investment in Massmart, has nevertheless pushed ahead in familiar local markets where the U.S. retail giant has moved more cautiously.""If you want extra growth, you've got to take on that extra risk,"" said Wayne McCurrie, a fund manager at Momentum Wealth in Pretoria.""Recognising that risk, by that I mean a severe shortage of shopping infrastructure, Shoprite started setting up warehouses and partnering with developers to build shopping centres and that's why it is in this quick store rollout phase whereas Massmart is a little bit behind.""Guy Hayward, an accountant who took over as Massmart CEO a year ago, acknowledges the need to catch up with Shoprite, whose CEO cheekily asked in 2013: ""Where is Wal-Mart?""""We all face challenges but Shoprite has done a good job in getting ahead,"" he told Reuters.Wal-Mart's slow progress in Africa also underscores the struggles the U.S. company faces in pursuing a rapid expansion to 27 countries and 6,300 stores outside the U.S. market. Scott Mushkin, who covers Wal-Mart at Wolfe Research, has argued Wal-Mart should look to exit markets in Asia, Europe and Africa due to lower returns than in the Americas. ""We believe these operations are a distraction from what appears to be a fairly synergistic operating model from Canada to Chile,"" he wrote in a note to clients this month. Wal-Mart said it was still committed to Africa.""We are excited by the retail opportunities in Africa and we're confident in the ability of Massmart's leadership to drive future growth,"" said Marilee McInnis, director of International Corporate Affairs at Walmart. FAILED DEALSThe last five years in Africa have been punctuated, for Massmart, by deals that failed to come off.Grant Pattison, who abruptly resigned last year as chief executive, tried and failed to buy Botswana's biggest grocer Choppies Enterprises (BT:CHOPP), Ramachandran Ottapathu, Choppies CEO told Reuters. In Kenya, Massmart was unable to complete a deal with private retailer Naivas because of a family dispute over its ownership.At home, too, some customers are underwhelmed by Massmart's performance. Famed for its aggressive pricing, it appears to be struggling to compete with Shoprite on cheap groceries.""I was very excited when I heard Wal-Mart is bringing low prices to South Africa but I haven't seen that,"" said Themba Khumalo, a 31-year old bank teller outside a Johannesburg shopping mall. Wal-Mart has also had problems in its bid to fast-track the expansion of Massmart's grocery unit Game. Massmart has complained to the competition watchdog against three rivals over shopping mall leases that prevent Game from selling groceries.AFRICA RISING Wal-Mart, and other international companies, want to benefit from a continent poised for dynamic growth fuelled by a rising young population of workers and consumers and global demand for its commodities, an idea known as 'Africa Rising'.There are promising signs for retailers: Shoprite's Basson reported ""insatiable"" demand for big brands after five Shoprite stores in Angola sold more Red Bull cans than nearly all 400 stores in South Africa in one year.But others are also finding it tough. Woolworths (J:WHLJ), a Cape Town-based upscale retailer, pulled the plug on its Nigerian business, citing high rents and duties.The Spar Group (J:SPPJ), which runs franchise grocery stores, said its partner in Nigeria has managed to open just five of 20 planned stores, having struggled to find suitable real estate and having to import everything from lighting and tiles to refrigerators.Pick n Pay (J:PIKJ), South Africa's third biggest grocer by value, recently shut its franchise stores in Mozambique and Mauritius because they were not profitable.""Retail in Africa is just not that romantic, it's not easy. Anything that looks like an overnight success has probably been around for 20 years,"" said Pick n Pay Chief Executive Richard Brasher, while stressing the group is still seeking to expand.A common complaint is the time it takes to get goods from ports to shelves.""Even if you air-freight the goods and you think within a week your goods could be in store, it may take five weeks,"" said Ronnie Steyn, chief financial officer of TFG (J:TFGJ), the biggest reseller of  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn) products in South Africa. France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), the world's second biggest retailer by sales, has taken a cautious approach. It has focused on China and Brazil as its key markets for expansion, while opting in Africa for franchise deals with strong local connections. ""Going into Africa is still a little bit adventurous in a way, compared to, for example, Asia, which has mega-cities and plenty of shopping malls,"" said Marieke Witjes, a retail consultant at AT Kearney in Johannesburg. ""That's why a lot of international players are still kind of fearful about putting their money into Africa.""SPACE SHORTAGE Hayward said Massmart remained committed to expanding further into the rest of Africa but cited the familiar list of challenges, including haphazard property laws and poor infrastructure.Among the biggest is the shortage of real estate space and big malls, something that prompted Shoprite to raise 3 billion rand three years ago to team up with developers to build its own stand-alone stores in markets such as Nigeria.""Do I advise my clients to stay away from Africa given Wal-Mart's experience? No. Do I advise them to wait until there are enough shopping malls in countries like Nigeria to build critical mass? Yes,"" said one retail consultant in Johannesburg, who declined to be named.Hayward said Massmart has started setting up its own stand-alone stores and was also considering partnering with landlords on building properties.The strategy would help Massmart open 19 stores in several African countries by the end of February next year, and increase its trading space by more than 45 percent, he said. Gabriel Sacks, investment manager at Scottish-based Aberdeen Asset Management, the third largest shareholder in Massmart with more than 4 percent, is prepared to be patient.""Whilst we appreciate the market's frustration with the pace of growth, we are of the view that a more cautious approach to rolling out stores in Africa is no bad thing given our preference for capital discipline,"" Sacks said.""Faster growth would be welcome, but not at all costs.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

283,"Apr 29, 2015 02:22AM ET",Wal-Mart to expand China store network by nearly a third after  growth stalls,nan,"By Matthew Miller and Adam JourdanBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Giant U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) plans to expand its footprint in China by nearly a third by opening 115 new stores by 2017, the firm's chief executive said, in a renewed push to lure China's grocery shoppers despite slowing growth. ""Our aim is to become an integral part of China's economy,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday. ""China is a top priority.""Wal-Mart's new push in China comes as global supermarket firms seek ways to tackle slowing growth in the world's second-biggest economy. Wal-Mart in February said its China net sales declined 0.7 percent for the quarter ended Jan. 31, with comparable same-store sales falling 2.3 percent.As well as new stores to boost sales, the world's biggest retailer will close some under-performing stores and seek to tap into the faster-growing online grocery market through its Yihaodian.com service. McMillon said he was excited by prospects for a platform that offered 8 million products at end-2014, up from just 18,000 items in 2011.The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said the 115 new stores will be opened in cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wuhan between 2015 to 2017, without saying how much it would invest in the new outlets. It had 411 stores in China at the end of January this year, according to its annual report: The retailer said on Wednesday it will remodel more than 50 of these this year at a cost of more than 370 million yuan ($60 million). Scott Price, head of Wal-Mart's Asia operations, said the retailer would close an unspecified number of poorly performing stores after shutting 29 outlets in China last year. Commenting on recent sales trends, Price said, ""There is some softening in retail sales but we've gained share ... in the hypermarket channel."" Wal-Mart, France's  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) and Britain's  Tesco  PLC (L:TSCO) have all seen sales growth slip over the last five years, losing market share to local rivals, according to a report published on Tuesday from consumer analytics firm Kantar Worldpanel.Average same-store sales growth dropped into negative territory last year, according to an analysis of six major grocers by consultancy OC&C.CEO McMillon also addressed ongoing investigations into Wal-Mart's accounting by the company itself and government agencies. He said the company was investing in improving systems and processes to bolster compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corruption Practices Act. ""Being compliant with the law,"" McMillon said, ""That's a high priority for us.""

284,"Apr 25, 2015 02:12PM ET","Up to 150,000 Bangladesh workers lost jobs after Rana Plaza safety overhaul ",nan,"By Serajul QuadirDHAKA (Reuters) - Some 220 garment factories have shut down in Bangladesh with the loss of up to 150,000 jobs after the collapse of Rana Plaza shone a light on unsafe working conditions in the ready-to-wear industry, triggering a wave of inspections, according to a report on Saturday. More than 1,100 workers were killed when the building collapsed in 2013, creating urgent demands for global retailers to do more to ensure the safety of their workers in Bangladesh, the world's second biggest garment exporter after China.Since then, the $24 billion industry has been in the throes of a massive safety overhaul, with more than 2,000 of 3,500 exporting factories inspected by the government or as a result of retailer-led initiatives.German-based NGO Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB)said many factories had closed down because they failed to meet the stricter safety measures and better terms for their workers, or due to a fall in orders.It carried out a research between April 2014 and March 2015 which revealed that the rate of factory closures was nearly four times that of the previous year, while job losses had tripled. ""The factories, especially small and medium-sized factories were closed during this time due to cancellation of work orders from the buyers and lack of compliance,"" TIB Executive Director Iftekhar Uzzaman told Reuters.""It is feared that if the process continues, up to 700,000 workers may face loss of jobs."" The government has rejected the survey results, saying most of the closures were among the sub-contractors.""A number of factories were shut down, but those are small factories and did not have direct buyers,"" Mikail Shipar, secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment, told Reuters.""At the same time, the compliant factories who have ISO certificates continued to expand due to good business,"" he said, adding these had absorbed some of the workers who had lost their jobs.Iftekhar said that while 95 percent of factories had implemented the new minimum wage requirements, there had been complaints of irregular payments and pressure on the workers to raise their productivity by 60 percent.He also cited lack of accountability to monitor the activities of the inspectors, and lack of transparency in handling a $19 million fund collected from buyers and international organizations to help toward worker compensations. Fourteen brands, including JC Penney (N:JCP) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which traded with factories based in Rana Plaza had not contributed to the fund, while Wal-Mart (N:WMT) had donated only $1 million, much less than expected, Iftekhar said, quoting the TIB report.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Arcofina cited development roadblocks such as difficulties in securing land.Rising incomes and an underdeveloped retail sector have made Africa an important new growth destination for retailers and consumer goods companies, with the likes of  Danone  (PA:DANO), Pernod (PA:PERP) and  Diageo  (L:DGE) boosting investments to counter weak growth in Europe.The World Bank forecasts Algeria's economy will grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2016 -- more than double rates expected for the euro zone.Small independent grocers dominate Algeria's retail sector, where Carrefour would compete with Numidis, the retail unit of agro-food conglomerate Cevital, which had a 1 percent share of the 2014 local retail market by value, according to Euromonitor.LOW RISK Newcomers to Africa face many challenges including legal hurdles, lack of available property and transport infrastructure and setting up a reliable supplier base.Carrefour has thus chosen to expand on the continent through franchise deals with strong local connections to which it brings retailing skills while keeping investment to a minimum.This is because Europe's largest retailer has earmarked the bulk of its tight resources for expansion in its key markets of Europe, Brazil and China. ""Carrefour is unlikely to sustain ambitious expansion plans for the African continent in the short-term as it already has a lot on its plate in its key markets,"" said PlanetRetail analyst Gildas Aitamer.Carrefour has had franchise deals since 2009 with Morocco's Label'Vie (CS:LBV) for 62 stores and in Tunisia with Ulysse Hyper Distribution (UHD) since 1997 with 71 stores.In east Africa, it relies on long-time partner Dubai-based Majid al Futtaim (MAJ), its exclusive franchise holder for the Middle East, which operates Carrefour hypermarkets in Egypt and plans to open stores in Kenya this year. In 2013, Carrefour teamed up with Africa-focused trading firm CFAO (PA:CFAO) to open stores in eight west African countries. CFAO plans to open the first shopping center in Abidjan in the second half of 2015.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

288,"Mar 16, 2015 01:08AM ET","China consumer show targets Volkswagen, Nissan, Mercedes",nan,"By Adam Jourdan and Sue-Lin WongSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Car makers, including Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes Benz, said they are probing allegations aired late on Sunday by Chinese state TV that the firms oversold repairs and spare parts to drivers.The annual ""3.15"" consumer rights day investigative special, similar to CBS network's ""60 Minutes"" in the United States, also criticized Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] for gearbox problems in some cars.China is the world's top auto market, and media criticism can dent reputations and drag on sales. iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL) made a rare apology in 2013 after criticism on the show of its after-sales service.Mercedes and Jaguar Land Rover are already being probed by China for possible anti-competitive behavior. The Chinese venture of German car maker Volkswagen was fined last year for price-fixing.Volkswagen, a target two years ago of the China Central Television (CCTV) show, was also criticized in an article ahead of the program for its handling of a recall of its Sagitar model car. ""We have paid close attention to CCTV reporting ... and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers,"" said Volkswagen China spokeswoman Larissa Braun. Nissan's China joint venture said it would set up a team to investigate the allegations and strengthen regulation of its service teams, according to a statement on its official microblog.Mercedes Benz said it would launch a probe and urged dealers to reform their behavior. Land Rover apologized to its customers on its official microblog and said it was working to resolve the issue.PIG'S BLOODThe popular show, which singled out camera maker Nikon Corp (T:7731) last year, also said fast food chain Xiabuxiabu (HK:0520) had used pig's blood as a cheaper substitute for duck's blood - a popular hotpot delicacy.The firm said in a statement it would investigate the allegations and suspend sales of duck blood products.Fast-food outlet McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), supermarket chain  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) and home products firm Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) have also previously come under the show's spotlight.Some firms have pushed out cut-price deals to consumers in the run-up the event to win over consumers in case they are targeted on the show.CCTV itself has come under fire in China over the last couple of years, with some consumers rushing to defend its targets or simply changing channels.But marketing experts said that without damage control the impact of such shows in China could damage companies severely.""The 3.15 show still packs a punch to the firms targeted, and a poor or flippant response from a targeted company can evoke consumer outrage,"" said James Feldkamp, chief executive officer of consumer watchdog MingJian.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

289,"Mar 05, 2015 02:10PM ET",Europe firms may draw fire by joining buyback boom,nan,"By Lionel LaurentLONDON (Reuters) - European companies are likely to join a boom in share buybacks as central bank cash floods the economy, risking criticism that they are recycling capital rather than investing to promote growth.European firms are already cheering financial markets by increasingly following their U.S. counterparts in returning cash to investors, propping up their share prices while the euro zone economy remains sluggish.But with the European Central Bank starting a 1 trillion euro stimulus program on Monday, political pressure will probably grow on companies to use ultra-cheap funding for creating jobs rather than simply buying back their own shares.In the United States, years of Federal Reserve stimulus aimed at reviving the real economy led to the wave of share buybacks while firms neglected capital expenditure (capex).Few people expect European firms to match the staggering sums in the United States, where over $2 trillion of stock was bought back between 2009 and 2014, according to Reuters data. Nevertheless, about $8 billion worth of buybacks have already been announced by a dozen European companies this year, including ABInbev (BR:ABI) and ASML (AS:ASML).That appetite is likely to keep growing: European firms have over $1.5 trillion in cash on their balance sheets and few obvious places to reinvest it to earn a return. Borrowing costs are already at record lows relative to their earnings power, and with the ECB set to depress rates further with its quantitative easing (QE) program, buybacks are an easy answer.If the United States is any guide, big buybacks will attract criticism. A report by Barclays from September found that, even though capex remained the top form of U.S. cash-flow spending, the rate of growth of buybacks had far outstripped capex and this meant less cash was being reinvested for growth.""The debate over corporate spending will increase, especially in Europe, where there is more of an attempt to balance both government and the private sector,"" said Martin Schulz, portfolio manager at Cleveland, Ohio-based PVC Capital Advisors.""With QE, the average voter thinks they are going to get all this free money ... There's the expectation that corporations are going to reinvest cash. The political pressure will grow.""French companies got a taste of this last year, when President Francois Hollande told Le Monde newspaper that bosses should use tax credits to reinvest and hire instead of paying out dividends to shareholders.CAPEX DECLINECapex has by no means evaporated; for example French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said on Thursday it would lift capital spending in 2015 to cement a revival in its European hypermarkets. But as a proportion of net sales, capex has declined globally since the 1990s, according to a 2013 OECD paper.In the United States, dividend payouts and share buybacks rose more than 40 percent between 2010 and 2013, eclipsing capex and effectively turning firms into ""giant capital recyclers"", according to a Citi research paper in 2014.By contrast, a survey by the U.S. Industrial Research Institute found that more than two thirds of laboratory and R&D leaders expected little to no change in their budgets in 2015.While one might have expected more spending on mergers and takeovers,  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC)' figures suggest most of the rebound in U.S. deal-making after the financial crisis was paid for in stock, with the cash component declining.But European firms won't necessarily become giant capital recyclers, borrowing funds just to buy back shares, in large numbers.Apart from the biggest corporations, most rely on bank borrowing to raise debt and European lenders are less likely to have the capacity to fund buybacks that do nothing to boost future profits than the bond market, where many U.S. firms get cash.""The way QE is going to be transmitted over here is very different ... The corporate debt market is significantly smaller,"" said Tim Crockford, portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management.Executives' pay is also less tied up in stock options than in the United States, investors say, making another factor that might discourage a buyback frenzy in Europe.However, European buyback volumes remain well below their pre-crisis peak - totaling $38.3 billion in 2014 versus $157.8 billion in 2007 - giving scope for growth. Lucrative reinvestment opportunities are also likely to take more time to find and win board approval while the economy remains weak.""In Europe, we are not yet in a phase where we will see the use of balance-sheet (spending) on capex,"" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of multi-asset investing at ING Investment Management. ""The exception may be Germany, which is in a different phase of recovery. In the rest of Europe, a move into capex will be at least a couple of years away.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I can't afford to rent, let alone ensure my children eat every day,"" she said.The 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010, killed more than 200,000 people, leveled much of Port-au-Prince and left 1.5 million Haitians homeless.While the number of people living in makeshift shelters has dropped by 94 percent, 79,000 people like Fenfen are still living in Port-au-Prince's squalid tent camps. ""These are the people who are the most vulnerable, who have few solutions ... (these) are the people who are most in need of humanitarian assistance,"" said Gregoire Goodstein, the International Organisation for Migration's (IOM) chief of mission in Haiti.Political instability, along with longstanding land tenure problems and a cholera epidemic, have stalled efforts to resettle homeless Haitians in new housing, experts say.POLITICAL DEADLOCKThe United States and the United Nations have expressed concern that the Caribbean state is on the brink of political chaos over long-delayed elections.Last month President Michel Martelly nominated former Port-au-Prince mayor and veteran politician Evans Paul as prime minister to replace Laurent Lamothe, who quit after weeks of nationwide protests and pressure by opposition lawmakers.Demonstrators, accusing the government of corruption, have demanded that Lamothe and Martelly resign and elections be held. Municipal polls and elections for a third of the Senate's seats were meant to have taken place in 2012.The political impasse has slowed efforts to resettle Haiti's remaining camp dwellers, experts say.""I think if the funding is there, if there's political stability, if the hurricane season is not too disruptive, then yes, within 12 months we could close down all the tent camps,"" Goodstein told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview at his office in Port-au-Prince.As donor funding and interest in Haiti's reconstruction have waned, few of the remaining 105 tent camps spread across the capital have adequate supplies of drinking water, enough toilets and proper waste disposal. ""The water supply stopped in 2012,"" said Fenfen. ""But what's worst is living here during the hurricane season. The tent floods and it collapses in the wind.""TOO FEW NEW HOMESThe hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere, have not resulted in as many new, permanent brick homes as Haitians had hoped for. Although there are signs of reconstruction with some roads now paved and luxury hotel chains and new offices sprouting up across Port-au-Prince, aid agencies estimate a shortage of 500,000 homes in the capital.In addition, most of the temporary shelters, built for around 114,000 of those who became homeless after the earthquake, were only meant to last five years. On the other side of the capital, Marie Eveline Lielin, a single mother of two, is one of the lucky ones. After enduring a tent camp for three years, she now lives in one of 45 pastel-colored two-storey homes, built last year in the Carrefour (PARIS:CARR) Feuilles neighborhood with international aid.The houses were given to those landowners whose homes had been destroyed by the earthquake, provided they gave free lodging to a displaced family for three years. ""Now when it rains I don't have to worry anymore. I'm very lucky to be here,"" said Lielin.But housing developments like these are few and far between.In a desolate area on the capital's outskirts sit rows of box-like rental homes, 3,000 houses built with Venezuelan aid in 2013 as part of the Lumane Casimr Village housing project.Nearly 20 months on, scores of the homes are still empty. Critics say the houses were built without first providing the infrastructure needed, such as roads, shops and schools. Other resettlement schemes being run by the Haitian government, the IOM and other international aid agencies include the offer of a one-off payment of $500 - the equivalent of a year's rent - if families can find a safe place to live.Back in her airless tent, Fenfen wonders when her turn will come to move into a rented room.""Every day I wait to get selected,"" she said. ""I keep hoping.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

300,"Dec 18, 2014 02:32AM ET","In South Korea, IKEA opens biggest store to lure tiny households",nan,"By Joyce Lee and Kahyun Yang SEOUL (Reuters) - Iconic Swedish furniture retailer IKEA built its biggest store in the world to serve South Korea's shrinking households, targeting millions of people living alone with Korea-only items like super-sized single beds and in-store kimchi rice. The store opened on Thursday in Gwangmyeong, less than an hour's drive or 14 minutes by train from central Seoul, with a sales space nearly as big as the Louvre museum at 59,000 square meters. The previous record-holder at IKEA, known for its inexpensive, self-assembly products, was in Stockholm spanning 55,200 square meters. Stiff domestic competition and sluggish spending have made South Korea an unhappy hunting ground for global retail giants like Wal-Mart (N:WMT) and Carrefour (PA:CARR), who exited years ago. But IKEA's design appeal to South Korea's urban crowds, and few big local rivals, leave it well placed, retail experts say. ""Korea has a population structure that fits IKEA's basic growth DNA - demand from design-conscious one-person and two-people households,"" said Suh Yong-gu, professor of marketing at Sookmyung Women's University. With the world's fastest-aging population, South Korea's attraction has faded for general retailers. Private spending growth fell from 4.4 percent on-year in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2013. But IKEA, now present in 43 countries with 365 stores, could fill a niche as it plans to grow to five outlets by 2020. As younger people marry later or not at all, the number of one-person households in the nation of 51 million people will climb to 34.3 percent of the total by 2035 from 25.3 percent in 2012, according to Statistics Korea - and each home needs furniture. IKEA will offer a new challenge to the country's legion of furniture makers, many of which are small. About 61 percent of a total of 1,247 firms in 2012 employed less than 20 people, private think tank Hana Institute of Finance said. ""I came because it's inexpensive and useful, and I wanted to buy after seeing for myself,"" said Woo Jin-sook, a 46-year old from Seoul. Woo said she took a day off work to be at the store's opening. Among the 8,600 items on sale, some were modified for local tastes. The ""super-single"" bed, brought specifically for Korea, offers sleepers up to 40 centimeters more snooze width than a standard single bed. Alongside its Swedish meatballs, the store's restaurant offers kimchi bibimbap, a rice bowl mixed with the spicy South Korean staple side dish, and Korean barbecue. ""We never planned the biggest store, we just planned a big store, because we believe we need one for a 23-million city (the Seoul metropolitan area),"" said Patrick Schuerpf, IKEA Korea's Country Project Manager.

301,"Dec 13, 2014 11:36AM ET",Mega retailers battle to survive as e-commerce booms in China,nan,"By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI (Reuters) - It took China's biggest retail chain Suning all last year to generate sales of about $17 billion. Last month, e-commerce giant Alibaba saw sales worth more than half that amount pass through its Tmall website in just one day. Big retailers like Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and foreign rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc are struggling to attract customers to their traditional stores in China, where online shopping is booming. ""The trend is definitely towards e-commerce because that's where the consumers are,"" said Frank Lavin, CEO of Export Now, which helps global firms launch their business in China. ""The 'big box' model here is already crowded. You need to invest a lot and be here on a large scale to make it work."" This month, Best Buy sold its Chinese business, which had struggled to fend off local rivals.  Other firms have also complained that operating in China has become more challenging. This week, Wal-Mart said it had found pricing discrepancies on its China books, which reportedly were made to make its retail business look better at a time when transactions were slowing and unsold inventory was piling up.  French hypermarket operator Carrefour SA has also reported weak China sales.  One of the main challenges facing retail chains is the shopping habits of Chinese consumers. Most prefer the convenience, and often lower prices, offered by online shopping and when it comes to food, many people would rather go to local grocers than big supermarkets. Showrooming, or visiting a physical store to check out an item and then buying it online, is also common. ""I usually go to offline stores to check the real products, then I will go online to compare the price and services of different online stores,"" said Lena Chen, 31, a university professor in Shanghai. ""That means I rarely buy in stores such as Suning or Best Buy, though they do help me decide what to buy,"" she said. Traditional retailers have taken note. Sun Art Retail Group Ltd, China's largest hypermarket operator, launched an online store this year and said its e-commerce business would help drive future sales. Suning and rival Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd are also trying to boost online sales to help revive profit growth. The competition between traditional retailers, as well as their e-commerce rivals, means firms spend more on marketing and discounts, giving those with the deepest pockets an advantage. Alibaba, which recently raised a record $25 billion in an initial public offering, saw more than $9 billion of trade on its online Tmall platform on its annual ""Singles Day"" shopping event last month, while JD.com Inc, China's second largest e-commerce firm, said revenues rose 61 percent to $4.73 billion in the third quarter of the year.  ""E-commerce just amplifies competition and some players in the consumer space will get squeezed out,"" said Torsten Stocker, Hong Kong-based partner at consultancy firm A.T. Kearney.

302,"Oct 16, 2014 12:30PM ET",New Tesco boss likely to sell assets to fund recovery plan,nan,"By Kate Holton, Simon Jessop and James Davey LONDON (Reuters) - Just six weeks into his job, Tesco (L:TSCO) boss Dave Lewis must look at selling assets in Britain and abroad as he battles to raise funds to pull the world's No.3 grocer out of the deepest crisis in its 95-year history. Trading at the British retailer has deteriorated to such an extent that its debt and ballooning pension deficit mean it could do with more cash. And that's even before it starts to consider the cost of a plan to revive sales. Some analysts and investors think Lewis should take advantage of his status as a new arrival to ask shareholders for money, rather than selling off valuable businesses such as its stores in Thailand or customer data specialist Dunnhumby. But a rights issue, which some think should top 3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion), could prove a hard sell when Tesco is in the midst of investigations into the discovery of a 250 million pound black hole in its accounts. Plus, several investors want to see the recovery plan first. ""No rights issue without a detailed strategy and without first trying to sell non-core assets at good prices,"" said David Herro of investors Harris Associates, which recently cut its stake in Tesco to 1 percent from 3 percent. Harris, which has $130 billion of assets under management, is not convinced Tesco will need a rights issue at all, unless UK operating profitability totally collapses. Yet pressure is building on Tesco's finances. Its adjusted net debt of 6.6 billion pounds is now 3.2 times operating cash flow, way ahead of a company target of 2.5 times and likely to rise, according to Morgan Stanley. Its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.76 versus an industry median of 0.53, Reuters data show. Meanwhile, its pension deficit is 3.2 billion pounds from 2.4 billion a year ago. Those factors, plus plunging profits, mean credit ratings agencies have warned they could downgrade the firm. A one notch cut would leave Tesco a single notch above ""junk"" status. ""HUGE MISTAKE"" Once an apparently unstoppable engine of growth, Tesco started to hit problems in the late 2000s when it held back investment at home to spend on new operations in Asia and eastern Europe, and an expensive failure in the United States. The mistakes cost it dear, as it was slow to respond to changes in shopping habits. Its big out-of-town stores lost favor as shoppers moved to buy more locally and online, while discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket chains Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) put the squeeze on the middle ground. The crisis came to a head this year, with three profit warnings in 64 days and the discovery of the accounting mistake, leaving billionaire Warren Buffett to describe his near 4 percent stake in Tesco as a ""huge mistake"". He has since cut it. HSBC analyst David McCarthy thinks Lewis should act quickly, and ask shareholders for at least 3 billion pounds to fight back against its main British rivals -- Wal-Mart's Asda (N:WMT), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), and Morrisons (L:MRW). He believes that could also block Sainsbury's from following a similar path as it too has come under trading pressure. ""With Tesco addressing some of its problems by using a rights issue, this would limit the ability of its competitors to go down a similar route to respond to a rebasing in profits,"" he said. ""Investors should only back one horse in this race."" But a rights issue could be complicated by the accounting scandal. Lewis has had to suspend eight senior staff over the profit mis-statement and is grappling with an internal forensic investigation and a probe by Britain's financial regulator. ""When you go to London markets to raise capital you need all these things signed off,"" one banker with experience in London equity fundraisings told Reuters. ""You wouldn't want to raise capital and then find out there were more holes."" Lewis is expected to update the market on Tesco's own investigation on Oct. 23 along with delayed first-half results. Investors and analysts think he may use his first public presentation to lower profit forecasts again and announce a further dividend cut, following a reduction in August. Major strategic decisions are likely to come later -- another reason why shareholders might be cool on a rights issue. ""Tesco needs to simplify the group by selling assets, strengthening the balance sheet and reinvesting into the core UK business,"" a top 20 investor said on the condition of anonymity. ""The most enhancing way (to strengthen the balance sheet) is to sell assets and not dilute shareholders with a rights issue."" That would follow the path taken by France's Carrefour (PA:CARR), which has listed or sold assets abroad to focus on the turnaround of its domestic business. ""A REAL CONUNDRUM"" Tesco's most lucrative non-core assets are its businesses in South Korea and Thailand. Morgan Stanley estimates the South Korean business, if listed, could be valued between 3.2 billion pounds and 4.9 billion pounds. It puts Thailand at between 4.3 billion pounds and 7.2 billion pounds. Analysts are less optimistic around eastern European assets where there are few local players that might be buyers. Morgan Stanley values Tesco's international operations, excluding Ireland, at between 10.2 and 17.3 billion pounds. British assets Tesco could put on the block include Dobbies garden centers, and Dunnhumby, the consumer data company behind the Clubcard loyalty scheme. Tesco Bank could also be listed, while the restaurant group Giraffe and a stake in British coffee chain Harris & Hoole could be sold. However, investors note that these could help draw customers back into stores. A person familiar with the situation has told Reuters that Tesco is reviewing around 50 different options, including a rights issue and the sale of non-core assets. Some decisions are already being made. Lewis has informed staff at the Blinkbox digital service it will either be sold or closed and the embarrassing revelation that the group had recently taken hold of its fifth corporate jet was met with the announcement that all would be sold. However, asset sales are not a solution in themselves, and the risk is that Tesco sells high growth businesses to invest in more price cuts and promotions in Britain, which so far have done nothing to revive its fortunes. ""You have a real conundrum,"" one sector banker said. ""Investing in prices and promotions is just money down the drain,"" he said of the highly competitive UK grocery market. ""Lewis has got so much on his plate, he will have to think about divestments. But the Asian businesses in particular are good -- is it a good time to sell a high growth business?""

304,"Oct 08, 2014 10:00AM ET",Price cuts no quick cure for Tesco's ills,nan,"By James Davey LONDON (Reuters) - Cheaper meat and vegetables should draw shoppers back into Tesco (L:TSCO) stores but it will take time for the new boss of Britain's biggest grocer to win back market share. Customers seeking to save money in a sluggish economy have turned away from the market leader to discounters such as Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL], igniting a price war in British grocery shopping and contributing to a series of Tesco profit warnings. Tesco still wants to be a mid-range retailer and not a discounter but former Tesco directors, retail experts and analysts say Dave Lewis must urgently put lower and simplified prices for staples at the center of a new trading strategy. He has over 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) to further cut the cost of goods such as milk, bread and carrots in the hope that shoppers will fill their baskets with more profitable products but international experience shows it takes time to impact sales. ""He can make a difference pretty quickly. Will it show up in the numbers straight away? Probably not,"" said a former director of the British business, which makes up two-thirds of group profit. Tesco declined to comment for this story. Having grown rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s by offering low prices, a range of high quality food and innovative marketing, Tesco responded to falling sales in the economic downturn by hiking prices. A second former Tesco director said that prices are now as much as 10 percent above Aldi and Lidl. Tesco is now reeling from an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading that has knocked 4 billion pounds off its market value in a matter of weeks. Fears are also growing the scandal could impact Tesco's sales in the crucial Christmas period. To make matters worse, Britain's grocery market is growing at its slowest pace in over 20 years due to falling food prices, consumers shopping around and restaurants luring diners out. Tesco's ""big four"" rivals - Wal-Mart's (N:WMT) Asda, Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Morrisons (L:MRW) - have all cut prices and with the latter also taking Aldi and Lidl head on with a price matching scheme and loyalty card, there is an urgent need for a strategy re-think. ""Tesco has to address the fundamentals of its economic model and become more competitive,"" said a third former Tesco director, who asked not to be named. Under Lewis' predecessor Phil Clarke the higher prices failed to make up for the lower sales. It issued three profit warnings in two and a half years as it lost market share to the discounters as well as upmarket players Waitrose (JLP.UL) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS). Industry data published last month from Kantar Worldpanel showed Tesco's share continuing to slide at an alarming rate, down to 28.8 percent from 30.2 percent in September 2013. A year-on-year total sales fall of 4.5 percent implied a fall of 6-7 percent at stores open over a year, said analysts, making Tesco by far the worst performer of the big four. ENTRY TICKET According to the second former Tesco director, price cuts are the ""entry ticket"" to a fight back for a group that has most recently confused shoppers with a range of different promotions. ""Moving from where Tesco are now to get back to being where they were, which was competitive with Aldi and Lidl just a few years ago, you are going to have to (either) take a huge hit (to profit) or start now and take five or six years to get there,"" he said, on the condition of anonymity. Tesco's Aug. 29 profit warning has given Lewis some initial firepower to further cut prices and improve customer service, store standards and product availability. It slashed its half-year dividend by 75 percent, saving 900 million pounds assuming a similar cut to the final dividend, and reduced planned capital expenditure by 400 million pounds. In the longer term additions to the war chest could come from other cost savings, such as trimming Tesco's UK head office staff, the disposal of peripheral UK businesses and of struggling overseas operations, such as Turkey and central Europe, or from a separate flotation of its Asian businesses. A rights issue is also possible. Clarke always maintained that Tesco could not beat the discounters on price alone, hence his focus on improving stores. However, in February he launched 200 million pounds of price cuts on basic products and invested a similar amount on a fuel savings' scheme for holders of Tesco's Clubcard loyalty card. More rounds of price cuts, involving unquantified investment, followed and he had pledged more before he was fired. Last year Clarke also launched Tesco's ""Price Promise"" price-matching scheme, which gives customers coupons if their basket of shopping proves to be cheaper at big four rivals but not the discounters. However, some analysts think the scheme merely serves to remind customers how much more expensive Tesco is and could be scrapped by Lewis if he opts for a simpler pricing proposition. With genuinely lower prices Tesco could highlight the elements discounters don't have, like wide ranges of branded goods and general merchandise, and retail services like online shopping and banking. YEARS NOT MONTHS Lewis' problem is that dramatically reducing prices does not result in an instant sales increase as they reduce actual cash sales going through the tills before volumes, or basket sizes, improve. The experience from all the other major grocers that have undertaken significant price repositionings and had some success, such as Delhaize in Belgium, Carrefour (PA:CARR) in France, Ahold (AS:AHLN) in the Netherlands and Kroger (N:KR) in the U.S. is it takes years rather than months to make an impact. ""You have to wean customers off the high low promotions and educate them to the benefits of everyday low prices,"" said Bryan Roberts, Kantar Retail's director of research. ""You need to re-capture the lapsed shoppers and you need to communicate to potential new shoppers what you are doing and the benefits of it."" In March Morrisons, Britain's No. 4 grocer, set out a plan to restore its low-price image and boost sales volumes by spending 1 billion pounds cutting prices over the next three years. CEO Dalton Philips says he does not expect the plan to start to benefit its sales performance until next year. Asda moved from being a promotional grocer to an everyday low prices stance in 2013 and reckons that this year it has stemmed the loss of customers to discounters and attracted some from its three big rivals. Any move by Tesco will hit its UK trading margin, which fell 18 basis points to 5.03 percent in its 2013-14 year and is expected by analysts to fall to about 2.5 percent in 2014-15. Industry operating margins have come down to an average of about 1.6 percent in the last twelve months from 4.1 percent in the previous five years, according to Reuters data. And others even argue that the traditional relationship between price and volume has changed, making price wars futile.

That old putting price down, volume goes up adage has not worked because the market's saturated,"" Steve Rowe, head of Marks & Spencer's (L:MKS) food business told Reuters.

305,"Sep 23, 2014 04:40PM ET",Tesco-style accounting risks well known in retail industry,nan,"By Tom BerginLONDON (Reuters) - Tesco Plc's disclosure of huge accounting mistakes over contracts with its suppliers shocked industry analysts and executives, but not because they didn't realise the potential for disaster.On the contrary, they assumed that everyone in retailing was fully aware of the risks involved in accounting for rebates paid by suppliers to Britain's biggest supermarket groups, thanks to auditors' warnings.Therefore Tesco's (L:TSCO) revelation on Monday that it had overstated its profit forecast for the first half of the year by 250 million pounds ($409 million) came as a nasty surprise and wiped 2 billion pounds off its stock market value.Auditors routinely list risks that companies may face, and this year they have raised the supplier rebates - which have become a major part of the grocery business - in a number of firms' accounts following a change in disclosure rules.The auditors for all three of Britain's biggest publicly-quoted retailers - Tesco, Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Morrisons (L:MRW) - told investors in their most recent annual reports that their businesses faced material risks regarding the reporting of the supplier rebates. Those at the smaller online retailer Ocado did likewise.These cash payment or discount deals take many different forms, but suppliers typically offer them to the retailers in return for additional efforts to promote their products.Accountants said that such disclosures by auditors reflected more the growing importance of the supplier rebates than worries that companies didn't know how to account for them. ""The rules are pretty well established,"" said a senior auditor at one big accounting firm who asked not to be named.Companies can even buy software packages to help to track, analyse and account for such payments.Nevertheless, deciding how the rebates should be treated in accounts requires companies to exercise discretion, and therein lies the risk of the kind of trouble that has hit Tesco.Companies don't publish how much they receive in payments from suppliers. But France's Carrefour (PA:CARR), which vies with Tesco as the world's second largest supermarket group by revenue, said at the end of last year that it had over 1 billion euros (now $1.3 billion) in outstanding receivables from suppliers in relation to rebates and other commercial incentives.One industry executive said that rebate programmes typically lasted less than six months so the actual payments - known as supplier or commercial income - for a group of Carrefour or Tesco's size could run to billions of pounds.This may explain the size of writedown at Tesco.The company blamed ""accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs"" within its UK food business for the overstatement of its expected half-year profit.Some analysts said the mistake could reflect grey areas that sometimes exist when accounting for complex agreements, but others were sceptical that such a big downgrade could have resulted from a mere interpretational misunderstanding.""This, in our view, is not all an accounting issue but more a behavioural issue instilled by previous management,"" said Mike Dennis, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in London.Dennis and other analysts said they expected the problem was linked to attempts by the previous leadership team, including CEO Phil Clarke who lost his job in July, to revive the flagging business. Analysts at Bernstein warned investors that the irregularities had probably gone on for years ""since the pressure started on Tesco in 2011"".Reuters attempts to contact Clarke and former CFO Laurie McIlwee were unsuccessful. Tesco declined to comment on whether staff might have felt pressure to account for promotions aggressively.A MATTER OF JUDGMENTTesco gave little detail about what kinds of mistakes it suspects were made, but analysts said the statement about accelerated income recognition suggested a number of possible mechanisms.Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who was previously a supply chain director of Tesco Asia, said managers - possibly under pressure to improve earnings - might have brought forward promotions and the right to book supplier rebates.He said that managers might also have booked rebates that bridged more than one period, in an earlier single period.Sales forecasts could also have been a factor.Rebates are often tied to volumes. Last year British media reported that retailer John Lewis had told suppliers it expected a 0.75 percent discount in prices, or a reduction of over 5 percent if sales rose by 50 percent. In such a scenario, exactly how much rebate a manager could book would depend on the projected sales growth.John Lewis declined to comment on its programme.David McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said slowing sales growth at Tesco could have contributed to any inaccuracy in such calculations. ""We suspect Tesco may have been booking promotional rebates based on historic precedent rather than on current volumes,"" he said.Peter Pope, Professor of Accounting at the London School of Economics, said rebates were often tied to a retailer performing certain tasks. This meant a manager might also wrongly recognise revenues by booking them even when a supplier might feel they have not been earned.Several of these methods of improving earnings were flagged up in the auditors' notes included in the Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury and Ocado annual reports.This highlighted, Pope said, how internal controls should be there to avoid the kind of problems Tesco suffered. ""Because there is so much need for judgment and discretion to be exercised, good internal audit procedures should really monitor the veracity of all assumptions,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Kate Holton and James Davey; editing by David Stamp)"
306,"Jul 21, 2014 02:20AM ET",Tesco ditches CEO for Unilever man after profit warning,nan,"By James Davey and Martinne Geller LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (L:TSCO) is to ditch chief executive Philip Clarke and replace him with a turnaround specialist from Unilever (L:ULVR), ending a disastrous three year reign as Britain's biggest retailer warned it would again miss profit forecasts. Just three weeks after backing Clarke at Tesco's annual shareholder meeting, Chairman Richard Broadbent said on Monday it was now time to hand over to a new leader ""with fresh perspectives and a new profile."" Clarke, who has spent more than 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) on a failed recovery plan in Tesco's main home market, will be succeeded on Oct. 1 by Dave Lewis, who is credited with revamping a succession of businesses at consumer goods group Unilever and is currently its global president of personal care. A party scheduled for Tuesday to celebrate Clarke's 40-years at Tesco was promptly canceled. Analysts said the appointment of a non-retailer and the first outside CEO in Tesco's 95-year history could herald a major strategy re-think at the world's third-biggest stores group, which could include big price cuts to win back customers. ""A material change in UK trading strategy cannot be dismissed, which is likely to have considerable implications for the rest of the British sector,"" said Shore Capital's Clive Black, who upgraded his rating on Tesco stock to hold from sell. The darling of the retail sector during two decades of uninterrupted earnings growth, Tesco started losing ground in the UK in the final years of long-standing CEO Terry Leahy's tenure. Clarke issued his first profit warning in January 2012. More recently, it has been squeezed between discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] at one end and upmarket grocers such as Waitrose [JLP.UL] at the other, and hurt by the slowest growth in the overall UK grocery sector for over a decade. Its attempts to respond were hampered by its exposure to large out-of-town stores in the UK at a time when more shoppers are buying online, and costly mistakes abroad including a failed expansion into the United States, originally a Leahy initiative. Clarke, who started at Tesco as a teenager stacking shelves in a store managed by his father, fought back with a wide-ranging plan including trimming prices, revamping stores and product ranges and investing in internet shopping and technology such as the Hudl tablet. But the firm's market share and share price have continued to decline. One former Tesco director said Clarke, 54, ""confused activity with progress,"" took a series of ""short term knee jerk decisions"" and had failed to listen to colleagues. ""Phil has never listened, Phil is a teller,"" he said. According to researchers Kantar Worldpanel, Tesco's market share dropped to 28.9 percent in June from 30.7 percent when Clarke took over in March 2011. During the same period, Aldi grew to 4.7 percent from 2.1 percent and Lidl to 3.6 percent from 2.5 percent, while Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Wal-Mart's (N:WMT) Asda - Tesco's main rivals - remained largely stable. Analysts said Lewis' 27-years at a major supplier to the retail sector could help negotiate better prices and that his experience with branding could help a company that was no longer associated by many Britons with either low prices or quality. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE Tesco shares, which had been languishing near 10-year lows, rose around 3.5 percent in early trade. At 1337 GMT, they were up 1.9 percent at 290.5 pence, topping the FTSE-100 index. Shares in Sainsbury's and No. 4 player Morrisons (L:MRW) were down 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. ""Tesco needed somebody fresh from outside the organization. Looking at the company from a different perspective could be helpful,"" said one institutional shareholder in the retailer. With Lewis, 49, viewed as heir apparent to Unilever CEO Paul Polman, succession at that firm is now far less clear. ""Tesco's gain is Unilever's loss,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo, who said Lewis had a track record of turning round businesses in Argentina, Indonesia and also Britain. ""He (Lewis) knows the UK grocery industry very well from the supply side, which is an advantage. He's smart, entrepreneurial and commercial but at the same time he's unpretentious. I think he'll be a good leader and a good cultural fit."" Lewis was chairman of Unilever UK and Ireland from 2007 until 2010, when he became president of the Americas. He took on his latest role as head of personal care products in 2011. Still, analysts noted the transition from consumer goods to retail has not always been easy. Lars Olofsson, a former Nestle executive with no retail experience, took the top job at France's Carrefour (PA:CARR) in 2009, beginning what turned into a very troubled three years that saw a spate of profit warnings. Lewis will work alongside new Tesco finance chief Alan Stewart, who quit Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) earlier this month but may not start at Tesco for six months due to a non-compete clause in his contract. Tesco said trading had turned tougher than expected at the time of its first-quarter update on June 4, and that sales and trading profit in its fiscal first half were ""somewhat below expectations."" Shore Capital's Black estimated a 5-10 percent downgrade to his 2014-15 earnings forecast. Clarke, who had told reporters on June 4 ""I'm not going anywhere,"" will ""provide support"" to Lewis until January 2015, when he will get a year's salary in lieu of notice, Tesco said. Lewis will be paid a basic salary of 1.25 million pounds, 525,000 pounds in lieu of his current year cash bonus from Unilever and awards of equivalent expected value in lieu of deferred share awards from Unilever.

The company is exiting India after it failed to reach an agreement over a joint venture with Sunil Mittal's Bharti group, which had earlier partnered with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) in India.Franck Kenner, a spokesperson at Carrefour's India unit, declined to comment on whether it was planning to sell any of its stores to rivals, Bloomberg reported Monday. Carrefour’s exit from India is being seen as a part of CEO Georges Plassat’s three-year revival plan.In August 2012, shortly after taking over as CEO, Plassat had called for “vigilant” cost control across the business. The company has since exited underperforming markets, including Singapore, Malaysia and Greece in order to focus on key markets in Europe, China and Brazil.The company's five stores in India reported losses of $17 million in 2012, Business Standard reported Tuesday.Although India opened up its $500 billion retail sector to foreign direct investment, or FDI, in multi-brand retail in 2012, laws requiring mandatory local sourcing and the freedom given to each state to decide on the entry of global chains have discouraged many companies from investing in the country.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, had last year shelved its plans to open a retail store in the country. Following the Indian government’s decision to allow foreign companies to own a 51 percent stake in the multi-brand retail segment, only British supermarket operator Tesco (LONDON:TSCO) has announced plans to open stores in the country."

310,"Jun 10, 2014 05:15PM ET","When Eating Shrimp, There’s No Free Lunch ",nan,"By Connor Adams Sheets - Shrimp is Americans' seafood of choice, but the facts of the modern shrimping industry validate the old maxim that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Producing the world's shrimp supply destroys the environment, kills other sea creatures, and even supports human slavery.Shrimp, which like lobster was once seen as a sort of “cockroach of the seas” unfit for people’s plates, is now big business, one that the U.S. shrimp fishing industry is not able to keep pace with: more than 90 percent of all shrimp eaten in the country today is farmed overseas, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Foundation. In fact, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reports that the world faces a so-called aquaculture gap -- ""the 80 million metric ton difference between our global wild harvest and the world's demand for healthy seafood,” according to John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute.In the race to fill that gap, many shrimp companies take steps that do great damage to the environment, from trawling the ocean floor to farming shrimp in fetid conditions. One particularly alarming statistic comes from the FAO, which estimates that 85 percent of the marine animals caught by shrimp trawlers around the world is classified “bycatch” -- aka: a species other than edible shrimp -- that is simply dumped back into the ocean, often after being maimed or killed by nets and machinery.On Tuesday the story of shrimp grew even grimmer, as the Guardian released a report alleging that the world’s largest shrimp farmer, Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Foods (BK:CPF), relies on slave labor for the production of some of the fishmeal that it feeds to its farmed shrimp.The food giant, which provides prawns to many companies including the four largest international retailers -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT); Tesco (LONDON:TSCO); Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST); and Carrefour (PARIS:CARR). -- feeds its farmed shrimp fishmeal from suppliers that subject enslaved ship workers to beatings, torture and death, according to the Guardian’s investigation.The article alleges that forces laborers are subjected to 20-hour workdays and brutal execution-style killings at sea, and slavery is endemic in Thailand’s fishing industry.""Slaves forced to work for no pay for years at a time under threat of extreme violence are being used in Asia in the production of seafood sold by major U.S., British and other European retailers,"" the Guardian said.The Guardian's report comes just months after an investigative report by the Environmental Justice Foundation, titled ""Slavery at Sea,"" asserted that Thailand’s billion-dollar seafood industry is a breeding ground for human trafficking and exploitation.For Beth Lowell, campaign director for seafood fraud at the ocean advocacy organization Oceana, the issues of slavery and worker exploitation are two of many reasons governments, consumers and companies need to take steps to ensure that shrimp and other seafood is coming from sustainable, reliable, above-board sources. The goal is “boat-to-plate traceability in all seafood,” she said.“This is a perfect example of why you need traceability in your supply chain, so you can verify the sourcing of the fish you’re purchasing,” Lowell said. “Especially large companies that have big chunks of the market share should make sure they reduce risk in the market chain and ensure they’re not buying from fisheries or fishing vessels that are engaged in illegal activity.”But shrimp is a dirty business, with a literally dirty product often caught and farmed in ways that degrade the environment and kill marine life. As the world looks to feed a population of 7 billion and rising that increasingly demands shrimp and other seafood for dinner, many activists, experts and environmentalists are sounding the alarm on the downsides of our obsession with the crustacean.Shrimp wasn’t even on the menu for most Americans until the 1980s, when it started to gain broader popularity as aquaculture boomed and distribution expanded. Before then, less than one percent of the global shrimp catch came from farms, as the technology to farm shrimp simply wasn’t developed enough yet, and catching shrimp at sea was very expensive, according to Slate.In 2001, shrimp surpassed tuna as the most popular seafood in the U.S. for the first time, according to the Vermont Law Review, and demand for the shellfish today accounts for about 25 percent of the country’s seafood consumption.As millions of tons of shrimp and fish continue to be imported by the United States each year, much of which comes from countries like Thailand that do not have reliable traceability and anti-slavery regimes in place, it is important for consumers to learn how to navigate both a Red Lobster menu and seafood counter, Lowell recommends.One invaluable resource, she said, is Seafood Watch, an industry-leading program run by the Monterey Bay Aquarium that offers ratings of various fish and shellfish based on their sustainability, environmental impact and healthfulness.“Use things like the Seafood Watch program to guide choices in the right direction, then go to the store, ask your fishmonger for information, and if they don’t know the answer, maybe go with something else,” she said. “Be as informed as you can as a consumer to make the right decision.”"
311,"May 05, 2014 02:49AM ET",Carrefour Plans To Exit India,nan,"By Sneha Shankar - French retailer Carrefour (PARIS:CARR) is planning to move out of the wholesale business that it has in the Indian market, after failed talks with the Bharti Group to sell its outlets.Carrefour, one of the largest retailers in the world, sees a very bleak possibility of the Indian government allowing foreign retailers to set up multi-brand retail stores in the country, local news reports said. The company has already seen several high-level exits and may cut some more jobs in the coming few weeks, as a part of its exit strategy.Carrefour has five outlets in the country, including Delhi and Bangalore and would become the first foreign retailer to move out of the market.Foreign retailers planning to tap the $518 billion Indian market need a local player to operate in the country for multibrand retail with foreign direct investment (FDI), which has a cap of 51 per cent, while cash-and-carry businesses can get FDI up to 100 percent. Global retailers have faced issues with India's retail regulations, like mandatory 30 percent local sourcing from small- and medium-sized enterprises, and the choice given to different states to accept or deny FDI in multibrand retail.The $76 billion retailer declined comment on the latest report, but has previously withdrawn from markets including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Greece during periods of economic slowdown.India, which is currently holding parliamentary elections, expects to see a government formulated by the Bharatiya Janta Party. Rooted in Hindu nationalism, the party has made clear its disapproval of FDI in multibrand retail, and has promised not allow such investments if it comes to power.Retail giants like Tesco (LONDON:TSCO) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) entered the Indian retail sector through the wholesale cash-and-carry route, hoping that multibrand retail would also be opened up. Since then, Tesco has formed a joint venture with the Tata Group in order to operate in multibrand retail in the country, while Wal-Mart dissolved its joint venture with Bharti and plans to stick to wholesale/retail."

And some multinational companies, under attack for ignoring safety concerns for the sake of cheap labor, vowed to aid victims’ families and fund efforts to audit factories to make sure they comply with fire safety and structural integrity codes.Amid the rubble of the eight-story Rana Plaza building, rescue workers found garment labels from some of the world’s biggest retailers including Italy’s Benetton Group, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. NYSE:WMT from the United States, Bonmarche Holdings PLC (LON:BON) of the UK, El Corte Inglés S.A., based in Madrid.Those efforts have a decidedly mixed record. Injured victims, most of whom have been unemployed or underemployed since the accident, are only just now starting to see compensation payments. Hundreds of factories are being inspected for workplace safety violations but they represent just a small share of all the factories involved in the supply chain, many of which are used by unauthorized subcontractors. It remains difficult to track which companies are helping fund such efforts, due to the voluntary nature of their involvement.“There are three important questions that I think have not been completely answered yet,” said Arvind Ganesan, director of Human Rights Watch’s Business and Human Rights Division. “One, who is contributing to improve conditions and how; secondly, is it readily apparent to the public what’s going on; and three, are conditions actually improving?”Two separate organizations were formed after the tragedy to help upgrade the factories but it is difficult to assess their efforts because they are ongoing.The Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety has over 150 signatories including major European brands like Sweden's clothing company H&M Hennes & Mauritz (HMb.ST) and French hypermarket chain Carrefour (CARR.PAR) and 15 U.S.-based retailers, including Abercrombie & Fitch Co. NYSE:ANF, based in New Albany, Ohio, and Fruit of the Loom, Inc. of Bowling Green, Ky.The accord is a legally binding arrangement between international and local trade unions, labor rights groups and companies with the participation of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The accord collects funds from companies based on the volume of garments they source from the country, up to $500,000 a year. The money pays for factoty inspections and to train local engineers. The group says it's deployed 38  structural, fire and safety expert teams to assess about 1,500 facilities by the end of September.The second group, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, is comprised exclusively of U.S. and Canadian companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), The Gap Inc. NYSE:GPS and Kohl’s Corp. NYSE:KSS. Alliance members are not legally bound to any financial or goal-oriented commitments but it has also been inspecting factories and pays workers for temporary shutdowns. So far, inspections have taken place in more than half of the roughly 700 factories used by members. Workers are paid from alliance funds during temporary shutdowns and the group says it will train at least a million factory managers by July.For the estimated 3,600 Rana Plaza family members and survivors, efforts to assist them have been disappointing. Only $15 million of a projected $40 million has been raised through an industry-backed compensation fund administered by the ILO, the Rana Plaza Arrangement, to pay for settling claims and distributing funds directly to victims. Two companies – British discount department store Primark Stores Limited and Canadian general merchandiser Loblaw Companies Limited (L.TO) - were responsible for $10.4 million of those funds."

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European shares slipped in choppy
trading on Thursday morning, after recent strong gains, with
mining stocks among the biggest casualties after Chinese trade
data was weaker than expected.	 The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index fell 2.3
percent after top metals consumer China's trade surplus narrowed
for a second straight month in September, with imports and
exports both lower than expected, reflecting global economic
weakness. 	 ""China is lower and slower. You can hear the balloon slowly
losing its air. But that's OK. We know it's slowing. There's no
reason to panic,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at
Seven Investment Management.	 ""But in Europe, maybe the political decisions are finally
coming through. Markets have been taking strength, as the
underlying value is still there.""	 At 0853  GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was down 0.8 percent at 969.29 points, after
earlier going into positive territory to as high as 980.34. 	 The index rose 1.6 percent in the previous session to its
highest close in more than nine weeks, buoyed by
better-than-expected euro zone output data. It is up more than
13 percent from a low it hit in September, but is down more than
13 percent in 2011, hurt by the euro zone debt crisis.	 Euro zone countries will ask banks to accept losses of up to
50 percent on their holdings of Greek debt, officials said on
Wednesday, as part of a grand plan to avert a disorderly default
and stem a crisis that threatens the world economy.
 	 To restore confidence in the banking system, euro zone
leaders are  working on plans to shore up the balance sheets of
banks through recapitalisations. 	 The index is bouncing around the 50 percent retracement
level of its fall from an August high to the September low. 	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.6
percent, Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 fell
between 0.6 and 0.8 percent. 	 Some technical analysts remained positive, following the 
recent rally. 	 Bill McNamara at Charles Stanley said in a note on the FTSE
100: ""Notwithstanding the fact that this rally is being driven
by relatively low volumes the outlook has improved as the UK
index has pushed up through its short-term downtrend and, at the
same time, exceeded its 50-day moving average - taken together,
the impression is that, for the moment, the path of least
resistance is to the upside."" 	  CARREFOUR FALLS	 Corporate news was mixed. Carrefour , Europe's No.1
retailer, fell 5.4 percent after issuing a fresh profit warning,
citing an increasingly challenging economic climate that has
seen shoppers cut spending at its core French hypermarkets. 
 	 Rolls-Royce rose 6.7 percent after Pratt & Whittney
said it would buy Rolls-Royce's share of International Aero
Engines consortium for $1.5 billion. 	 Alcatel-Lucent , rose 9.2 percent after the
Financial Times reported that the Franco-American communications
equipment maker has agreed to sell its corporate call centre
services business for as much as $1.5 billion to Permira, the
private equity group.

352,"Aug 31, 2011 05:36AM ET",European shares rallying at end of weak month,nan," * FTSEurofirst up 1.4 percent * Index on track for biggest monthly fall since 2008 * Carrefour down after profit warning * ADP jobs report, other key data awaited
 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - European shares were sharply
higher on Wednesday morning, extending a rally into a third
session ahead of a raft of U.S. data this week that may
determine whether the Federal Reserve acts to boost the
struggling U.S. economy. 	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
was up 1.4 percent at 952.76 points at 0906 GMT, after rising 1
percent in the previous session. It was on track to fall 12
percent in August, the biggest monthly fall since October 2008. 	  Investors have cut exposure to risky assets such as stocks
following an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis, the United
States losing its AAA credit rating and weak data from major
economies that sparked concern they may go back into recession. 
  	 Stocks rose across the board on Wednesday, with miners among
the biggest gainers. The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index
 was up 1.7 percent, though still down 28 percent in
2011.	 Copper prices edged up, supported by a strike threat at the
Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia and news of lower output from
Chile.	  Investors awaited the ADP employment report, weekly
mortgage market index, Challenger job cuts, factory orders, the
Institute for Supply Management-New York's index of regional
business activity and the ISM Chicago's index of manufacturing
activity.  	 ""The ADP report will be important to the mood of the market
before the non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Given the
uncertainty over the U.S. economy, the payroll numbers are as
important as ever,"" said Richard Jeffrey, chief investment
officer at Cazenove Capital Management.	 ""The market has been shaken, and you would not call it
resilient. But in the absence of bad news, it will probably
drift higher.  Over the summer period reality has been dawning,
with investors realising  that the recovery is not going to be
straightforward.""	 The insurance sector rose 2.1 percent, led by
Allianz , up 4 percent, after Goldman Sachs upgraded it
to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" .	 ""In our view, Allianz has been sold off on what we see as
excessive concerns over the sustainability of life earnings
owing to the fall in German 10-year yields,"" Goldman said.	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1 percent,
Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 were both up
1.5 percent. 	 U.S. stocks rose for a third straight day on Tuesday in a
volatile session, after minutes from the latest Fed meeting
boosted expectations the U.S. central bank will act again to
stimulate the economy. 	  VALUATIONS	 The August sell-off has created buying opportunities,
strategists say. Equity valuations on Thomson Reuters Datastream
showed the STOXX Europe 600 carrying a one-year forward
price-to-earnings of 8.7, against a 10-year average of more than
13.  	 ""Stock markets look a bit undervalued at the moment. There
is potential for better times ahead,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief
investment officer at Octopus Investments, which manages $4
billion. 	 He said more quantitative easing was ""not on the cards"" at
the moment, adding:  ""The Fed is particularly concerned about
the U.S. and the western world stumbling into a liquidity trap,
interest rates low and inflation low. You get the Japanese
disease of people postponing consumption, investment. If they
need to stoke inflation they will.""	 Economic news in the euro zone's biggest economy surprised
on the upside. German retail sales held steady in July in real
terms, avoiding a drop expected by economists and showing
resilience in the face of falling consumer confidence.
 	 Among individual shares, French telecom, media and
construction group Bouygues soared 11 percent after
moving to address the recent sharp fall in its share price with
a planned 1.25 billion-euro ($1.8 billion) share buyback and an
upgrade of its 2011 sales target. 	 Finnish paper maker UPM-Kymmene Oyj rose 9
percvent after announcing plans to shut several
mills. 	 Carrefour , Europe's largest retailer, fell 3.3
percent after saying full-year profits would slump 15 percent as
it cuts prices in a bid to reverse market share losses in its
home market and elsewhere in Europe.

Wednesday morning after Chinese data boosted miners, eclipsing
losses in consumer-related stocks on poor sales from French
groups Carrefour and L'Oreal .      Gains were limited by simmering worries over the euro zone
debt crisis after Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to
junk.      Tech shares took a beating, with Dutch chip equipment maker
ASML falling 5.4 percent after saying consumer demand
was slowing. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
was up 0.04 percent at 1,092.09 by 0852 GMT. The index had lost
nearly 3 percent over the past three sessions.      The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index,
which ended at a seven-month closing low on Tuesday, was up 0.1
percent at 2,695.30.      ""We are at a fork in the road. You can tell just by the
massive volumes in futures. The Euro STOXX 50 is testing major
support levels, and if it closes the week below 2,696 points, it
could drop to May 2010 lows at 2,448.10 points,"" said Lionel
Jardin, head of institutional sales at Assya Capital, in Paris.	 Mining shares gained ground, with Rio Tinto up 1.4
percent and Xstrata up 2.3 percent, rallying with metal
prices after data showed China's economy grew faster than
expected in the second quarter, easing fears of a hard landing.	   STAY AWAY FROM THE STOCK      Consumer-related shares took a hit, with Nestle 
down 0.9 percent and Henkel  down 2 percent.      L'Oreal dropped 4.2 percent after the cosmetics
group posted disappointing sales.      Carrefour fell 1.4 percent, extending recent sharp
losses, after the retailer said it will struggle to meet 2011
goals for sales and profit growth, and confirmed a potentially
lucrative merger deal in Brazil was off.      ""This is clearly another profit warning, the second in one
month. Stay away from the stock,"" a Paris-based trader said.  Carrefour stock has plumetted 30 percent so far this year.  Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.2
percent, Germany's DAX index up 0.2 percent, and
France's CAC 40 dragged down 0.3 percent by L'Oreal and
Carrefour.      Italy's two biggest banks, UniCredit and Intesa
Sanpaolo , gained 2.5 percent and 3.7 percent
respectively, extending Tuesday's rally seen by traders as short
covering.      Italy's market regulator has recommended stakeholders who
have lent shares in Italian companies to retrieve them, Consob
head said on Wednesday.	 ""Also, Italy's budget manoeuvre should be voted by Saturday.
All the shorts on financial stocks have been closed,"" a
Milan-based trader said.      The recent sharp pull-back on European shares has dragged
valuation ratios to levels not seen since April 2009, according
to Thomson Reuters Datastream.      Shares on the STOXX 600 trade at an average 9.96
times 12-month forward earnings, below a 10-year average of
13.35 and Wall Street's S&P 500 average forward
price-to-earnings ratio of 12.31.

355,"Jul 05, 2011 01:00PM ET",European shares hit one-month closing high,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.1 pct * Index closes above 50-day moving average * Carrefour up after Spanish discount chain listing
 By Harpreet Bhal	 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - European shares inched higher in
thin volume on Tuesday, rising for the seventh straight session,
with French retailer Carrefour leading the gainers after listing
its Spanish discount chain.	 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares closed 0.1 percent higher at 1,122.23 points, hitting a
one-month closing high, though moves were exaggerated by thin
volumes of around 70 percent of its 90-day average.	 Carrefour , the world's second-biggest retailer,
rose 4.5 percent after listing the Dia chain in Spain, in which
each shareholder will get a stake.   	 Banks were lower, with the STOXX Europe 600 banking index
 down 0.8 percent. French lenders including Societe
Generale and BNP Paribas fell further, down
1.7 and 1.3 percent, weighed by bearish comments from Standard &
Poor's on Monday about a Greek debt rollover plan.	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index held above its 50-day moving
average in a technical indicator seen as bullish for equities.
The closely-watched Euro STOXX 50 index , the euro
zone's blue chip index, also held above its 50-day moving
average, closing at 2,850.51 points.	 ""For now, prices are consolidating above the next strong
horizontal resistance area around 2,890 (for the Euro STOXX 50
index). This should likely be followed by a pull-back to around
2,800 ... before the uptrend continues,"" said Roelof-Jan van den
Akker, senior technical analyst at ING.	  SOFT DATA	 Optimism was tempered by data showing that growth in the
euro zone's services sector slowed for a third straight month in
June, and by more than an initial estimate, with sluggish new
orders dimming the outlook. 	 ""The big question is whether it will go down in the second
half of the year, and also whether the U.S. ISM
(non-manufacturing data) will show whether the weakness was
temporary due to the Japan earthquake,"" said Koen de Leus,
economist at KBC Securities.	 Highlighting underlying caution in the market, the Euro
STOXX 50 volatility index , one of Europe's main gauges
of investor discomfort, rose 2.7 percent.	 The higher the volatility index, based on sell and buy
options on the Euro STOXX 50 index, the lower the
market's risk appetite.	 Data due later this week is likely to provide fresh
direction for equities, with the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing
numbers on Wednesday, the European Central Bank interest rate
decision on Thursday and U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday.

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - European shares edged up on
Tuesday, extending the rises for a  seventh session, though
strategists were advising caution as weak euro zone economic
data cast fresh doubts on the strength of the recovery.  	 At 0908 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 	
European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,123.60 points, 	
after rising 0.2 percent in the previous session to its 	
highest close in one month.	 The index is in the middle of a range defined by its 2011
high, hit in mid-February, and its low in March. 	Novartis rose 0.7 percent after saying a late-stage
study showed its drug Afinitor helped extend the time women with
advanced breast cancer could live without their tumours
worsening.  	 ""Part of the reason for the rally last week was better than
expected data out of the United States. The markets want to see
whether that will be continued and whether the soft patch has
come to an end,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at
Charles Stanley.	 ""With the U.S. debt ceiling issue moving toward the centre
of the stage, and continued uncertainty, there is still plenty
of reason for most investors to be strategically cautious.""	 Carrefour rose 4 percent as the French retailer
prepared to list its Dia discount chain in Spain later on
Tuesday. 	""We have an equity value for Dia of 4.5 euros within our
Carrefour divisional valuations, that is our Carrefour target
price should adjust down to 25 euros although we expect Dia to

in a note. 	 However, mining shares were among those capping gains for
the European benchmark, as a stronger dollar hurt metals prices.	  The Stoxx Europe 600 Basic Resources Index fell 0.4

of the European economy,"" said Koen de Leus, economist at KBC

 (Adds fund manager, union, Knight Vinke comments) By Dominique Vidalon and Mark Potter  PARIS, May 5 (Reuters) - Carrefour SA fired the executive
tasked to revive its core French business and said it was
shelving a controversial property listing, fuelling talk of
boardroom dissent and worries over its turnaround plan. Europe's top retailer said James McCann was leaving only 15
months after he was picked to boost flagging French sales,
raising concerns over its new Carrefour Planet hypermarket
revamp plan -- the lynchpin of the group's turnaround plan. Reasons for the shock departure were not given in
Carrefour's statement, but a Carrefour spokeswoman said McCann
was leaving because the performance of the French business --
which made 38.7 percent of 2010 net sales of 90.1 billion euros
($134 billion) -- did not meet management expectations. Carrefour did not say if McCann had been fired or had
resigned, though a source close to the matter said he was fired. Contacted by phone, McCann told Reuters he would not comment
at this stage on the reasons for his departure. One person familiar with the matter said the former Tesco
Plc manager was uncomfortable with plans to spin off assets,
which have been championed by key shareholders Colony Capital
and Groupe Arnault but opposed by others. Several sources said McCann had grown frustrated with
pressures from top Carrefour shareholders and had left because
he felt he did not have enough leeway to properly do his job. ""Neither of these developments is positive in our view and
once again brings into question management's strategy and
ability to ... execute its turnaround plan,"" analysts at
Espirito Santo said in a research note. Francois Chaulet, fund manager at Montsegur Finance, said
shelving the IPO was not necessarily a bad decision but added:
""There is a real problem with Carrefour today."" At 1011 GMT, Carrefour shares were down 2.2 percent at 30.91
euros, off an earlier low of 30.8 euros and valuing the group at
22 billion euros. The stock has lagged the STOXX Europe 600
retail index by 13 percent over the past year. ""McCann's departure will raise further questions over the
potential for the ""Planet"" concept and the ""En Avant"" turnaround
programme to be successful and this is key to our long term
investment case,"" JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said.  MOUNTING OPPOSITION Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer by sales
behind U.S. group Wal-Mart Stores Inc, said Chief Executive Lars
Olofsson would take over management of its French business
pending the appointment of a successor and it would press ahead
with plans to spin off discount chain Dia. Carrefour launched its ""En Avant"" turnaround plan in 2009
with a goal of making 4.5 billion euros of savings. In September
it said it would invest 1.5 billion euros in revamping its main
western European hypermarket business. After initial enthusiasm for the plans, investors'
confidence was shaken by two profit warnings late last year. Earlier this year, the group came up with a plan to float
discount chain Dia and 25 percent of Carrefour Property to
deliver 4 billion euros in special dividends and mollify key
shareholders Colony and Arnault. Colony and Arnault, which hold 13.5 percent of the capital
and 20 percent of the voting rights of Carrefour, are still down
on their 2007 investment, made at about 50 euros a share. However, the property spin-off in particular sparked
opposition from parties including activist shareholder Knight
Vinke, European shareholder rights group Deminor, French
minority shareholder association APPAC, French labour unions and
founding family shareholder Defforey. Vinke, which owns 1.5 percent of Carrefour's capital, hailed
the decision to defer the listing of 25 percent of Property,
while Michel Enguelz at labour union Force Ouvriere said
McCann's departure was negative but the Property decision was
""encouraging"". Critics had said ceding some control of its properties could
weaken Carrefour in a competitive grocery market, and people
familiar with the matter said there was some opposition to the
plans within the boardroom.  Earlier this year, European boss Vincente Trius defected to
Canadian grocer Loblaw and independent board member Jean-Martin
Folz left, fuelling talk of dissent. ""The broader question ... is why they were doing it (the
property spin off) in the first place. There's some pretty big
worries about corporate governance,"" said Bernstein analyst
Chris Hogbin.

 (Adds comments, share price reaction)  By Robert-Jan Bartunek BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - Belgian supermarket group
Delhaize saw its profit margins squeezed in the first quarter as
it refurbished U.S. stores and cut prices in Belgium. Sales in Belgium fell short of the market consensus, but the
company managed higher-than-expected sales in the United States,
where it was able to pass on higher prices to consumers. ""As expected, our operating margin is a reflection of the
investment we are doing in prices throughout the group, as well
as a consequence of all of the new game plan initiatives that
will lead to sales improvement later in the year,"" CEO
Pierre-Olivier Beckers said in a conference call with analysts. Comparable store sales in the United States, where Delhaize
generates about 70 percent of its sales, fell by 0.3 percent,
not as much as the 0.6 percent decline expected in a Reuters
poll. It was the third straight quarter in which the pace of
decline had lessened. In Belgium, where Delhaize introduced further price cuts,
like-for-like sales were flat. Analysts had expected a 2 percent
rise. Group operating profit decreased 9.4 percent to 218 million
euros ($323 million) in the first three months, below the
average 231 million expected by six analysts in a Reuters poll. Shares in Delhaize fell to their lowest point for more than
three months on Wednesday, down 5.2 percent, but recovered
somewhat to trade 2.3 percent lower in later session. Analyst Marc Leemans at Bank Degroof said he expected the
margin squeeze to be temporary. ""I think part of the margin pressure was price investments,
and some costs will not return in the coming quarters, such as
the refurbishment of shops,"" he said. French peer Carrefour said in April that its recently
restructured Belgian business was continuing to improve, with
like-for-like sales increasing 2.3 percent. In March, Delhaize bought Serbian retailer Delta Maxi Group,
gaining a strong foothold in the Balkans. Delhaize said it
expected to close the acquisition in the third quarter.

 (Adds more CEO comments, updates shares)  By Mark Potter  LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - New Tesco boss Phil Clarke said
the world's No.3 retailer must spruce up its products,
particularly clothing, after slipping downmarket in the
recession and missing profit hopes in its main UK market.  The supermarket group also unveiled a bigger-than-expected
loss at U.S. business Fresh & Easy, leading some analysts to
question whether it should quit the country, and missed a target
to break into profit in China, saying on Tuesday it was taking
longer than expected to find sites for new shopping malls.  Group profit before tax and one-off items climbed 12.3
percent to 3.8 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) in the year ended
February, in line with analysts' forecasts thanks to a strong
performance in Asia and proceeds from property sales.  But earnings in Britain, where Tesco accounts for almost one
pound in every seven spent in shops, rose just 3.8 percent, with
sales at stores open at least a year falling 0.7 percent in the
final quarter, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax. ""We didn't achieve our planned (UK) growth in the year and
this was only partly attributable to the deterioration in the
consumer environment,"" said Clarke, taking a more critical line
in his first results statement than his long-serving predecessor
Terry Leahy, whom he succeeded in March. ""We've got a good strategy. The issues are not structural.
It's about the detail,"" he told reporters. ""We can do better and
we are taking action in key areas,"" he added, while ruling out
launching a price war.  Clarke said he would step up innovation and marketing to
address a general merchandise offering grown ""stale"" and a
clothing range that was not ""on song"" or ""of the moment"". Shares in Tesco, which trails France's Carrefour and U.S.
industry leader Wal-Mart by annual sales, were down 0.9 percent
at 396.25 pence by 1330 GMT, lagging a 0.7 percent rise in the
UK's benchmark FTSE-100 index. ""The most striking admission in the statement is that Tesco
thinks ... (its UK performance is) not good enough,"" said Arden
Partners analyst Nick Bubb, who also described the loss in the
United States as ""alarming.""    CONSUMERS STRUGGLE   International retailers are increasingly relying on emerging
markets for growth as shoppers in Europe and the United States
struggle with austerity measures. British groups have been particularly hard hit by a rapid
government deficit reduction plan, triggering a wave of profit
warnings as shoppers cut spending on discretionary goods. ""Consumers are struggling with higher taxes, higher
inflation and particularly higher petrol prices. So a typical
family in the UK is probably about 18 to 20 pounds a week worse
off, which is equivalent to about a 7 percent increase in your
basic tax rate,"" Finance Director Laurie McIlwee told Reuters. Tesco, with over 5,000 stores in 14 countries, said it
expected trading to remain challenging in Britain, but
conditions were improving in most of its other markets.  Group sales rose 7.1 percent excluding VAT to 60.9 billion
pounds, below analysts' mean forecast of 61.7 billion. Profit in
Asia jumped 29.5 percent at actual exchange rates to 570 million
pounds, led by Tesco's second-biggest market, South Korea.  However, U.S. losses widened 12.7 percent to 186 million
pounds. Tesco said they would reduce sharply this fiscal year
and it was on track for Fresh & Easy to break even late 2012-13. Clarke said the chain had ""pulled a little too much from the
mainstream"" and he was taking steps, like introducing fresh
bread and coffee, to win over shoppers. When asked if he would
commit to its long-term future, Clarke said he would take ""one
step at a time,"" while adding: ""I want to give it a good run."" Clarke also said Tesco was finding it more difficult than
expected to find sites for its Lifespace shopping malls in
China, and expected to open around 50 over the next five years,
down from an initial projection of about 80.  Tesco said its return on capital employed, a key focus as
investors look for a payback on years of heavy investment, rose
to 12.9 percent from 12.1 percent the year before. Panmure analyst Philip Dorgan thought 2011-12 earnings
forecasts might fall 5 percent, but kept a ""buy"" rating on Tesco
shares due to the better returns and plans to improve in the UK. Tesco, which makes about two-thirds of sales and profits in
Britain, said capital spending would reach 4 billion pounds this
financial year, up slightly from 3.7 billion in 2010-11. It will open 11 million square feet of selling space, mostly
abroad but still continuing a rapid expansion in Britain, and
launch mortgages at Tesco Bank by the autumn and an Amazon-style
 online marketplace in late 2011 or early 2012.

Friday, after a surge in China's inflation rate to a 32-month
high fuelled expectations of further monetary tightening, while
weaker-than-expected Bank of America results added to investors'
cautious mood. But Goldman Sachs said the positive long-term outlook for
equities was intact, saying it was maintaining its ""overweight""
in equities on a three-month and 12-month horizon and that
Europe was the cheapest market and had the strongest expected
earnings growth across all regions in 2011. By 1137 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was flat at 1,128.79 points and is on track to end the
week lower after three-weeks of gains. The jump in China's inflation, which topped market
forecasts, prompted worries that tighter monetary policy there
could slow economic growth and feed through into company
earnings. Another negative was Bank of America Corp results in which
the bank posted a 37.5 percent decline in first-quarter
earnings, hurt by mortgage-related costs. ""The focus is on earnings ... given interest rates are
expected to rise, the market is sensitive to any sort of news
flow in this area,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin, which has 25 billion pounds ($40.92 billion) of
assets under management. The euro zone's periphery was in focus again after Moody's
downgraded Ireland's sovereign rating and speculation grew that
Athens will eventually need to restructure its debt. ""These downgrades can periodically spook the market. These
countries -- Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- are in a special
situation and what is key now is that they prove to the market
that they have the will to consolidate successfully,"" said Klaus
Wiener, chief economist at Generali Investments, which manages
$465 billion. Banking stocks featured among the worst performers, with
Spanish banks Santander and BBVA down 1 percent and 1.8 percent
respectively on worries about euro zone peripheral contagion,
and BarCap analysts cited the prospect of lower loan growth. Overall, the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index fell 0.9 percent,
with traders saying Bank of America results were also not
helping the sector. Most stock markets in the peripheries fell, with Spain's
IBEX 35, Portugal's PSI 20, Greece's Athens General and Italy's
benchmark down 0.3 to 0.9 percent. But, Ireland's ISEQ gained
0.4 percent following recent weakness.  SYNTHES GAINS In terms of individual stocks, Synthes rose 3.2 percent on
market talk that Johnson & Johnson or Medtronic could be
interested in buying the Swiss medical device maker, traders
said. Elsewhere, Man Group gained 3.4 percent after the world's
biggest listed hedge fund manager was added to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch 'Europe one' list of preferred stocks. On the downside, Carrefour shares fell 1.2 percent after the
world's No.2 retailer warned of challenging conditions in its
largest market, France. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent,
Germany's DAX was 0.5 percent higher and France's CAC 40 was
down 0.3 percent.

 (Adds analyst comment, background) By Jussi Rosendahl HELSINKI, April 4 (Reuters) - Finnish retailer Kesko said it
was targeting sales of 500 million euros ($711 million) and a
profit by 2015 from its long-awaited move into the Russian
grocery market. Kesko will open four large-scale grocery stores in the
Moscow and St Petersburg areas during 2012 and 2013, chief
executive Matti Halmesmaki said on Monday, adding it would look
at other acquisition opportunities to expand the new business. International retailers have struggled to enter the Russian
market. Carrefour, the world's number two retailer, opened its
first Russian stores in 2009 but pulled out after four months,
citing insufficient growth prospects and acquisition
opportunities. U.S. group Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, also
recently abandoned its quest to enter Russia amid a lack of
buy-out opportunities. ""I am sceptical about Kesko's possibilities in Russia.
Logistics are not as good as in Finland, and there really is no
room for failures as the profit margins are thin. That is to add
to the political risks,"" FIM analyst Martin Sundman said. Kesko, which has explored moving into Russian food markets
since 2006, expects synergy benefits from its hardware unit
chain K-rauta which already operates 12 stores in Russia. ""I do not believe there is much synergy with the hardware
unit. It might speed up the start with less permits to apply
(for),"" Sundman said. Kesko also announced plans to open another 13 hardware
stores in Russia by 2015 when it hopes the unit will have
full-year sales of 800 million euros there. The planned grocery and hardware chain investment will total
600 million euros, the company said.

Wednesday, with oils gaining as crude rose to more than $80 a
barrel, and as U.S. companies continued to beat forecasts for
third-quarter earnings. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.5
percent to close at 1,025.88 points, recouping almost all the
loss from the previous session, and taking it to near its
highest close since Oct. 3, 2008. The index is up nearly 59 percent from its lifetime low on
March 9, as investors have become more confident on the
prospects of economic recovery. ""The general theme continues to be that the significant
improvement we have seen in economic indicators also shows up in
Q3 earnings,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at
UniCredit Group. ""All the fundamental factors in the equity
market are still intact, and the upward strength will continue,
though a breather is overdue."" Crude oil prices rose above $80 a barrel to one-year highs
after U.S. government data showed inventories rose less than
expected. The oil price was also supported by the dollar
weakening to trade at more than $1.50 against the euro. ENI, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol rose 0.7-1.2 percent.U.S. financial services firm Morgan Stanley reported
better-than expected quarterly profit on strong fixed-income
sales and trading revenue and improved investment banking
underwriting results, sending its shares up 6.9 percent. Internet company Yahoo also rose, up 3.9 percent, after its
earnings pleased the market.  As European bourses were closing, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and
Nasdaq Composite were up 0.4-0.7 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX closed
0.3 and 0.4 percent higher respectively; France's CAC-40 rose
0.05 percent.  BANKS REVERSE LOSSES Banks, which had been lower for much of the day, were mostly
up by the close. Natixis surged 11.4 percent after Credit Suisse
upped its price target to 5.7 euros, from 4.2, on the
loss-making French investment bank, keeping an 'outperform'
rating. Index heavyweights Banco Santander and HSBC ended the day up
1.8 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. But Deutsche Bank dropped 2.4 percent after Germany's
biggest bank said tax credits had flattered net profit in the
third quarter. Among other individual shares, British supermarket operator
Tesco rose 2.3 percent after Nomura raised its target price to
526 pence, from 405 pence.  Tesco's British margin is likely to step change to 7.2
percent from 6.2 percent, said Nomura, as it pointed to the
potential for the company's banking, telecoms and online
businesses. French peer Carrefour rose 1.6 percent. French carmaker Peugeot fell 4.8 percent after it said
third-quarter revenue slowed less sharply than in previous
quarters, but analysts at Morgan Stanley analysts said sales
were still disappointing. Fiat also dropped, down 2.0 percent after the company

shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,025.57 points after rising to

percent after Qatar sold 379 million shares worth over 1.3

 (Adds analyst comment, more detail, background) By Mark Potter LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Sales at Dutch grocer Ahold grew
more slowly in the third quarter as food prices fell and
recession-hit shoppers switched to cheaper goods, especially in
the U.S. Ahold, which owns the Netherlands' biggest supermarket chain
Albert Heijn but makes over half of its sales in the U.S., said
on Tuesday sales in the quarter rose 4.3 percent to 6.04 billion
euros ($9 billion), in line with the average forecast of 6.08
billion in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts. The increase was 2.6 percent at constant exchange rates,
down from a 3.9 percent rise in the second quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year, excluding petrol, were
mostly weaker than expected and included a 0.4 percent fall at
Albert Heijn, versus forecasts for a 1.3 percent rise. Barclays
analysts said this was the first decline for about six years. An Ahold spokeswoman said volume growth at Albert Heijn,
however, was the highest so far this year. ""Although the weak U.S. dollar and tougher trading
conditions are cause for slight consensus earnings concern, we
think this is discounted,"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a
research note. Ahold shares have lagged the DJ Stoxx European Retail Index
 by 20 percent this year due to its exposure to U.S. markets,
which have been hit harder by recession than Europe. They closed at 8.78 euros on Monday, valuing the business at
about 10.4 billion euros.   VOLUME GROWTH ""In the third quarter, Ahold delivered volume growth in all
markets. Sales were impacted by deflation and trading down by
customers while increased promotional activity continued,
especially in the United States,"" the firm said in a statement. Supermarket groups in the U.S. and much of Europe have been
battling a downturn in consumer spending exacerbated recently by
price deflation in some foods. France's Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer,
last week posted a 2.9 percent drop in third-quarter sales,
while U.S. group Safeway reported a 36 percent fall in
third-quarter profit. Ahold, which trades from over 3,500 stores in 11 countries,
has benefited from an extensive store revamp in 2006 ahead of
competitors and before the downturn, which also stepped up the
group's focus on low prices. Underlying sales at U.S. chains Stop & Shop and
Giant-Landover rose 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively,
below analysts' average forecasts for increases of 1.5 percent
and 1.8 percent. Underlying sales at Giant-Carlisle, also in the U.S., rose 1
percent, just above the average forecast of 0.8 percent.  On Monday, Dutch grocer Jumbo won a bid battle for peer
Super de Boer, stepping up the challenge to Ahold in its home
market.

shareholders. Carrefour was expecting two offers, including one from
Wal-Mart, the paper said.
""Carrefour denies the sale of its businesses in growth
markets,"" the retailer said in a statement in response to the
newspaper article. ""The group's geographic priorities are France, the other G4
countries and, in the medium- and long-term, growth markets, and
particularly Brazil and China,"" Carrefour said. G4 refers to
France, Belgium, Spain and Italy. Le Monde reported that Carrefour was under pressure to make
disposals from shareholders Colony Capital and Bernard Arnault,
the owner of luxury goods group LVMH. According to Carrefour's website, Colony Capital and Arnault
hold 10.7 percent through Blue Capital, 2.15 percent through
Colony Blue Investor and 0.7 percent through Groupe Arnault. A spokesman for Blue Capital earlier declined to comment on
the report. Analysts value Carrefour's operations in Latin America at
between 3.3 billion to 8 billion euros ($4.9-$11.8 billion),
according to Le Monde. Carrefour unveiled a plan in June to make savings of 4.5
billion euros by 2012 across the company by cutting operating
costs, improving purchasing terms and reducing inventory times
to boost profits. Carrefour shares were up 0.5 percent at 31.08 euros by 1342
GMT.

372,"Oct 06, 2009 02:42AM ET","REFILE-UPDATE 6-Tesco sees gradual recovery, food prices flat",nan," (Refiles to add missing words in fourth paragraph)  * H1 underlying profit 1.57 bln pounds, vs forecast 1.48 bln * Q2 UK underlying sales up 3.1 percent, vs forecast 3.4
percent * Says sales growth converging with main British rivals * Says ready meals, organics, non-food sales now growing * Shares up 0.5 percent 
 (Adds finance director comment, updates shares) By Mark Potter and James Davey LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Tesco the world's third-biggest
retailer, posted first-half profit towards the top end of
forecasts and said it was seeing a gradual economic recovery
with shoppers starting to treat themselves again. The supermarket group also said on Tuesday growth in its
core British market had converged with rivals in recent weeks,
but its second-quarter performance was towards the bottom end of
forecasts as a prolonged rise in food prices comes to an end. Tesco's growth rate has been lagging its main competitors in
Britain due, in part, to its exposure to non-food products which
have been hit harder than groceries in the recession.  Chief executive Terry Leahy said sales of non-food products,
hit hard in the recession, had returned to growth, and demand
for more expensive groceries, like organic foods, ready meals
and Tesco's ""Finest"" range, was picking up, adding to recent
signs of improving confidence among shoppers. Tesco, which runs over 4,300 shops in 14 countries, said
profit before tax and one-off items rose 8.6 percent to 1.57
billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in the six months to Aug. 29,
helped by deals last year to buy a store chain in South Korea
and to take full control of a banking joint venture.  That was the smallest increase for 10 years as interest
costs climbed because of the debt taken on to pay for the deals,
but towards the top end of analysts' forecast range of 1.31-1.62
billion pounds, according to a Reuters poll of 12.  Sales increased 9.3 percent to 27.8 billion pounds, and the
interim dividend was lifted 9 percent to 3.89 pence. ""Solid, but not inspiring,"" was the verdict of BofA-Merrill
Lynch analyst John Kershaw. Tesco shares, which have beaten British rivals Sainsbury and
Morrison this year on hopes of a recovery in non-food spending,
were up 0.5 percent at 393.3 pence at 1245 GMT, lagging the DJ
Stoxx European retail index.    For a graphic showing price
performance of British food retail companies, click here: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/109/UK_RTLEQ1009.gif  CONVERGENCE Grocers have fared better than many retailers in the
recession, thanks to their focus on selling essential goods and
a prolonged period of rising food prices. Retail sales in the European Union fell 0.3 percent in
August from July, with the drop in non-food sales more than
offsetting demand for groceries. But food inflation has fallen recently as commodities prices
have eased, contributing to profit warnings from European and
U.S. supermarket chains. The impact has been delayed in Britain by a weaker pound.
Leahy said food inflation had now slowed to zero, but saw little
risk of significant deflation. Tesco said sales in Britain -- around two thirds of its
total -- rose 3.1 percent for stores open at least a year,
excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, in the second quarter. That was down from 4.3 percent in the first quarter, due
mainly to the lower food inflation, and below analysts' average
forecast of 3.4 percent in a Reuters poll. Sainsbury is expected to post a 5.6 percent rise in
underlying sales on Wednesday. But Leahy said Tesco's growth had converged with rivals in
recent weeks, helped by the relaunches of its Clubcard scheme. British food maker Northern Foods also reported a drop in
food price inflation on Tuesday. Tesco finance director Laurie McIlwee said the group would
consider all opportunities to boost its fledgling banking
business by, for example, buying deposit or mortgage loan books. But he also said it did not need to do a deal, that it was
not interested in buying bank branches and it had no plans to
buy nationalised bank Northern Rock. Tesco has been tipped as a potential bidder of assets from
Northern Rock and Lloyds Banking Group. Tesco shares trade at about 13.4 times forecast earnings,
below bigger rival Carrefour on 14.9 and world number one
Wal-Mart on 13.8.

supermarket chain Colruyt said on Wednesday its net profit
should rise by 4.6 percent in the year to end-March 2010, below
market expectations. The Belgian group said it expected a profit of 320 million
euros ($469.9 million), versus 306 million euros in 2008/2009. A Reuters estimates poll of 19 analysts had produced an
average net profit for this year of 328 million euros. Colruyt Chairman Jef Colruyt told shareholders at their
annual meeting that steep inflation of last year had increased
the pressure on operational costs. ""This year, once again, the automatic indexation mechanism
and the shortage of some specific competence profiles on the
labour market will be a burden on our cost structure,"" he said. The company also announced that it planned to pay a dividend
of 4.04 euros gross and 3.03 euros net per ordinary share. A
year ago, it paid out 3.68 euros gross and 2.76 euros net. In July, Colruyt, which traditionally offers cautious
guidance, reported a 6.6 percent rise to 1.67 billion euros in
first-quarter sales for its 2009-2010 financial year. The group said at the time summer weather had had a positive
impact on consumption of typical summer products and its
discount formula continued to attract customers turning to
cheaper goods.Colruyt competes with German hard discounters Aldi and Lidl,
France's Carrefour and high-end Belgian retailer Delhaize.

374,"Sep 10, 2009 01:03PM ET",DEALTALK-Rallying stock markets help accelerate M&A plans,nan," * Global recovery seen spurring more M&A next year * M&A deals must have sound industrial logic * Availability of financing is improving  By Victoria Howley LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - More companies could follow
Kraft's lead and put long-held plans to buy rivals back on the
agenda as confidence grows and stock markets reach yearly highs,
bankers and analysts said on Thursday. Industry experts do not expect a swift return to the
frenetic dealmaking of 2007, but they say pipelines are
healthier, supporting views that more bosses are getting ready
to de-ice plans for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that have
been on hold since the start of the financial crisis. ""You've reached an inflexion point in the economic cycle, at
least from the perception of (chief executive officers),"" said
Patrick McCullagh, head of U.K. and European credit research at
asset manager Schroders. ""You are comfortable with your cash flow and you've now got
... businesses at a 30 percent discount to where they were 18
months ago - that's a strong reason for undertaking M&A."" Major indexes set new highs this week for 2009 - the UK's
FTSE 100 top share index closed Wednesday over 5000 points for
the first time since October - on mounting evidence of economic
recovery. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) also sees renewed expansion of gross domestic product in
the United States and the euro zone in the third quarter, after,
respectively, four and five quarters of loss.  THE RIGHT STORY While the credit markets are buoyant and pricing on bank
debt is reducing, companies still need solid ratings and sound
industrial logic to secure financing for M&A. ""We are seeing a series of straightforward strategic deals,
the sort of corporate moves people have been talking about and
expecting for a number of years,"" said Andrew Bell, global head
of M&A at HSBC. For the right deal that will generate value, financing
availability has improved, Bell added. Kraft's pursuit of Cadbury has been anticipated since 2007,
when Mars bought Wrigley for $23 billion to create a global
powerhouse in the confectionary industry. For Kraft, the deal is a natural extension of a strategy to
push into more overseas growth areas and products like chocolate
that offer high margins than other parts of its portfolio, like
cheese and frozen pizza. Other examples of clear strategic M&A include Walt Disney
Cos $4 billion purchase of Marvel Entertainment Inc, this year's
biggest media deal. Disney will be able to use its marketing and
entertainment clout to promote and build characters like Thor in
ways Marvel never could.       Finnish retailer Kesko is also considering acquisitions in
Russia, where the consumer sector has been booming for much of
the last decade and where Carrefour has also pledged further
expansion. In the telecoms sector, meanwhile, French media giant
Vivendi has offered $2.9 billion for Brazilian operator GVT, as
it also looks to boost its presence in emerging markets. UK insurer RSA will find shareholders sympathetic if it
proceeds with a rights issue of up to $1 billion - as long as it
sets out sensible acquisition plans, top investors in the
company told Reuters this week. Andy Haste, who took the helm of RSA in 2003, has built
credibility with investors after restructuring the company and
cleaning up its balance sheet after it over-extended itself in
the 1990s. A report by Natixis predicts a higher incidence of M&A in
sectors including pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, transport, IT
software and oil services. It said International Business Machines Corp could pursue
SAP and lists AstraZeneca and Whitbread among potential takeover
targets.  FINITE WINDOW Bankers argue that companies should consider pursuing M&A
sooner rather than later, before the recovery lifts potential
targets out of range. Liam Beere, co-head of European M&A at UBS, said that
confidence is starting to return at companies that have
weathered the financial crisis, with CEOs looking for
opportunities to grow their top line by acquiring rivals that
are still weak financially. ""If companies are willing to pursue targets aggressively,
they may find they are able to make public company acquisitions
more easily as shareholders are looking to M&A to drive
performance,"" he said. Marco Boschetti, global head of M&A and restructuring at
business consultancy firm Towers Perrin said deals that closed
in the second quarter of the year outperformed the market by 8.5
percent, compared to outperformance of 2 percent in the second
quarter of 2008. He was referring to global deals worth more than $100
million, which were measured in a joint survey with London's
Cass Business School against the MSCI world index. ""What this is saying is that there is a lot of value in
deals at the moment and if you can afford to close a transaction
you should go for it,"" he said. Not everybody is convinced a sustainable recovery is
underway, however, and the threat of double dip has not
completely receded from the market. ""When you look at the ever shrinking bank lending to the
private sector around the world it is as clear as the nose on my
face that the global economy is still very, very sick,"" SocGen
analyst Albert Edwards wrote in a strategy note. (Additional reporting by Jane Merriman; editing by Simon

 (Adds CFO/CEO comment, analyst comment, background, shares) By James Regan PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - French supermarket group Carrefour
 confirmed its 2009 operating profit would fall up to 18 percent
and said that with no signs of a pickup the market would remain
challenging in the second half. The world's second-biggest retailer after U.S. company
Wal-Mart said first-half operating profit fell 28 percent to
1.01 billion euros ($1.45 billion), in line with guidance issued
in a profit warning on June 30. Full-year profit was expected to fall to 2.7-2.8 billion
euros from 3.3 billion last year ""if current sales trends
continue"", Carrefour said in a statement on Friday, again
echoing its June 30 statement. Shares in Carrefour, which employs nearly 500,000 people in
more than 15,000 stores in 30 countries, were 4.9 percent higher
at 33.21 euros at 0920 GMT, compared with a 1.4 percent gain on
the French CAC 40 index. The DJ Stoxx European retail index was
1.5 percent higher. ""The share ... had underperformed since June. The main
reasons for this rebound are technical,"" said one trader who
declined to be named. Carrefour stock had lagged other French
blue chips by 12 percent since its profit warning. Asked about developments in its main French market since the
end of June, Carrefour finance head Pierre Bouchut told
reporters he had not seen any change. ""We are seeing no sign in our figures of a real pickup at
the moment. We don't see any sign of deterioration compared with
the first-half trend either,"" Bouchut said, adding Carrefour's
results reflected a ""difficult environment"". Chief executive Lars Olofsson told a news conference the
market would continue to be ""challenging"" and the second half
would be similar to the first. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart posted better-than-expected
quarterly earnings and forecast a full-year profit that could
beat Wall Street estimates.. The French group, whose stores range from Ed hard discount
shops to Carrefour hypermarkets, is spending on price promotions
and has introduced a range of discounted products to tackle its
image as an expensive retailer and fight for market share in the
downturn. Earlier this month, the French economy posted a surprise
return to growth in the second quarter after a year of
recession, although analysts questioned how strong the recovery
will be once state support begins to fade. On June 30, the group unveiled a plan to make savings of 4.5
billion euros by 2012 in June by cutting operating costs,
improving purchasing terms and reducing inventory times to boost
profits. Carrefour confirmed this plan on Friday. Smaller rival Casino missed forecasts with a 9.1 percent
drop in first-half operating profit on Thursday. It also said
trading was ""challenging"" and it would cut an additional 150
million euros of costs in 2010. Carrefour plans to invest 600 million euros on promotions to
bolster market share and make operating cost savings of at least
500 million this year. It has capped capital expenditure at 2.5
billion euros. ""Our priorities for 2009 remain unchanged,"" Bouchut said. ""There are very few surprises within the numbers,"" Credit
Suisse analysts say. ""Guidance ... is retained. But the company
sounds confident that its 500 million euro 2009 cost savings
target is a 'minimum'. ""We remain cautious, especially regarding near-term
prospects in France where there are big anniversary campaigns to
come this year -- E.Leclerc and Intermarche -- which are likely
to include increased levels of promotions. Longer term, we think
there are more attractive recovery stories in the sector."" Carrefour swung to a net first-half loss of 58 million
euros, after a profit of 744 million a year ago. Income was hurt by 511 million euros of one-time costs,
including a 400 million charge relating to Finiper in Italy to
adjust the equity investment and put option relating to the
business to fair market value. Without this, net profit would
have fallen 41 percent to 421 million, Bouchut said.

 (Adds analyst comment, detail, background, updates shares) By Noelle Mennella and Mark Potter PARIS/LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - French supermarket group
Casino missed forecasts with a 9.1 percent drop in first-half
operating profit, knocking its shares and overshadowing news it
will squeeze out more costs next year. Casino, which runs over 10,000 stores in 10 countries, said
on Thursday it would cut 150 million euros ($214 million) of
costs in 2010 on top of previously announced plans to reduce
overheads by the same amount this year. Chairman and chief executive Jean-Charles Naouri said
trading was ""challenging"", and Casino was stepping up plans for
more cheaper own-brand products and to transform the operating
model of its Geant hypermarkets, where non-food ranges have been
hit hard by the economic downturn. He did not give further details. However, some analysts were concerned whether the group
would hit full-year profit forecasts, and also at the lack of
progress in plans to sell assets to reduce its debts. ""We think there is now risk of some estimate cuts today,""
Credit Suisse analysts said, noting the group now needs a 3.9
percent rise in second-half operating profit to achieve the
full-year consensus forecast of 1.26 billion euros. At 1030 GMT, Casino shares were down 3.5 percent at 52.18
euros, the biggest fall on the DJ Stoxx European retail index. Casino, which also runs Franprix and Leader Price discount
stores, said first-half operating profit fell to 488 million
euros, missing analysts' average forecast of 498 million in a
Reuters Estimates poll. As previously announced, sales rose 1.3 percent excluding
acquisitions, petrol and calendar effects, while the trading
margin fell 26 basis points.  Retailers across the world are struggling with a downturn in
consumer spending. Supermarkets have fared better than most,
helped by their focus on low prices. But growth has slowed
sharply recently in France, as food price inflation has receded
and market leader Carrefour has cut prices. Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer behind U.S.
group Wal-Mart, is due to report detailed first-half results on
Friday. It gave headline numbers in a profit-warning in June,
alongside a big cost-cutting and turnaround plan.   DEBTS Casino has been dogged by concerns over its debt pile as
well as the level of borrowings at 49 percent shareholder Groupe
Rallye. It announced plans in March to sell 1 billion euros of
assets by the end of 2010 to cut debts, but some analysts are
disappointed there have been no major deals announced so far. Net debt rose to 6 billion euros June 30, up from 5.87
billion a year earlier. But Casino said it was sticking to its
goal of reducing its ratio of net debt to earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) this year,
and cutting it to less than 2.2 percent by the end of 2010. Casino's shares trade at 11.2 times forecast earnings, below
Wal-Mart on 13.4 and Carrefour on 14.4, according to Reuters
data. ""Valuation remains undemanding despite a recent rally but
we remain concerned about the sustainability of Casino's high
margins with a threatened top line, and the high leverage of its
parent company Rallye,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a research
note, keeping a ""neutral"" rating on the shares. Casino said it made a first-half net profit of 231 million
euros, above a forecast for 189 million, helped in part by a
lower than expected tax rate.

379,"Aug 17, 2009 10:03AM ET",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-Metro looks east for growth over next decade,nan," * Deputy CEO says United States not on priority list * In advanced talks with Foxconn over J/V in China * Not in touch with Merrill Lynch yet over Karstadt * Says Metro financially secure for next two years * Metro shares fall 1.6 percent  By Eva Kuehnen and Nikola Rotscheroth (Adds detail, background and share price) DUESSELDORF, Germany, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Metro, the world's
fourth largest retailer, has set its sights on Eastern Europe
and Asia in its search for growth, giving the U.S. market the
cold shoulder, its deputy chief executive said. ""The United States is currently not on our top-priority
list,"" Thomas Unger told Reuters in an interview published on
Monday. ""We will increase our exposure to Eastern Europe and
especially to Asia, because that's where we see an enormous
growth potential in the long term."" ""We see great opportunities and challenges in Asia over the
next ten years,"" said Unger, who started as deputy CEO this
month, overseeing Metro's restructuring programme, the consumer
electronics, department store and real estate businesses. Unger, who will be replaced as chief financial officer on
Oct. 1 by Permira's Olaf Koch, said the Germany-based retailer
was in talks on forming a joint venture in China. It had also covered all its financing needs for the next two
years.  HIGH EXPOSURE Metro makes about a third of sales in Eastern Europe, Africa
and Asia, where it operates about a quarter of its 2,128 stores. In Asia and Eastern Europe it banks on a strong performance
from its consumer electronics division, Media Markt and Saturn
-- No. 1 in Europe -- and its wholesale business Cash & Carry,
the company's most profitable core units with operating margins
of 3.2 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively. Its high exposure to Eastern Europe is one reason why Metro
traded at a discount to the likes of France's Carrefour and
Britain's Tesco at the height of the economic crisis. The region's currencies have fallen sharply against the
euro, knocking 50 million euros ($71.4 million) off Metro's
first-half operating earnings, the company has said.
 To compensate, Metro tries to keep costs local and recently
became the first western company to issue a corporate bond in
Romania's currency, raising 80 million leu.
Metro now trades at a slight premium to peers as its
consumer electronics and wholesale businesses are seen as
winners in an economic recovery. The economy in its home market expanded unexpectedly by 0.3
percent in the second quarter, bringing an end to Germany's 
deepest recession since World War Two.  SHOP TALK Metro launched its biggest-ever revamp in January, including
at least 15,000 job cuts and with the potential to boost
operating profit by 1.5 billion euros from 2012. The programme
will cost about 650 million euros over 2009-2011.  Unger said the slump had meant the net positive impact on
earnings from the programme would be less than 1.5 billion
euros, though he could not say by how much. On average, analysts polled by Reuters expect full-year
adjusted operating profit to fall 14 percent to 1.9 billion
euros -- a far cry from Metro's mid-term goal to grow profit
before one-offs by more than 8 percent. In its push to go east, Metro has adopted an aggressive new
store opening strategy and is in advanced talks with Taiwan's
Foxconn Technology to set up a joint venture with its electronic
media store chain Media Markt and Saturn in China. Cash & Carry already operates 60 stores in Asia and plans to
expand its network significantly in India and China, Unger said.  KAUFHOF AND KARSTADT? In the long run, Metro aims to spin off its department store
unit Kaufhof and has said it would be interested in buying about
60 stores from rival Karstadt whose insolvent parent company
Arcandor is heading for break-up. It has so far not been in touch with Merrill Lynch, which
has been appointed to assess Karstadt's future. ""But we
signalled that we are open for talks,"" Unger said.  One option would be to combine some Karstadt stores with
Kaufhof and float the company on the stock market in a couple of
years' time, Unger said. Metro shares were down 1.8 percent at 37.14 euros by 1354
GMT, roughly in line with a 1.7 percent fall in the DJ Stoxx

 (Adds credit market reaction) By Eva Kuehnen DUESSELDORF, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Germany's Metro, the world's
fourth-largest retailer, said on Monday that it expected sales
to fall further in the coming months, mainly due to rising
unemployment. ""In western Europe we see possible signs of stabilisation.
However, talking today about green shoots would not be prudent,""
Chief Executive Eckhard Cordes said after Metro posted falling
second-quarter sales and profits. ""Clear signs for a fast economic upswing after the severe
downfall are so far not discernible ... We expect that retail
sales will further decline in the coming months,"" Metro said. Metro's second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and
tax (EBIT) fell 6.1 percent to 307 million euros ($433 million),
above the average estimate of 297 million in a Reuters poll of
analysts, while sales fell 3.8 percent to 15.34 billion euros,
below the poll average of 15.49 billion. Retailers across the world are struggling in the economic
downturn as consumer spending has dropped due to rising
unemployment and concern over the global economic crisis. German retail sales unexpectedly fell 1.6 percent
year-on-year in June, denting hopes that consumer spending could
help support Europe's largest economy, though jobless numbers
unexpectedly fell in July. Carrefour, Europe's No.1 retailer, announced in June its
third profit warning in 12 months, underscoring a tough year
ahead for the industry. Its second-quarter sales fell 1.2
percent.  Metro shares were down 0.8 percent at 40.30 euros at 1325
GMT, having been as low as 39.42 euros earlier in the day and 
underperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European
retail index. ""The figures met market expectations. Nevertheless, the
retail environment for the retailers remains challenging, as we
see a weak consumer climate in all European countries,"" said
UniCredit analyst Volker Bosse, who confirmed his ""sell"" rating. In the credit market, five-year credit default swaps on
Metro narrowed by 7.5 basis points to around 131.50 basis
points, according to data from Markit. RBC Capital Markits said in a note that Metro's net debt
increased substantially from the year-end figure -- which was
4.6 billion euros -- to 8.4 billion euros, but this was a usual
seasonal effect for the company, and the increase was only 0.1
billion euros from June 2008. ""The credit market is in a mood right now that this slight
miss is not going to have an impact on price,"" said Roger
Appleyard, an analyst at RBC. ""Their cash flow is fine; the
liquidity position is fine; they are making a decent profit.""  ""As long as they are ticking the boxes, the CDS could
tighten a little bit, in line with the market,"" he said. Metro said rising unemployment could further burden the
retail business and it did not expect its sales and earnings
trends to change significantly in the second half of the year. It said adjusted operating earnings were not expected to
fall by 20 percent in the full year as they did in the first
half, pointing to easing pressure from currency exchange rates
and from prior year comparable figures. Metro, which is more exposed to eastern European markets
than other retailers, suffered particularly from weakening
exchange rates against the euro in Russia and Poland. Metro trades at a premium to Carrefour and Britain's Tesco
because its Cash & Carry and its consumer electronic operations
are more cyclical than other retailers' businesses and would be
more in demand when recovery kicks in, analysts said.

 (Adds analyst comment, shares, detail) By Reed Stevenson AMSTERDAM, July 28 (Reuters) - Dutch supermarket group Ahold
 increased quarterly sales but missed forecasts as the economic
slump drove shoppers to cut their spending on food. Shares in the firm, which had gained market share thanks to
a restructuring it adopted well ahead of rivals, fell to a
four-month low after it reported on Tuesday second quarter sales
of 6.43 billion euros. The figure was well below the average of 6.56 billion euros
expected in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts as growth in its U.S.
business lagged. The Amsterdam-based food group operates U.S. Stop & Shop and
Giant food sellers and the Albert Heijn franchise in the
Netherlands. Although the sales figure reflected a healthy 11.5 percent
rise from 5.77 billion euros a year earlier in the current
sluggish economic climate, the result fell below the lowest
analyst forecast for 6.48 billion euros. ""Ahold's trading update was much weaker than expected,"" said
SNS Securities analyst Richard Withagen. ""The company has been
able to keep competition at bay for a long time, but that
appears to be changing with today's set of numbers."" Shares in Ahold fell 4.3 percent to 8.03 euros by 0836 GMT,
compared with a flat DJ Stoxx European retail index.  ROBUST GROWTH Ahold adopted restructuring measures well ahead of its
competitors, such as Delhaize and Kroger, revamping stores and
operations to enable it to post robust sales even as economic
growth stalled. But consumers, who are opting to buy groceries instead of
eating out in a weak economic environment, have become more
price-conscious and more careful with their spending, Ahold
said. ""Inflation slowed considerably and we continued to see
changing customer and competitor behaviour, with an increased
focus on price and promotions,"" the company said in a statement. That was especially evident in slower sales growth at
Ahold's U.S. businesses. Sales at Ahold's U.S. operation Stop & Shop and
Giant-Landover rose 2.8 percent to $4.1 billion. Its other U.S.
supermarket franchise Giant-Carlisle reported a sales increase
of 0.4 percent to $1.1 billion. Petercam analyst Fernand de Boer noted that Ahold's U.S'
performance was still relatively strong, and that sales in its
home market reflected Ahold's continued dominance over Dutch
competitors. At Ahold's Dutch chain Albert Heijn, sales rose 7.8 percent
to 2.2 billion euros. Ahold's overall growth rate also exceeded that of larger
European rivals, including Carrefour -- which earlier this month
posted a 1.2 percent fall in second quarter sales -- and Tesco,
where sales in the UK rose at their fastest rate for two years
to post growth of 9.7 percent. (Reporting by Reed Stevenson; editing by Simon Jessop, John

 By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, July 21 (Reuters) - European shares rose for the
seventh straight session on Tuesday, reaching their highest
close since early January, with mining and energy stocks in the
lead while banks and mobile phone maker Nokia fell. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares advanced
0.8 percent to 888.18 points -- its highest close since Jan. 6. The European benchmark index has gained 37.5 percent since
it hit a lifetime low on March 9. ""I am very confident about European stocks,"" said Gary
Clarke, head of European Equity at fund manager Schroders. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of European shares at
11-12 was ""very attractive"", for example compared with U.S.
stocks trading at a P/E of about 15, he said in a note, adding
that dividend yields in Europe were higher than in the United
States. Credit Suisse in a global equity strategy note upgraded
equities to ""overweight"". ""We are halfway through the first 'V' of an upward sloping
W-shaped recovery, with a likely peak in early Q4. Corporates
have to rebuild inventories, which could send global industrial
production up 10 percent year-on-year,"" Credit Suisse said. ""Earnings revisions are now positive for the first time
since August 2007,"" Credit Suisse said, adding that this was 
usually associated with stocks rising 5 percent over 3 months. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, testifying before the
House Financial Services Committee, said on Tuesday the outlook
for the U.S. economy appeared to be improving. Some bellwether U.S. companies, notably Caterpillar,
reported quarterly earnings above market expectations. Caterpillar, however, later warned that the third quarter
will be ""very tough"" on sales and it was conceivable the company
would lose money during the period, sending U.S. benchmark stock
indexes into negative territory.  COPPER RALLY In Europe, mining added the most points to the FTSEurofirst
300 index. Copper prices rose more than 2 percent to nine-month
highs. Anglo American gained 4.1 percent, BHP Billiton was up 2.6
percent and Rio Tinto added 2.3 percent. the DJ Stoxx basic
resources index, which includes miners, rose 2.2 percent. Crude oil touched a two-week high above $65 a barrel,
lifting European energy stocks such as Total, up 1.7 percent,
ENI, up 1.2 percent, and StatoilHydro, also up 1.2 percent. Healthcare was another sector showing strength, AstraZeneca
 and GlaxoSmithKline rising 1.7 percent each. Among food retailers Wm Morrison shot up 8.2 percent after
the company raised its full-year outlook
. Sainsbury climbed 3.1 percent, Carrefour added 1.7 percent and
Tesco rose 1.4 percent. Upmarket French luxury goods group Hermes rose 4 percent
after posting a 12 percent rise in second-quarter sales, driven
by demand for its handbags and perfumes. Banks, which have outperformed the broader market with a
rise of 122 percent since March 9, were among Tuesday's top
losers, with CS Group down 3.6 percent, BNP Paribas falling 1.7
percent, UBS dropping 1.4 percent and Barclays closing 1.2
percent lower. Nokia lost 2.5 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the
stock to ""underweight"" from ""overweight"", citing a ""threat from
rising competition in all segments"". Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.9 percent,
the German DAX added 1.3 percent and the French CAC 40 gained
1.0 percent while Zurich's SMI lagged with a gain of 0.2
percent.

percent around midday on Tuesday, advancing for the seventh
consecutive session and reaching a five-week high, led by 
buoyant financial stocks such as Santander and Axa. At 1106 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.5 percent at 885.85 points. Food retailers were also among the biggest gainers,
propelled by Wm Morrison's raised outlook for full-year results.
Morrison surged 8.3 percent, Carrefour added 1.6 percent, Tesco
 rose 1.7 percent and Sainsbury climbed 2.5 percent. Nokia, the world's top cellphone maker, dropped 2.9 percent
after Morgan Stanley slashed its rating on the stock to
""underweight"" from ""overweight"", citing a ""threat from rising
competition in all segments"". ""Although smartphone value share ticked up in the second
quarter, we expect it to fall again, after a slew of recent
competitor launches and potential expansion of the iPhone into
China and new operators in Europe,"" Morgan Stanley analysts
wrote in a note. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which is up 6.5 percent in 2009,
has surged 8.8 percent over the past seven sessions -- the
index's longest winning run since August 2007 -- powered by
better-than-feared company profits. ""We're getting into a short-term overbought situation, so it
would not be surprising to see consolidation down the road, but
that would not change the medium-term improved technical
picture,"" said Achim Matzke, European stock indexes analyst at
Commerzbank, in Frankfurt. So far in the current earnings season, 26 companies of
Europe's STOXX 600 have posted results for the quarter, of which
12 have beat estimates, one has matched and 13 have missed the
estimates, according to Thomson Reuters research data. Improving corporate results and early signs of a global
economic turnaround have sparked a debate about how and when
policymakers will remove the unprecedented stimulus measures
introduced as the credit crisis sent equity markets plummeting
last year.  FED'S EXIT STRATEGY In an opinion piece published on the Wall Street Journal's
website, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the
huge amounts of money the U.S. central bank has pumped into the
economy will not undercut its ability to push borrowing costs
higher when the time is ripe, but stressed that the weak U.S.
economy will likely warrant exceptionally easy policies for a
long time to come. The outline of the Fed's exit strategy from its
extraordinary monetary policy easing offered a preview of the
testimony Bernanke will give to Congress on Tuesday when he
presents the Fed's twice-a-year economic report. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.9
percent. Financial stocks were the biggest gainers, with Banco
Santander up 0.9 percent, Axa up 2.7 percent and UniCredit up
1.8 percent. Pharma stocks were also on the rise after Actelion and Elan
 posted forecast-beating results, with sales of key drugs
helping shield the companies from the recession. Actelion gained 3.9 percent and Elan rose 2.1 percent, while
AstraZeneca climbed 1.3 percent and Novartis added 0.8 percent. French luxury goods group Hermes rose 2 percent after
posting a 12 percent rise in second-quarter sales, helped by
strong demand for its leather bags.

 By Joanne Frearson LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - European shares closed higher on Friday for the
fifth straight day, with banks and commodity stocks the biggest gainers, as
investors confidence about a global economic recovery improves. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed up 0.4 percent
at 870.56 points in choppy trade, having fallen earlier to 865.82 points. The index is up around 7 percent this week, its best weekly gain since late
November, and is up around 34 percent from its lifetime low of March 9. ""We have had a whole week of great gains. The market has been anticipating a
decent set of earnings and the message the market has been looking for is that
the corporate sector is behind the worst of the recession,"" said Mike Lenhoff,
strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""While some results are going to be negative they probably are not going to
be as negative as they have been, while other companies are going to have
positive earnings. Investors are becoming more confident that the recovery is
now in its formative stages,"" he said. The banking sector was higher, rebounding from earlier falls as investors
digested results from U.S. peers Citigroup and Bank of America. HSBC, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Banco Santander were up 0.3-1.6
percent. Citigroup reported a $4.3 billion second-quarter profit thanks to gains on
its Smith Barney deal, while Bank of America posted a quarterly profit that
topped Wall Street forecasts.  ACCOR, CARREFOUR FALLS However, General Electric Co said profit fell by almost half, on a deeper
drop in revenue than Wall Street expected, as the slump that has gripped its
finance and media businesses took hold of its heavy industrial units. Energy stocks rose as crude oil gained 2.1 percent. BG Group, BP, Royal
Dutch Shell and Total were up 0.3-1.7 percent. Miners ticked up as copper gained 1.9 percent. Antofagasta, BHP Billiton,
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto and Xstrata were 0.5-5.8
percent higher. On the downside, Accor lost 7.5 percent after second-quarter sales dropped 9
percent as the economic crisis weighed on its hotel business. Carrefour was down 3.7 percent after, the world's second-biggest retailer
behind U.S. group Wal-Mart, said second-quarter sales fell 1.2 percent, hurt by
weaker western European markets, lower petrol prices and exchange rates. Looking at macroeconomic data, helping buoy investor enthusiasm, new U.S.
housing starts and permits jumped more than expected in June, propelled by a
rise in single-family homes, a government report showed. ""Starts are at a very low level but we have established a base in the last
six months and I would say this is confirmation that starts are not going to go
any lower and the increase in permits might actually see thins move up from
here,"" said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX was 0.4
percent higher and France's CAC 40 was up 0.6 percent.

 (Adds detail, CFO comment, analyst comment) PARIS, July 16 (Reuters) - Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer
behind U.S. group Wal-Mart, said second-quarter sales fell 1.2 percent, hurt by
weaker western European markets, lower petrol prices and exchange rates. The drop to 23.44 billion euros ($33.04 billion), including a 3 percent fall
in its domestic market, was slightly less than the expected 1.9 percent decline
to 23.28 billion euros based on the average of estimates from nine analysts
polled by Reuters. ""It was all pretty much pre-released. I would highlight that within France,
the hypermarkets were worse than expected and the supermarkets were better,"" one
analyst said on condition of anonymity. ""There's a deterioration in the
hypermarket numbers in the second quarter."" Carrefour, with some 490,000 staff in over 15,000 stores in 30 countries,
had already issued a profit warning at an analyst day on June 30 when it said
first-half sales should be about 46 billion euros. First-quarter sales were 22.7
billion. ""Carrefour posted resilient half-year sales in an environment that shows no
signs of improving in the short term,"" Chief Executive Lars Olofsson said in a
statement on Thursday. ""In the second quarter, we saw encouraging results of the actions we have
started to implement ... The strategic initiatives that we are implementing
should show positive results in the second half."" Carrefour said on June 30 that it plans to make savings of 4.5 billion euros
by 2012 by cutting operating costs, improving purchasing terms and reducing
inventory times. Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut confirmed on a conference call a
forecast given then that full-year operating profit would decline to 2.7-2.8
billion euros from 3.3 billion.  FRANCE UP SLIGHTLY WITHOUT FUEL In France, which contributed 10.14 billion euros of Carrefour's
second-quarter revenue, second quarter like-for-like hypermarket sales fell 5.3
percent, or 1.4 percent excluding petrol, while hard discount stores posted a
7.5 percent decline in like-for-like sales. Excluding petrol, sales in France rose 0.6 percent in the quarter, Carrefour
said. Retailers across the world are struggling in an economic downturn. Carrefour
has suffered more than most due to its exposure to weak western European markets
and to sales of non-food goods, which have been hit harder than groceries. Wal-Mart posted a 0.6 percent fall in first-quarter sales, while British
rival Tesco reported a 9.7 percent increase, helped in part by favourable
exchange rates. Smaller French rival Casino on Wednesday posted a 1.9 percent drop in
second-quarter sales, broadly in line with analyst estimates, pulled down by
lower petrol prices and declines at its French hypermarkets. Carrefour said total second-quarter sales excluding petrol and the impact
from currencies rose 2 percent. Like-for-like sales excluding petrol slid 0.5
percent. The group saw a continued slowdown across all formats in Spain, ""reflecting
a difficult environment"". However, there was a slight improvement in trends in Italy and Belgium,
supported by improved food sales, Carrefour added.

388,"Jul 16, 2009 12:56PM ET",UPDATE 1-Russia retail law seeks to cap grocers' growth,nan," *No new space for chains with more than $30 million turnover *Chains with high market share also barred from expanding *Anti-monopoly agency does not advocate turnover limits 
 (Adds comment from retailers' anti-monopoly regulator) By Maria Kiselyova and Maria Plis MOSCOW, July 16 (Reuters) - Russia's government, which came to the aid of
top food retailers in hopes they would mop up weak rivals in the financial
crisis, is now putting the brakes on growth in a new draft law, a copy of the
bill showed on Thursday. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit last month to a
supermarket run by Russia's largest retail chain and scolded its management for
charging too much for meat and sausage. The chain immediately announced a ""grand
sale"". Russians' purchasing power slumped in the country's first recession in a
decade, which saw the rouble devalued, unemployment spike to 10 percent and real
wages decline. Putin's government is keen to avoid public outrage at economic
decline. The bill stipulates food retailers with annual sales of more than 1 billion
roubles ($31.21 million) or market share of more than 25 percent in Moscow, St
Petersburg, or any given city district, cannot buy or lease additional trade
space. Yevgeny Fyodorov, head of the Duma Committee for Economic Policies, told
Reuters by telephone that the amendment was explicitly intended to rein in
national retail chains. ""It is always better to have ten small Gazproms than one big one,"" Fyodorov
said, referring to the powerful Russian state gas export monopoly. ""The sector must develop ... but it does not mean that we should have one
chain for the entire country,"" he said. He said the draft law, submitted to the Duma lower house of parliament on
Thursday, received government backing on Monday. It was unclear how the bill would affect Wal-Mart, Carrefour and other
aspirants to Russia's retail market, one of the fastest growing in the world
until the crisis and still lacking in modern, Western style shops. Earlier versions of the bill were based on industry consultations between
suppliers and food retailers, who escaped outright price controls in the draft. Timofei Nizhegorodtsev, in charge of retail trade controls at the

districts where their market share already exceeds 25 percent,"" he said, adding
that turnover-based limits required closer study.  X5, MAGNIT PROTEST The chief executives of Russia's two top food retailers, who have managed to
staunch sales declines by opening new stores this year, decried the unexpected
amendment to the bill and said they expected it would be changed during debate

X5 Retail Group, said the amendments were absurd. ""They are so absurd that I hope that the government will adjust them in
accordance with common sense,"" he told Reuters. ""It cannot be that they forbid us to open new stores and develop. The whole
sense of the business is getting lost. It will hit the investment appeal of the
retail business,"" Sergei Galitski, the CEO of Magnit, said. X5 and Magnit, which is Russia's largest grocery chain by number of stores,
had sales of about $9 billion and more than $5 billion respectively in 2008. They received a combined total of roughly 11.5 billion roubles in state bank
loans and credit lines to help cope with the crisis.

389,"Jul 16, 2009 09:32AM ET",Russia retail law seeks to cap grocers' growth,nan," By Maria Kiselyova and Maria Plis MOSCOW, July 16 (Reuters) - Russia's government, which came
to the aid of top food retailers in hopes they would mop up weak
rivals in the crisis, is now putting the brakes on growth in a
new draft law, a copy of the bill showed on Thursday. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit last
month to a supermarket run by Russia's largest retail chain and
scolded its management for charging too much for meat and
sausasge. The chain immediately announced a ""grand sale"". Ordinary Russians' purchasing power slumped in the country's
first recession in a decade, which saw the rouble devalued,
unemployment spike to 10 percent and real wages decline. Putin's
government is keen to avoid public outrage at economic decline. The bill stipulates food retailers with annual sales of more
than 1 billion roubles ($31.21 million) or market share of more
than 25 percent in Moscow, St Petersburg, or any given city
district, cannot buy or lease additional trade space. Yevgeny Fyodorov, head of the Duma Committee for Economic
Policies, told Reuters the amendment was explicitly intended to
rein in national retail chains. ""It is always better to have ten small Gazproms than one big
one,"" Fyodorov said, referring to the powerful Russian state gas
export monopoly. ""The sector must develop...but it does not mean that we
should have one chain for the entire country,"" he said by
telephone. He said the draft law, submitted to the Duma lower house of
parliament on Thursday, received the government's backing on
Monday. It was unclear how the bill would affect Wal-Mart, Carrefour
 and other aspirants to Russia's retail market, one of the
fastest growing in the world until the crisis and still lacking
in modern, Western style shops. Earlier versions of the bill were based on industry
consultations between suppliers and food retailers, who escaped
outright price controls in the draft.  X5, MAGNIT PROTEST The chief executives of Russia's two top food retailers, who
have managed to staunch sales declines by opening new stores
this year, decried the unexpected amendment to the bill and said
they expected it would be changed during debate in parliament. Lev Khasis, the chief executive officer of Russia's largest
grocer by sales, X5 Retail Group, said the amendments were
absurd. ""They are so absurd that I hope that the government will

develop. The whole sense of the business is getting lost. It
will hit the investment appeal of the retail business,"" Sergei
Galitski, the CEO of Magnit, said. The Federal Anti-monopoly Service which, Fyodorov said, is
backing the amendments, declined immediate comment. X5 and Magnit, which is Russia's largest grocery chain by
the number of stores, had sales of about $9 billion and more
than $5 billion respectively in 2008.  They received a combined total of roughly 11.5 billion
roubles in state bank loans and credit lines to help cope with

 (Adds detail) PARIS, July 15 (Reuters) - French supermarket group Casino
posted a 1.9 percent drop in second-quarter sales, broadly in
line with analyst estimates, pulled down by lower petrol prices
and declines at its French hypermarkets. But the company said underlying sales excluding petrol and
calendar effects rose 1.1 percent as 4.8 percent growth in its
international business offset a 1.1 percent drop in its domestic
market and hypermarket sales fell at a slower rate. ""Sales trend at the hypermarkets showed tangible improvement
with same-store sales down 4.2 percent excluding petrol --
versus an 8.6 percent fall in the first quarter -- underpinned
by the marketing initiatives launched since the end of March,""
Casino said in a statement on Wednesday. The group reported second-quarter sales of 6.82 billion
euros, including 4.32 billion in France, compared with the
average 6.8 billion estimate from three analysts surveyed by
Reuters, who expected France sales of 4.3 billion. Larger rival Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer
behind U.S. group Wal-Mart, is expected to post a 1.9 percent
decline in second-quarter sales on Thursday to 23.28 billion
euros. Retailers have been struggling worldwide during the economic
downturn as consumers pay more attention to household budgets
and cut spending on non-essential items, weighing particularly
on hypermarkets. Casino said its French convenience formats were performing
satisfactorily, with sales up, whilst discount customers were
limiting their purchases, sending same-store sales at its Leader
Price shops down 6.1 percent. ""The group is in line with its business plan and is
continuing to rapidly deploy its cost-cutting programme and
optimise its food and non-food product mixes,"" Casino said. Casino added that it still expected to improve its net debt
to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation) ratio by the end of the year and to bring it below
2.2 by the end of next year. Casino shares, which rose 2.9 percent on Wednesday, have
lost 14.3 percent so far this year, underperforming a 19.2
percent gain on the DJ Stoxx European retail index. (Reporting by James Regan, by Marcel Michelson)

Carrefour and Casino are expected to post declines of around 2
percent in second-quarter sales on a year ago, underscoring
tough trading conditions in their home market. Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer behind U.S.
group Wal-Mart, is seen reporting a 1.9 percent fall to 23.28
billion euros ($32.7 billion), according to the average of
estimates from nine analysts polled by Reuters. The data shouldn't come as a surprise after Carrefour, which
employs around 490,000 people in more than 15,000 stores in 30
countries, issued a profit warning at an analyst day on June 30. At that time, the group said first-half sales should be
about 46 billion euros. First-quarter sales were 22.7 billion. Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut said then that
like-for-like sales excluding petrol and adjusted for any
calendar impact slid 0.8 percent in the second quarter, less
than the 1.3 percent decline seen in the first quarter. Reported like-for-like sales improved slightly in
Carrefour's domestic market, but Spain saw a 6.5 percent decline
and Italy a 2.6 percent drop, he said, adding that the group
experienced a ""difficult market environment"" in the first half. Retailers across the world are struggling in an economic
downturn. Carrefour has suffered more than most due to its
exposure to weak western European markets and to sales of
non-food goods, which have been hit harder than groceries. Wal-Mart posted a 0.6 percent fall in first-quarter sales,
while British rival Tesco reported a 9.7 percent increase,
helped in part by favourable exchange rates. ""The pre-announcements of Q2 trading and H1 profits at
Carrefour's investor day has put much of the bad news on the
table,"" Bernstein Research analysts wrote in a note. ""We now expect little incremental information from its Q2
trading update."" Carrefour is fighting back by cutting prices, putting
pressure on rivals such as Casino. But this has hit profit
margins, triggering last month's profit warning. Three analysts surveyed by Reuters predicted Casino would
post second-quarter total consolidated net sales from continuing
operations of about 6.8 billion euros, down from 6.95 billion a
year earlier -- a drop of about 2.2 percent. All three analysts expect sales in France to total 4.3
billion euros, down from 4.55 billion a year ago. They see French like-for-like hypermarket sales including
petrol down between 10.5 and 10.8 percent, hit in part by the
step up in competition from Carrefour. ""Following a poor Q1 performance and increased price
investment in this quarter, we do not anticipate French sales
having taken another leg down and look for a performance broadly
in line with Q1,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note. ""With the competitive environment in France becoming
increasingly aggressive and subsequent price investment by
Casino, concern remains over the likely margin impact."" Casino shares have underperformed the DJ Stoxx European
retail index by about 15 percent this year. Carrefour has lagged
by 4 percent, supported in part by its announcement last month
of a plan to make 4.5 billion euros of savings, mainly by
cutting costs and improving purchasing terms, by 2012.

392,"Jul 03, 2009 06:16AM ET",UPDATE 1-Euro zone May retail sales fall more than expected,nan," (Adds analyst views, background, details) By Darren Ennis BRUSSELS, July 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell
further than expected in May, data showed on Friday, dampening
hopes that an improvement in consumer spending might ease the
recession. Retail sales in the 16-country currency area fell 0.4
percent month-on-month, the European Union statistics office
said, worse than the 0.1 percent drop expected by economists in
a Reuters poll.  Sales fell 3.3 percent year-on-year, while analysts had
expected a 2.7 percent decrease. The data, which came a day after the European Central Bank
kept euro zone interest rates steady at 1.0 percent, showed
consumer demand continued to suffer from the worst recession
since World War Two. ""There was further confirmation today, if any were needed,
that domestic demand is not set to ride to the rescue of the
euro area economy any time soon,"" Colin Ellis, economist at
Daiwa Securities, said. Nick Kounis of Fortis bank said: ""These figures are a little
surprising especially after good German numbers earlier in the
week. One of the trends that we are seeing is strong car sales
and these figures don't include car sales."" German retail sales rose for a third consecutive month in
May, gaining 0.4 percent on low inflation-spurred demand. ""Now that there are some sorts of support measures from
governments like extra child benefits in Germany, or the
reduction in VAT for restaurants, consumption in total may
benefit ... but overall the outlook for consumption remains
quite weak,"" Citigroup's Juergen Michels said.  ECB PLAN B? Eurostat revised down its retail trade figures for April to
a rise of 0.1 percent month-on-month and a fall of 2.5 percent
annually from the previous readings of plus 0.2 percent and
minus 2.3 percent, further illustrating recent cautious outlooks
given by some of Europe's top retailers.
  Euro zone retail sales had inched up month-on-month for the
first time in five months in April and their annual decline was
lower than expected. Most large European retailers, such as Carrefour, Tesco and
Marks and Spencer, have been reporting signs that consumer
confidence is stabilising, but there has been little indication
that spending is picking up.  Carrefour, Europe's No. 1 retailer, announced in June its
third profit warning in 12 months, underscoring a tough year
ahead for the industry despite a rally in retail stocks on hopes
of a recovery. Sales of non-food products in the euro zone in May dropped
0.6 percent month-on-month and 3.4 percent year-on-year despite
good weather, which normally boosts consumer spending. Eurostat said food, drink and tobacco sales increased 0.2
percent on the month, but fell 1.7 percent from a year earlier. Retail sales are an indication of household demand, under
pressure from rising unemployment due to factory closures and
lay-offs. Joblessness in the euro zone rose in May to 9.5
percent, its highest in 10 years.  ""More fundamentally, regardless of whether firms cut costs
by shedding jobs or cutting hours, that still represents a fall
in aggregate household income across the economy as a whole,""
said Daiwa's Ellis.  ""Essentially, we find ourselves coming back to the same
question as yesterday -- does the ECB have a plan B if its
current actions fail to revive domestic demand?""

session of the quarter in positive territory, with strong metals
prices on Wednesday boosting mining shares, while banks rose
after slipping in four of the past seven days. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 1.8
percent higher at 865.66 points after falling 1.1 percent on the
last day of the second quarter. But the benchmark index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008,
gained nearly 16 percent in the second quarter, its best
performance since late 1999. Miners got strength from a 3 percent rise in copper prices,
2 percent higher aluminium prices and a 6 percent hike in
nickel.  BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,
Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources rose between 2.5 and 6.3
percent. India-focused mining group Vedanta rose 9.9 percent after
the London-listed company said it has boosted the size of its
share buy-back programme by 40 percent to $350 million. ""Resource stocks are a good barometer of global economic
sentiment and today the miners and energy firms are the standout
performers,"" said David Evans, analyst at BetOnMarkets.com. Energy shares were among the top gainers as crude jumped 2.5
percent to trade above $71 a barrel before surrendering gains in
the late afternoon session. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total
and StatoilHydro added between 1.4 and 4.2 percent. Among the banks, Commerzbank surged 18.6 percent after the
parliamentary parties in Germany's ruling coalition backed a
plan to establish ""bad banks"" for struggling lenders, which the
government hopes will spur lending and reinvigorate the economy.
 Other banks also advanced, with Standard Chartered Bank,
HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas and Deutsche
Postbank up 1.4 to 8.8 percent. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were 2.0 to 2.4 percent higher.  CAUTIOUS APPROACH Despite Wednesday's sharp rally in stocks, some analysts
advised caution ahead of the second-quarter company results.
Latest macroeconomic data also dampened hopes the economy was
emerging from its worst slump since the Great Depression. Figures showed that U.S. private employers cut almost half a
million jobs in June and mortgage applications fell to a
seven-month low last week. The news supported other evidence from Europe and Asia that
a broad recovery would be slow in coming, as euro zone
manufacturing activity contracted in June, with Germany lagging
behind other nations, and Japanese business morale disappointed. The U.S. manufacturing sector shrank in June but at a slower
pace than during the prior month, according to a report by the
Institute for Supply Management. ""The major indices have been consolidating for one to two
months, so it wouldn't surprise me if that pattern continued in
the next month or two,"" said Andrew Bell, head of research at
Rensburg Sheppards. ""The test is going to come in the next few weeks as the
second quarter earnings numbers will start to come in. They are
unlikely to be great but the question is will the accompanying
trading statements be encouraging, against the very cautious
statements we had in April."" Carrefour rose 5.7 percent after the world's second-biggest
retailer unveiled a plan to save 4.5 billion euros by 2012 to
boost profits at the group.Britain's Marks & Spencer rose 3.8 percent after posting a
smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter underlying sales.

led lower by banks and energy companies, after U.S. consumer
confidence readings proved weaker than expected, but European
equities gained 15.9 percent over the second quarter.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1.1
percent to 850.17 points. The index rose 15.9 percent over the
second quarter, its best performance since 1999, having hit a
lifetime low on March 9. However, the rally has stalled in recent weeks, as some
analysts feel it had gone too far, relative to the evidence of
recovery. ""We're at that stage now, where bad news will make a bigger
dent than decent news,"" said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC
Partners, in London. ""And it doesn't take much. Volumes are so
low today, they're just tiny.""  U.S. consumer confidence fell in June after two straight
months of gains. The Conference Board, an industry group, said
on Tuesday its index of consumer attitudes dropped to 49.3 from
54.8 in May. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Societe Generale fell
between 1.7 and 2.9 percent. Lloyds Banking Group fell 0.9

 Crude oil prices fell more than 3 percent to less than
$69.30 a barrel, hurting energy shares. Total, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol and StatoilHydro fell
between 1.2 and 1.7 percent. The price of copper and other metals was also hurt by the
fall in consumer confidence. Mining groups Anglo American,
Antofagasta, Rio Tinto and Xstrata fell between 1.8 and 2.7
percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down between 1 and 1.7 percent. Wall Street was lower as European bourses were closing. The
Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down between 0.8

Europe's biggest retailer had not, by the time the market

in Paris. The company released information later.
  Marks & Spencer fell 1.1 percent, ahead of a trading update

percent, recovering some ground lost recently, after saying it

midday on Tuesday, as a drop in retail and food stocks such as
Carrefour eclipsed gains in pharma shares, led by
Sanofi-Aventis's rebound from last week's selloff. Shares in Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer,
dropped 2 percent on disappointment the company had not, so far,
unveiled a big cost-cutting programme at an analyst day in
Paris. Other retailers and food and drinks groups lost ground, with
Tesco down 1.1 percent, Heineken down 2.1 percent and Unilever
down 1.4 percent. At 1137 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.03 percent at 859.34 points. The index, which is up 3.3 percent this year, has surged 33
percent since plummeting to a record low in early March, but the
spring rally has stalled since early May, as mixed macroeconomic
data dampened hopes of speedy economic recovery. ""Equities will remain stuck in the range that we've seen
over the past few weeks, with high volatility and low volumes,
as people are waiting for more visibility,"" said Victor Peiro
Perez, head of strategy at Caja Madrid Bolsa. ""That should go on at least until we get the second-quarter
results and outlook from companies."" The FTSEurofirst 300 is on track to record a 17 percent gain
on the quarter -- its best quarterly performance since 1999. But
Europe's benchmark index is still down 47 percent from a
multi-year high reached in mid-2007. But while the spring rally lost steam over the past few
weeks, investors continued to pour money into equities. A Reuters survey on Tuesday showed fund managers in
continental Europe pulled capital out of cash in June and
boosted stock holdings to their highest since August. The monthly survey of 14 investment houses in the region,
released on Tuesday, showed equity holdings rose to 47.1 percent
of their portfolios this month from 45.9 percent in May.  EARNINGS SEASON KEY A number of analysts say the real test for the equity rally
will be the second-quarter earnings season. The results were
expected to be relatively bad, but investors will look for any
signs of a turnaround in profit. ""One of the factors driving renewed investor pessimism is to
do with earnings, where the view is that expectations have moved
too far too fast, setting the scene for a disappointment,"" said
JPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka in a note. ""There were some high profile negative pre-announcements
over the past few weeks, and it is highly likely there will be
more, but in contrast to the popular perception, the
pre-announcement season has been rather benign so far."" On Tuesday, investors were digesting grim economic data that
showed euro zone bank lending has stalled and Japanese
unemployment at its highest level for six years, adding to
worries over the outlook for the global economy. Pharmaceutical shares gained ground, with Sanofi-Aventis up
2.6 percent, paring some of its recent hefty losses sparked by
worries over one of the company's main drugs, and
GlaxoSmithKline up 1.5 percent. Banks were also on the upside, with Barclays up 2.1 percent,
UBS up 1.6 percent and UniCredit up 1 percent. So far this year, the DJ STOXX energy index is up 9 percent,
and the banking index is up 21 percent, while the health care

Xstrata  said it wanted merger talks. By 0836 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was down 1.2 percent at 851.12 points, after

market. ""(The markets) had a good day on Friday so it is a bit of a
move back from that... I do not think there is anything there,""

Richmond Fed index hold up or make gradual recovery back towards
neutral level tomorrow I think the markets look ok."" ""There is plenty of liquidity around and the Fed will
probably be confirming this week they have no plans to hike
interest rates. It is really the vulnerabilities surrounding
whether these indicators indicate ongoing movement back towards
neutrality. That is the most important. It is down to data this
week,"" he said. Miners added the most points to the index. Anglo American
soared 9.1 percent after Xstrata said on Sunday it wanted talks
with the group about a proposed merger of equals worth about $68
billion, seeking increased scale and cost synergies.
[ID:nLL443532] Xstrata was down 4.3 percent. Other miners were hit by falling metal prices with copper

sector were mixed. Banco Santander , Barclays ,
Deutsche Bank  and UBS  were down 1.1-1.8
percent. In individual stocks movers, British Airways  was
down 4.1 percent after the Daily Telegraph said it had clashed
with its pension trustees over a higher-risk investment strategy
that it believes has exacerbated the deficit in the fund, now
thought to top 3 billion pounds. French retailer Carrefour  gained 2 percent after
Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on the stock to ""neutral"" and
raised its price target to 32 euros from 26.5 euros. On Tuesday investors are likely to watch for the release of
Eurozone PMI figures and the U.S. Richmond Federal index. ""Unless there is going to be bad news then no one is going

France's CAC 40  was down 1.5 percent.

 (Adds quotes from Dankner interview, analyst) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, June 22 (Reuters) - Israeli holding company Koor
Industries Ltd is planning to invest up to 3.5 billion shekels
($886 million) in France's Carrefour SA and to rebuild its stake
in Credit Suisse Group AG. Koor, a subsidiary of IDB Holding, said it had cash to
invest and was looking for cheaply-valued, quality assets. ""At IDB we have significant liquidity and are looking for
high-quality investments that still trade at comfortable
prices,"" IDB Chairman and Chief Executive Nochi Dankner told
Reuters. The group already holds 1.76 million shares, or 0.25
percent, in Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer. It
paid 284 million shekels for the shares.  Koor last year began to buy and sell shares in Credit
Suisse, at one point reaching a stake of 3.4 percent, which made
it the third-largest shareholder in the Swiss bank. It has since
reduced its stake to 0.7 percent, reaping gains of over 2
billion shekels. ""Credit Suisse is one of the winners of the financial crisis
and I am sure that the bank will strengthen its position due its
solid and robust business model,"" Dankner said. ""We intend to rebuild IDB's stake in Credit Suisse. This
investment was and remains an excellent investment for IDB and I
like it very much.""  DEFENSIVE SECTOR Dankner said IDB has been studying Carrefour for close to a
year and noted the food retail sector is defensive, without the
volatility of other sectors. ""I like Carrefour's expansion to emerging markets, to South
America, China and India,"" he said. Dankner, who is IDB's major shareholder, said IDB has an
understanding of this sector through its subsidiary Super-Sol
Ltd, Israel's biggest supermarket chain. Blue Capital, a holding company owned by Bernard Arnault,
one of France's richest men, and property company Colony
Capital, holds 17.08 percent of the voting rights of Carrefour. ""I am sure that under the leadership of Bernard Arnault and
his team and the Colony Capital group, Carrefour will continue
to expand its business globally and to improve its
profitability,"" Dankner said. A market source, who asked not to be identified, said Koor
had approved an investment of 3.5 billion shekels in Carrefour
and could even surpass that. Limor Gruber, head of research at brokerage Psagot, said it
seemed a reasonable investment as Carrefour is in the process of
a global expansion. ""The price from what we see is okay,"" she
said. Shares in the French retailer, up 2.6 percent at 30.21 euros
at 1147 GMT, have dropped from a 2009 high of 33.05 euros set
earlier this month. Shares in Koor were up 0.1 percent, having spiked 1.8
percent at the market opening on the news. Koor said it had reached an agreement in principle for HSBC
to extend it credit of 300 million euros for the purchase of
shares. As it makes use of the credit, Koor will put up similar
amounts from its own resources. ""The use of the credit framework and the investment in
Carrefour shares is dependent on several conditions, including
the company's estimate as to market developments,"" it said.

 (Adds more quotes, details, background) By Maria Kiselyova MOSCOW, June 18 (Reuters) - French retail giant Carrefour, a
relatively late arrival to Russia, plans to stake out a leading
position in the market and is looking at all options to speed
growth, a top executive said on Thursday. ""We want to be among leading distributors in Russia in the
long term. We are talking about a very large market, so there
should be enough space for several big distributors,"" Executive
Director Thierry Garnier told a news conference. Garnier was speaking at the opening of Carrefour's first
store in Russia, in a newly built Moscow shopping mall, which
will be followed by two more hypermarket openings in the Russian
regions in 2009. Russian retailers are facing a difficult year as the country
enters recession while rising unemployment, slower income growth
and limited access to credit have hit most consumers. But the downturn may also offer global majors an easier
entry into a highly fragmented sector which has more potential
than many mature markets and where distressed asset prices are
set to plunge. Russia's top grocer by sales, X5 Retail Group, has a 4
percent share of the food retail market and had revenues in 2008
of about $9 billion. ""We have been waiting for the best environment to enter,""
Garnier said when asked why Carrefour had not moved into the
Russian market in the 1990s when the purchasing power of local
consumers was soaring on the back of high oil export revenues. A top French competitor, Auchan, was among the first foreign
hypermarket chains to hit Russia, opening its first Moscow store
in 2002 and now has more than 30 stores. It has expanded widely
in the provinces and plans to open another six stores this year. Another global major, Wal-Mart, may soon follow Carrefour's
Russian move and bankers say it is talking with local chains in
need of cash to cope with the crisis. ""We really believe in the potential of the Russian market in
long-term prospective and I think the best demonstration of our
confidence is that we are opening (our) first stores in 2009, a
difficult year for the world economy,"" Garnier said. The world's second-biggest retailer is seen as a potential
buyer of Moscow grocer Seventh Continent which would give
Carrefour an immediate foothold in the Russian market. ""In all countries we are looking at all the opportunities to
speed our development,"" Garnier said, but he declined to comment
on Seventh Continent specifically.  Banking sources have said the French hypermarket chain
offered to buy out the Moscow chain's main owner, Alexander
Zanadvorov, whose stake is collateralised with Deutsche Bank,
for up to $1.6 billion. A Russian radio station said on Wednesday the deal could go
ahead but daily business newspaper Vedomosti said on Thursday
the negotiations were halted. ""There are new rumours every day and I will not comment on
them,"" Garnier said. He said it was too early to say how many stores Carrefour
would have in its Russian chain by the end of 2010 or what
market share the company wanted to achieve. Carrefour also had no immediate plans to expand into the
neighbouring markets of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS). ""So far, only Russia is on the agenda for us,"" he said.

 (Adds more FD, analyst comments, detail, background, shares) By Mark Potter LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Tesco, the world's third-biggest
retailer, posted its best quarterly sales rise in Britain for
two years and said it was closing the gap on recent stronger
growth rates at its main domestic rivals.  Britain's biggest retailer said on Tuesday first-quarter
sales at UK stores open at least a year rose 4.3 percent,
excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, in line with forecasts and up
from 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. Group sales rose 9.7 percent, including petrol, in the 13
weeks to May 30, with strong growth in international markets
fuelled by new stores, currency moves and the benefits of an
acquisition in South Korea last year. Tesco, which makes about 70 percent of sales and three
quarters of trading profit in Britain, has been losing market
share for months to British rivals like Wal-Mart's Asda, J
Sainsbury and Wm Morrison. The group, which takes almost one in every three pounds
spent in a British supermarket, has said this is due mainly to
customers switching to its cheaper discount range, which has
boosted sales volumes but meant it has not benefited from food
price inflation as much as competitors.  ""The relative performance is closing,"" finance director
Laurie McIlwee told Reuters, adding rivals were also growing
strongly after fixing some ""real fundamentals"" in their
businesses around price and availability. McIlwee said Sainsbury, which is forecast to report a 7.3
percent rise in first-quarter sales on Wednesday, was also
benefiting from shoppers switching out of upmarket food
retailers like Marks & Spencer as well as strength in south
England. 
NO RECOVERY YET ""An encouraging statement,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive
Black. ""Tesco is a growth company and we see scope for it to
benefit from improving economies as low ticket discretionary
spend improves,"" he added, keeping a 'buy' rating on the stock. At 0805 GMT, Tesco shares were up 1.7 percent at 362.3
pence, topping a 0.6 percent rise on the DJ Stoxx European
retail index. McIlwee said it was too early to talk of a recovery in
Tesco's markets, but was encouraged that like-for-like sales
growth had returned to non-food lines like electricals,
homewares and toys, as well as upmarket ranges, like ""Finest"". ""We're still planning on a tough year,"" he said, adding
shoppers' main focus remained on the lowest prices. Sales of
Tesco's budget ""Value"" range were growing around 30 percent
year-on-year, he said. Tesco expected full-year underlying growth in Britain to be
towards the bottom of its long-term 3-4 percent target range, as
food price inflation eases, and was comfortable with analysts'
consensus annual profit forecast, McIlwee said.  Analysts expect Tesco to make profit before tax and one-off
items of 3.23 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) in the year to
February 2010, up from 3.13 billion in 2008-09, according to
Reuters Estimates.  Tesco, which employs around 470,000 people in over 4,300
stores in 14 countries, said first-quarter international sales
rose 20.1 percent rise at actual exchange rates, or 11.4 percent
at constant rates, with a strong performance in Asia offsetting
tougher trading in many continental European markets. Tesco shares have performed broadly in line with the DJ
Stoxx European retail index this year. They trade at 12.3 times
forecast earnings, below Sainsbury on 14.3 times and
international rival Carrefour on 12.6 times.  (Additional

mths * Banks lead gains; sector up 118 percent since early March * Defensives stocks catching up in cyclical-led rally * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Blaise Robinson PARIS, June 11 (Reuters) - European equities ended at their
highest close in five months on Thursday, propelled by buoyant
banking stocks, as U.S. macro data showing the recession was
abating helped shares extend their sharp three-month rally. Data showed sales at U.S. retailers rose in May for the
first time in three months, and the number of workers filing new
applications for jobless benefits fell for a fourth straight
week last week. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 0.9
percent higher at 887.78 points, the index's highest close since
Jan 6. Thursday's rally was led by banking shares, such as HSBC,
UBS, Barclays and BNP Paribas, up 2.2-5.6 percent. But sectors seen as defensive such as utilities, pharma and
telecoms -- shunned by investors during most of the spring rally
--  were also on the rise, with Vodafone up 2.5 percent, Roche
up 1.9 percent and E.ON up 1.3 percent. ""Cyclical stocks are now priced at valuation levels that we
usually see at mid-cycle. That's premature because the economic
activity is still in bad shape,"" said Chicuong Dang, equity
analyst at KBL Richelieu, in Paris. ""Meanwhile, valuation multiples in sectors such as telecoms
and utilities are still very attractive."" Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX index rose 1.1 percent, and France's CAC 40 added
0.6 percent. Auto stocks gained ground, with Daimler up 2.7 percent and
BMW up 1.2 percent. French car parts maker Valeo, upgraded to
""buy"" by Merrill Lynch, surged 8.5 percent. Among the few stocks on the downside, Carrefour lost 3.7
percent, dragged lower by market talk that the retailer could
lower its profit outlook, according to traders. Carrefour
declined to comment.  LOSING STEAM? The FTSEurofirst 300 has risen 38 percent since reaching a
record low in early March, as better-than-feared macro data
fuelled recovery hopes. The sharp rebound has been led by banks, up 118 percent over
the past 3 months, and basic resources, up 85 percent, while
sectors seen as defensive have lagged behind, with telecoms up
only 6 percent and healthcare, up 13 percent. But a number of analysts and fund managers warn we could see
a period of consolidation after the recent sharp gains because,
despite a few ""green shoots"", there is still a lack of
visibility on the outlook for the world economy. ""Equities, credits and commodities, government bonds have
had a torrid time,"" said Paul Niven, F&C's head of asset
allocation. ""From here, with valuation broadly fair and limited scope
for upside surprises in economic and corporate newsflow, we see
the risks on equities and credits as much more finely balanced,""
Niven wrote in a note. So far this year, UK's FTSE 100 index is up 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 6.2 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 3.6
percent. ""The stabilisation of the macro situation we see through
data is now priced in. To move higher from here, we need real

second-quarter earnings and revenue, signalling improving demand
in the chip market.    ""The implication is that Nokia, the large
global handset market bellwether, is seeing momentum towards

Santander, BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse were up 1.1-1.7
percent. HSBC lost 1.1 percent as traders cited concerns that a major
stakeholder may need to place shares. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department said that 10 of the
nation's biggest banks had been cleared to pay back a combined
$68 billion of taxpayer money pumped into them last year to
combat the credit crisis. The DJ Banking Eurostoxx banking index is up around 21
percent for the year following a 64.76 percent slump the
previous year. On the downside, defensive stocks were out of favour. Food
retailer Carrefour was down 3.2 percent and British American
Tobacco was 1.9 lower. Earlier stocks pared losses after German industrial
production fell unexpectedly by 1.9 percent month-on-month in
April, hit by a sharp fall in capital goods output, the Economy
Ministry said.    German exports resumed their slide in April
and imports fell even more sharply, tempering hopes that
Europe's largest economy will soon recover from its deepest
recession since World War Two.    ""Everything was struggling to
go up today as optimistic talk of recovery in the U.S. this

rising amid cautious statements from major companies about the
outlook for a recovery from one of the deepest recessions in
living memory, raising questions over the rally's real strength. The heads of luxury, retail, consumer goods and car
companies are all singing from the same song sheet, telling
investors the trading environment is very tough and further
sales and margins declines may be in prospect. Yet stock markets, which aim to anticipate future trends in
company earnings, have been bidding up the shares in these
companies for much of the past 10 weeks, helping them recover
from a plunge that preceded the full onset of the recession. ""Two months ago, people had the impression the glass was
half empty. Today, investors' sentiment is that the glass is
half full,"" said Philippe Waechter, head of economic research at
Natixis Asset Management. But for CEOs, who have to deal with the urgent need to
restructure and slash jobs, the mood remains more cautious. ""The CEOs' visions are based on the order books, while
investors on the market are trying to anticipate what comes next
and when,"" Waechter said. Luxury group Richemont has said it saw ""very few encouraging
signs in the global economic picture"", while its UK peer
Burberry said trading will remain difficult as it focuses on
cutting costs. Meanwhile, Michel Rollier, chief executive of tyre group
Michelin, saw ""little sign of real improvement in the world
economy"" and warned of tough quarters ahead, while BMW's CEO
Norbert Reithofer does not expect the market to recover until
next year. ""There's a huge contrast between what the business leaders
say and what investors think -- to my mind, CEOs are being
rightfully cautious because there is still an extreme lack of
visibility about earnings,"" said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at
Fortis in Brussels. ""We're in uncharted territory but I would estimate that
there would be a lag of at least one year between macro data
stabilising and actual demand for companies' products picking
up,"" Gijsels said. Europe's DJ STOXX retail index, home of bellwethers such as
supermarket chain Carrefour and clothes retailer H&M, has surged
27 percent since early March and is now up 15 percent
year-to-date. The DJ STOXX personal and household goods index, which
includes names like L'Oreal and Philips has risen 23 percent
over the past 10 weeks and is now up 9.3 percent in 2009,
despite the flow of gloomy retail sales data and rising
unemployment rates around the world.  NEW BULL RUN, OR SHORT-LIVED RELIEF RALLY? With the broader stock indexes, the FTSEurofirst 300 and the
STOXX 600, now up around 35 percent from their lows in March,
several fund managers and strategists say the market is getting
ahead of itself. For them a correction looks inevitable as the
macroeconomic backdrop remains broadly negative despite a few
""green shoots"". The sharp upward move in prices over the past couple of 
months could turn out to be more a relief rally than the dawn of
a new bull market. ""There has been an improvement in sentiment since last
February when people feared many companies and even countries
would go bankrupt,"" said Romain Boscher, head of equity
management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris. But ""the economic reality still contrasts with the broad
optimism among investors who have been hoping for a quick
recovery,"" he said. Arthur van Slooten, European equity strategist at Societe
Generale, said investors were keen on adding more risk into
portfolios, reassured by signs of improvement in the credit
market, and that the 10-week stock rise had not much to do with
the corporate forecasts. ""This rally has been a correction of the equity risk
premium, and obviously not based on an improvement on the
earnings side,"" he said.  CYCLICALS GETTING PRICEY Many fund managers expect jobs to continue to be axed over
the next few quarters with no tangible improvement in the ""real
economy,"" reflected in part by consumer spending and retail
sales, which remain weak. For Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers,
cyclical stocks such as consumer goods, retail, industrials and
autos, had reached pricey levels, with a 30 percent premium to
defensives compared to around 15 percent in the last recovery
rally of 2002-03. ""I never saw this before, which is making me cautious,""
Wenzel said. ""We recommend not to be too brave and refrain from
increasing exposure to cyclical stocks."" But he expects to see tangible signs of an economic recovery
at the end of the year -- suggesting that the stock market is
not completely devoid of rational investors. (Additional reporting by Mark Potter, David Jones, Helen

407,"Apr 22, 2009 05:08AM ET",Carrefour to sell low-cost own brand goods,nan," PARIS, April 22 (Reuters) - French Carrefour , the
world's second-biggest retailer, unveiled a low-cost own brand
on Wednesday to compete for increasingly cost-conscious
customers as the economic downturn crimps spending. The Carrefour Discount range of 400 day-to-day items, of
which 83 percent are food stuffs such as orange juice, green
beans and minced beef steaks, will be launched at supermarkets
and hypermarkets in France from the end of May. Carrefour is trying to shed its image as a more expensive
retailer to keep customers as they seek to control spending. ""Managing spending and budgets is a real problem. The
consumer today has a real spending power problem,"" executive
director of Carrefour France, Gilles Petit, told reporters on
Wednesday. The group's first-quarter sales fell 5.1 percent in France,
which accounted for about 42 percent of the total. Like-for-like
sales excluding fuel at its French hypermarkets fell 2.5
percent. The company is seeking to increase the amount of own brand
products, which have higher margins, in its French stores to 50
percent in three years from around 40 percent currently, Petit
said, adding Carrefour was willing to see margins ease slightly
at its new discount range in order to win sales volumes. It is also opening convenience stores under the Carrefour
City and Contact formats that are closer to customers.

408,"Apr 21, 2009 06:08AM ET",ANALYSIS-Discount brand Tesco deserves share price premium,nan," * Tesco shares trade at discount to most major rivals * Has lost some share in mature UK grocery market * Discount brands may be helping firm retain UK customers * International, financial services offer growth platforms  By Mark Potter LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - The jury may be out on Tesco's
 new discount brands range, but prospects for growth abroad and
in financial services and telecoms mean shares in the world's
No.3 retailer shouldn't trade at a discount to peers. Tesco's stock is priced at about 11 times forecast earnings
for 2009-10, below world No.1 Wal-Mart on 14.2 and No.2
Carrefour on 11.8, as well as UK rivals J Sainsbury and Morrison
, according to Reuters data.  Much of this is due to signs that Tesco is losing ground to
competitors in Britain, which accounts for about 70 percent of
the group's sales and three-quarters of trading profits. But the group is still holding onto most of its big market
share gains of recent years and, while this is the case,
investors should look beyond Britain's maturing grocery market
and focus on its prospects for UK growth in banking, telecoms
and home shopping, as well as huge markets like China and India. ""Ultimately, would investors prefer exposure to structural
as well as operational growth opportunities, or 100 percent
exposure to a UK grocery market that structurally, aside from
small capacity withdrawal, is not growing?"" Nomura analyst
Matthew Truman asked in a recent research note, questioning
whether Tesco should trade at a discount to UK-only rivals. Tesco, which employs 440,000 people in about 4,000 stores
across 14 countries, posted a 10 percent rise in annual profit
to 3.13 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) on Tuesday. Sales at UK stores open at least a year were up 3.4 percent
in the first six weeks of its new financial year. That's an
improvement on the 2.7 percent reported in the fourth quarter,
but it still lags rivals like Sainsbury, which posted a 6.2
percent rise on the same basis for the 11 weeks to March 21.  Some analysts are worried Tesco, which has about 30 percent
of the UK grocery market, could experience a prolonged period of
share price underperformance, as occurred to Carrefour when it
was losing ground in its main French market. ""Our core belief is that the market will not fully embrace
the Tesco story again until it has stabilised its UK market
share performance,"" Citigroup analysts wrote recently.   RISKS VS POTENTIAL But others are more relaxed, arguing Tesco is naturally
ceding a little of its big market share gains of recent years as
previously underperforming rivals raise their game.  ""Put simply, many customers who had been driving past a
Sainsbury/Morrisons supermarket to get to a Tesco no longer see
the need to,"" Morgan Stanley analysts explain.  Tesco launched a new range of discount brands in September
in a bid to give it renewed impetus and while the jury is still
out whether it will eventually help the group to regain market
share, some analysts think it has done enough to retain custom. For RBS analyst Justin Scarborough, that is crucial. ""If it had not introduced the discounter brands, then its
platform to offer other products, whether they be non-food, or
telecoms, or financial services, would have been significantly
diluted,"" he said.  As it is, Tesco has a customer base of over 20 million
Britons a week to try to sell new products to, whether insurance
or mobile phones, at little extra infrastructure cost -- a ""huge
opportunity"", according to the Citigroup analysts. Tesco said last month it planned to open 30 bank branches in
its stores this year, and said on Sunday it aimed to double its
number of in-store phone shops to 100 by next March. Outside the UK, Tesco has expanded into some of the world's
biggest potential growth markets, like China and India. This has not been without problems or come without risks. For example, with a strong presence in Ireland, Hungary and
Thailand, Tesco is current exposed to some of the economies
worst affected by the global economic downturn.  Trying to crack major foreign markets is also expensive and
there is no guarantee of success, as Tesco has found in the
United States, where the group has abandoned forecasting when
its Fresh & Easy chain will break even because of the recession. ""There is a very real risk that Tesco could destroy a great
deal of shareholder value in trying,"" Morgan Stanley analysts
warn. But of all the major international retailers, Tesco has the
best track record on foreign expansion so far, only having
withdrawn from one market, Taiwan, and then at a profit. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst John Kershaw also sees
a clear path for growth over the next few years with last year's
purchase of stores in South Korea already yielding good results
and financial services offering relatively low risk rewards. ""International and Tesco Personal Finance are now becoming
of sufficient scale to keep Tesco Group as a 10-percent-plus
EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) grower in the medium
term, a prospect not reflected in the shares,"" he said.

409,"Apr 17, 2009 06:24AM ET",PREVIEW-Tesco to show resilience with $4.5 bln profit,nan," * Tesco, Burberry, Primark to report on Tues Apr. 21 * Carphone Warehouse, Game Group report on Weds Apr. 22 * Debenhams, WH Smith, Sports Direct report on Thurs Apr. 23 By Mark Potter and James Davey LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Tesco Plc, the world's No.3
retailer, is set to show its resilience to the economic downturn
by posting profits of over 3 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) just
four years after passing the 2 billion pound mark. Investors, however, will be looking for reassurance from the
British supermarket group that strong growth can continue. In the UK, they will scrutinise profit margins to see if
they have been hit by Tesco's discount brand range, launched in
September to counter the threat of hard discounters like Aldi. They also want to hear that Tesco is addressing its recent
sales underperformance against major UK rivals Asda, J.
Sainsbury and Morrison. Tesco's medium-term target is to grow UK sales at stores
open at least a year, excluding fuel, by between 3 and 4
percent. But analysts' current consensus forecast for the year
ending February 2010 is for growth of about 1.7 percent.  Abroad, investors are keen for signs that the group, which
employs 440,000 people in about 4,000 stores across 14
countries, is coping in some of the world's most challenged
economies, such as Ireland, Hungary and Turkey. Tesco's U.S. plans will also be under the spotlight after
the firm said in November it was slowing down its expansion
there, and conceded in February it had made some mistakes.  Analysts are keen to hear if it still expects its U.S. Fresh
& Easy chain to break even by the end of fiscal 2009-10. Debt will also be a focus, with some analysts forecasting it
could reach 10 billion pounds. Fewer-than-expected property
deals and a falling pound have inflated borrowings on top of an
acquisition in South Korea and a deal to buy out Royal Bank of
Scotland from a financial services joint venture. But with strong cash flows and property assets estimated at
about 30 billion pounds, analysts are generally relaxed about
Tesco's finances. Some expect the group to cut capital spending
for 2009-10 to 3.0-3.5 billion pounds from around 4.5 billion.  GROWTH POTENTIAL  Profit before tax and one-off items will rise 7 percent to
3.04 billion pounds for the year ended February, according to
the median forecast of 19 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates,
with sales, excluding VAT, seen up 13 percent to 53.5 billion. That should compare favourably with a string of trading
updates and results from British retailers next week.  Also on Tuesday, luxury goods group Burberry is expected to
report a drop in fourth-quarter sales at constant exchange
rates, although discount chain Primark is likely to say it
continues to benefit from the downturn.  On Wednesday, Carphone Warehouse, Europe's biggest mobile
phone retailer, will reveal whether unexpectedly strong trading
over Christmas has continued, while Game Group will give a sense
of whether the computer games market -- one of the few recent
hot-spots in retailing -- has started to cool.  Department stores group Debenhams, stationer WH Smith and
sporting goods retailer Sports Direct report on Thursday. All
have shown some resilience in the recession, but are nonetheless
bearing its scars. Tesco reported a 2.5 percent rise in sales at UK stores open
a least a year, excluding fuel, in the 7 weeks to Jan. 10,
lagging its main rivals. Analysts expect this rate of growth, or
slightly higher, for the full fourth quarter.  Tesco says its sales growth has been held back by customers
switching to the cheaper discount brands range and that its
sales volumes are increasing, which will put it in a strong
position when food price inflation starts to ease.  Analysts are divided on the success of the discount brands. ""Our core belief is that the market will not fully embrace
the Tesco story again until it has stabilised its UK market
share performance,"" Citigroup said in a recent research note,
adding investors fear the stock may suffer the fate of Carrefour
, which has underperformed as it struggles in France.  Carrefour, the world's No.2 retailer, on Thursday reported
its first quarterly fall in sales for six years. Nomura, however, believes Tesco is doing well to hold onto
the bulk of its big market shares gains of recent years in the
face of resurgent rivals, and it has greater potential than UK
peers via international operations and expansion into banking.  ""Ultimately, would investors prefer exposure to structural
as well as operational growth opportunities, or 100 percent
exposure to a UK grocery market that structurally, aside from
small capacity withdrawal, is not growing?"" he asks.  Tesco shares have broadly matched the DJ Stoxx European
Retail Index over the past year. They trade at 11 times forecast
earnings for 2009-10, below Carrefour on 12.1, Morrison on 13.8
and Sainsbury on 14.1, according to Reuters data.

410,"Apr 16, 2009 09:40AM ET",ANALYSIS-Spain food prices help consumers but hurt farmers,nan," By Martin Roberts MADRID, April 16 (Reuters) - Falling Spanish food prices
have helped turn consumer inflation negative for the first time
on record but farmers say low prices are forcing them to sell
below cost, plant less or give up farming altogether. Thousands of angry dairy farmers rallied in Madrid on
Thursday in a noisy protest to highlight losses of 1 million
euros ($1.32 million) a day between them just to break even. ""We cannot survive with these losses and these restricted
quotas, said demonstrator Rosario Arredondo who has a small
dairy farm in the northern Cantabria region. She said she receives 29 euro cents a litre for milk that
costs her 40 cents to produce.  Spain's National Statistics Institute said food was a
leading factor in the consumer price index in March falling 0.1
percent from the same month in 2008, the first drop since the
CPI was first compiled in 1962. Farm gate prices have fallen even further. The Asaja union estimates Spain had 173,000 dairy farms in
1993 but just 24,000 now, and said they may vanish altogether if
steps are not taken at national and European level. Spain's four leading farm unions has urged the government to
stop supermarkets from importing milk at below cost. Spain has
to import 2.8 million tonnes of milk a year on top of an EU
production quota of 6.2 million.
 The government estimates sterilised milk most often retails
at 91 euro cents, or 4.9 percent less than a year ago, although
it has recently been available for 51 cents in the Dia discount
chain, owned by France's Carrefour.  GRAIN AND CITRUS Grain farmers have responded to a 35-percent drop in grain
prices since last year's harvest by sowing 8.9 percent less land
to wheat and barley this winter, according to official figures. If yields go down in the same proportion, the winter cereals
harvest in import-needy Spain will decline to 17.6 million
tonnes this summer from a bumper 19.5 million in 2008. Many farmers say the fall could be more pronounced because
they have cut back on costly fertiliser.  ""The weather could improve matters, as this year water
reserves are higher, but farmers will be using a lot less basic
fertiliser,"" an ASAJA technician said. Even bumper harvests cannot meet Spain's grain needs and the
country is expected to import 8 million tonnes in the crop year
ending in June. Spain's Cooperative Farmers' Association estimated that
citrus farmers too were cultivating 10-15 percent fewer trees
this season compared to last. Spokesman Juan Safont said much farm land on the
Mediterranean coast had been swallowed up by a construction
boom. ""Farmers cannot make money so they retain land ownership but
give up farming,"" he said by telephone from easterly Valencia,
Spain's leading citrus producing region. ""We produce for animals as well as people, so if we become
dependent on imports and give up Mediterranean farming the way
we are because they are cheaper today, it could end up costing
us very dearly,"" he said. Farm unions -- and consumer groups -- have long protested
over what they say is the widening gap between what they receive
and what a handful of powerful retailers charge to consumers. ""It cannot be that whatever we sell is rock-bottom while all
the value added by what the consumer pays is grabbed by four
firms with very little effort,"" Asaja president Pedro Barato
said. Farm union COAG estimated in a recent report that food was
sold at more than 4.5 times producer prices on average. Amongst other measures, the union has called for producer
prices to be shown alongside retail prices in shops.  (Reporting by Martin Roberts, editing by William Hardy)

411,"Apr 01, 2009 06:16AM ET","UPDATE 2-China, France agree to repair damaged ties",nan," (Adds meeting, paragraph 2) BEIJING, April 1 (Reuters) - China and France agreed on
Wednesday to repair ties damaged after a series of recent
spats, including over Tibet, with both pledging high-level
talks and cooperation to tackle the global financial crisis. China's President Hu Jintao and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy will meet on the margins of the G20 summit in London,
probably on Thursday, French government spokesman Luc Chatel
said after a weekly cabinet meeting in Paris. Bilateral relations began deteriorating after the
disruption of the Paris leg of the Olympic torch relay last
summer by pro-Tibet activists. China has ruled Tibet with an
iron hand since its troops marched into the region in 1950. Further incidents, including Paris' decision to make
Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, an honorary citizen,
have fuelled tensions and led to sporadic boycotts of French
firms operating in China such as retailer Carrefour. ""Both sides reaffirm the high importance of Sino-French
relations and are willing to strengthen the all-round strategic
partnership on the basis of mutual respect and paying attention
to each sides basic interests,"" said a joint statement carried
on the website of China's Foreign Ministry (www.fmprc.gov.cn). The document was issued by both countries' foreign
ministries and agreed upon after many rounds of talks, it
added. It said that France ""fully understands"" the importance and
sensitivity of the Tibet question, and recognises that Tibet is
an inseparable part of Chinese territory. ""On the basis of this spirit and the principle of not
interfering in internal affairs, France refuses to support any
kind of 'Tibet independence',"" the statement said. ""Both sides are willing to strengthen communication and
coordination, to jointly deal with the global challenge of the
international financial crisis,"" it added. Last year, China pulled out of a summit with EU leaders
that France was to host after French President Nicolas Sarkozy
met the Dalai Lama. China labels the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Dalai Lama a
dangerous separatist and has been angered by his frequent
meetings with foreign leaders. The Dalai Lama denies seeking
independence for Tibet, saying he wants only greater autonomy.

* To cut capex, working capital, reduce UK costs * Shares fall as much as 5.7 percent 
 (Adds more company comment, updates shares) By Mark Potter LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Kingfisher, Europe's top home
improvements retailer, plans to close a third of its loss-making
Chinese stores and said it expected group profit to fall this
year as the global recession takes hold. Shares in the firm, which runs market leaders B&Q in Britain
and Castorama in France, fell as much as 5.7 percent to 134.2
pence on Thursday, unwinding some recent outperformance against
rivals on high hopes for its turnaround strategy. The world's third-biggest home improvements group, which met
forecasts with a 3.1 percent rise in annual profit, said it
would take further steps to mitigate tough trading by reducing
investment, working capital and costs. ""We're assuming difficult markets and focusing on the self
help,"" Chief Executive Ian Cheshire told reporters.  ""I would hope things are trading better by the end of the
year, but we're not going to assume any quick uplift."" Some analysts said Kingfisher's shares, which have beaten
the DJ Stoxx European retail index by almost 30 percent over the
past year, did not reflect the challenges. ""Profits are set to decline...and the group is vulnerable to
operational gearing in parts of its operations and high margins
in others. We believe that the shares do not fully reflect these
risks after recent strength,"" Credit Suisse analysts said. At 1415 GMT, Kingfisher stock was down 3.7 percent at 137.1
pence, valuing the firm at 3.3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion).  FIXING CHINA Kingfisher runs over 800 stores in eight countries and has
been hit hard by a downturn in most of its major markets. UK retail sales plunged 1.9 percent month-on-month in
February, official figures showed, while data from France showed
consumers mired in gloom. Kingfisher said it made profit before tax and one-off items
of 368 million pounds in the year ended January, close to
analysts' average forecast of 364 million in a company poll. Sales from continuing operations rose 10.8 percent to 10.03
billion pounds, but were down 4.1 percent on a same-store basis. B&Q China made a loss of 52 million pounds, battered by a
property slump, and Kingfisher said it would respond by shutting
22 and downsizing 17 of its 63 stores there. It will revamp the rest as part of a plan that will cost
about 30 million pounds in cash, but which should be offset by
selling the two freehold stores among the 22 being shut. There will also be a non-cash one-off impairment charge of
160 million pounds, 124 million of which relates to writing off
goodwill at the Chinese business. Cheshire said he had looked into exiting China, but said the
market still offered great long-term growth potential if the
group corrected mistakes, such as over-rapid expansion,
over-reliance on suppliers and too many products. He was comfortable with analysts forecasts for the unit to
cut losses to 30-40 million pounds in 2009-10 and said he was
aiming for it to return to profit by the end of 2010. He did not expect job losses from the closures because the
stores employ many staff from suppliers, which are expected to
be redeployed. Kingfisher will actually hire a net 600 staff as
it takes a stronger control of remaining stores, he said. Cheshire said he was in contact with major international
retailers including Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco, Best Buy and
Decathlon over renting out space in the stores to be downsized. ""There's quite a lot of interest in the big-box (store
format in China),"" he told a news conference, noting Germany's
Metro announced plans earlier this week to expand its MediaMarkt
electrical goods business into China. Cheshire said he was comfortable with analysts' consensus
forecast for adjusted profit in 2009-10 of 323 million pounds,
but the firm was focusing on trying to limit any profit fall. Kingfisher said it would cut capital spending to 300 million
pounds in 2009-10 from 390 million in 2008-9. It will also aim
to reduce working capital by a further 50 million pounds and
reduce costs in the UK by 1 percent year-on-year.

its cue from successful turnaround plans at peers like Ahold and
Morrison and focus on low prices, own-brand goods and marketing
if it is to rebound from two profit warnings in 2008. New Chief Executive Lars Olofsson, who gives his first
presentation at Thursday's annual results, also needs to address
the French group's specific problems with its underperforming
hypermarkets and over-exposure to mature western markets. This could include downsizing hypermarkets by renting out
space to third parties, exiting lacklustre Belgium and Italian
businesses and expanding in emerging markets like Russia. None of that will be easy in the teeth of an economic
recession, and analysts are not expecting a comprehensive
blueprint for recovery until later in the year. But after a big fall in Carrefour's shares, Olofsson could
get a good reception if he diagnoses the group's problems and
sets out his priorities for addressing them. ""All in all, we need to be given the confidence that
management understands its own problems and the strategic
threats it faces,"" said JP Morgan analyst Jaime Vazquez. Carrefour, which employs around 490,000 people in over
15,000 stores and 30 countries, had a torrid 2008, hit by a
consumer downturn in its main western markets, its exposure to
non-food items, which have seen a bigger drop in demand than
groceries, and by growing competition from discounters.  The group is expected to report a 2.1 percent rise in 2008
operating profit to 3.36 billion euros ($4.25 billion) according
to the mean forecast of 26 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. That compares with growth of 12 percent at Dutch group Ahold
 and 7.3 percent at French rival Casino.  The bad news may already be priced in to Carrefour shares,
which have underperformed the DJ European retail index by 23
percent over the past year and trade at 9.1 times forecast
earnings, below world number one Wal-Mart on 13.7 and number
three Tesco on 11, according to Reuters data. Carrefour is also the most shorted European food retail
stock, with 10.1 percent of its shares out on loan to traders
betting they will fall further, according to Data Explorers, the
short selling data research firm based in New York. So there is plenty of room for Carrefour shares to bounce if
Olofsson gets the message right.   LEARNING FROM RIVALS Jose Luis Duran, Olofsson's predecessor, did much to
identify Carrefour's problems and start work on solutions which
analysts think will be a good base for the new chief executive.  Duran's problem was implementation -- both effectiveness and
speed -- and here Olofsson could learn from Carrefour's rivals.  For example, Duran cut prices and stepped up promotions, but
drew criticism for not always doing so consistently, or
communicating it well. Natixis analysts suggest Carrefour could learn from Ahold
which, after putting low prices at the centre of its recovery
plan in 2003, has relentlessly focused on value. Duran also started a drive to unify branding by, for
example, converting Champion stores to the Carrefour banner,
which analysts think could have big benefits by, for example,
centralising processes and improving customer loyalty schemes. Olofsson, with a background in marketing, could be better
placed to drive this through, analysts say, pointing to the
success of marketing man Marc Bolland in revamping Britain's
Morrison after its botched acquisition of Safeway.  Olofsson could also learn from the success of own-brand
goods at another UK grocery recovery story J Sainsbury. Like Carrefour, Sainsbury is associated with higher quality
and higher prices than some rivals but it has defied predictions
it would suffer in the downturn by urging shoppers to save money
by switching to its often higher margin own-brand products.  Duran also started work on downsizing Carrefour's
troublesome French hypermarkets and analysts think Olofsson
should accelerate this, though it may be hard to find tenants
for vacated space in the downturn. Olofsson may also find it difficult to undertake any radical
surgery on Carrefour's underperforming businesses in Belgium and
Italy, as analysts see few obvious buyers.  But increasing the firm's exposure to emerging markets could
be easier as the number of distressed sellers rises. Banking
sources told Reuters last month that Carrefour was looking to
buy Russian retailer Seventh Continent. Even if radical change seems unlikely in the short term,
analysts think Carrefour can follow the likes of Britain's Tesco
and Germany's Metro by stepping up cost savings and cutting
investment. Deutsche bank analysts think capital spend for 2009
could be cut back to 2.3 billion euros from 3 billion. UBS analysts argue that, with manageable debts and at least
15 billion euros of freehold property, there is no reason why,
with the right strategy, Carrefour could not fight back. ""The last big food recovery play?"" is how they titled a
recent research note.

418,"Jan 21, 2009 07:40AM ET","ANALYSIS-Crisis-struck, Russian retail lures global majors",nan," By Maria Kiselyova MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russia's retailers faces a hard
landing in 2009 as the country lurches towards recession but the
downturn also offers global majors an easier entry into a sector
with more potential than many mature markets. Analysts anticipate faster growth in Russia than in most
European countries although the global crisis has now spread
into the real economy, ending one of the longest consumer booms
in Russian history. The economic crisis has led to rising unemployment, slower
income growth and limited credit access for most consumers. ""While we acknowledge that growth is likely to fall short of
previous expectations over coming years, we nevertheless expect
Russia to deliver some of the fastest growth in the global
retail sector,"" Marat Ibragimov, analyst at Citigroup said. As a result, many retail giants that missed earlier chances
to participate in the 15-year spending boom - and whose balance
sheets still provide financial firepower for deal-making - can
now opt to enter at a time when Russian assets are cheaper. ""Everything is less expensive now and we expect M&A
activities in food retailing,"" Natalia Smirnova, consumer market
analyst with UralSib Financial Corporation said. ""Obviously purchasing power is also declining, but discount
chains such as Wal-Mart are well placed to profit from the
situation as their formats will be very popular in the crisis."" A credit squeeze triggered by the global crisis has hit both
the food and non-food retail sectors, which some analysts say
could accelerate consolidation inside the fragmented industries. For example, Russia's largest food retailer in revenue
terms, the X5 group, is widely expected to buy up smaller chains
threatened with bankruptcy. X5 and rivals Magnit, Dixy Group and Seventh Continent have
lost 60 to 80 percent in value over the past six months as
Russian stocks were hit by the falling oil price and capital
flight from emerging markets. Based on the ratio of enterprise value (EV) to earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA),
the sector will this year underperform emerging market peers by
around 40 percent, according to Citigroup. Leslie Fletcher, consumer goods and retail analyst at A.T.
Kearney, said lower oil prices and a weaker rouble could make
some Western firms delay their entry into the Russian market. ""However, the crisis also provides a great opportunity to
capitalise on lower valuations for M&A targets and lower costs
of land acquisition. Deals in this environment may outweigh
exchange rate risk -- especially if these rates come back in
line in 2009 as some economists expect,"" she said.  WEAKENING CONFIDENCE Many Russian retailers are cutting capital expenditure and
expansion this year to free up cash for debt repayments. They
also anticipate a deterioration in consumer sentiment in Russia. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast retail sales growth of 4
percent in 2009 after a 16 percent rise in 2007. Official data
for all of 2008 is not yet available. November monthly data showed Russian retail sales were up 
8.0 percent year-on-year. This was the slowest annual growth
rate in five years and a 3.4 percent fall on October. ""We believe the data shows obvious signs of consumer
confidence weakening. In our view, the slowdown in retail sales
... is the beginning of a trend in growth rates (in rouble
terms) which we think will hold next year,"" VTB Capital said. In November, real disposable income contracted by 6.2
percent compared with a year earlier. Wage arrears doubled
between October and November, affecting 600,000 people. ""The current crisis situation has brought to an end the
consumer boom in Russia and will lead to almost zero real
disposable income growth in the near future, as companies are
laying off people and reducing salaries,"" UralSib said in a
strategy note called ""Darkest Before Dawn."" ""Other non-economic, but no less important factors, that
also make us bearish on consumer spending include people's
uncertainty over financial stability and job security."" Analysts warily forecast the market may begin to recover in
the second half of 2009 if a global turnaround takes off. ""We could see dramatic sales increases as early as mid-late
this year due to deferred demand, should the economic situation
stabilise,"" Fletcher said.  MARKET OF INTEREST Analysts say some grocers, notably the low-price chains, are
better placed to weather tough condition than retailers of
discretionary items such as cars and electronic items. ""Customers may now switch back to previous shopping patterns
as their disposable income shrinks. Much like how Wal-Mart wins
customers from Target in a recession (in the United States),""
said Fletcher, a former Senior Director of International
Strategy at world number one retailer Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, which is increasingly looking overseas to fuel
expansion, last year joined the Russian retail lobby group,
after hiring an executive to head its efforts to explore
business opportunities in Russia and neighboring markets. Sources have said Wal-Mart hired 30 Russian office staff and
is in acquisition talks with local chains that may need a cash
injection to cope with the financial crisis. ""Russia remains a market of interest for Wal-Mart. We
recognise that our success in this market will depend upon our
ability to meet customers' needs in all economic conditions,""
Richard J. Coyle, Wal-Mart senior director for international
corporate affairs, told Reuters. French hypermarket chain Carrefour, the world's no.
2 retailer, plans to open its first Russian store in 2009 while
other operators are reviewing the country's potential. ""Russia is still a large retail market that cannot and will
not be ignored by global retailers. Despite current crisis
conditions, Russia is still among the fastest growing retail
markets, with population sizable enough to influence the
portfolio of a global retailer,"" Fletcher said.

419,"Jan 20, 2009 11:56PM ET",ANALYSIS-Global retailers feel China chill,nan," By Kirby Chien BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Recession shockwaves are
swamping China's main coastal export zones and spreading,
pushing a fragmented and once fast-growing retail sector to
consolidate as sales and profit margins shrink. Global giants such as Wal-Mart Stores and Carrefour will
benefit along with China's growing consumer class, but rapid
expansion has caught some over-extended, as their home markets
collapse in the face of a sharp economic downturn. China's $824 billion retail sector is still one of the
world's fastest growing. Smaller than Germany's in 2003, the
market could be almost twice as big by 2013, according to
Euromonitor. ""As the large get larger, major domestic and foreign
players with strong parents should survive as the market
consolidates,"" said Mavis Hui, retail analyst with DBS Vickers
in Hong Kong. Department stores such as Hong Kong-based Parkson Retail
are pushing discounts to regain sales, and Kingfisher, Europe's
largest home improvements retailer, is closing stores ahead of
the week-long Chinese New Year shopping period. As China's economy slows sharply, some retailers may be
forced to rethink their strategy. ""We're aware of some foreign retailers in China trying to
sell their operations, which could be picked up by someone else
at bargain prices,"" said Graham Matthews, partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Shanghai, noting, with others, that
home improvement chains are being hit hard by the global
property market collapse. WEAK SALES Standard & Poor's downgraded its outlook for Parkson,
China's second-largest department store chain, to stable from
positive earlier this month, after a weak 7-8 percent
same-store sales growth estimate. ""We expect the weak sales
trend to persist in 2009,"" S&P said. Retailers globally are struggling as consumers cut back on
spending amid rising unemployment and fears of a deep
recession. U.S. department store chain Gottschalks Inc filed for
bankruptcy last week, the latest in a list of battered
retailers. Hong Kong-based garment retailer U-Right
International, which rapidly expanded to over 600 stores
throughout China, filed for bankruptcy in October after running
out of cash. But Carrefour, China's leading hypermarket retailer, which
is buoyed by its recession-resistant grocery business, expects
to open 28 new stores this year, up from 22 in 2008, though the
French firm has said it would compete aggressively on price. ""Total retail sales could still rise by the mid-teens this
year,"" said DBS Vickers' Hui. ""But the steep discounts we're
seeing could pressure margins for selective players."" OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS Deals may slow in the near term as risk appetite is low and
those with cash may want to hold it, PWC reckons. But it sees
opportunities. Kingfisher, owner of the B&Q franchise, is seen as a prime
target. It posted a surprise third-quarter loss in its China
operations late last year as sales slumped by a third. Home improvement stores such as Kingfisher and Home Depot,
which has also expanded aggressively in China, have been hurt
by a global property market slump. Kingfisher expects more store closures in China, a sharp
turnaround from mid-2007, when B&Q China sales growth was
humming along at over 40 percent and it had plans to open 8-12
stores annually to over 130 locations. Still, even during the best of times, China only accounted
for a small fraction of total sales for the big global
retailers. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is shifting its
focus from mature markets to countries like Mexico, China and
Brazil. But China accounts for just over 100 stores from a
global stable of some 7,200 Wal-Mart facilities. Other niche players such as coffee shop chain Starbucks,
which is closing stores in its home U.S. market, will continue
to expand because their penetration in China and other emerging
markets is still at a relatively early stage. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE KEY Three fifths of consumers in major Chinese cities expect to
spend less this year on luxury goods, branded apparel and
entertainment, according to consultancy Data Driven Marketing
Asia. And the outlook is not likely to improve any time soon. U.S. retail sales fell a steep 2.7 percent in December,
signalling a sharper economic contraction than had been
thought. That is bad news for China as the United States is its
single largest export market. Analysts forecast the Chinese
economy could grow 8 percent this year, a level widely regarded
as a minimum to absorb millions of new job seekers. High-flying Chinese consumers had once snapped up luxury
cars at a record pace, but the global downturn has exposed a
fragile spending class that must increasingly plan and pay for
its own healthcare, education and retirement. ""Quite frankly, I'm not particularly thrilled with
(China's) policy recipe,"" Stephen Roach, Asia chairman for
Morgan Stanley, told a conference in Beijing last month. ""China
needs to shift its growth dynamic away from investment and
exports ... and increase consumption."" China's household consumption in 2007 made up just 35.3
percent of economic output, a record low for a major country in
peacetime. In the 1980s, it was over 50 percent, versus 72
percent in the United States. The reluctance to buy is evident at Solana, one of
Beijing's newest mega-malls with over 200 stores and vendors,
but where spending customers are sparse on weekdays and many
stalls are still waiting for tenants. ""You can see business is not good, how can it be good?,""
said a sales clerk at an up-scale clothing boutique, gesturing
at an empty pedestrian walkway.

grocers reported solid sales growth on Friday, boosted by a
stronger dollar, a focus on low prices and limited exposure to
non-food sales, which have been hit by the economic downturn. Robust fourth-quarter updates from Dutch group Ahold and
Belgium's Delhaize contrasted with France's Carrefour, the
world's second-biggest retailer, which said after Thursday's
market close that sales growth had almost ground to a halt in
its fourth quarter. Ahold and Delhaize's shares both jumped more than 8 percent
in early trading, while Carrefour initially fell, before
recovering in a firmer market. Retailers worldwide are struggling as shoppers curb spending
amid rising unemployment and fears of a deep recession. No.1 retailer Wal-Mart cut its fourth-quarter profit outlook
last week. Both Wal-Mart and Carrefour have been hit by weak non-food
sales as shoppers rein in spending on non-essential items. Carrefour, which issued a profit warning last month, said 
late on Thursday that its fourth-quarter sales rose just 0.7
percent, or 1.9 percent at constant exchange rates. Ahold and Delhaize both have less exposure to non-food sales
and have worked hard to keep prices low. Ahold, the world's seventh largest grocer, said
fourth-quarter net sales rose 5.9 percent at constant exchange
rates to 6.6 billion euros ($8.8 billion), at the top end of
analysts' forecasts. Delhaize, which like Ahold makes more than half its sales in
the United States, said fourth-quarter net sales rose 10.3
percent at constant exchange rates to 5.42 billion euros, above
analysts' average forecast of 5.35 billion. ""The key difference between these two and Carrefour is they
are trading pretty well in their domestic markets and also both
of them have posted surprisingly resilient performances in the
U.S. market ... whereas Carrefour is clearly suffering in the
French hypermarket sector,"" said Bryan Roberts, global research
director at Planet Retail. However, he questioned whether Ahold and Delhaize would be
able to sustain their solid U.S. performances amid darkening
economic storm-clouds. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. retail
sales dropped 2.7 percent in December.  TOUGH TIMES Both Ahold and Delhaize showed signs of tougher trading. The rise in fourth-quarter sales at Ahold, which employs
142,000 people in 6,500 wholly-owned or joint venture stores
across 11 countries, was below the 6.9 percent achieved for 2008
as a whole. Delhaize's fourth-quarter growth was above the 5.6 percent
for the year as a whole, but it described an ""uncertain economic
environment"" and unveiled plans for 100 million euros of cost
savings in 2009, some of which it will invest in lower prices. Both firms also benefited from the stronger dollar. Sales
growth including currency changes was 12.9 percent at Ahold and
15.8 percent at Delhaize, which employs 138,000 people in more
than 2,500 stores across seven countries. Growth in like-for-like sales -- which compares revenue from
the same stores in local currencies -- at Ahold's U.S. stores
broadly beat forecasts. Growth at its Stop&Shop, excluding
gasoline, rose 4 percent, beating the average forecast of 3.4
percent. But growth slowed more than expected at Ahold's Dutch
supermarket chain Albert Heijn, with like-for-like sales growth
of 5.2 percent missing the average forecast of 6.1 percent. Delhaize reported fourth-quarter comparable store sales
growth of 2.9 percent in the United States, where it makes about
70 percent of its revenues with chains like Food Lion and
Hannaford, beating analysts' average forecast of 2 percent. ""Year-end sales in particular were strong and the trend in
number of transactions turned positive again when compared to
the two previous quarters,"" Chief Executive Pierre-Olivier
Beckers said in a statement.  Comparable store sales rose 2.7 percent in Belgium, also
topping analysts' average forecast of 1.9 percent. Delhaize repeated its 2008 forecasts and announced capital
spending of 600-620 million euros for 2009, including the
opening of between 71 and 81 new stores. It will close 7 underperforming Sweetbay stores in the
United States and its four loss-making German shops. At 0845 GMT, Delhaize shares were up 6.9 percent at 46.21
euros, off an early high of 47.095. Ahold was up 6.2 percent at
9.05 euros, off an early high of 9.23. Carrefour was up 2.3

 (Adds more detail) By Mark Potter LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Carrefour, the world's
second-biggest retailer, posted a steep slowdown in
fourth-quarter sales growth, hit by weakness in its French
hypermarkets business and in other European countries. The French group, which employs around 490,000 people in
more than 15,000 stores across 30 countries, said on Thursday
sales reached 25.74 billion euros ($33.8 billion) in the final
three months of 2008. Forecasts ranged from 25.3 billion euros to 26 billion euros
in a Reuters poll of seven analysts. Full-year sales were up 5.7 percent at 97.56 billion euros. ""Carrefour can and should further improve its performance,""
new Chief Executive Lars Olofsson said in a statement. Retailers worldwide are struggling in an economic downturn.
Both Carrefour and U.S. rival Wal-Mart, the world's biggest
retailer, have issued profit warnings in recent weeks.  Discounters have fared better than most as shoppers look to
save money, while sellers of expensive or non-essential items
have been hardest hit.  France's Casino and Portugal's Jeronimo Martins both met
fourth-quarter sales forecasts on Wednesday as their discount
and international businesses offset weaker performances at their
hypermarkets, which sell more discretionary goods.
 Carrefour said sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.3
percent in the fourth quarter, with declines of 2.4 percent in
France, 3.5 percent in other European countries and 5.1 percent
in Asia. Latin America grew 11.1 percent on the same basis. Like-for-like sales at French hypermarkets were down 3.3
percent, excluding petrol. Carrefour reaffirmed its guidance, reduced at its December
profit warning, for a small rise in 2008 earnings. Olofsson, former head of marketing at Swiss food group
Nestle, started work as Carrefour's chief executive officer
earlier this month.  Carrefour shares have underperformed the DJ Stoxx European
Retail Index by 30 percent over the past year. They closed
earlier down 1.5 percent at 25.96 euros, valuing the business at
about 18.5 billion euros.

 (Adds detail) By James Regan TOULOUSE, France, Jan 14 (Reuters) - French supermarket
group Casino posted a 9.3 percent rise in fourth-quarter sales
as expansion in the Netherlands and growth in Asia and South
America made up for flat revenue at home. Quarterly revenue rose to 7.67 billion euros ($10.2 billion)
from 7.02 billion in the year-ago period. Full-year sales met
the 28.7 billion average of estimates by 18 analysts polled by
Reuters Estimates. But sales in France were flat, with revenue at its Geant
hypermarkets dropping 8.4 percent to 1.6 billion euros.
Discounters Franprix and Leader Price benefited from changing
spending patterns with a 6.3 percent rise in quarterly sales. ""Nearly two-thirds of net sales are generated by convenience
and discount formats, which are preferred by shoppers who are
increasingly price-sensitive or looking to limit the size of
their average basket,"" Casino said in a statement on Wednesday. Outside France, sales rose 29.4 percent to contribute 35
percent of the total, helped by its purchase of Dutch
supermarkets group Super de Boer. The group confirmed its target for further growth in trading
profit for 2008. Casino is due to publish full-year results on March 5.
Retailers are having to wrestle with the impact of an
economic downturn that is prompting shoppers to curb spending as
business and consumer confidence plunges. Data on Wednesday showed German economic growth slipped to a
three-year low in 2008. There was also more gloom on the other side of the Atlantic
as U.S. December retail sales figures showed a
steeper-than-expected 2.7 percent decline. Earlier on Wednesday, German retailers Arcandor and Douglas
 reported steady sales in the Christmas quarter but both saw
their share prices drop as they gave cautious outlooks given the
economic slowdown. Super de Boer said on Tuesday that comparable sales growth
slowed to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, adding that it
would focus on discounting and promotions this year. Larger French rival Carrefour is expected to post flat or
slightly higher fourth-quarter sales of 25.3-26 billion euros
after the market closes on Thursday, according to a poll of
seven analysts. Carrefour, confirmed on Monday as the world's second-biggest
retailer in a Deloitte study, cut its earnings forecast and
trimmed its sales target for 2008 in mid-December, blaming a
downturn in consumer spending and the cost of promotions aimed
at maintaining market share. Casino meanwhile received a boost last month when it
announced it had agreed with Galeries Lafayette to postpone the
latter's option to force Casino to buy its 50 percent of their
Monoprix supermarket joint venture.

show the strain of the economic downturn in a string of trading
updates this week, adding to pressure on the European Central
Bank (ECB) to deliver a cut in interest rates on Thursday. Food retailers and discounters will fare better than stores
selling discretionary and expensive items, but almost all groups
will report a slowdown in sales for recent weeks.  Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, cut its
fourth-quarter profit forecast last week as U.S. shoppers curb
spending amid rising unemployment and fears of recession.  The picture in Europe is much the same, with business and
consumer confidence plunging to record lows in December. ""Given recent largely dismal euro zone data and clearly
sharply retreating inflationary pressures, we believe that the
ECB is more likely than not to act on Thursday,"" said IHS Global
Insight economist Howard Archer, who thinks the central bank
could cut rates by half a percentage point to 2 percent.  Britain's Tesco, the world's third-biggest retailer, is set
to buck the trend on Tuesday with a rise of 2.4 percent in
underlying sales for the six weeks to Jan. 3, according to a
Reuters poll of nine analysts. That would be an improvement on the 2 percent posted for the
13 weeks to Nov. 22, helped by a seasonal uptick in spending.  But Tesco's Christmas sales are forecast to lag UK rivals
due to its greater exposure to non-food lines and to its new
discount range, which is depressing top-line growth. Germany's Metro, the world's fourth-biggest store group,
reports 2008 sales on Tuesday. The food-to-electricals retailer will post revenues of about
68.28 billion euros ($91.44 billion), according to a Reuters
poll of nine analysts, up 6.3 percent on last year and meeting
its target of over 6 percent.  But that would suggest a slowdown in the fourth quarter,
after growth of 7.1 percent in the first nine months, due to
flagging sales at Media Markt/Saturn, Europe's top electrical
goods retailer, and weaker currencies in eastern Europe.  Several analysts also think Metro will struggle to meet its
goal to grow earnings before interest and tax by 6 percent to 8
percent. German travel and retail group Arcandor publishes a
first-quarter sales update on Wednesday.  CA Cheuvreux analysts have pencilled in 0.5 percent sales
growth at the group's Karstadt department stores and a 1 percent
fall at its Primondo home shopping business.   FRANCE AND BENELUX After the market close on Wednesday, French supermarket
group Casino publishes 2008 sales numbers.  Revenues should reach 28.7 billion euros, according to the
average forecast of 18 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, up
15 percent on the year, boosted by strength at its Franprix and
Leader Price discount stores and its South American businesses.  This suggests fourth-quarter sales of about 7.67 billion
euros, which analysts think will be held back by sliding
underlying non-food sales at hypermarket chain Geant. A raft of UK retailers publish Christmas sales updates on
Thursday, with DSG International, Europe's second-biggest
electricals retailer and Home Retail, Britain's top household
goods group, both tipped to report big falls in underlying
sales. After the market close Thursday, France's Carrefour, the
world's second-biggest retailer, updates on 2008 sales figures.  Following a profit warning in December, analysts expect few
surprises, with fourth-quarter sales seen flat or up slightly at
25.3 billion euros to 26 billion euros, according to a poll of
seven. Weakening non-food sales are expected to result in a big
fall in underlying French hypermarket sales, offset by a better
performance at discount stores and in some emerging markets. Dutch supermarket group Ahold and Belgium's Delhaize publish
2008 sales numbers on Friday.  Both make over half of their revenues in the United States
and so analysts think they will suffer from the same forces that
have pressured Wal-Mart, though they note Delhaize's U.S.
presence overlaps much more closely with Wal-Mart than Ahold's.  Analysts expect 2008 sales at Ahold to reach 25.73 billion
euros, according to Reuters Estimates, suggesting a
fourth-quarter sales number of about 6.6 billion euros.  Underlying U.S. sales growth is seen slowing in the fourth
quarter, but should be cushioned by the group's drive to lower
prices, they said. Underlying sales at Dutch chain Albert Heijn
are expected to grow by about 6 percent.  Full-year sales at Delhaize are forecast to reach 18.92
billion euros, according to a Reuters Estimates poll, including
a fourth-quarter contribution of about 5.3 billion euros.

425,"Jan 11, 2009 10:08AM ET","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Rates, earnings, bonds and scandals",nan," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Much investor focus will be on
Europe this week with eyes on interest rates, retail earnings
and the demand for bonds. Concerns about corporate fraud, meanwhile, are rising as the
global economy deteriorates and scandals are revealed in India
and on Wall Street. As legendary investor Warren Buffett put it: ""You only learn
who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out."" The key event for many investors this week will be the rate
setting meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday, with a
Reuters poll showing a majority of economists expecting a
half-point cut to 2.00 percent. [ID:nL556716 Among major monetary authorities, however, the ECB has been
one of the most reluctant to make sharp cuts in interest rates
in part because of a strong, pre-euro tradition in Germany's
powerful Bundesbank to focus on fighting any sign of inflation. ""It is dominated by northern Europeans,"" said Gary Dugan,
chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch's wealth management
arm. ""They want to appear very Bundesbank-like."" But with U.S. rates now at 0.5 percent, Britain and Canada
at 1.5 percent and Japan at 0.10 percent, the current ECB rate
of 2.50 percent does stand out, even after a record 75 basis
point easing last month. And the euro zone economy is increasingly suffering. Euro
zone economic sentiment hit an all-time low in December and
exports in Germany, the largest economy, posted a record drop. Dugan reckons the ECB will have to cut by 50 basis points
soon followed by another 50 in April. For investors, the ECB's decision this week will be a
signpost to just how dangerous the authorities see the threat of
a deepening recession.  SHOP 'TIL YOU DROP Another sign, meanwhile, will come from Europe's retailers,
many of whom have trading and earnings reports this week. Among

to 0.25 percent instead of 0.5 percent) By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Much investor focus will be on
Europe this week with eyes on interest rates, retail earnings
and the demand for bonds. Concerns about corporate fraud, meanwhile, are rising as
the global economy deteriorates and scandals are revealed in
India and on Wall Street. As legendary investor Warren Buffett put it: ""You only
learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out."" The key event for many investors this week will be the rate
setting meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday, with
a Reuters poll showing a majority of economists expecting a
half-point cut to 2.00 percent. Among major monetary authorities, however, the ECB has been
one of the most reluctant to make sharp cuts in interest rates
in part because of a strong, pre-euro tradition in Germany's
powerful Bundesbank to focus on fighting any sign of inflation. ""It is dominated by northern Europeans,"" said Gary Dugan,
chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch's wealth management
arm. ""They want to appear very Bundesbank-like."" But with U.S. rates now at a range of zero to 0.25 percent,
Britain and Canada at 1.5 percent and Japan at 0.10 percent,
the current ECB rate of 2.50 percent does stand out, even after
a record 75 basis point easing last month. And the euro zone economy is increasingly suffering. Euro
zone economic sentiment hit an all-time low in December and
exports in Germany, the largest economy, posted a record drop. Dugan reckons the ECB will have to cut by 50 basis points
soon followed by another 50 in April. For investors, the ECB's decision this week will be a
signpost to just how dangerous the authorities see the threat
of a deepening recession. SHOP 'TIL YOU DROP Another sign, meanwhile, will come from Europe's retailers,
many of whom have trading and earnings reports this week. Among

 (Adds close of U.S. markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Fears of a worsening U.S.
economy drove yields on long-dated government bonds to fresh
50-year lows and led Standard & Poor's on Thursday to warn that
it could cut General Electric's top credit rating, pushing Wall
Street sharply lower. Signs of economic duress were visible throughout financial
markets, with U.S. crude prices dropping more than 9 percent to
$36 a barrel and investors accelerating a safe-haven scramble
into the relative safety of government securities. Oil's slide overshadowed an agreement on a record output
cut on Wednesday by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, while the International Energy Agency said
the market's fixation on falling demand was unlikely to end
soon. ""The price is not going higher because the market has
expected the (OPEC cut) number,"" the IEA's Executive Director
Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters. ""The global economy is getting
worse, so the market is responding to this."" The U.S. dollar, in response to speculation the Japanese
government may intervene to halt a recent sharp advance by the
yen, posted its biggest one-day rise against the yen in more
than a month. U.S. stocks turned sharply lower after Standard & Poor's
said there is at least a 1-in-3 chance it could strip GE's AAA
credit rating in the next two years if the American icon's
earnings and cash flow decline enough to warrant a downgrade. General Electric  shares tumbled 8.2 percent. The biggest drags on the Dow for the second consecutive
session were Exxon Mobil  and Chevron Corp , with
both falling about 5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 219.35
points, or 2.49 percent, at 8,604.99. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index  fell 19.08 points, or 2.11 percent, at 885.34. The
Nasdaq Composite Index  slipped 26.94 points, or 1.71
percent, at 1,552.37. The yen came off its highest level in more than 13 years
after Japanese authorities stepped up their rhetoric against a
stronger currency, which is hurting the nation's exporters. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index  up 1.75 percent at 79.95. Against
the yen, the dollar  rose 2.49 percent to 89.48. The euro  fell 1.32 percent at $1.4211. U.S. bonds rallied for a third straight session. Longer
maturities yields have shed half a percentage point since the
Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut its benchmark interest rate
target to near zero percent in an attempt to end a yearlong
recession. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 fell as low as 2.04 percent, the lowest since the
early 1950s, while the 30-year Treasury  fell to a
record low of 2.52 percent. In Europe, a rally in defensive sectors, such as utilities
and telecoms, helped limit losses in European equities. Carrefour , the world's second-biggest retailer,
sank 7.0 percent after warning it expects only slight growth in
2008 compared with previous guidance of about 7 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 0.17 percent lower at 827.12 points. ""There is more financial debris to come out of the
financial sector when fourth-quarter results come through,""
said Kevin Gardiner, head of Global Equity Strategy at HSBC
Investment Bank. ""And the near-term economic data is going to remain pretty
poor for quite a while, so we can't rule out new lows for
stocks, but we're optimistic that we won't probably see them."" Oil prices tumbled on supply concerns. Top forecasters are
predicting the first decline in world energy use since 1983 as
the global financial crisis gnaws at consumer and industrial
demand. The January U.S. crude oil contract , which expires
on Friday, settled down $3.84 at $36.22 a barrel, after earlier
hitting $35.98, the lowest price since June 2004. London Brent
 traded down $1.61 at $43.92 at 2:51 p.m. Gold ended lower as the dollar's rebound and oil drop led
investors to take a breather following bullion's recent rally. U.S. gold futures for February delivery  settled down
$7.90 to $860.60 an ounce in New York.

down in choppy midday trade on Thursday with falls in blue chip
energy and bank stocks outweighing the rises in drugmakers. At 1157 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was down 0.2 percent at 827.10 points, having
traded between 823.20 and 833.02.  The index has fallen about 45 percent so far this year. Energy stocks led the fallers, taking the most points off
the index, as oil remained at less than $41 a barrel. BP, StatoilHydro, BG Group, and Royal Dutch Shell fell 1.2
percent to 3.6 percent. However, grim data about the euro economy appeared to be
already factored into the market. Germany's Ifo business climate index deteriorated sharply in
December, falling to 82.6 from 84.0 in November, the lowest
pan-German figure since reunification in 1990. ""It's not a new thing that little attention is being paid to
big European economic indicators,"" said Joerg Rahn, senior
economist at MM Warburg. ""The markets are already looking ahead, one step further and
special factors such as a year-end rally may play a role."" In the UK, British retail sales rose unexpectedly in
November, while public sector net borrowing rose to its highest
monthly total since records began, the Office for National
Statistics said. ""The bigger picture is fundamentally disastrous,"" said
Giuseppe-Guido Amato, investment analyst at Lang & Schwarz. ""But the sentiment of the market participants is bad enough
that I think we could very well see a rally based on hope."" ""What you need now is commodities and shares in companies
that have a good debt position.""  PHARMA UP Drugmakers added the most points to the index as investors
turned to the relative safety of defensive stocks. GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Sanofi-Aventis were up
between 1.5 percent and 3.3 percent. The DJ Stoxx European healthcare index has been the best
performer this year, falling 20 percent compared with a decline
of more than 60 percent for banks and miners as a credit crisis
shook investor confidence. Banks were lower with BNP Paribas retreating 7 percent after
it said it could not proceed with Fortis stake acquisition as
planned because of Brussels court decision.     HSBC fell 6.1
percent, investors worried about likely dividend cuts and
capital raising at the bank. Retail stocks were lower after French retail giant Carrefour
 fell 8 percent as it warned it expected sales growth of 6.5
percent in 2008 at constant exchange rates, down from a previous
target of about 7 percent. The DJ Stoxx European retail sector index was 1.1 percent
lower, with Metro and Marks & Spencer down 1.1 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.1 percent,
Germany's DAX was 0.9 percent higher and France's CAC 40 was
down 0.7 percent.

Wednesday said it expected sales growth of 6.5 percent in 2008
at constant exchange rates, down from a previous target of
around 7 percent. The board of directors of the world's second-largest
retailer met to review the action plan implemented over the last
two months, and said its new sales target was ""broadly in line""
with its earlier objective. Carrefour said it would continue its ""aggressive promotional
policy"" given the deteriorating global consumption trends it had
seen over the last weeks, particularly in Europe. CEO Jose Luis Duran told an analyst call that he expected
the group to post sales growth of around 3 percent in the fourth
quarter. He added that he had not yet seen any short-term positive
impact from changes in inflation rates and oil prices, but that
he expected to see a positive effect in the medium- to
longer-term. Duran said that he had noted a ""certain slowdown"" in
non-food sales in China, where the group generated sales of 2.96
billion euros in 2007, out of global sales of 92.272 billion
euros, but that food sales were still ""pretty positive"". The group said in a statement that it expected to meet its

turnover behind U.S. group Wal-Mart, according to a report on Tuesday. Grocery market researchers IGD forecast Tesco would achieve compound annual
growth of 11 percent between 2007 and 2012, led by expansion in China, the

the pace of growth will continue to outstrip that of the developed world,"" said

431,"Dec 02, 2008 04:54AM ET","China row not a deal breaker yet, French firms say",nan," By Tamora Vidaillet PARIS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - French firms doing business with
China do not expect a diplomatic row over the Dalai Lama to
scupper deals just yet, but analysts see a risk of Chinese
boycotts unless problems are cleared up soon. Beijing last week abruptly cancelled a gathering of European
and Chinese leaders, angry over French President Nicolas
Sarkozy's plan for a meeting in Poland on Saturday with the
Dalai Lama, the exiled Buddhist leader of Chinese-ruled Tibet. On Tuesday, China berated Sarkozy again, demanding that he
cancel the meeting to heal ties between China and the European
Union. France holds the rotating EU presidency until the end of
this year. But French companies subjected to Chinese boycotts earlier
this year, after the Paris leg of the Olympic torch relay was
disrupted by protesters, have played down fears of a repeat. Supermarket chain Carrefour, the main boycott target, opened
two shops in China last week. European planemaker Airbus, which is headquartered in
France, has denied that negotiations with China were hit. Firms note that German companies were unaffected when
political ties with China froze in the wake of last year's
meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama. However, analysts say Beijing could more easily punish
French firms if the atmosphere between France and China worsens. ""They have been trying with the French to deliver some kind
of economic hit,"" said Andrew Small, Transatlantic fellow at the
German Marshall Fund think tank in Brussels. ""If relations with France stay in a poor state they can keep
that going. Obviously they don't want this thing to persist but
in some respects they have the capacity to do it.""  FRUSTRATION That would hurt firms at a time of economic slowdown and
aggravate frustration over how Sarkozy has handled ties with
China, the country's eighth largest export market last year. Around 8,000 French companies currently ship goods to China
and the value of large contracts in China totalled an estimated
14 billion euros ($17.74 billion) between 2003 and 2008. French businessmen do not blame Sarkozy for meeting the
Dalai Lama, who is branded a ""splittist"" by Beijing over his
campaign for self-determination in Tibet. But some say the
president has been clumsy in his dealings with China. ""He has handled the China subject very badly. His main
defect is his inconsistency,"" said Olivier Lefebure, a partner
with China-focused law firm UGGC. Businesses questioned the timing of the Dalai Lama meeting. ""He should have consulted and probably done this in his
capacity as French president next year outside of his (EU)
presidency,"" said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union
Chamber of Commerce in China, during a visit to Paris. For now, French businessmen hope any damage will be limited.
 ""Commercial and economic relations will be more difficult,""
said Wang Jiann-Yuh, who heads the France-China Committee of
French business lobby Medef. ""But to go from that to contracts not being signed, I don't
think it works like that. If it is in the Chinese interest to
sign a contract and in the European interest it will happen."" But businesses will be watching developments carefully. ""If the Chinese see relations are going badly, they will
become more interested in the competition,"" said Arnaud Baril, a
salesman from one French joint venture in China.

 (Adds details) By Aaron Gray-Block AMSTERDAM, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Dutch supermarket group Ahold
 reported on Thursday a higher-than-expected 11 percent rise in
core quarterly profit and reiterated its full-year margin target
as its earnings turnaround sparked confidence in its 2009
prospects. Shares in Ahold, which have risen 1.9 percent since it
reported second-quarter results on August 28, were up 6.4
percent at 8.51 euros at 1040 GMT, outperforming a 3.8 percent
decline in the Amsterdam blue chip index. Ahold, which generates just over half of its sales in the
United States, has been focusing on price cuts at U.S. stores
and has benefited as consumers search for bargains amid the
economic downturn, along with rivals Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger
Co both of which have also reported better-than-expected
earnings.  Ahold reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of
262 million euros ($331 million), beating an average forecast of
250.6 million euros from a Reuters poll of 10 analysts.
Estimates ranged from 232 million to 265 million euros. The result reflected an 11 percent rise from last year's 236
million euro operating result, which Ahold restated to strip out
divested Schuitema stores in the Netherlands. ""I had expected earnings recovery in one or two quarters,
but not in the third quarter so this is encouraging and it bodes
well going in to next year,"" said SNS Securities analyst Richard
Withagen. Ahold Chief Executive John Rishton told reporters the
company's turnaround is due to a combination of improved sales,
price cuts and lower costs, adding that the repositioning of its
U.S. stores was always the best move and particularly relevant
given the current economic climate. He said Ahold will continue to adapt to changing consumer
and competitor trends, such as adjusting its supermarket meat
sales strategy, but did not fully elaborate on other specific
measures.  IMPROVING MARGINS Ahold, which also owns the Netherlands' biggest supermarket
chain, Albert Heijn, reported last month third-quarter sales at
the top end of estimates as the revamp of its U.S. stores, which
has hurt margins in recent quarters, gained traction. Ahold said on Thursday its underlying retail operating
margin improved in the third quarter to 4.9 percent from 4.8
percent last year and it reiterated its full-year margin
guidance of 4.8 percent to 5.3 percent. Margins improved at Stop&Shop/Giant-Landover stores to 4.3
percent and at Giant-Carlisle stores to 4.6 percent, as
operating earnings at both U.S. operations beat estimates, while
margins fell to 7.0 percent at Ahold's Dutch flagship chain
Albert Heijn.""The momentum is certainly there and now it's a question of
maintaining it,"" Petercam analyst Fernand de Boer said, adding
he is bullish on Ahold's prospects for the fourth quarter and
the first half of 2009. SNS Securities analyst Withagen said he expected Ahold's
earnings growth in the Netherlands will slow in 2009, but added
that its margins and earnings growth is still good. Ahold has streamlined its business in recent years,
divesting its U.S. Foodservice operations in 2007 after an
accountancy scandal and focused instead on improving its U.S.
retail operations and gaining market share in the Netherlands. Ahold booked 12 million euros in one-off costs in the
quarter related to the rebranding of its U.S. stores and the 58
Schuitema stores it retained, but added that costs related to
the Schuitema integration will continue into the fourth quarter. Ahold's Dutch rival Super de Boer, majority-owned by
France's Casino, said last month third-quarter sales growth
doubled to 4.1 percent, due to rising food prices. Ahold has so far held back from fully passing on higher
costs to consumers, Petercam's De Boer said.Ahold's stock trades at 12.5 times forecast 2009 earnings,
compared with Wal-Mart's 15.3 times, Kroger's 14.1 times and
French Carrefour's 11.3 times, Reuters data showed.
