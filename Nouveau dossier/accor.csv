6,"Mar 11, 2019 08:05AM ET",Big investors look past Khashoggi to opportunities in Saudi Arabia,nan,"By Sylvia Westall, Saeed Azhar and Stephen KalinDUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Big investors in Saudi Arabia are pushing ahead with deals and pouring money back into its stock market as the kingdom tries to move on from the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.His killing at the hands of Saudi agents in October strained ties with Western allies and Riyadh is keen to repair its image. It wants to attract foreign capital and knowhow as part of its Vision 2030 plan of reforms to diversify the economy of the world's top oil exporter and create jobs for Saudis.Some Western governments said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was implicated in the murder. The Saudi government has denied any connection to the crown prince.Deterred by the case, some Western firms in the technology and entertainment sectors have distanced themselves from Saudi Arabia. But several U.S. multinationals told Reuters they are building on their plans in the largest Arab economy. Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) said it was committed to construction of a $100 million polymer plant in Jubail and will complete a feasibility study by the end of 2019 for another complex to produce siloxanes and silicones.Technology and manufacturing group Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) is going ahead with projects as part of a $3.6 billion agreement in 2017 to deliver projects localizing goods and services for state oil giant Saudi Aramco. General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, said it was building on $15 billion of Saudi deals it signed in 2017.""We continue to build upon our agreements to support local infrastructure and growth across the power, oil and gas, healthcare, aviation and digital sectors,"" a GE spokesman said.Riyadh wants to show it is business as usual. It sent a senior delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos and packed executives' agendas with meetings.Last month it announced $54.4 billion in deals and offered fresh incentives under a 10-year industrial program that aims to attract $427 billion in investment.The crown prince, who is the driving force behind the reforms, agreed several deals last month during an Asian tour including $28 billion with China.It also wound down a 15-month anti-corruption campaign that netted scores of senior princes, ministers and top businessmen and unnerved investors.BUSINESS FORGETSForeign investors appear to have taken note. They poured 6.94 billion riyals ($1.85 billion) into the Saudi market in the first two months of 2019, according to Saudi stock exchange data. The index is up more than 8 percent, outperforming its Gulf peers, compared to a fall of about 9 percent within two weeks of Khashoggi's disappearance and killing.Several executives pulled out of a major investment forum in Riyadh last year but a Western diplomat said this year's event is expected to attract big names.""Business tends to forget more quickly than social conscience,"" the diplomat said.Investors are now looking ahead to the inclusion of Saudi stocks in the MSCI's emerging markets benchmark this year and focusing on the pace of economic reforms, bankers say.""There's too much opportunity for investment in Saudi Arabia,"" said Nick Wilson, chairman of the $100 million Gulf Investment Fund which plans to increase its exposure to the Saudi stocks it sees benefiting from reforms.""A nasty thing like that happens and shakes people up for a couple of weeks but at the end of the day business is business,""He pointed to projects to boost the economy such as the $500 billion business zone NEOM.Thomas Barrack, executive chairman at U.S. investment management firm Colony Capital told a conference in Abu Dhabi last month it was a mistake ""to dictate what we think is the moral code.""Colony Capital has agreed to buy a stake in the property business of France's  Accor  (PA:ACCP) alongside Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the financial vehicle behind Vision 2030.BAD PUBLICITYOther Western firms have distanced themselves from the PIF, which has more than $250 billion in assets under management.British billionaire Richard Branson in October said his Virgin Group suspended talks with the PIF over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures and suspended his directorship in two Saudi tourism projects. A Virgin Group spokesman said the statement still stands.Hollywood talent agency Endeavor and PIF ""parted ways"" after talks on the fund investing $400 million, a source familiar with the matter said.Hollywood companies had concerns about the reputational impact on their businesses after Khashoggi's killing, a second source said. Endeavor did not respond to a Reuters query for comment.The PIF had been eyeing up to a $700 million stake in U.S. movie studio Legendary Entertainment but is facing resistance from executives at Legendary, Reuters had reported earlier.A source familiar with the matter said the deal still faced the same issues. Legendary and PIF did not respond to queries for comment, while the sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of these deals.The bad publicity has deterred some potential entrants to the market fearing a backlash at home, another Western diplomat said, while firms new to Saudi need ""hand-holding"".""I think it's going to take one year or two before people really begin to say Saudi Arabia is the place we want to be,"" Mark Mobius, a prominent emerging market investor, told reporters in Dubai this week.(Graphic: Foreign fund flows in the Saudi stock market link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2F1n50T)."

10,"Jan 16, 2019 01:51PM ET",Kenya-based foreign firms pledge to stick to Nairobi after attack,nan,"By Duncan Miriri and George ObulutsaNAIROBI (Reuters) - International companies with regional headquarters in Kenya said on Wednesday that a deadly militant attack on an upscale Nairobi hotel complex would not scare them away from a city that has long been East Africa's business hub.At least 14 people were killed and about 700 evacuated under fire after gunmen stormed the upscale dusitD2 hotel and office complex on Tuesday. Hotel guests and workers from companies like  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) had to hole up for several hours while the attackers were hunted down and killed.The raid echoed a 2013 assault by Islamist militants on an Israel-built shopping center in the same neighborhood that killed 67 people: Images beamed across the world during that assault dented Kenya’s image abroad and scared off tourists, damaging a vital sector of the economy. Among Nairobi's other potential deterrents are sporadic political violence that erupts during elections.But companies say the latest attack won't alter their plans to work in the region's richest city.""We are very committed to Nairobi. GE is very committed to Kenya,"" said Brenda Mbathi, executive director for government affairs in East Africa at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). The American conglomerate set up its regional headquarters for sub-Saharan Africa in Nairobi in 2011, and now provides medical equipment to the Kenyan government and turbines to private power plant developers. Convenient flights, a skilled English-speaking workforce and advanced information technology infrastructure have persuaded multinationals like GE and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc to set up regional hubs in the city.The influx has helped shore up Kenya's long-held position as East Africa's wealthiest economy amid tough competition from other regional countries and Dubai to play a regional hub role.The attack was claimed by Somali group al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate fighting to topple Somalia's weak U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law. BUFFER ZONENeighboring Kenya has been a periodic target for al Shabaab after sending troops into Somalia to try to create a buffer zone along the porous border.But robust economic expansion, estimated at 6.0 percent last year, has helped boost investor sentiments, although rising government debt levels have stoked concerns. Snehar Shah, managing director for East Africa at British solar power firm Azuri Technologies, pointed out that Kenya was not the only country that had suffered attacks. ""We still believe that Nairobi is a hub for the region and we are very committed to being here,"" Shah told Reuters.""This is also happening in places like London and it didn't stop business and tourism.""Google Africa, whose offices are near the hotel complex attacked, echoed his sentiments.""We are here in Kenya for the long haul,"" said Dorothy Ooko, their head of communications. Google lost some of its partners in the attack, including American Jason Spindler, the CEO of investment firm I-Dev International, part of Google's local start-up and developer network.At the East Africa headquarters of U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (UBER.UL), staff were co-ordinating free rides to and from selected Nairobi hospitals for blood donors. ""Uber continues to stand in support of the Nairobi community as we recover from this devastating act,"" said their spokesman for East Africa.1998 BOMBINGSuch stoicism reflects a realization that East Africa was not really getting more dangerous, said Ed Hobey-Hamsher, senior Africa analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.""One-off attacks will embarrass the Kenyan government but will not jeopardize its stability,"" he said.Kenya has a record of resilience. Its economy recovered strongly from the 1998 bombing by al Qaeda’s East Africa cell of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi which killed more than 200 people.In the important tourism sector, which has attracted a wave of foreign investments recently from global chains like Hyatt Hotels and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, executives also stood firm.""I don't see any cancellations and no one has cut short their stay,"" said Mohamed Hersi, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation, an umbrella body of hoteliers, tour operators and airlines.The industry was encouraged by the swift security response that killed the attackers in less than 24 hours, he said.Earnings from tourism, one of the top sources of foreign exchange, surged 31 percent last year to 157.4 billion shillings ($1.55 billion), the tourism ministry said on January 7.The Nairobi Securities Exchange, a gateway for foreign investors into the fast-growing economies of East Africa, said trading had carried on normally on Wednesday.""Despite the efforts by the terrorists to instill fear and destabilize our country, Kenya is a strong and resilient country. Today's market performance was stable,"" the bourse said in a statement. ($1 = 101.6000 Kenyan shillings)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

11,"Jan 10, 2019 09:50AM ET",French companies bruised by 'yellow vests' protests,nan,"By Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - French companies have this week revealed some 60 million euros ($69 million) of lost business from anti-government protests rocking the country, which could augur badly for the likes of supermarket chains Casino and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Shares in retailer FNAC Darty fell on Thursday after the electronics goods retailer estimated a revenue hit of some 45 million euros from the closure of stores during the protests and fewer shoppers.With no sign of the protests ending, Air France KLM said the unrest had reduced sales by 15 million euros -- a relatively small figure for the Franco-Dutch airline but enough to push its shares down too.The ""yellow vests"" ('gilets jaunes') movement - named after the fluorescent jackets all French motorists carry in their vehicles - started in the middle of November as a protest against a fuel tax but has since grown into a broader backlash against the government. The demonstrations have been marred by violence that has led to shopping districts and tourist hotspots having to close down on some weekends.""The impact will be felt first and foremost with those companies with a physical presence on the high street, such as FNAC Darty. But others will also be impacted, such as hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) since the 'gilets jaunes' has been negative for tourism in Paris,"" said Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.Data on Wednesday showed consumer confidence last month fell to its lowest level in four years as consumer fretted about their purchasing power and ability to make large purchases - and figures later in January from Casino and Carrefour could reflect that.Confidence was also down in France's construction industry as a result of the protests, said HSBC, which said it was revisiting its valuation of Bouygues' construction related business to better reflect the global environment.""STANDSTILL""Catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) warned it had concerns for later this year. Sodexo owns Paris cabaret Le Lido, the Yachts de Paris luxury river cruising business and has the catering contract for a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.""We are more worried about the impact of the protests on the spring-summer tourism season,"" said CEO Denis Machuel.The FCD French retail association, which speaks for both supermarket retailers and upmarket department stores, estimated that there had been a revenue loss of around 2 billion euros over the course of November and December.""Needless to say, you will have similar warnings from other big Paris shops. In essence the Champs Elysees has been closed every weekend for the last two months, so outlets such as LVMH and Le Bon Marché will get hit,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Clairinvest.""The companies in Paris' CAC-40 index will get impacted to a certain extent because the 'gilets jaunes' have brought the French economy to a standstill,"" added Valahu.The signs of bruising to French companies comes after a study in financial daily Les Echos this week showed that the country's top companies had paid out dividends worth 57 billion euros last year, as President Emmanuel Macron pursued his reform drive.Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Swiss investment firm Prime Partners, said that given the risks from the protests he would favor international companies over those exposed to the domestic French economy, such as Casino and Carrefour.(GRAPHIC: Paris riots roil French equities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QgkZSn)(GRAPHIC: Protests slow French GDP - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zQhrf0)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already has hotels including the Cheval Blanc in the prestigious Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvlgari hotels.The Belmond deal is LVMH's largest since it spent 4.3 billion euros in 2011 to buy Bvlgari and 6.5 billion euros in 2017 to gain full control of Christian Dior.It will have a limited impact of its debt and boost 2018 earnings per share, before synergies by just 0.1 percent.LVMH will ""reach critical mass in the ultimate luxury hotel world with one single acquisition,"" finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a call.""The priority is to develop and improve the profitability of these exceptional brands and nurture complementarity with the LVMH group brands,"" he addedThe acquisition will give it properties including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in southern Peru, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, moving LVMH further into the fast-growing ""experiential"" high-end travel and hospitality sector.The transaction follows a wave of deals in the luxury hotels sector, including AccorHotels' (PA:ACCP) purchase of FRHI Holdings, the parent of the Fairmont and Raffles hotels.""While some investors may question the acquisition, which appears to lie outside LVMH group's core operations, we believe it is consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience,"" Berenberg analysts said in a research note. ""LUXURY EXPERIENCES""Guiony said the deal reflected LVMH's belief that ""the future of luxury is in luxury goods and in luxury experiences"".It also pushes LVMH further into new luxury services at a time of growing concern that Chinese demand for high-end fashion and handbags will start waning amid worries about the health of the world's second-largest economy and potential damage from Washington's protracted trade spat with Beijing.LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday's closing price. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, values Belmond's equity at $2.6 billion, and the group, including debt, at $3.2 billion.Belmond posted earnings of $140 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on revenue of $572 million in the 12 months to Sept. 30. Half of revenue comes from Europe and 20 percent from North America.At 1520 GMT, LVMH shares were down 0.9 percent at 253.45 euros in a weak European stock market (FTEU3) while Belmond shares jumped 40 percent in New York to $24.74.RBC Capital Markets analysts said the price of the deal - at 5.6 times recent sales and 22.9 times recent EBITDA - looked ""optically high"", but added: ""Belmond owns a unique portfolio of trophy real estate assets, that will allow LVMH to increase its exposure to experiential luxury"".LVMH ended up paying a multiple of 19 times Belmond’s expected EBITDA for next year, according to Refinitiv data. Bigger hotel chains like Hilton and Marriott International (O:MAR) trade on forward multiples of just over 12 times.Belmond owns, partly owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants and train and river-cruise properties located in exotic and distinctive destinations worldwide.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The positivity that started the week was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday, with Donald Trump pouring more fuel on the trade war fire while unleashing some unhelpful Brexit comments,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst Spreadex.com. The U.S. president said on Monday he expected to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from the current 10 percent and repeated his threat to impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China.Among the leading sectoral fallers on Tuesday were mining companies (SXPP), down 1 percent as copper prices slid for the third day, pressured by Trump comments. The export-oriented auto sector (SXAP) fell 0.6 percent.

""It’s been a challenging year for travel operators and airlines, buffeted by the `Beast from the East' at the beginning of the year, and then by industrial action in Europe, as well as rising oil prices through the summer,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets.However,  Accor , (PA:ACCP) rose more than 1 percent. Europe's largest hotels company stuck to its target of doubling core earnings to 1.2 billion euros by 2022.

A senior Radisson executive for Africa told Reuters last year it planned to have 120 hotels by 2021. ""We are more than doubling our presence on the continent by 2020,"" Kurt Straub, Hyatt's vice president of operations for Middle East and Africa, told Reuters.""Air travel has improved tremendously, it has become much more open, people are freer to travel. Hyatt is very keen to go where our customers want to go,"" said Straub, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Nairobi to announce the opening of Hyatt's first hotel in Kenya in 2020. Chicago-headquartered Hyatt's existing hotels in Africa include one in Senegal and South Africa, where it has the luxury Hyatt Regency brand in Johannesburg.Straub said the new hotels would include a Hyatt Regency in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and another in Arusha, a northern Tanzanian city popular with holiday-makers and conference organizers.The Hyatt hotel in Nairobi will have 233 rooms, including some under the Hyatt Place brand, aimed at shorter stays, and 60 Hyatt House apartment style suites for longer stays.Straub did not say how much Hyatt was investing in the project, which is a partnership with a local company, only saying it was a ""sizeable investment"".""We are very careful in how we grow. We don't want to grow for the sake of growing,"" said the 25-year Hyatt veteran, who took over his Dubai-based job in February.""It is not about the quantity, it is about being in the right place at the right time with the right partner.""Other big international hotel groups, including Radisson, Kempinski and Marriott, are estimated to have about a third of the available room capacity on the continent.

23,"Sep 26, 2018 08:20AM ET",Deal-making spree keeps investors upbeat about European M&A revival,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - The $40 billion takeover of British broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB) and other new deals in Europe have broken a summer lull to bolster investor optimism over an M&A revival in the region.Europe has not traditionally been the preferred destination for M&A investors, but 2018 started with a boom that saw activist campaigns targeting big names from food group Nestle (S:NESN) to miner BHP Billiton (L:BLT) and paints maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO). In the last three months, however, the value of transactions more than halved as trade war concerns and political worries gripped markets and M&A bankers waited on the sidelines.But this week's Sky takeover, a merger involving miner  Randgold Resources  (L:RRS) and the acquisition of Italian fashion house Versace showed that M&A in Europe is anything but dead and could help drive positive share price performance. Philippe Ferreira, cross-asset strategist at Paris-based Lyxor, which oversees some $165 billion of assets, said he was ""constructive"" over the outlook for European M&A. ""Even if volumes have come down a bit, activity remains buoyant and is likely to remain so,"" he said, mentioning Sky and drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP) in the UK and pointing to Germany and Switzerland as other regions where large deals are in the pipeline. Sky shot up 8 percent after the deal with Comcast (O:CMCSA) was announced and Randgold added 6 percent after saying it would be taken over by Barrick Gold (TO:ABX) in a deal that Bernstein analysts say could signal the start of renewed consolidation in the mining industry.Shire is being acquired for $62 billion by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502), the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company.Dealogic data show the value of deals in Europe more than halved to $182 billion in the third quarter so far from the previous quarter, sliding below year-ago levels. U.S. deals fell at a smaller pace and remained above year-ago levels. That has fueled some pessimism about whether the early boom in M&A would continue. ""A lot of deals aren't happening,"" said a London-based trader, focused on special situations. He cited the lack of any big banking merger and no move by U.S. tech giant Amazon to buy a cheap retailer despite continued speculation. On Wednesday,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) dismissed speculation that it might seek a merger as ""fictions"", while the Telegraph reported that Amazon (O:AMZN) made preliminary approaches for online food delivery company Deliveroo that had made no progress.BUMPER YEAR Still the year is set to be a bumper one and dealmaking activity could get a further boost if concerns that the U.S.-Sino trade war could damage Europe's export-oriented economy ease. A softening of political risk would also help, investors said. ""We continue to expect M&A as a big driver for European equity markets. A lot of companies have cash and big balance sheets but the problem is it's difficult to announce a big deal in this market which has a lack of visibility,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Roland Kaloyan. ""If we see some better newsflow coming on the political side and the macro side, that will be a strong catalyst to see more deals,"" he added. With nearly $1 trillion worth of deals, European M&A is on track for its strongest year since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, tracking global dealmaking. An unprecedented record of mega-deals, of which Sky is one, however, has lifted Europe's share of deal values to almost 30 percent, the strongest since 2012.Investor sentiment this month was buoyed by hopes that the United States and China could resume talks on trade, while worries over a no-deal Brexit and the Italian budget eased.A trader at a European bank however said some investors are wary of acquisitions that could hit share prices. The takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) has cost Bayer (DE:BAYGn) 18 billion euros of market value so far, but that may be an exception. According to a study by Cass Business School for investment adviser Willis Towers Watson, shares in European acquirers have bucked a negative global trend by outperforming their regional index by 2.8 percentage points this quarter. Over a one-year period, the outperformance was 6.2 percentage points, against a 3 percentage point underperformance worldwide, the study published on Monday showed. Possible picks range across different sectors. Among the stocks that U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) believes are well placed to play the revival in European M&A are retailer  Kingfisher  (L:KGF), electrical parts supplier  Rexel  (PA:RXL), hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and telecoms infrastructure supplier Nokia (HE:NOKIA). Their break-up candidates include engineer ABB (S:ABBN), miner  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and car maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). Lyxor's Ferreira said his outlook had not changed much this year and that interest from foreign investors in M&A in Europe had grown and that could support the market. ""We talk with several funds investing in M&A and they are pretty much satisfied with the returns they got on European M&A,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The French group announced in July that it was teaming up with Katara Hospitality - the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund's hospitality arm - to create a fund to invest in Africa.The fund will invest in 40 hotels as  Accor  expands from the 114 hotels it operates in Africa under brands including Ibis, Novotel and Pullman.With 70 percent of the existing properties being in North African markets, Mark Willis - appointed as the company's Middle East and Africa chief this month - told Reuters that Accor is looking at opportunities in Cape Town, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Abidjan and Kampala. ""There's a variety of different things on the table. We have a number of deals about to close in those key destinations,"" he said, adding that he believes there is a gap in the market for economy and mid-range accommodation. In April AccorHotels acquired a 50 percent stake in South Africa's Mantis Group, which runs a string of five-star properties and lodges around the world.Accor's established North African foothold, Willis said, was expected to serve as a springboard for the expansion push, since those same customers travel and do business across the continent. ""The key, especially when you have a 40 million-strong loyalty base, is to make sure you've got footprint in those key locations where your guests need a brand that they know and trust,"" he said.Among its main rivals, Radisson's Africa portfolio stands at 86 hotels and almost 18,000 rooms in operation and under development after rapid expansion on the continent in recent years.While accepting that Radisson has done a ""fabulous job"" in Africa, Willis said that Accor is more than capable of competing in an African market that is increasingly attracting big-name hotel chains.""We have the opportunity to really put a firm grip on the whole continent,"" he said. Hyatt Hotels & Resorts (N:H) plans six new hotels in Africa by 2020 and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT) will spend $50 million over the next five years to fund expansion.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It was the will of the nomination committee to identify a candidate before the end of the month,"" said one of the sources.But disturbances ranging from media speculation about the potential candidates to AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) voicing an interest in buying a stake in Air France KLM and then dropping that plan, had complicated the process, said the sources.""So you lose a week here and there and it's August 1. It means nothing will happen before the end of the month. Everyone must go and come back from holidays,"" said one of the sources.In mid-July, Anne-Marie Couderc - the interim chairman of Air France KLM - had said in a memorandum seen by Reuters that the company hoped to have a new leadership team fully up and running by September.According to La Tribune.fr website, Air France-KLM's nomination committee is currently talking to one north American executive with a good knowledge of the airlines industry.Air France-KLM declined to comment on the situation.The French government has a stake of about 14 percent in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Jul 24, 2018 04:42AM ET","Global airfares, hotel rates to rise in 2019: industry forecast",nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - A strong global economy and rising oil prices are expected to push up the cost of air travel in 2019, with fares seen rising 2.6 percent and hotel rates up 3.7 percent, although there are downside risks from a trade war, according to an industry forecast.In some countries, including India, New Zealand, Norway, Germany and Chile, airfares are expected to rise by more than 7 percent, said the annual business travel forecast from Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT) and the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) released on Tuesday.""Speaking for the Asia-Pacific region, we are coming off a period three to four years ago where there was a lot of capacity in the system (and) fares were down pretty significantly, potentially lower than was sustainable,"" said Michael Valkevich, CWT's vice president for global sales & program management, Asia Pacific.""So I think we are getting to a bit more of a renormalization of sustainable fares.""The International Air Transport Association in June forecast passenger yields, a proxy for airfares, would rise by 3.2 percent this year in the first increase since 2011 as a stronger global economy drives growth in demand. CWT/GBTA predicted a 3.5 percent rise in airfares in 2018 in a forecast released last year.Airline costs, including for fuel and labor, have been rising, leading carriers to attempt to push up fares or add fuel surcharges to maintain margins.The CWT/GBTA 2019 forecast said the rise in hotel rates would be driven by an increased demand for air travel, which would fuel demand for rooms. Room rates are expected to rise by more than 5 percent in Asia and Europe, by 2.1 percent in North America and to fall by 1.3 percent in Latin America.Hotel groups including France's  Accor  SA (PA:ACCP) and U.S.-based Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) have reported strong growth in revenue per available room in Asia and Europe this year.The CWT/GBTA forecast said despite its positive outlook, risks remained for the global economy in 2019 from the rise of protectionist policies, the stoking of trade wars and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union.Valkevich said the U.S.-China trade war had not yet led to any noticeable drop in demand for business travel, but it was a ""downside risk factor"" for the corporate travel industry.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

36,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."

39,"Jul 10, 2018 12:06PM ET",Air France-KLM CEO hunt signals industry strategy shift under Macron,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - The hunt for a new chief executive to lead Air France-KLM, a group hobbled by union resistance to cost-cutting at its French brand, is testing President Emmanuel Macron's resolve for a lighter state touch on the economy.Macron's government has told the Franco-Dutch airline group its very survival is at stake if it fails to become more competitive and undergo the painful reforms completed by carriers such as British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) as they battle low-cost airlines and Gulf carriers.In what would signal a subtle shift in French industrial strategy, two sources familiar with Macron's thinking said the government is open to considering a non-French national as chairman of the group for the first time. This chairman would sit above one chief executive for Air France, who would almost certainly be a French national, and one for KLM, one of the sources said. It is just one option on the table. Macron's office expects to receive a shortlist of candidates from the group's interim management by the end of next week, a third source familiar with the matter said. The Air France-KLM group (PA:AIRF) has been led by French chief executives since its formation in 2004, a demand of the French state, its largest shareholder and one with heavy influence over the group's board thanks to its outsized voting rights.The last, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned in May after losing a fight over pay with Air France staff. His role as group chief executive and chairman as well as chairman of the Air France unit has prompted a rethink of the structure. Paris' readiness to consider a foreigner to oversee a revamp of the airline's strategy and negotiations with Air France unions reflects Macron's desire to create pan-European companies that can withstand globalization, even if that means placing control of a national asset in foreign hands. ""What we want to do is to create European champions,"" a finance ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's not of primary importance that the boss has to be French.""""It wouldn't worry us if we ended up with an aviation specialist from Europe.""Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115), which both hold 8.8 percent stakes in Air France-KLM, declined to comment.Two names have leaked to media in past weeks. Philippe Capron, the financial head of Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), pulled out after French ministers said they wanted an aviation specialist and that he was one of several candidates.Le Figaro reported on Monday that Catherine Guillouard, chief executive of French public transport group RATP, was being considered for the top job at Air France-KLM. Two sources told Reuters she was not an official candidate.INVESTOR PRESSUREThe job of Air France-KLM chief executive may not be one that widely appeals. The next company chief will face the unenviable task of having to break union resistance to reduce Air France's swollen cost base, while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch KLM staff onside. A wave of strikes this spring at Air France over pay cost the group some 350 million euros ($410.97 million) and led to the ouster of Janaillac. Sources say KLM officials are frustrated at French staff's chronic labor conflicts and blame Air France's weak handling of the powerful SNPL pilots' union for the group's fragile state.Investors are frustrated too. The group's share price has slumped 47 percent so far this year. Asked recently if the group could have a Dutch chief executive, KLM CEO Pieter Elbers responded: ""why not?""The pressure from investors to slash costs has intensified as rising fuel costs and overcapacity squeeze margins. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned after Janaillac quit that he would not soak up the airline's losses. Overseeing a restructuring of Air France-KLM would cement Macron's reputation as a reformist and modernizer.""Restructuring ... is what is required to move Air France-KLM forward. Anything else will be history repeating itself,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska.STATE EXIT?Macron could go further and sell-down France's 14.3 percent stake in Air France-KLM, a move that would deliver a potent message that he is serious about liberalizing the economy.The state's exit from the airline group would hand its leadership more freedom to stare down the unions.""(IAG chief executive) Willie Walsh just stared them down until blood came out of their eyes and they gave up,"" said aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) announced last month it was looking at buying all or part of the French state's stake - an option the government has not closed the door on but which faces obstacles.""The government is studying things and is closed to nothing, but the first priority is to find a new leadership team for Air France-KLM,"" the finance ministry official said.AccorHotels' overseas investors could, however, complicate any deal. Its main investors are from China and the Gulf, whose own airlines compete with Air France-KLM on long-haul routes. European Union rules also require more than half of a European airline's capital to be held by member states or EU nationals. ""Accor's capital today is not sufficiently European for it to work,"" said a second source familiar with the discussions. There would, however, be ways to overcome this, analysts say. The state's holding remains an open question. Nonetheless, analysts are encouraged by broader comments on the future of Air France-KLM coming out of the French finance ministry. ""The noises heard out of the finance ministry definitely signify a change in attitude toward Air France-KLM from the French state, said Roeska.

45,"Jun 04, 2018 05:25AM ET",Bank stocks boost European shares as dealmaking dominates,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares extended a recovery on Monday thanks to bank stocks as dealmaking took center stage again after a week of political tension in Italy and Spain and friction between the U.S. and its allies over trade policies.Investors' concerns over trade were overshadowed by very strong U.S. jobs data on Friday. Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) took the lead from Asian markets climbing on the data, up 0.6 percent while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.8 percent.News about mergers and acquisitions (M&A), particularly in the financial sector, drove the biggest moves. Dealmaking has been a key trend in equity markets globally this year, with the UK among the most active for deals, helping the FTSE 100 start to outperform euro zone stocks.The banks sector (SX7P) jumped 1.2 percent, the strongest boost to overall gains, as investors priced in potential dealmaking activity and stronger economic data. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) shares rose 3.5 percent and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) gained 2.6 percent after the Financial Times reported the two were exploring a merger which many investors hope could pave the way to further consolidation in the sector.Analysts noted that speculation about a deal has been ongoing, but regulatory obstacles posed a big challenge.""The political and regulatory backdrop remains a significant hurdle to deliver an attractive deal,"" said Jefferies analysts. ""While the recent political volatility in Italy understandably increases the merger rationale for UniCredit, in our view an outright merger is unlikely in the current circumstances,"" said KBW banking analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert.British lender CYBG (L:CYBGC) gained 3.2 percent after it upped its offer for challenger bank Virgin Money (L:VM) by 7 percent.Beyond financials, Air France (PA:AIRF) topped the STOXX with a 5.3 percent gain after AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) said it was looking at taking a stake in the airline.  Accor  fell 4 percent on the news. ""While the strategic rationale for Accor is there, we wonder why this cannot be achieved by a commercial partnership without any equity stake,"" said Bernstein analyst Caius Slater. For Air France he saw little benefit from a potential deal. The removal of a government stake could increase bargaining power against labor unions, said Slater, but on the other hand the stake was possibly providing a floor to the share price.Italian and Spanish equities were the top gainers, having suffered a week of heightened uncertainty as Italian parties negotiated a government and Spain's Prime Minister was ousted. Spain's IBEX (IBEX) was up 1.3 percent while Italy's FTSE MIB gained 0.6 percent.The political turmoil did have knock-on effects for investor morale, however. A Sentix index for euro zone investor confidence fell for the fifth month in a row in June, hitting its lowest level since October 2016. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares rose 1.7 percent in their second day of modest recovery after they hit a record low on Thursday on a report the U.S. Fed had deemed its U.S. operations ""troubled"".To view a graphic on June 4 european stocks, click: https://reut.rs/2LjkYG1  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Chinese group has the master franchise for the Mercure and Ibis hotel brands in mainland China, Taiwan and Mongolia. Under the arrangement, AccorHotels has also taken a 10.8 percent in Huazhu and a seat at Huazhu's board of directors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

50,"Apr 18, 2018 04:01AM ET",China leapfrogs New Zealand as Australia's top tourist source,nan,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China has leapfrogged New Zealand to become the top source country for travelers to Australia in the 12 months to February, Australian official data showed on Wednesday, as overall visitor numbers hit a record high.Some 1.39 million Chinese visited Australia during the period, up 13.2 percent on the year prior and for the first time exceeding travelers from neighboring New Zealand, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed. There were 1.36 million visitors from New Zealand in the period. Overall tourist arrivals rose to a record high of 8.9 million during the year to February, while tourism-related spending in the year to December reached a record A$41.3 billion ($32 billion).""Tourism is generating income, wealth, jobs and economic activity across the economy,"" Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec said in a note, adding the industry accounted for 10 percent of Australia's exports. Record numbers of tourists also visited Australia from the United States and India in the period. Chinese visitors are particularly sought after because they tend to stay longer, and spend more than visitors from other countries.China has been Australia's most valuable inbound tourism market since 2011. Over the past five years, Chinese visitor numbers have doubled, driving tourism earnings and spurring a boom in hotel development and record profits for airlines and travel agents.""The Chinese traveler is evolving and the growing middle class in China are chasing new experiences,"" said Hianyang Chan, an industry analyst at research firm Euromonitor International.""Australia is a preferred destination due to its vast landscape, pristine nature, good food, security and art and culture.""Australia's largest airline, Qantas, posted a record half-year profit in February as higher visitor numbers drove both international and domestic flying.Its main rival, Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd, reported its best result in a decade, while shares in travel agencies Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd and Webjet Ltd are trading within range of record highs.The boom has attracted dealmakers, most notably the $920 million buyout of resort operator Mantra Group by French hotel company  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA last year - forming Australia's biggest hotel group.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The 48-year-old German, who won her first Olympic title in Barcelona back in 1992, scored 90.657 percent at the  Accor  (PA:ACCP) Hotels Arena to add to her 1992, 2007 and 2017 World Cup titles. Also seven-times world champion, Werth beat American Laura Graves, on Verdades, by 1.575 percentage points.Another German, Jessica von Bredow-Werndl, finished a distant third with 83.725 per cent, riding Unee BB. ""It was a fantastic performance from us. She was focused, she was really with me,"" Werth said of her 13-year-old mare.""It was one of her best freestyle, if not the best.""World number one Werth, who had won four of nine events going into the World Cup dressage final, made uncharacteristic mistakes in Friday’s Grand Prix as she was beaten by Graves, but there was no repeat of those in Saturday’s decisive Grand Prix Freestyle. ""A lot of people think it is easy to win but you have to listen to the horse. Yesterday was not our day but today we improved. It was a great show,"" said Werth, the most decorated dressage rider in the event's history.A bouncy piaffe, near-perfect tempo changes and a lot of power made the difference and six of the seven judges put her first.The event is part of a joint-final with the World Cup jumping final, which will be held on Sunday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Jan 31, 2018 12:55PM ET","For Saudi tycoons freed from detention, cheers and a business challenge",nan,"By Stephen Kalin and Katie PaulRIYADH (Reuters) - Cheering supporters greeted Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal when he arrived at his skyscraper offices in Riyadh after his release from detention in an anti-corruption crackdown.But he and other tycoons freed from a luxury hotel in the Saudi capital face a challenge to get back into the swing of running their financial empires in the uncertainty hanging over the business community since their detention in early November.Their ability to do so could impact Saudi Arabia's attempts to lure investors to big projects, an important part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's grand vision to transform the kingdom and reduce its dependence on oil.""It will need another six to nine months without disruption or another witch hunt before anyone would be willing to move on anything major,"" a regional banker said of the business climate. ""This is not the right time to bring anything to market.""Online footage showed Prince Alwaleed waving from a luxury car in a convoy trailed by police as he arrived this week at the Kingdom Center skyscraper one day after his release, and then walking inside with his private physician.A source familiar with the matter said the prince received an operational update on his global portfolio, which includes stakes in Twitter, ride-hailing firm Lyft and French hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP).In the first few days after his detention, the share price of his investment firm Kingdom Holding plunged 23 percent, erasing $2.2 billion of his personal fortune on paper.After a jump this week, the stock has regained almost all that it lost, but during the prince's detention the overall stock market rose 10 percent. Kingdom shares do not reflect that gain, indicating investors are still applying a discount to his company because of the uncertainty.Prince Alwaleed's predicament suggests Saudi tycoons who have long been content to focus on amassing huge profits must now consider whether the government's anti-corruption drive could stop them in their tracks.Saudi Arabia's attorney general said on Tuesday that settlement deals had secured just over $100 billion from members of the elite. He did not provide a breakdown, and Reuters could not verify that figure. BACK IN THE DRIVING SEATIn another video, property mogul Mohammed Aboud al-Amoudi sits in a black office chair at his home in Jeddah receiving kisses on the hand and forehead from a procession of well-wishers who utter thanksgiving for his safe return after nearly three months in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh.A company representative reached by phone said Amoudi was in good health.""It is as if he was traveling and returned, nothing more,"" said the person who declined to be named, adding it was not clear if he would run the company again.Associates of other released detainees, including media magnate Waleed al-Ibrahim and retail billionaire Fawaz al-Hokair, told Reuters they were at home catching up with family and close friends.An email to MBC employees seen by Reuters described Ibrahim as ""fit and eager to get back"". It said he would travel to Dubai in a couple of weeks to get ""back in the driving seat"".Hokair, meanwhile, is hosting dinners for guests, according to one attendee. The stock price of his company, fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co, is still 13 percent below its level just before he was detained.""It's as if he was on a business trip or in a summer holiday or a religious trip. He is fully motivated, full of ambitions,"" the attendee said.""He does not talk about anything, he just says he was happy and received good treatment.""These men are among the last group released from the Ritz, which had been used since November as a prison and interrogation center for dozens of senior princes, ministers and businessmen and was cleared out on Tuesday.Specific allegations against the men and the settlements they agreed before their release were kept secret. Some may have been moved to prison after refusing to admit wrongdoing and reach financial settlements; they may stand trial. Notably absent from the final batch of releases were Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the king's nephew, and dismissed Economy Minister Adel Fakieh. Their fates remain unknown.Two bankers said assets or corporate ownership transfers had not yet been made for the last batch of released detainees and any handovers could be shielded from public view for some time through what one banker described as ""very clever lawyers and accountants.""Critics have described the anti-corruption campaign as a shakedown and power move by the Crown Prince. The government denies this.As workers removed security barriers at the Ritz-Carlton in anticipation of the hotel's reopening in mid-February, recently checked-out ""guests"" reconnected with loved ones.Pictures shared on social media showed Alwaleed visiting an ill nephew in hospital. On Twitter, people urged him to continue his charitable activities.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Jan 27, 2018 10:30AM ET",Prince Alwaleed's release to reassure investors in global portfolio,nan,"By Andrew Torchia and Saeed Azhar(Reuters) - The release of Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, known for his big bets on  Citigroup  (N:C) and other top Western companies, is likely to reassure investors in his sprawling international business empire. For many foreigners, Prince Alwaleed - whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - is the face of Saudi business, appearing frequently on international television and in articles about his investments and lifestyle.A 2013 Forbes magazine profile described his marble-filled, 420-room Riyadh palace, a private Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 equipped with a throne, and his 120-acre resort on the edge of the Saudi capital with five homes, five artificial lakes and a mini-Grand Canyon.Directly and indirectly through his investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280), he holds a portfolio of stakes in companies such as Twitter (N:TWTR), where he is believed to own nearly 5 percent, ride-hailing firm Lyft and French hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP), where latest disclosures show him with 5.7 percent.His web of hospitality and real estate investments includes the George V hotel in Paris, New York's Plaza hotel and the Savoy hotel in London. Investments within Saudi Arabia include a 16.2 percent stake in lender Banque Saudi Fransi (SE:1050).The assets of Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, appeared at risk of seizure or liquidation when he was detained in November in a crackdown on corruption. A Saudi official said he was accused of money laundering, bribery and extortion.Kingdom Holding's share price plunged as much as 23 percent in following days, wiping about $2.2 billion off his fortune.But the stock has since recovered about half its losses. The prince's release on Saturday could help it rebound further.Terms of the release have not so far been disclosed. A senior Saudi official told Reuters the prince was freed after a financial settlement over ""violations"" to which he had admitted. But the official gave no details, beyond saying Prince Alwaleed would continue to head Kingdom Holding.Prince Alwaleed told Reuters in the final hours of his captivity that he maintained his innocence of any wrongdoing, and did not expect to have to hand over assets to the state.The prince also said he was able to communicate with executives at his business during his detention, and that Kingdom Holding would remain under his ownership.FINANCE MINISTER'S SONPrince Alwaleed, whose father was the Saudi finance minister in the 1960s, formed Kingdom Holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in Riyadh. In the 1990s, he ventured into Wall Street, investing heavily in Citigroup.He had a close relationship with former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford ""Sandy"" Weill, and has nurtured close ties with other Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) chief executive Lloyd Blankfein.""He's always been a colorful and unofficial public face of Saudi Arabia, though he has never been a key decision-maker in the kingdom,"" a Gulf-based businessman said.Well before he was detained, Prince Alwaleed publicly endorsed economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the crackdown on corruption.Prince Alwaleed was an early advocate of women's employment in Saudi Arabia and ending a ban on women driving. In September, King Salman ordered the driving ban to be lifted this year.The prince has also been outspoken in the international arena. During the U.S. election campaign, he called Donald Trump a ""disgrace"" and said he should withdraw from the campaign after Trump pledged to ban Muslims' entry into the United States.Trump responded by tweeting that the Saudi prince wanted to control ""our politicians with daddy's money. Can't do it after I get elected.""Following the vote, Prince Alwaleed congratulated Trump on his victory and said that, whatever past differences, America had spoken.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Jan 05, 2018 09:50AM ET","As Macron embarks on China tour, reciprocity is the word",nan,"By Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's visit to China next week will be the first by a major European leader since the Communist party's recent leadership congress, and he will use it to try to secure greater access for French companies and forge a yet-to-be-defined Asia policy.In his first official visit to the world's second-largest economy since his election last May, Macron is expected to push for a more level playing field in trade relations, as France tries to cut a 30 billion-euro trade deficit with China.""There's an ambition to rebalance, get more reciprocity in access to Chinese markets and fairer competition conditions,"" an advisor to Macron said on condition of anonymity.By reciprocity, French officials mean easier access for foreign companies to regulated or protected sectors of the Chinese economy. Chinese officials say that concept is ""relative"" in an emerging economy.Like other Westerners, the French have long complained about China's rules for foreign investments and its demands for technology transfers and compulsory joint-ventures with local rivals.French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot-Citroen in particular have had to set up partnerships with domestic companies but have had only limited success in gaining a slice of the world's biggest auto market.French officials hope the emergence of a prosperous Chinese middle-class will give French companies, which tend to specialize in consumer products, an edge over German rivals more focused on machinery and equipment.But besides the usual race for market share, Macron's advisors say he will also defend a common European Union line for freer trade between the blocs, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric.As an economy minister in the previous Socialist government, Macron led the fight to toughen EU anti-dumping rules imports of cheap Chinese steel surged. In June, he also urged the Commission to build a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from outside the bloc, which drew criticism from Beijing.""Even if on the surface the trip goes smoothly and faux-pas are avoided because the two presidents are smart and it's the first state visit, I think on substance each will firmly defend their own priorities,"" Alice Ekman of the Paris-based think tank IFRI told Reuters.A delegation of 50 company executives, from nuclear giants EDF (PA:EDF) and Areva, planemaker Airbus and hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP), as well as representatives of the French beef, pork and milk lobbies are expected to travel with Macron.Airbus is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during the visit, sources said.DEFINING FRANCE'S ASIA POLICYThe trip will also be an opportunity for the 40-year-old president, who has mostly focused on Europe and its neighborhood since his election, to define his country's role in Asia.The two countries are expected to discuss security issues such as North Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to hold talks with the South next week amid a standoff over its nuclear and missile programs.French officials have touted the fight against climate change as another key issue for cooperation with China, now that Trump has announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord signed in 2015.History and symbols will also feature on the trip, as they did with Trump and Putin, whom Macron received in grandiose settings such as the Champs-Elysees and the Palace of Versailles. Macron is expected to visit cultural landmarks such as the ancient Terracotta Army in the former capital of Xian and the Forbidden City in Beijing, the ancient home of China's emperors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"Nov 14, 2017 05:59AM ET",Airbnb puts automatic rental cap on central Paris offers,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - Short-term rental website Airbnb, which has been challenging traditional hotel operators such as  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and Marriott, said it would automatically cap the number of days its hosts can rent their property each year in central Paris.The decision, which goes into effect in January and mirrors initiatives already in place in London and Amsterdam, will force hosts to effectively comply with France's official limit on short-term rentals of 120 days a year for a main residence.It comes as Airbnb, similar to its taxi-hailing peer Uber, is facing a growing crackdown from legislators worldwide - triggered in part by lobbying from the hotel industry, which sees the rental service as providing unfair competition. Airbnb and other rental platforms have also been criticized for driving up property prices and contributing to a housing shortage in some cities such as Paris or Berlin.Airbnb, which has denied having a significant impact on housing shortages, has been trying to placate local authorities.""Paris is Airbnb number one city worldwide and we want to insure our community of hosts expands in a responsible and sustainable manner,"" said Emmanuel Marill, Airbnb general manager for France.In Paris, the automatic rental cap will apply only to the city's first four districts (""arrondissements"") unless the property owner has proper authorization. These districts include tourist hotspots such as the Marais, and landmarks such as the Louvre and the place de la Concorde square.Airbnb is implementing the cap as the Paris city council has made it mandatory from December for people renting their apartments on short-term rental websites to register their property with the town hall.Ian Brossat, the housing advisor to the Paris Mayor, told Reuters that the cap should extend to the whole of Paris. ""Under the law, websites must withdraw listings that do not comply with the law throughout Paris. One cannot accept that a website complies with the law only in the first four arrondissements of Paris,"" said Brossat. With over 400,000 listings, France is Airbnb’s second-largest market after the United States.

74,"Nov 05, 2017 04:00PM ET","Alwaleed, Caught in Saudi Purge, Has Assets Across Globe",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- When Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was arrested as part of an anti-corruption probe in Saudi Arabia, it was the latest twist in the story of a billionaire who has courted international attention -- while cloaking his investments in secrecy.Alwaleed is among the 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of current or former senior officials arrested on orders from a newly established anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said a senior Saudi official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The wealthiest of the arrestees, Alwaleed was picked up from his desert camp, the official said. Authorities didn’t disclose the allegations that prompted the action.Despite his being the 50th-richest person in the world, with a $19 billion fortune according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, details on the source of Alwaleed’s wealth must be gleaned from his public statements, the website of his holding company and company filings. Often his transactions and assets are disguised by investing through funds that obscure the ultimate beneficiary.Known internationally for investments in companies including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alwaleed, 62, hasn’t hesitated to flaunt his wealth. He bought his own A380 superjumbo jet in 2007, planning to kit it out as a “flying palace.” He also launched legal action against Forbes magazine for undervaluing his worth in 2013, before settling the case in 2015. He was a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the U.S. presidential election last year. He later sold the A380 before taking ownership of it, and sought to reconcile with Trump after he was elected president.“A suspect’s position or status does not influence the firm and fair application of justice,” Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, attorney general of Saudi Arabia, said in a statement announcing the investigations, without naming names.Alwaleed’s 95 percent-owned investment vehicle, Kingdom Holding Co., is listed on the Saudi stock exchange and has a market value of about $35 billion -- down 8 percent on Sunday. Still, details on the investments he has made or the returns they generate are scarce. Kingdom Holding’s latest annual report barely refers to its stake in Citigroup, for example, even though the prince has said he is one of the biggest single investors in the bank. Kingdom Holding is continuing its usual commercial operations and has assurances of support from the government, the company said in a statement.Some of his highest-profile stakes may take a beating in trading Monday unless more is heard from them or Alwaleed, said Joice Mathew, head of equity research at United Securities in Muscat. Here’s what’s known about Alwaleed’s investments.FinanceCitigroupKingdom Holding has held Citigroup shares since 1991, according to its website, increasing its stake during the bank’s 98 percent plunge during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Citigroup’s latest proxy filing doesn’t include Alwaleed or Kingdom Holding among the two investors that own more than 5 percent of the company. The prince was a vocal backer of Vikram Pandit, the chief executive officer brought in to help turn Citigroup around, although he also told Fox News in a 2010 interview that the “honeymoon is over” for Pandit and that investors wanted to see results.Alwaleed long has been a vocal shareholder, encouraging the lender to rebuild its Saudi Arabian business more than a decade after it lost a key banking license there. Citigroup will reopen in the kingdom later this year after a 13-year absence. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat met the prince in Riyadh in March to discuss the bank’s future plans. The company declined to comment.Technology and Entertainment Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).Alwaleed invested $300 million in Twitter in 2011 for what Kingdom Holding’s website says was a “substantial position” in one of social media’s most powerful platforms. He currently owns 4.9 percent of Twitter, according to a regulatory filing by the San Francisco-based company in February. In an interview on CNBC Arabia in October, he said Twitter may face some difficulties, though his investment was close to breaking even and he was optimistic about the outlook. Alwaleed has pared his investment from 5.1 percent in December 2015. The company declined to comment.AppleAlwaleed bought 6.23 million shares, or 5 percent, of the computer and mobile-device maker for $115.4 million in 1997. He made these purchases between mid-March and April of that year while the company was still struggling to turn itself around. He has since continued to hold the stake while Apple’s valuation has soared to as high as $900 billion. The company didn’t immediately respond to comment.LyftIn 2015, Kingdom Holding was among a group of investors that bought a 5.3 percent stake in the California-based ride-hailing company, valued at $247.7 million. Lyft’s major investors, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, also sold a portion of their shares in the company to Alwaleed last year. The company didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.21st Century Fox As of Dec. 31, 2015, the prince held 39.7 million shares, or a 4.98 percent stake, in Rupert Murdoch’s media and entertainment company. That’s lower than the 6.6 percent holding he had in the company as of the end of 2013, according to regulatory filings. Kingdom press releases as recent as last month mentioned that it still owns a stake in Fox, though it no longer appears in Bloomberg data as a reporting holder. Fox declined to comment.In 2011, while a leading stockholder at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., he called for the departure of top executive Rebekah Brooks amid a phone hacking scandal in the U.K. Three years later, he voted with the Murdochs as shareholders tried to dilute family control over the business. He sold most of his stake in 2015.JD.comAlwaleed has been investing in e-commerce and technology companies for a number of years as demand for technology and Internet services increases. In 2013, Kingdom Holding led a group of investors in buying a stake in a Chinese online retailer, now called JD.com, that was valued at $400 million. JD.com said it had raised a total of $700 million from investors, also including a Canadian pension fund and some major shareholders, in addition to Kingdom Holding. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.HotelsThrough Kingdom Holding and its Kingdom Hotel Investments unit, Alwaleed has made substantial investments in some of the world’s grandest hotels and biggest operators. Kingdom’s portfolio of luxury hotels includes a controlling interest in the The Plaza in New York, the Savoy Hotel in London and the George V in Paris, according to its website. Kingdom Hotels has a 5.7 percent stake in  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, Europe’s biggest hotel operator, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Accor declined to comment.DomesticAlwaleed owns significant stakes in Saudi companies across the real estate, retail and petrochemical industries. Most recently, Kingdom Holding acquired a 16.2 percent of Banque Saudi Fransi from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in September. The $1.5 billion deal makes Kingdom Holding the biggest shareholder in Saudi Arabia’s fifth-largest bank. Saudi Fransi didn’t respond to requests for comment.It is the latest addition to a domestic portfolio that also includes a 33 percent stake in Jeddah Economic Company, which is developing a real estate project in Jeddah that is set to include the world’s tallest building. Other assets include the Kingdom Tower in Riyadh, which includes one of the tallest towers in Riyadh and a Four Seasons hotel. Other investments include a 34 percent stake in Flynas, a budget airline that was considering an initial public offering this year, and a stake in food-producer Savola.(Updates with response from Fox.)"
75,"Nov 02, 2017 08:00PM ET",HNA May Check Out of This Spanish Hotel After Getting Kicked Out,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- HNA Group Co.’s precarious grip on a $2.2 billion Spanish hotel company is in doubt as a mountain of debt comes due and China puts the squeeze on its most prolific acquirers.The Chinese conglomerate, whose assets include a quarter of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., owns about 30 percent of Madrid-based NH Hotel Group SA. But HNA is in Spanish limbo: its directors have been booted off the board in a shareholder revolt, while Beijing’s crackdown on overseas deals would obstruct any buyout that could bring NH Hotel to heel. Analysts anticipate a sellout.A sale of HNA’s stake, which has a market value of more than 550 million euros ($641 million), might attract European hotel operators or real-estate funds, according to Oddo & Cie. The Spanish company’s inventory of almost 60,000 hotel rooms -- stretching from New York to Luxembourg to Shijiazhuang, China -- would appeal to  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, making the French rival the most obvious suitor, according to Bankinter Securities SV SA. “HNA is better off selling the stake in NH,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “As a 30 percent owner, they really don’t have any control. By selling they would both get rid of an asset that is somewhat of a public-relations problem while also raising some much-needed liquidity.”Proceeds from the sale could ease the conglomerate’s refinancing pressure. After the once little-known airline operator went on a debt-fueled acquisition spree -- with more than $40 billion of purchases announced since the beginning of 2016 -- its interest expenses bloated to 15.6 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), exceeding earnings before interest and taxes. HNA just sold China’s most expensive short-term dollar bond ever, highlighting concerns among investors about its high financial leverage.HNA, the Curious Company Worrying China and U.S.: QuickTake Q&ANH Hotel, which operates about 400 properties in 30 countries, was losing money when HNA invested in 2013. After a debt refinancing, NH Hotel returned to profit in 2015 and expects to generate net income of 100 million euros in 2019, according to targets announced in September.But after HNA extended its hotel-buying spree, the Spanish alliance unraveled. NH Hotel investors ousted HNA’s four board representatives in June 2016, claiming they were conflicted because HNA also agreed to buy competitor Rezidor Hotel Group AB. In September, a Spanish court reaffirmed that putsch. That decision left the Chinese conglomerate, even as NH Hotel’s largest investor, with no say in how the business is run.Read More: China Lays Down Outbound Investment Rules in Bid to Cut RiskSimultaneously, HNA -- which also owns about 10 percent of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) -- is being reined in by Chinese authorities. They’ve put hotel investments on a list of restricted deals as President Xi Jinping clamps down on mounting debt and capital outflows to protect the yuan.As Europe’s largest hotel operator and the owner of the Novotel, Ibis and Mercure brands, Accor may be interested in HNA’s stake, said Javier Hombria Gestoso, an analyst at Bankinter Securities in Madrid. He described Accor as “the primary suspect in terms of public companies” that could emerge as buyers.Accor and NH Hotel both focus on business travelers, and NH Hotel could broaden Accor’s European footprint, said Fehmi Ben Naamane, an analyst at Oddo & Cie in Paris. Accor also expects to raise more than 4 billion euros from selling a stake in its HotelInvest property unit.“Accor could be a good fit for NH,” Naamane said.There’s also scope for an investment fund that’s focused on real estate to pursue HNA’s stake, then later spin off the property component. Either way, any buyer of HNA’s stake probably would make an offer for the rest of NH Hotel, Naamane said.HNA declined to comment, while representatives at NH Hotel and Accor didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Rival hotel groups also may be interested. El Confidencial reported in September that Spain’s Barcelo Hotels & Resorts had hired  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA to assess a possible merger with NH Hotel.To be sure, HNA may prefer to wait things out rather than sell. The conglomerate’s ultimate goal may be to merge its Brussels-based Rezidor hotel group with NH Hotel: Rezidor said last year it planned to study such a union as part of a plan to turn Rezidor into a global hotel chain. Such a combination “seems justifiable,” said Guilherme Sampaio, an analyst at Banco BPI SA.But HNA first would need to overcome both NH Hotel shareholders and opposition in Beijing.Plus, an exit from NH Hotel would unravel the Chinese company’s maiden overseas hotel acquisition -- in an industry that’s become one of its core investment areas.“HNA needs to do something,” said Nigel Stevenson, an analyst at Hong Kong-based GMT Research. “It could engineer a takeover by another company, enabling it to exit at a premium.”"

82,"Sep 14, 2017 05:31PM ET",Irma creates bittersweet travel bonus for luckier Caribbean islands,nan,"By Alistair Smout(Reuters) - On Friday, a cruise ship carrying around 3,000 passengers will dock at St. John's harbor in the Caribbean island of Antigua. It will not be where the passengers expected to land when they booked, however.The Carnival (LON:CCL) Plc ship was meant to dock in Saint Martin, 100 miles (160 km) to the northwest. However, Hurricane Irma devastated the island, wrecking its port and infrastructure, and leaving it out of bounds for tourists.Antiguan officials now expect the Carnival Fascination to visit every Friday, and have gotten about 25 calls from major cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Lines looking to make stops through the end of the year.For Asot Michael, Antigua and Barbuda's minister for tourism, the unexpected arrival of thousands of tourists is a bittersweet bonus.""We are going to be benefiting. I don't want to benefit from others' misfortune after such a disaster,"" Michael said.""But because the port is so damaged in Saint Martin, so damaged in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, we're getting some of those cancellations. Those cruise lines now are making ports of call into Antigua."" Hurricane Irma left behind a stark divide in the Caribbean ahead of the winter tourism season that is the region's economic lifeblood. As travel to the region picks up again, cruise lines, hotels, airlines and other companies are directing customers to places that are able to host them, and away from the worst-hit areas. Popular winter vacation spots such as Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Saint Barthelemy that were devastated by the storm could be sidelined for weeks or months. In 2016, 29.3 million tourists visited the Caribbean and spent $35.5 billion, both new records, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization. “For Saint Martin and Saint Bart, the holiday season looks very compromised,"" said Jean-Pierre Mas, chairman of French travel agency federation SNAV. ""My sentiment is that the winter season is lost. Decisions to book for the winter season are taken right now."" Busy tourist destinations in the western Caribbean, such as Barbados and Trinidad, were well away from the path of the storm. Cozumel, on Mexico's Gulf Coast, got four additional visits this week as ships were rerouted to avoid the storm's impact, although Cozumel tourism officials said three cruises were canceled. Florida, which was anticipating another record year for its $100 billion a year tourism industry, is expected to rebound in time for the peak winter travel months, Moody's Analytics said earlier this week. Walt Disney Co reopened its Orlando Disney World theme park on Sept. 12. The Florida Keys, however, wrestled with more severe storm damage. [nL2N1LR0N1] [nF9N1L0029] [nL2N1LS1HW]Some travel companies said they are still assessing the situation and had not made firm decisions about rerouting ships.Tour operator Virgin Holidays said that it was beginning to return to regular operations in Antigua, despite damage to some properties on the island.""Antigua wasn't as badly damaged as we feared, and we have reopened tourism there, although three resorts are currently not on sale because of the damage,"" a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said. ""Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia are three big tourist examples that were not impacted.""However, the small island of Saint Martin, which France shares with the Netherlands, could miss out on much of its tourism season.French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday vowed to swiftly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean, including Saint Martin, and a French public reinsurance body estimated a cost of at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the damage there and in Saint Barthelemy. [nL2N1LT1SF] [nL5N1LQ09G]Hurricane Irma badly damaged many hotels on the island, such as AccorHotels Mercure hotel. A spokeswoman for  Accor  (PA:ACCP) said that while nobody had been hurt, the hotel would be closed until Jan. 8 at least. While 70 hotel rooms remain operational, they are being used to house military forces and other staff that are supporting the relief effort. AccorHotels is offering cancellation and reimbursement for those who had booked stays at the hotel.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

83,"Sep 12, 2017 08:32PM ET",Hurricane Irma batters already struggling Cuban economy,nan,"By Marc Frank and Sarah MarshHAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's cash-strapped economy has suffered this year from a decline in aid from its chief ally Venezuela, lower exports and a brake on market reforms. And then came Hurricane Irma. The strongest storm to strike Cuba in more than 80 years ravaged infrastructure throughout the country, collapsing the power grid and damaging crops after it slammed ashore late Friday. In the keys along the northern coast, it battered beach resorts popular with foreign tourists and knocked out the airport they use.The cost of rebuilding as well as the lost revenues from tourism and agriculture, sectors that had helped offset some of the economy's weaknesses, are heavy blows as the Communist nation strives to pay overseas creditors and suppliers.""The probability that the economy stays in recession are now much greater,"" said former Cuban central bank economist Pavel Vidal, now a professor at Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia, of chances for a second straight full-year contraction in 2017.""With the impact on installations in the keys and on the country's general infrastructure, tourism will lose dynamism.""A tourism boom in Cuba over the past few years sparked by warming relations with the West has helped sustain the economy. Cuba is still laboring under a 57-year U.S. trade embargo and suffering from a steep decline in subsidized oil from its crisis-stricken Socialist ally Venezuela.Official data - which gives heavy weighting to Cuba's universal free healthcare and education - shows hotels and restaurants account for just 4.4 percent of the roughly $90 billion-a-year economy, but they are a vital earner of hard currency.A 23 percent rise in foreign visitors to Cuba helped the economy return to growth in the first half of 2017, the government said, after it tipped into recession in 2016.The outlook has darkened in the second half of the year. First U.S. President Donald Trump said he was tightening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba. Then the Cuban government said last month it would not hand out new licenses for much of the private sector until it had ""perfected"" its functioning.Then Irma arrived, grazing along the island's coast from east to west. Packing sustained winds of more than 157 miles (253 km) per hour, it pummeled the northern keys, though it left the biggest beach resort area of Varadero mostly intact. The keys - whose pristine beaches are home to around a quarter of Cuba's four- and five-star hotels - are now littered with felled trees and lamp posts, animal corpses and shredded furniture, according to state-run media.Irma also destroyed much of the area's single-runway airport, which receives more than 485,000 passengers a year.President Raul Castro vowed on Monday that tourism infrastructure would be fixed before the start of the winter high season at year-end.Eric Peyre, a representative at French hotel company  Accor  SA (PA:ACCP) which runs the Cuba-owned Pullman hotel in Cayo Coco, said that damage would be covered by insurance and he expected 90 percent of what the hotel needs would be in place by mid-December. ""As long as you have the main kitchen and the main restaurant and rooms (ready), you can normally welcome guests,"" he told Reuters. ""The tennis court and things like that, that can come after."" Still, hotels in the keys face revenue loss for the months that tour package operators sent their clients elsewhere and it could prove tricky to rebuild the area's reputation.HURRICANE AFTER THE DROUGHTDamage in the agricultural sector will both weigh on state finances as well as tighten food supply in the short term. Fuller reservoirs due to Irma's torrential rains could in the long run prove advantageous after a severe drought.Some 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of sugarcane - an area roughly twice the size of Houston - were affected to different degrees, the state sugar monopoly said. Forty percent of mills were damaged in the industry that remains one of Cuba’s most important in terms of employment and export earnings.Even though Cuba had rushed to harvest what it could before Irma hit, other crops such as platano and rice had also reportedly been affected, said Laura Melo, the Cuba representative for the United Nations' World Food Programme.""Some of these areas were already seriously affected by drought so this is an accumulation of shocks to Cuba's capacity to produce food, both in terms of income and availability of food,"" said Melo.Looking ahead, Cuba will need to repair tens of thousands of houses as well as roads, bridges, public buildings and the power grid. Irma also damaged a thermoelectric plant that provides a fifth of the country's electricity.""If this year, the budget deficit was estimated at around 12 percent,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny. ""That will undoubtedly have increased with these enormous losses.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At the time, onefinestay had a portfolio of 2,600 properties in London, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Rome.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

89,"Jun 07, 2017 07:13AM ET",Luxury hotels arrive in Cuba despite fears Trump may hurt tourism boom,nan,"By Sarah MarshHAVANA (Reuters) - Towering cranes dot the Havana skyline as communist-run Cuba races to build luxury hotels, amid indignation among some residents and concern that U.S. President Donald Trump might reverse a detente that fueled the tourist boom.Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA will inaugurate its Gran Hotel Manzana in the heart of the capital on Wednesday, billing it as Cuba's first true luxury hotel.The five-star property, managed by Kempinski but owned by the Cuban government, occupies the top floors of a renovated Belle Epoque shopping mall filled with glitzy Gucci and Montblanc stores.Farther down the iconic Paseo de Prado boulevard toward the Caribbean Sea, workers are developing two other sites into luxury hotels to be operated respectively by Spain's Iberostar and France's  Accor SA  (SA:ACCP), the largest hotel group in Europe.Tourism is the one bright spot in Cuba's moribund economy, which is struggling with falling exports and upheaval in major trade partner Venezuela.Cuban Tourism minister Manuel Marrero said in May that more than 4.2 million tourists were expected this year, up from 4 million in 2016. He said the country was adding 2,000 hotel rooms a year to its stock of 65,000 hotel rooms and 21,000 homes renting to tourists.Visits by Americans have soared since U.S.-operated cruises and scheduled flights were relaunched last year as part of the detente pursued by former President Barack Obama after a half-century hiatus.However, his successor Trump is considering tightening those rules when he announces his Cuba policy as soon as this month, according to current and former U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions. That would likely hurt tourism, at least in the short run, and might slow the pace of hotel construction.  ""We hope that trade and travel restrictions eased by the Obama administration will not be tightened again by the current U.S. government,"" said Alessandro Benedetti, a marketing director at Kempinski.""That would not be favorable for any kind of businesses connected to tourism, such as cruise ship operators, airlines or hotel chains.""The Cuban government has courted foreign hotel operators to develop untapped markets, particularly in high-end tourism.With its gleaming white stone facade and French bay windows, the Gran Hotel Manzana features a rooftop infinity pool overlooking Havana's central park, as well as a spa with steamroom and sauna. There is also a cigar lounge with a tobacco sommelier.Industry experts say Cuba, which offers a plethora of low- and mid-range accommodation, is right to bet on luxury, although it will be a challenge for operators to maintain standards in a tightly controlled Soviet-style economy.""We have travel agencies contact us saying they had never worked with Cuba because it didn't offer anything up to their standards,"" said Benedetti.""But now that's changed,"" he said, citing strong interest from U.S. tourists seeking more luxurious destinations.CUBANS HAVE MIXED FEELINGSIt remains unclear how far Trump will go in rolling back Obama’s changes. Any reinstatement of U.S. restrictions on Cuba travel would face criticism from American travel companies as well as a growing number of U.S. lawmakers.The number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, but Americans are still not officially allowed to visit as tourists. Because their trips must fit certain categories, like educational travel, most descend on Havana rather than the coastal resorts.While Cuba has been building resorts around the island, it has redoubled its focus on the capital, where hotels are fully booked year-round and demand is growing.""With this increase, it would be appropriate to have products of high standard,"" said Francisco Camps, Cuba deputy general manager for Spain's Meliá Hotels International S.A. (MC:MEL), which wants to introduce its two main luxury brands.Despite assurances tourism revenues will benefit all Cubans, the move has stirred mixed feelings in a country that prides itself on social equality.""The hotels are very pretty, but they are too expensive for Cubans,"" said retiree Antonio Cazamayor, who lives on a monthly pension of $10.Rooms at the Gran Hotel Manzana will range from $360 for a low-season double to $5,000 for the 150-square-meter (1,600-square-foot) presidential suite.Cazamayor's home in the densely populated back streets of central Havana is just a few blocks from the hotels but feels like a different world.His building appears derelict from the outside, with the ground-floor windows boarded up, but inside it teems with families packed into tiny units.Many neighborhood buildings, which date to the 1920s and 1930s, are missing walls or balconies. Collapses are common. An apartment block in front of Cazamayor's was recently evacuated after its stairwell caved in.""If that one collapsed, and this one is falling apart, why don't they build homes?"" Cazamayor asked.Hobbled by an inefficient, centrally planned economy and a U.S. economic embargo, Cuba has struggled to maintain its infrastructure in a punishing tropical climate.Since the country opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, Havana reinvested much of its revenue in renovating historic buildings, from Art Deco hotels to colonial palaces.""They have returned the sparkle to part of Old Havana,"" said Abraham Rodriguez, 45. He attended a school in the building that now houses the Gran Hotel Manzana and recalls how the classrooms flooded when it rained.But much of the rest of the city is still falling into ruin.Cubans working in the private sector as restaurateurs, taxi drivers and tour guides say the arrival of Kempinski and its rivals spells good business for them.Yet the benefits for the more than two-thirds of the government employees are less obvious.Josefa Cespedes, 73, has been living for a quarter-century in a building that houses a unit of the Communist Party charged with keeping tabs on the neighborhood because her home collapsed.""The poor have to wait for the state to help,"" she said."

94,"May 05, 2017 01:40PM ET",AccorHotels shareholders stick to double voting rights,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - The shareholders of AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) on Friday granted former French President Nicolas Sarkozy a seat on the board of Europe's largest hotel group, and rejected a bid to block long-term shareholders from getting more double voting rights. Chairman and CEO Sebastien Bazin reiterated at the annual shareholders meeting that double voting rights were a good way to foster loyalty and stability among shareholders..""We have a solid and extremely diversified shareholder basis,"" he said.Europe's largest hotel group has seen some big changes in its shareholder base recently, with investors from China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar now holding a combined 29 percent stake.Soon, these shareholders - which include Chinese competitor Shanghai Jin Jiang (SS:600754) - could qualify for double voting rights under the company 's rules.This led critics, including French shareholder advisory group Proxinvest, to say this could give them more control over the company without having to pay a premium for that advantage.Proxinvest had advised a group of 14 shareholders, led by Paris-based investment firm PhiTrust and representing 2.3 percent of AccorHotels's capital, which had filed a proposal to block the further granting of double voting rights.The proposal needed a two-thirds majority to be approved but received just 52.36 percent of the votes cast at the meeting.Chinese group Jin Jiang is Accor's biggest investor with 12.58 percent of the shares and 11.22 percent of the voting rights, having built its stake since late 2015.French media reports in June 2016 that the Chinese firm could gradually seek to gain more control over  Accor  drove President Francois Hollande to state publicly that AccorHotels should retain a diverse group of shareholders. [nL8N18Y2SE)Sarkozy also chairs the newly created international strategy committee of AccorHotels. His board appointment was announced in February. Bazin on Friday quashed speculation that Sarkozy's nomination could be a way to help limit Jin Jiang's influence.""Nicolas Sarkozy is not in any way a brake (to Jin Jiang), his nomination is not related to our Chinese shareholder,"" he said.Sarkozy, who led France for five years from 2007, lost his bid for another presidential term in November after coming third in the primaries of his centre-right party.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

98,"May 03, 2017 07:20AM ET",AccorHotels faces AGM battle over double voting rights,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) faces a battle at its annual shareholder meeting on Friday as a group of investors tries to block the granting of double voting rights to some long-term shareholders. Europe's largest hotel group has seen some big changes in its shareholder base recently, with investors from China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar now holding a combined 29 percent stake.Soon, these shareholders - which include Chinese competitor Shanghai Jin Jiang (SS:600754) - could qualify for double voting rights under rules adopted by the French company. Critics, including French shareholder advisory group Proxinvest, say that would give them more control over the company without having to pay a premium for that advantage. Proxinvest is advising a group of 14 shareholders, led by Paris-based investment firm PhiTrust and representing 2.3 percent of AccorHotels's capital, which has filed a proposal to block the further granting of double voting rights. Big investor advisory groups Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) have backed that proposal. ""Only respecting the 'one share-one vote' principle could prevent one of the new major shareholders, notably the Chinese competitor Jin Jiang which for the time being is still denied a seat on the board, from weighing in on group decisions without having to launch a takeover bid,"" said Proxinvest.AccorHotels declined to comment.ONE SHARE, ONE VOTEJin Jiang is Accor's biggest investor with 12.58 percent of the shares and 11.22 percent of the voting rights, having built its stake since late 2015. French media reports in June 2016 that the Chinese firm could gradually seek to gain more control over  Accor  drove President Francois Hollande to state publicly that AccorHotels should retain a diverse group of shareholders.The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) owns a 10.36 percent stake and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding a 5.79 percent stake since summer 2016. They also each have a board seat, following Accor's takeover of luxury hotels group Fairmont Raffles (FRHI).Last month, AccorHotels' board rejected the Proxinvest group's proposal to reinstate the 'one share, one vote' principle - known as 'Proposal A' - saying it wanted to foster loyalty and stability among shareholders.In protest, Proxinvest has withdrawn its support for resolutions to re-elect Chairman and CEO Sebastien Bazin to the board and to appoint former French President Nicolas Sarkozy as a board member.Proposal A will be submitted to a shareholder vote on May 5, but not as one approved by the company's board. It needs a two-thirds majority to be approved.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Gobilliard, who joined AccorHotels in 2009 after 10 years at French holiday group Club Med, was responsible for the operations of Accor's mainstream Mercure and Novotel brands for the French provinces. In the last two years, he also managed relations with the MamnaShelter teams.AccorHotels cut back the upper end of its 2016 profit target range in October after its French and Belgian operations were hit by security fears in the third quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

123,"Oct 12, 2016 08:50AM ET",Airbnb seeks French growth beyond resilient Paris,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Vacation rental marketplace Airbnb said guest arrivals in its biggest market Paris rose this summer despite an overall decline in foreign visitors due to security fears, and it now aims to expand into lesser known corners of France. The online business recorded an annual rise in guest arrivals of 20 percent in the French capital and of 80 percent elsewhere in France between June 1 and Sept. 1 2016, in sharp contrast to the hotel sector, with which it competes. Hoteliers suffered a marked decline in business that they blame on fears of more Islamist militant attacks, like those that claimed the lives of over 230 people since early 2015. Foreign tourist arrivals to France could fall 4-5 percent this year and research firm KPMG warned that French hotels could suffer a revenue fall of 10 percent in 2016.Airbnb country manager for France and Belgium Emmanuel Marill told Reuters in an interview Airbnb had also been hit by the tourism downturn as it had expected growth above 20 percent.""But we resist because we are at the heart of a new phenomenon backed by strong brand recognition,"" he said.The 35-year-old former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive who took over last month said the site's resilience in Paris was also down to the fact hosts and travelers can exchange information and hosts can reassure visitors of the safety of their neighborhood.Founded in 2008 in San-Francisco, Airbnb matches people wishing to rent out all or part of their homes to temporary guests. It appeals to young, web-focused consumers looking for a cheaper price, but also the experience of living like a local.As Airbnb has rapidly expanded across the globe, it has often come into conflict with local rules and traditional hoteliers, who see it as unfair competition.With 350,000 listings, France is Airbnb's second-largest market after the United States, and Paris, the most visited city in the world, is its biggest single market, with 65,000 homes.Foreign tourists have avoided France since Islamic State gunmen killed 130 people in an attack in Paris last November. In July, a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 86.Repeated robberies against foreign tourists, notably Asian tourists, and an armed robbery against reality TV star Kim Kardashian earlier this month, have added to safety worries.Despite this, in July, Airbnb said the number of guests lodged in France since it launched there in 2012 had passed 10 million. It had five million guests in 2015 alone, twice 2014's number. Marill declined to make a prediction for 2016.EXPANSION PLANSWhile 70 percent of Airbnb's listings were in Paris in 2012, 80 percent are now outside Paris, a trend set to continue.""The rest of the country will drive growth, notably the mountains and the seaside. Cities like Marseille, Bordeaux or Lyon will drive volumes but the fastest growth will come from lesser known, isolated places which often lack any hotels.""Once a startup selling cereal, Airbnb is today valued at around $30 billion and has more than 2 million rental listings worldwide. By comparison, hotel group InterContinental (L:IHG) has a market value of $7.9 billion.Europe's largest hotel group AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) has long warned revenues were under threat from the so-called sharing economy and it has fought back with a flurry of acquisitions and a push into the luxury sector.As a result of pressure from hoteliers and officials Airbnb agreed to charge visitors the traditional French ""tourist tax"".It began collecting this from guests in Paris in 2015 and now collects it from visitors to 19 towns. Marill said Airbnb aimed to collect it everywhere in France by mid-2017.He also played down criticism that Airbnb was driving up property prices or contributing to a housing shortage in some cities such as Prague and Berlin. ""We do not want to be a source of housing problems in the big European capitals. But it's sometimes very hard to identify the professionals using the platform to speculate"".""We are complementary of hotels,"" he said, adding Airbnb was often present in areas without hotels.""For the cake to grow, we must all work together.""(Corrects translation in quote to ""brand recognition"")  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The image of France has deeply deteriorated and it's likely that 2017 will still feel the impact. The recovery may therefore be long,"" it said.An armed robbery against reality TV star Kim Kardashian on Monday only exacerbates the situation.The decline in visitor figures, if confirmed, would be the steepest in 40 years and put up to 30,000 jobs at risk in the struggling French tourism sector, the statement said.Foreign tourists have avoided France since Islamic State gunmen killed 130 people in an attack in Paris last November. In July, a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 86.Repeated robberies against foreign tourists, notably Asian tourists, have also added to safety worries, Alliance 46.2 said.The tourism sector represents 7-8 percent of France's gross domestic product and employs about 2 million people.The French government last month pledged more aid to the sector, bringing to 10 million euros its contribution to a campaign to promote the country abroad.France is the most-visited country in the world, with almost 85 million foreign tourists last year. France is still targeting 100 million foreign tourists by 2020.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

131,"Jul 17, 2016 10:40AM ET",Attack on Nice deals blow to France's crucial tourism industry,nan,"By Michel Rose and Tom BerginPARIS/NICE, France (Reuters) - The carnage on Nice's famed seaside boulevard as the summer season got into full swing has sent shockwaves through France's tourism industry, a vital sector for the economy of the world's most-visited country.With tourism accounting for 7-8 percent of the eurozone's No. 2 economy, last week's truck attack on the French Riviera deals a new blow to an industry that had yet to recover fully from the bloody assaults in Paris in January and November last year, which were also claimed by Islamic State.""France has been projecting very violent images to the outside world for 18 months now,"" Vanguelis Panayotis, managing director of the MKG tourism consultancy, told Reuters.""The impact on business is going to be large. It's tough, because France is just coming out of a successful Euro (soccer) tournament, and the feeling of insecurity had receded,"" he said, predicting a 30 percent decline in visitor numbers to France in the coming month.The blow will be harshest for Nice, France's second most-visited city after the capital. One of the first resorts to emerge in the 19th century, the city rakes in 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) annually from tourism.The seafront Promenade des Anglais, where 84 people were killed on Thursday night as they celebrated Bastille day, is named after the English aristocrats who helped make Nice a popular holiday spot.EMPTY CAFES, On Saturday afternoon, 36 hours after the 31-year old truck driver's rampage, cafe tables were empty, markets closed and deck chairs lay unused.Joanna Marat, owner of the Hotel Cronstadt, on a side-street leading off the Promenade said an Australian couple staying at the hotel had left early after the attack. ""They were scared,"" she said. Marat was pessimistic about the outlook for the rest of the summer. ""There will be far fewer tourists,"" she said, standing behind the wooden counter in the lobby of her hotel, with stucco ceilings, antique furniture and old carpets.""I was planning to take more people on to help in August but now I said to them that there will be no jobs,"" she added.Although Nice and the Riviera are likely to suffer this summer, the impact for the $2 trillion French economy is harder to gauge.Spain and Britain did not suffer lasting economic damage after attacks in Madrid in 2004 and in London a year later. It could be different for France, however, if the multiple attacks establish a perception that the country is inherently more dangerous.""The specificity of the Nice attack is that such a tragic event can now happen in any region and is no longer specific to Paris,"" Philippe Waechter, chief economist at asset manager Natixis, said in a briefing note. ""The impact on France's image will probably be key. Non-residents may come to see it as a risky country,"" he said, although he was not changing his outlook for French growth at this stage.Flagship airline Air France and  Accor  (PA:ACCP), Europe's biggest hotel chain, both reported a significant hit to their earnings from the Paris attacks, and their shares sank the day after the killings in Nice.MARGINAL ECONOMIC IMPACTThe effect on gross domestic product (GDP) of the Paris assaults was marginal, however, with the INSEE national statistics office estimating it at 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, mainly through lower consumer spending.It did not prevent France from posting the strongest growth in a year in the following quarter, with the government's 1.5 percent target for the whole year still within reach.""The consensus is that the impact of the Nice attacks on GDP will be more marginal than that of the November attacks,"" Christopher Dembik, economist at Saxo Banque told Reuters.""It will be smaller than the fallout from Brexit on the French economy,"" he said, seeing less than a 0.2 percent impact on the quarter.He said he did not expect tourists to shun France for long, in contrast to what has happened in north Africa following the Arab spring.""France has an advantage compared to other tourist destinations, there is no identical substitute,"" he said, referring to the country's mix of culture, sandy beaches, ski resorts and nightlife.In Nice, some businesses said their clients were increasingly resigned to the possibility that such attacks could happen in many Western countries.Wanda Pinarello, an agent at a local branch of the Orpi real estate chain, said a couple of American and Lebanese customers who were in the process of buying properties in the area were happy to continue with their purchases.""They feel concerned but they don't want to pull out. I think they're aware that it can happen anywhere,"" she said.($1 = 0.9065 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

139,"Jun 12, 2016 09:20PM ET",Chinese state-owned companies face greater scrutiny of EU deals after ruling,nan,"By Michelle PriceHONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese state-owned companies seeking to buy European assets are going to face greater regulatory scrutiny following a landmark European Commission decision on a recent deal.    In its review of a proposed joint venture between France’s EDF (PA:EDF) and state-owned China General Nuclear Power (CGN), the Commission - which has exclusive power over antitrust issues in the European Union – ruled that CGN was not independent from China’s central administrator for state-owned enterprises, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). As a result, it decided that it did have the power to decide whether the deal should be cleared.It meant that the Commission didn't only consider CGN's own revenue but the combined revenue of all Chinese energy state-owned enterprises when considering whether the deal came under its jurisdiction.     This approach automatically bumped CGN’s turnover above the minimum EU threshold for merger clearance, a warning shot for other Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) who may be considering buying assets in Europe and were not anticipating needing to get a regulatory green light.The Commission generally only reviews a merger if each party to it has more than 250 million euros ($281 million) in sales in the EU as well as combined global sales of more than 5 billion euros.CGN’s turnover, alone, didn’t cross that 250 million euro threshold, but the Chinese energy SOEs as a whole do breach that level.While the ruling was little noticed when the details were released in April, law firms working with Chinese companies and their targets have in the past few weeks issued warnings to their clients. They have told them the decision could force Chinese SOEs to file for EU merger clearance regardless of their size in Europe, creating an extra barrier, and at the very least delay proposed acquisitions by Chinese SOEs.POLITICAL CONCERNS    The development comes as the purchase of over $200 billion of foreign assets by Chinese companies in the past 18 months - many of which are SOEs - is triggering some political concerns in Europe and the United States.    Politicians in France and Germany have expressed concerns at the rapid advance of Chinese companies in Europe, with French President Francois Hollande balking at the prospect of city of Shanghai-controlled Jin Jiang gaining control of French hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP).       The CGN-EDF deal was approved by the Commission in March. It is the full analysis showing why it reviewed the transaction, which was published in April, that has made the waves.    The CGN case marks the first time the Commission has said publicly that Chinese government control is so pervasive that all SOEs in a sector should be treated as a single entity.     ""The CGN decision demonstrates the European Commission's appetite to look at deals involving Chinese SOEs,"" said Adrian Emch, a partner at Hogan Lovells in Beijing. ""This was the first time the European Commission had said yes, SASAC is effectively the parent company of a Chinese SOE in order to assert its jurisdiction to review the deal - previously the European Commission had left that question open.""     CGN did not respond to requests for comment, but said in its submission to the Commission that it operated independently. SASAC did not respond to requests for comment.     In a statement, the Commission said it tests for state-owned company independence regardless of the nationality of the entity, adding: “The Commission does not lay down rules in its cases, but makes findings based on the facts of the case at that specific point in time.”        Some European and U.S. policymakers have raised concerns that China's foreign takeover drive poses national security risks, prompting the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to scrutinize and in some cases block more deals.    At least 50 percent of Chinese foreign purchases over the past 18 months involved companies that were either fully or partly state-owned, according to Thomson Reuters data.         COMPELLING EVIDENCE     One EU source with knowledge of the matter said the Commission's decision did not set a new precedent but offered greater clarity on the regulator's thinking on Chinese state control. ""In all likelihood, this will be the basis for such cases going forward,"" said the source.    Lawyers said they were now advising Chinese SOE clients to speak with the Commission even if they believe the deal does not meet the EU merger thresholds, especially if they operate in China's energy sector. Failure to file for approval of a deal can lead to sizable fines. In 2014, for example, the regulator fined Norwegian salmon farmer Marine Harvest 20 million euros for merging with a rival without first having sought EU clearance    ""This certainly sets down a marker for future cases,"" said Nicholas French, co-head of the China antitrust practice at law firm Freshfields. ""If the SOE is in the energy sector, they would have to show some concrete evidence to the rebut the commission’s analysis.""     For companies that do file for merger review, the clearance process is likely to become more onerous as Brussels seeks extra information on the control structure of an SOE that is buying assets in Europe. This may be hard to produce due to China's strict state secrecy laws.     The tougher approach could have implications for state-owned ChemChina's $43 billion bid for Swiss agriculture company  Syngenta  (S:SYNN) - China's biggest foreign purchase ever - with lawyers saying the clearance process may take longer and require additional disclosures.    ""The level of scrutiny is likely to intensify. This will make filing in EU merger cases trickier if you need detailed corporate information on a large number of SOEs,"" said Alan Riley, professor at the UK-based Institute for Statecraft, a think tank.    ""If you think about ChemChina, they may well face a huge demand for information from the commission in relation to at least other bio and agriculture SOEs and then they would have to hope there are not many overlaps.""    ChemChina did not respond to requests for comment.($1 = 0.8887 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

156,"Mar 22, 2016 08:57AM ET","Stocks slide, safe-haven assets rise after Brussels attacks",nan,"By Jamie McGeeverLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell and safe-haven gold and government bonds rose on Tuesday after attacks on the airport and a rush-hour metro train in Brussels that triggered security alerts across western Europe.Travel sector stocks including airlines and hotels fell the most, pulling the broader indices down from multi-week highs, although stocks had clawed back some of their losses by midday and bonds and gold eased back from their earlier highs. U.S. futures pointed to a fall of almost half of one percent at the open on Wall Street (ESc1). ""It is all to do with the events in Brussels ... but the reaction is muted, which also shows that after all the terrorist attacks we have seen, markets have learned to live with these kind of things,"" said Rabobank euro zone economist Emile Cardon. At least 26 people were killed and many injured in the twin attacks on the Belgian capital, which took place four days after the arrest there of a suspected participant in November's militant attacks in Paris. At 1220 GMT the FTSEuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 1 percent at 1,326 points (FTEU3). Germany's DAX was down 0.5 percent (GDAXI) and Belgian stocks were down 0.4 percent . These indices had earlier been down as much as 2 percent.The STOXX Europe 600 Travel & Leisure index (SXTP) was the top sectoral faller, down 2 percent. Shares in major European airlines like Ryanair (I:RYA) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) were down as much as 4.5 percent (DE:LHAG), and hotel company  Accor  (PA:ACCP) was down 3.5 percent.The federal prosecutor said at least one of two explosions at Brussels airport was likely to have been caused by a suicide bomber and the attacks brought some cross-border transport to a halt, including trains from London to Brussels.Gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,255 an ounce , having been up around twice that earlier. The yield on benchmark German government bonds fell to a two-week low of 0.18 percent before edging back to 0.21 percent . U.S. Treasury yields fell 2 basis points across the curve (US2YT=RR) (US10YT=RR).In currency markets the Japanese yen, regarded by investors as a shelter from turbulence, rose across the board, notably against the euro. The euro was last down 0.5 percent at 125.25 yen (EURJPY=) and the dollar was down 0.3 percent at 111.60 yen .The single currency fell a fifth of a percent against the dollar to $1.1220 .ATTACKS OVERSHADOW DATALiquidity had already been starting to dry up ahead of the Easter holiday and investors were beginning to think about cashing in on a steep rally in stocks over the last few weeks.""Coming up to the Easter holiday, people are going to be very reluctant to put more money into these (stock) markets. If anything, they will be more likely to take money out,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in London.""Anything like the events we're seeing in Brussels this morning is going to weigh on risk sentiment and risk appetite.""Investors paid little attention to data showing a slight pick up in German business morale and euro zone business activity in March.Earlier, Asian stocks seesawed as hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials clouded the monetary policy outlook less than a week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen had set out a more cautious path to interest rate increases this year.The dollar got a mild boost from the suggestion that interest rate hikes could come sooner rather than later.Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) added 1.9 percent, closing at a one-week high, after markets in Tokyo reopened after a public holiday on Monday. A weaker yen overnight had given a tailwind to local shares.Elsewhere, sterling was one of the biggest losers among the major currencies after ratings agency Moody's said Britain's credit rating will be put under pressure by a marked slowdown in fiscal consolidation unveiled in last week's budget.The warning came amid concerns about Prime Minister David Cameron's ability to keep Britain in the European Union after leading 'Out' campaigner Iain Duncan Smith resigned from the cabinet late on Friday.Sterling was last down 0.6 percent at $1.4281 , more than two cents off Friday's one-month high of $1.4514.In oil markets, U.S. crude futures fell 1 percent to $41.11 a barrel (CLc1) and Brent crude (LCOc1) shed 0.75 percent to $41.23.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

157,"Mar 21, 2016 06:20AM ET",Priceline strikes deal with Cuba to let Americans book hotels,nan,"By Mimi Dwyer(Reuters) - Priceline Group has agreed with Cuba to make Cuban hotel rooms available to U.S. customers via subsidiary Booking.com, becoming the first U.S. online travel agency to strike a deal with the island state, a Booking.com executive said.The deal comes on the first full day of U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to Cuba and on the heels of U.S. hotel firm Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide's agreement with the Cuban government to manage and market three Havana hotel properties.Booking.com would allow Americans traveling to Cuba to reserve and pay for rooms at a number of Cuban and foreign hotels, starting in several weeks, Booking.com Americas Managing Director Todd Dunlap told Reuters in an interview.Americans previously had to reserve Cuban hotels principally through travel agencies or tour groups. Booking.com would operate initially in Cuba only in Havana, Dunlap said. It planned to work with foreign firms already on the island, including France's  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and Spanish chains Meliá Hotels International SA and NH Hotel Group SA. It was also working on deals with state-run Cuban chains.The only major American lodging booking service currently available to Americans traveling to Cuba is online home-rental marketplace Airbnb, which began operating in Cuba in April last year. Priceline began working on bringing its services to Cuba shortly after President Obama announced the restoration of diplomatic ties with the island on December 17, 2014. Cuban tourism infrastructure has seen significant strain since U.S. relations to the island warmed. Prices have surged for the island’s 63,000 hotel rooms, many of which are booked solid months in advance. Cuba received a record 3.52 million visitors last year, up 17.4 percent from 2014. American visits rose 77 percent to 161,000, not counting hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans.Tourism to Cuba is still technically illegal under the U.S. trade embargo. U.S. travelers to the island are required to do so under ""general licenses"" which permit travel for religion, family visits, cultural exchange, sports, and other purposes approved by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control. On March 17 OFAC said it would allow individual people-to-people educational exchanges, as well.Booking.com would ask travelers to certify that they fit one of the Treasury's approved travel categories, but would not verify their status, Dunlap said. The company would keep travelers’ information on file for five years after their travel, should officials choose to check.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Following the changes, 38% of the new board will be under the age of 60 while the median age of its board members will decrease to 61.Last fall, the company imposed 15-year term limits for its board members and ruled that directors could not seek renomination after turning 75. Also in the report, GE disclosed that Immelt received compensation of $23.377 million last year when adjusted for certain items, up 14% when pension changes were excluded. Immelt's base salary increased slightly to $3.8 million.""I am really proud of the GE team. They are talented, global and driven; they, too, have been tested. The GE team will never be out- worked, and we don’t give up,"" Immelt said in the report. ""Last year, we won a $2.5 billion order to upgrade the India rail system. This was a project we worked on for 20 years. It required global teams, week- end travel and all the strength of the GE Store.""Shares in GE closed at 30.27, down 0.06 or 0.18% on the session."

161,"Dec 02, 2015 12:00PM ET",Tourists try to identify safer destinations after attacks,nan,"By Victoria BryanBERLIN (Reuters) - Visitor numbers to Paris should recover quickly after last month's deadly attacks but destinations such as Tunisia and Egypt may experience a more permanent drop in demand as tourists shift to places they view as safer, industry experts say.The attacks in Paris on Nov 13, in which 130 people were killed, followed a week later by a shooting at a luxury hotel in Mali, have dampened travel demand and hit travel stocks, from airlines to hotels.But with travel demand flourishing this year thanks to low oil prices and improving economies, people are not likely to start cancelling travel plans outright.The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) predicts the sector will grow 3.5 percent this year, or 1 percent more than the global economy.""Our data has shown us that people do not stop traveling but rather change destinations,"" WTTC President and CEO David Scowsill told Reuters.He said a big destination like Paris should suffer only a blip in figures before recovering quickly.France's AccorHotels has felt a ""real economic impact"" from the attacks in Paris, with fewer last-minute bookings for the second half of December,  Accor  (PA:ACCP) Chief Executive Sebastien Bazin told BFM Business TV on Wednesday, adding that the effect will probably last three or four months.Among airlines, Scandinavian carrier SAS said it had seen a drop in travel to Paris and Brussels but that traffic was already returning to normal, comments echoed by Ryanair.Roy Scheerder, commercial director of Air France-KLM's low cost arm Transavia said that Paris should recover quickly because people weren't only going there on holiday but also for business and to visit friends. Others note that tourists quickly returned to London and Madrid after bombings in the previous decade.SEEKING SAFER SHORESThe ITB World Travel Trends report, compiled just before the Paris attacks, noted there was already a trend towards places viewed as ""safer"".Once popular destinations such as Egypt and Tunisia, which have this year suffered a series of attacks including the suspected bombing of a Russian airplane and a shooting at a beach resort, may not bounce back quickly, Martin Buck, who organizes the annual ITB travel fair, told Reuters.""If one bomb after another explodes, then tourists will vote with their feet and simply stay away,"" Buck told Reuters.Turkey is also among those tourist destinations suffering from a downturn in demand from western European travelers due to security worries.An influx of tourists from Russia had been compensating but analysts say that looks set to dry up amid tensions after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane. Russia on Tuesday approved sanctions against Turkey including a ban on charter flights.British tour operator Thomas Cook said last week the events in Egypt and Tunisia had resulted in more bookings to the Canary Islands, and for long-haul trips to North America, Mexico and Cape Verde. On a festive note, another destination that could benefit from its tranquillity is Lapland, according to Finnish airport operator Finavia. It expects its airports in northern Finland to be busier this Christmas after seeing an increase in the number of charter flights.""The popularity of Lapland as a safe destination may also be increased by the recent world events,"" said Finavia director Joni Sundelin.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

164,"Nov 12, 2015 05:00AM ET","Airbnb says to help cities tax homesharers, ease home shortages",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbnb has moved to head off conflict with tax-raising authorities, city councils and hoteliers worldwide as a two-day promotional event in Paris, the online home-sharing group's biggest market, gets under way.In a statement on its web site dated Nov. 11, the company whose runaway success has turned the travel and hotel industry upside down announced plans to co-operate with cities to make sure homeowners pay their fair share of hotel and tourist taxes.Founded only in 2008 but measured earlier this year as the third-most valuable venture capital-backed group in the world at over $25 billion, Airbnb also said it would help prevent its service from causing housing shortages by ""ensuring hosts agree to a policy of listing only permanent homes on a short-term basis"".The announcement comes just a week after the company unveiled plans to form 100 home-sharing clubs in cities across the United States during 2016, a move aimed at giving advocates of home- and room-sharing companies a stronger voice to head off regulatory crackdowns.The website is expected to have about 80 million nights booked this year, double the number in 2014, investors familiar with the company's performance told Reuters in September.The company says it has more than 1.5 million listings - homes, apartments, guest rooms, even houseboats and tree houses - in more than 34,000 cities in 190 countries.San Francisco, California-based Airbnb says its biggest destination is Paris, with more than 40,000 listings there. It already said in August it would begin collecting and remitting tourist taxes from guests on behalf of rental apartments in the French capital.In many cities it is seen as a competitor to independent hoteliers and to international hotel groups like InterContinental (L:IHG), Marriott (O:MAR) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

177,"Jun 08, 2015 09:15AM ET","Cuba Inc. open to foreign capitalists, but within limits",nan,"By Daniel Trotta and Marc FrankHAVANA (Reuters) - Communist Cuba's newfound interest in foreign capital has its limits, as Philippe Pouletty found out.A French doctor, venture capitalist and founder of biotech company Abivax, Pouletty is working with Cuba's Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology to develop a therapeutic vaccine to treat chronic Hepatitis B that could be on the Asian market in two years and in Europe after that.But when he pitched the idea of floating a company on the pan-European stock market Euronext with the Cuban state as a shareholder, that was clearly too much, too soon.""I told him in a half serious, half joking mode, that I had a capitalist proposal,"" Pouletty said of his conversation with Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro's eldest son, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, a science advisor to the government.""His response after more than 30 seconds was 'That's indeed very intriguing, but if you want us to reach an agreement quickly, that's not the fastest route. It's a few years too soon.'""Instead, Abivax agreed to buy vaccines at a predetermined price and pay royalties to Cuba when the product is on the market.Pouletty's story offers a peek into the mindset of Cuba Inc.Convinced their country needs capital, Cuba's leaders are welcoming businesses under a foreign investment law passed a year ago, but they want tight control over the pace of change. U.S. business interest in Cuba has exploded since December, when President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced they would restore diplomatic relations after decades of hostility.""In the morning on Dec. 17, Cuba was still a word spoken in U.S. business circles with hushed tones. By the afternoon, half of corporate America was rambling around forming a Cuba team,"" said Mark Entwistle, a former Canadian ambassador to Cuba and now a partner at Toronto-based merchant bank Acasta Capital who advises companies interested in Cuba.Among those joining a recent New York state delegation to Cuba were executives from JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU),  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and MasterCard Inc (N:MA).Most U.S. companies are still blocked by the 53-year-old trade embargo, although Obama has relaxed it for some imports, travel and telecommunications. That has allowed for minor deals such as Netflix (O:NFLX) streaming movies in Cuba and Airbnb listing Cuban rental properties online.If Obama can convince Congress to end the embargo, U.S. firms would be free to do business here, though they would still face major obstacles, including a multi-layered bureaucracy, an unpredictable legal system and highly regimented labor market. Many foreign companies have thrived over the years. They run hotels, build ships, refine oil and pack meat. Some have a share in bottled water, beer, soda, rum and cigar businesses.Canada's Sherritt International (TO:S) is perhaps the most vested. It has been here since 1992 and generated 73 percent of its C$1.136 billion revenues in 2014 from Cuba-related businesses. Sherritt mines nickel in Cuba and refines it in Canada in a 50-50 joint venture with Cuba's government. It also produces 20,000 barrels per day of oil that it sells to Cuba and has a one-third interest in an electricity joint venture.Even in a business subject to price swings, Sherritt says it has always made a profit or at least broken even with Cuban nickel.""We would tell others that Cuba's a great place to do business,"" said Sean McCaughan, vice-president for investor relations, even though the embargo means top Sherritt executives are banned from setting foot in the United States and the company is cut off from U.S. capital markets or shipping through U.S. territory.Other companies have failed miserably in Cuba and were forced to leave or had their executives imprisoned and their assets confiscated. Petty bribery can land people in jail.And at least one billionaire real estate mogul came away from a recent trip to Cuba unimpressed.""I didn't find there were lot of great opportunities. It was like going back in time,"" Stephen Ross, chairman and founder of The Related Companies, told CNBC television. ""You need a government that really wants change, that really wants business, and really wants to see growth, and you don't really have any of that feeling at all.""LISTEN AND ADAPTThose who have been successful have simple advice: be flexible and listen to Cuban officials, because they will tell you exactly what they want. ""There are foreigners who come here with an attitude of superiority. In other words, 'We're going to show the Cubans.' In general, those are the ones who fail spectacularly,"" said Alexandre Carpenter, co-president of cigarette-maker Brascuba, a joint venture between Cuba and the Brazilian subsidiary of  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS).There is no escaping the state's central planning. Foreign firms in joint ventures must order raw materials a year ahead of time. Property is leased from the state, it is not up for sale.Cuba regularly draws up a portfolio of projects it wants foreigners to help with. The latest one, issued in November, outlines 246, most of them joint ventures, that need investments totaling $8.7 billion. In one of the most attractive sectors, tourism, the portfolio lists five hotel construction projects; two golf resort developments; and contracts to manage 33 existing hotels.But the government rarely tries to force its Marxist ideology on foreign partners as long as Cubans do not get rich.""To the contrary. They demand that the business grow and generate more profits every year,"" Carpenter said.One of the largest foreign firms in Cuba is Brazil's Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], which built a $900 million port at Mariel, the centerpiece of an economic development zone designed to attract capitalist ventures with a more liberal import-export regime.Odebrecht wants to build a plastics factory there and it also has deals to expand Havana's international airport, operate a sugar refinery, and build two hotels.Mauro Hueb, head of Odebrecht's operations here, says the advantages of operating in Cuba include an educated, low-cost workforce and low logistical costs, and that to take advantage a company needs to learn and respect local customs.""You have to have the capacity to adapt,"" said Hueb. ""Here in Cuba, we consider ourselves a Cuban company.""Other successful ventures, some with U.S. stockholders, include Sherritt and French builder  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY). Swiss conglomerate Nestle (VX:NESN) has a bottled water and soft drinks business. Spanish hoteliers Melia Hotels International (MC:MEL), Iberostar and NH (MC:NHH) have established footholds in tourism and global beer giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) brews Cuban suds.SOVIET COLLAPSECuba's communist government first opened to international firms in the 1990s amid economic crisis caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main ally and benefactor.Results have been mixed. Cuba says around 60 percent of foreign investment projects begun since the 1990s have had to close. Sometimes it kicks foreign partners out, saying they failed to live up to their side of the deal. Sometimes the companies leave on their own. The corporate landscape is still sparse, with only around 100 direct investment projects and a similar number of deals in which foreigners manage a Cuban company without an equity stake.While U.S. firms hope the normalization of relations and economic reforms under way in Cuba will improve the investment climate, experts say change will be gradual. For years, foreigners' biggest complaints have been the lack of control over labor, the uncertain legal environment, and the multiple layers of bureaucracy to get a project approved.""Forget owning a piece of the rock. The most you can hope for is a 50-50 venture with a state-run partner,"" a European economic attaché said. ""And that will be the exception. The rule remains a minority interest.""British-Dutch consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) became the first major corporation to enter Cuba after the fall of Soviet communism.Desperate for hard currency and consumer products, Cuba agreed to a 50-50 venture on a factory complex but when the 15-year deal came up for renewal it insisted on majority ownership. Unilever left the country although it is now in discussions on returning, several sources familiar with the talks said.When business goes wrong, it can be dire.An extreme example is that of Canadian businessman Cy Tokmakjian, who served three years in jail for bribery and other charges before being freed in February.Tokmakjian had done business in Cuba for 20 years, then suddenly was arrested in 2011 and his company shuttered as prosecutors accused him of wooing officials and their families with gifts. His company called it a ""travesty of justice"".Stephen Purvis, the former development director of British investment fund Coral Capital who built hotels and planned a golf course in Cuba, was arrested in 2011 in a crackdown on corruption.Purvis said he was falsely accused by a rival, interrogated for five days, and denied a lawyer for a month. He was eventually deported after being convicted on a minor charge. ""There is a virtual 100 percent conviction rate,"" Purvis said. ""Once detained you will be charged and found guilty. It's just a question of what for.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

178,"Jun 03, 2015 01:45AM ET",Accor steps up digital push and changes name,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Accor  (PARIS:ACCP) said on Wednesday it would spend 22 million euros ($25 million) to enable independent hoteliers to offer their rooms on its booking website as it seeks ways to fight back against online travel agents such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Booking.com.The world's fourth-largest hotel group, which is undergoing a reorganization initiated by Chief Executive Sebastien Bazin, is also changing its name to ""AccorHotels"", in line with its website, as part of the strategy.""The transformation of our distribution platform into an open market place is a major step for the group and reflects a new approach,"" Bazin said in a statement.Accor, which competes with InterContinental, Marriott and Starwood, said the investment comes on top of the 225 million euros it has announced it would spend to beef up its digital business between 2014 and 2018.Accor has 3,700 hotels worldwide ranging from the luxury Sofitel to the budget Ibis brands. Its goal is to triple its online offering to 10,000 hotels by 2018 via this new service to be launched in July.Europe's largest hotel group faces challenges ranging from rising competition from online travel agents (OTAs), who are hitting the margins of traditional hoteliers and earning commission fees that can reach 20 percent of the cost of a room, to the growing popularity of online home-sharing site Airbnb.Accor makes a third of it sales online, evenly split between bookings made via its own website and bookings made via OTAs.Accor last year bought French start-up Wipolo, a travel software company that offers mobile and web itinerary management services.In April, it bought FASTBOOKING, a digital services provider for the hotel industry, whose expertise Accor will use to offer online booking services to selected independent hoteliers.Accor will charge a commission that Vivek Badrinah, deputy CEO in charge of digital, told Reuters would be below that charged by rival OTAs.Bazin, a private equity specialist who took over in August 2013, has split Accor into two divisions, HotelServices and HotelInvest, to separate its hotel services business from its property activities to boost profitability.The restructuring has started to pay off, with Accor posting a record profit last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

181,"May 11, 2015 08:27AM ET",Hollande becomes first French president to visit Cuba,nan,"By Elizabeth PineauHAVANA (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande began the first visit by a French head of state to Cuba by noting it was ""special"" in light of Washington's opening to the Communist-ruled island.Hollande, who arrived on Sunday night, was scheduled to meet Cuban President Raul Castro, deliver a speech and participate in an economic forum in Cuba as part of his swing through the Caribbean.He also promised to talk about human rights in Cuba, always a sensitive subject in a country that represses freedom of assembly and controls the media.The French president is traveling with executives from French companies including Air France (PA:AIRF), hotelier  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and distiller  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP). Each of those three already operates in Cuba but they want to expand their business here with an eye to the potential end of the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba.Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama announced in December they would restore diplomatic ties and seek to normalize overall relations after more than 50 years of confrontation, and the two leaders followed that with a meeting at a regional summit in Panama in April.""I come here to Cuba with great emotion because it is the first time that a president of the French Republic comes to Cuba,"" Hollande told reporters upon arriving.""And today it takes a special meaning after what President Obama finally decided,"" he said. France has always maintained relations with Cuba and is one the largest holders of Cuban debt, but the renewed opening with the United States is expected to have ramifications throughout the West. European companies that have long done business in Cuba could have a new competitor if the United States ends the embargo. Obama, a Democrat, has asked Congress to remove it but has encountered resistance from Republicans, who control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.Hollande will also meet Cuba's Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Ortega, and the Cuban chapter of the Alliance Francaise, which promotes French culture abroad.He could also visit retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro, 88, whose 1959 revolution is generally well regarded in France, especially within Hollande's Socialist Party.Fidel Castro stepped down provisionally in 2006 and definitively in 2008, handing power to his younger brother Raul.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

183,"Apr 21, 2015 09:51AM ET","France, Sweden, Italy accept booking.com antitrust proposals",nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - France's competition watchdog said on Tuesday that in coordination with the European Commission, and Swedish and Italian regulators it had accepted sweetened commitments from online travel agent booking.com to address competition concerns.These will go into effect in France, Italy and Sweden from July 1 for five years and will allow hotels to offer lower prices on other booking websites, the French regulator said.Hotels will also be able to make offers directly to their customers by means other than the Internet and allot fewer rooms to booking.com than they keep for themselves.In December, booking.com, owned by U.S-based Priceline Group, proposed scrapping the so-called pricing parity clause in its contracts preventing hotels from giving discounts to its rivals.Booking.com came up with improved commitments following third-party feedback and market tests conducted by the regulators.The pledges will be enforceable with the potential of fines of up to 5 percent of the company's global revenue of around $7 billion, the French competition authority said.Booking.com said it was considering implementing the new commitments across Europe and was working with other national regulators towards that goal.The European Commission, the anti-trust enforcer in the 28-country European Union, has been coordinating national probes in France, Italy and Sweden but has said it was not conducting its own investigation.The regulator's probe in France was prompted by a consortium of hotelier federations.Hoteliers have been trying to crack down on rate parity clauses in contracts with online travel agents (OTA) such as booking.com, arguing they remove flexibility in pricing.Traditional hoteliers face rising competition from OTAs, which are hitting their margins and earning commission fees that can reach 20 percent of the cost of a room. Booking.com said its commissions are between 15 and 17 percent.The French UMIH hotel federation welcomed booking.com's commitments as ""a first step"" but remained vigilant as other OTAs such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and HRS were not bound by these proposals. Accor  (PARIS:ACCP), Europe's largest hotel group, approached the French regulator in February, saying booking.com was abusing its dominant position.It said on Tuesday that booking.com's commitments would allow hotels to ""reward their loyal clients and regain control over pricing policies"" but said Expedia and others must also comply to bring true competition among OTAs and lower their fees.Expedia said it was working with the authorities to find a solution.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

187,"Mar 19, 2015 08:08PM ET",Islamic State says it killed tourists in Tunisia,nan,"By Tarek AmaraTUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia said it would deploy the army to major cities and arrested nine people on Thursday after 20 foreign tourists were shot dead in an attack on a museum which Islamic State militants called ""the first drop of the rain"".Japanese, Italian, Spanish and British visitors, as well as three Tunisians, were among the victims of the attack, which took place in the heavily guarded parliament compound of a country largely spared the violent aftermath of the Arab Spring.Officials did not confirm the militants' claim of responsibility, but said they had identified two gunmen shot dead by security forces after the shootings, which targeted tourist buses visiting the Bardo museum on Wednesday.The two gunmen were trained at a jihadist camp in Libya, the Tunisian government said. Interior ministry official Rafik Chelli said the two men had been recruited at mosques in Tunisia and traveled to Libya in September.Cruise liner MSC Cruises said 12 of its passengers, including Colombians, French and a Belgian, were among the dead, while a Spanish couple was found alive on Thursday after hiding all night in the museum.The assault -- the most deadly attack involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing in Djerba -- came at a fragile moment for a country just emerging to full democracy after its pioneering popular uprising four years ago.It is heavily reliant on foreign tourists to its beach resorts and desert treks, and the government was about to tackle politically sensitive reforms aimed at boosting economic growth.Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria and is active in Tunisia's chaotic neighbor Libya, praised the two attackers in an audio recording as ""knights of the Islamic State"" armed with machineguns and bombs.Tunisians make up the one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters in Syria, Iraq and Libya, and their homeland's young democracy, which has cracked down on militancy at home, was a clear potential target.""We tell the apostates who sit on the chest of Muslim Tunisia: Wait for the glad tidings of what will harm you, o impure ones, for what you have seen today is the first drop of the rain,"" the Islamic State audio said in Arabic.The two dead militants were identified as Tunisians, Hatem al-Khashnawi and Yassin al-Abidi. Two local newspapers reported Abidi had spent time in Iraq and Libya, but officials did not confirm that. Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid said Abidi had been under surveillance but ""not for anything very special"".""We have identified them, it is indeed these two terrorists,"" the premier told French RTL radio earlier on Thursday. ""Their affiliation is not clear at the moment.""ARMY TO GUARD LARGE CITIESTunisian authorities said they had arrested four people directly linked to the attack and five others with indirect ties. A security source said two family members of one of the gunmen were among those held. ""We arrested the father and the sister of the terrorist Hatem Al-Khashnawi in the their home in Sbiba City,"" the source told Reuters.The president's office said the army would be deployed to the streets as part of increased security following the attack. ""After a meeting with the armed forces, the president has decided large cities will be secured by the army,"" it said.The number of foreign tourists killed rose to 20 from 17, the health minister said. London said a British woman was among the dead in shootings it called cowardly and despicable.Spain said the woman in the couple who emerged from the museum alive on Thursday was pregnant. ""They were hidden this whole time, without daring to make a phone call, probably because they were anxious and scared, as you can imagine,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said.Four years after a popular revolt toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has completed its transition to democracy with free elections, a new constitution and compromise politics between secular and Islamist parties.But security forces are battling Islamist militants including Ansar al Sharia, which is listed as a terrorist group by Washington, and Okba Ibn Nafaa, a brigade of al Qaeda-affiliated fighters operating in the Chaambi mountains along the Algerian border.The fight against these militants may have played a role in prompting the museum attack, said Geoff Porter, security analyst at North Africa Risk Consulting. ""Increasing pressure on terrorist activities in the Djebel Chaambi region may have squeezed the balloon, with terrorists seeking softer targets with more symbolic impact,"" he said.FOREIGN FIGHTERSA former commander in Tunisia's Ansar al Sharia was killed last week fighting for Islamic State in Libyan city of Sirte. He had been running training and logistics, security sources said. The United States said it could not confirm Islamic State was responsible but that the attacks were consistent with the group's actions. It offered Tunisia counter terrorism help. An earlier Islamic State news broadcast distributed online also mentioned the Tunis attack, describing the perpetrators as Mujahideen and asking God to receive them as martyrs in paradise. But it did not claim direct responsibility.A social media account linked to Okba Ibn Nafaa brigade also provided details of the attack, without a direct claim of responsibility. But that group has also issued conflicting statements in the past about its position on Islamic State.The Bardo attack appeared squarely aimed at Tunisia's economy, with tourism accounting for seven percent of gross domestic product. The government estimates that loses this season for the tourism sector would reach $700 million.Two German tour operators said they were cancelling trips from Tunisia's beach resorts to Tunis for a few days and  Accor  (PARIS:ACCP), Europe's largest hotel group, said it had tightened security at its two hotels in Tunisia. Italy's Costa Cruises, a unit of  Carnival Corp  (NYSE:CCL) CCL.N, canceled stops in Tunisia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

188,"Mar 18, 2015 05:09PM ET","Gunmen storm Tunisian museum, kill 17 foreign tourists",nan,"By Tarek Amara and Mohamed ArgoubiTUNIS (Reuters) - Gunmen wearing military uniforms stormed Tunisia's national museum on Wednesday, killing 17 foreign tourists and two Tunisians in one of the worst militant attacks in a country that had largely escaped the region's ""Arab Spring"" turmoil.Five Japanese as well as visitors from Italy, Germany, Poland and Spain were among the dead in the noon assault on Bardo museum inside the heavily guarded parliament compound in central Tunis, Prime Minister Habib Essid said.""They just started opening fire on the tourists as they were getting out of the buses ... I couldn't see anything except blood and the dead,"" the driver of a tourist coach told journalists at the scene.Scores of visitors fled into the museum and the militants - who authorities did not immediately identify - took hostages inside, officials said. Security forces entered around two hours later, killed two militants and freed the captives, a government spokesman said. A police officer died in the operation.The attack on such a high-profile target is a blow for the small North African country that relies heavily on European tourism and has mostly avoided major militant violence since its 2011 uprising to oust autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.Several Islamist militant groups have emerged in Tunisia since the uprising, and authorities estimate about 3,000 Tunisians have also joined fighters in Iraq and Syria -- raising fears they could return and mount attacks at home.""All Tunisians should be united after this attack which was aimed at destroying the Tunisian economy,"" Prime Minister Essid declared in a national address. The local stock exchange dropped nearly 2.5 percent and two German tour operators said they were cancelling trips from Tunisia's beach resorts to Tunis for a few days. Accor  (PARIS:ACCP), Europe's largest hotel group, said it had tightened security at its two hotels in Tunisia.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington condemned the attack and continued ""to support the Tunisian government's efforts to advance a secure, prosperous, and democratic Tunisia.""Television footage showed dozens of people, including elderly foreigners and one man carrying a child, running for shelter in the museum compound, covered by security forces aiming rifles into the air.State television said 17 tourists were killed. Among the dead were three Italians, two Colombians and two Spaniards, their country's governments said. Tunisian officials said 24 foreign tourists were wounded.The museum is known for its collection of ancient Tunisian artifacts and mosaics and other treasures from classical Rome and Greece. There were no immediate reports that the attackers had copied Islamic State militants in Iraq by targeting exhibits seen by hardliners as idolatrous.The museum's white-walled halls set in the parliament compound are one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Tunisian capital.Shocked but defiant, hundreds of Tunisians later gathered in the streets of downtown Tunis waving the country's red and white crescent flag, and chanting against terrorism.""I pass this message to Tunisians, that democracy will win and it will survive,"" President Beji Caid Essebsi said in a television statement. ""We will find more ways and equipment for the army to wipe out these barbarous groups for good.""A MODEL OF COMPROMISETunisia's uprising inspired ""Arab Spring"" revolts in neighboring Libya and in Egypt, Syria and Yemen. But its adoption of a new constitution and staging of largely peaceful elections had won widespread praise and stood in stark contrast to the chaos that has plagued those countries.After a crisis between secular leaders and the Islamist party which won the country's first election, Tunisia has emerged as a model of compromise politics and transition to democracy for the region.But security forces have clashed with some Islamist militants, including Ansar al-Sharia which is listed as a terrorist group by Washington, mostly in remote areas near the border with Algeria.Affiliates of Islamic State militants fighting in Iraq and Syria have also been gaining ground in North Africa, especially in the chaotic environment of Tunisia's neighbor Libya, where two rival governments are battling for control.A senior Tunisian militant was killed while fighting for Islamic State in the Libyan city of Sirte over the past week. Security sources said he had been operating training camps and logistics.Wednesday's assault was the worst attack involving foreigners in Tunisia since an al Qaeda suicide bombing on a synagogue killed 21 people on the tourist island of Djerba in 2002.A militant blew himself up at the Tunisian beach resort of Sousse in late 2013 but no one else was killed or wounded.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

By Joanne Frearson LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - European shares pushed ahead on
Thursday with the support of forecast-beating earnings from U.S.
bellwether General Electric and Finnish phone maker Nokia, with
technicals indicating an upward trend. By 1129 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 0.6 percent at 1,144.47 points and moved above its
50-day moving average. Volume was 59.8 percent of its 90-day average ahead of the
Easter break. Investor sentiment improved after U.S. conglomerate General
Electric's quarterly results beat expectations, joining a slew
of forecast-beating numbers in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Of the 100 S&P 500 companies that have reported
first-quarter earnings so far, 78 percent of them have either
beaten or met market expectations, with the remainder below
forecasts, data from Thomson Reuters StarMine showed. ""We still got some company reporting to come and I think the
market is going to be quite driven by that,"" Colin McLean,
managing director at the 650 million pound ($1.07 billion)
Scottish Value Management in Edinburgh, said. ""If there are decent updates from any of the industrials
including the United States this would encourage Europe."" The technology sector extended its sharp gains from the
previous session, with Nokia rising 3 percent after it beat
expectatations for January-March. ""Nokia was fairly solid and the general feel as we go into
the long weekend in Europe is of a positive note,"" Matt Brown,
trader at Catalyst Markets said. ""General Electric beat expectations and it is another reason
for investors to come in and buy stocks."" Earnings news helped boost chemical makers, with Dutch
chemicals AkzoNobel rising 4.3 percent after first-quarter sales
topped forecasts. Construction stocks were buoyed by bullish broker notes.
Irish building materials group CRH gained 4.2 percent after
Goldman Sachs raised it to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and JPMorgan

the world's biggest cement maker to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".  GREEK BANKS RECOVER Greek banks recovered, up 1.7 percent following a 4.6
percent drop in the previous session when traders cited market
talk that a debt restructuring could be imminent. Goldman Sachs said it expected a Greek debt restructuring
would lead to a hit of up to 41 billion euros in European bank
capital, with Greek banks suffering a hit of ""8-25 billion euros
or 26-80 percent of total Greek bank capital."" Dutch telecoms firm KPN dropped 6.7 percent after it scaled
back its 2011 profit forecast. Elsewhere, Europe's largest hotel group Accor lost 2.4

suffers from lower spending by travellers, its chief executive

interview. ""We are just calculating the 2010 investment budget
and it will surely be lower."" On Thursday the company, a unit of France's Accor cut its
2009 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation) target by a fifth to 180 million zlotys, as
falling sales in the first three quarters weighed. ""The beginning of this month does not signal a change in the
trend, which started in the second half of 2008,"" Savoye said
when asked about sales. ""Usually October is also one of the good hotel months, but
now the occupancy rate in the business segment remains lower
than expected. Additionally, in line with the sector's
seasonality, the number of leisure clients drops after the
summer."" The tourist industry has been hit hard by the global
financial crisis, as both Polish and foreign travellers cut back
on trips. The deterioration in market conditions led Orbis, which
operates 64 hotels in Poland, to recommend no dividend payout
from 2008 profit for the first time in seven years. The group
also plans to scrap investments and cut costs.

hotel operator, reported a 2.6 percent fall in underlying half
year sales, hit by slower trade at its budget Premier Inn chain,
but said it was confident on the full year. Whitbread on Monday said total sales at Premier Inn, which
contributes three-quarters of its profits, were flat in the 24
weeks to Aug. 13, with like-for-like sales down 7.7 percent and
revenue per available room (RevPAR) down 9.4 percent. However, Whitbread's pub restaurants division, which
includes the Beefeater and Brewers' Fayre chains, and its Costa
Coffee business delivered strong growth, making the group
bullish on its full-year prospects. ""The range is between 180 million pounds ($295 million) and
196 million for pretax profit. In the absence of deterioration
in trading, we expect the full-year result to be at least at the
higher end of market expectations,"" Chief Executive Alan Parker
told reporters on a conference call. Shares in Whitbread, which have risen 12 percent since the
start of the year, were up 11.60 percent at 1,146 pence, valuing
the group at over 1.8 billion pounds. ""Trading remains tough but the market is now looking beyond
this and we believe that sentiment has firmly turned in
Whitbread's favour,"" said KBC Peel Hunt analyst Nick Batram, who
upgraded the company to ""buy"" from ""hold"". Premier Inn's performance was slightly ahead of its
first-quarter run rate and the company expects to perform better
in the second half when comparatives are softer. ""Across this period RevPar for the industry is down over 11
percent so I think we're doing relatively well. Corporations are
seeing value for money in budget hotels such as Premier Inn and
prefer us to expensive full-service hotels,"" said Parker. Upmarket rivals such as InterContinental Hotels and
Millennium & Copthorne have been hit even harder by the global
economic downturn. Last month, Europe's largest hotel group Accor reported a 54
percent drop in first-half profit, while InterContinental said a
recovery for the industry might be two years away. M&C, however, recently said it saw signs of stability
returning to its major markets. Like-for-like sales at Whitbread's pub restaurants division
rose by 2.1 percent during the period, as offers such as two
main meals for nine pounds on weekdays proved popular. The group said its Costa Coffee business had seen an 18.4
percent rise in total sales and 2.7 percent growth in
like-for-like sales on the back of its new ""Seven out of ten
coffee lovers prefer Costa"" advertising campaign. Whitbread said its level of debt at the half-year would be
similar to the year-end figure of 620 million pounds.

making them the top gainers on the French blue-chip CAC 40
index, as analysts welcomed the chance for prepaid services to
realise a valuation premium to hotels. ""The possibility of listing the entities autonomously allows
a fair value to be given to the services shares without
affecting their capacity to grow and the acceleration of the
restructuring of the hotel unit, whose valuation will definitely
benefit with time,"" Natixis analysts said. Accor had a market value of 7.88 billion euros as of
Wednesday. The services division could be worth 5.2 billion
euros, based on 15 times estimated 2010 operating profit, Oddo
Securities analyst Gilles Rascoussier said. Accor had earlier this year dismissed splitting hotels from
prepaid services, which include luncheon vouchers and prepaid
bank cards, saying services was key to supporting earnings as it
countered the cyclicality of its hotel business. But Chairman and Chief Executive Gilles Pelisson told
analysts on Thursday it had become clear there were very limited
synergies between the two businesses and that opportunities to
grow services were increasing. He cited a joint venture agreed with MasterCard in February
to provide flexible payment services, called PrePay Solutions,
adding that autonomy would allow both businesses to access the
financing they need to grow independently. Pelisson plans to reveal the decision on whether to create
two separate listed companies in February. Such a move could be
implemented towards the end of next year. This could create two ""champions"" in time to benefit from a
possible economic upturn in 2010 or 2011, he said.  HOTEL DEMAND DOWN Accor's hotel business, ranging from the budget Ibis brand
to top-of-the-range Sofitel, has suffered from a drop in demand
for its upscale and midscale hotels, as well as its economy
hotels in the U.S., during the economic crisis. Budget hotels outside the U.S., especially in France, have
remained resilient. UK rival InterContinental Hotels, the world's biggest
hotelier, said on Aug. 11 a recovery for the industry might be
two years away. Marriott International last month reported a 76
percent drop in second-quarter profit and cut its 2009 forecast.
  Accor's pretax profit before non-recurring items fell 54
percent in the first six months of the year to 182 million euros
($261 million). The group forecast full-year profit of 400-450
million euros, down from 875 million last year.
 Accor raised its target to reduce operating costs this year
to 150 million euros from 120 million. The company added that it expected no major improvement in
its hotel business in the second half of the year. Pelisson was made chairman as well as chief executive in
February, leading to the departure of previous Chairman Serge
Weinberg and five other members of the board of directors, under
pressure from top shareholders Eurazeo and Colony, which own a
combined 30 percent of Accor.

 By Joanne Frearson LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - European shares closed higher on Friday for the
fifth straight day, with banks and commodity stocks the biggest gainers, as
investors confidence about a global economic recovery improves. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed up 0.4 percent
at 870.56 points in choppy trade, having fallen earlier to 865.82 points. The index is up around 7 percent this week, its best weekly gain since late
November, and is up around 34 percent from its lifetime low of March 9. ""We have had a whole week of great gains. The market has been anticipating a
decent set of earnings and the message the market has been looking for is that
the corporate sector is behind the worst of the recession,"" said Mike Lenhoff,
strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""While some results are going to be negative they probably are not going to
be as negative as they have been, while other companies are going to have
positive earnings. Investors are becoming more confident that the recovery is
now in its formative stages,"" he said. The banking sector was higher, rebounding from earlier falls as investors
digested results from U.S. peers Citigroup and Bank of America. HSBC, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Banco Santander were up 0.3-1.6
percent. Citigroup reported a $4.3 billion second-quarter profit thanks to gains on
its Smith Barney deal, while Bank of America posted a quarterly profit that
topped Wall Street forecasts.  ACCOR, CARREFOUR FALLS However, General Electric Co said profit fell by almost half, on a deeper
drop in revenue than Wall Street expected, as the slump that has gripped its
finance and media businesses took hold of its heavy industrial units. Energy stocks rose as crude oil gained 2.1 percent. BG Group, BP, Royal
Dutch Shell and Total were up 0.3-1.7 percent. Miners ticked up as copper gained 1.9 percent. Antofagasta, BHP Billiton,
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto and Xstrata were 0.5-5.8
percent higher. On the downside, Accor lost 7.5 percent after second-quarter sales dropped 9
percent as the economic crisis weighed on its hotel business. Carrefour was down 3.7 percent after, the world's second-biggest retailer
behind U.S. group Wal-Mart, said second-quarter sales fell 1.2 percent, hurt by
weaker western European markets, lower petrol prices and exchange rates. Looking at macroeconomic data, helping buoy investor enthusiasm, new U.S.
housing starts and permits jumped more than expected in June, propelled by a
rise in single-family homes, a government report showed. ""Starts are at a very low level but we have established a base in the last
six months and I would say this is confirmation that starts are not going to go
any lower and the increase in permits might actually see thins move up from
here,"" said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX was 0.4
percent higher and France's CAC 40 was up 0.6 percent.

with automakers rising and banks gaining as Bank of America
continued the trend of strong second-quarter earnings.
 At 1109 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European

prospects of recovery. It has risen 7.1 percent this week, on track to post its
best weekly gain since late November last year.
""The catalyst has been the Q2 earnings, mainly Goldman Sachs

London. ""Before that people, had been worried that the green

more confidence that analysts estimates won't be out by a wide

 Other U.S. companies to report strong second-quarter
eearnings this week included JP Morgan and IBM. On Friday, General Electric Co said profit fell by almost
half on a deeper drop in revenue than Wall Street expected, as
the slump that has gripped its finance and media businesses took
hold of its heavy industrial units. Back in Europe, banks were among the top gainers. BNP Paribas, Barclays, HSBC and Societe Generale were up
between 1.4 and 2.2 percent. Swedbank reversed earlier losses to trade up 10 percent
despite posting a bigger-than-expected second quarter operating
loss, hurt by huge provisions for souring credits in the
recession-hit Baltic region. The DJ Stoxx Banking Index has risen more than 10 percent
this week.
 AUTOMAKERS RISE Automakers also extended gains from recent days. Daimler rose 2.5 percent, after Goldman Sachs reiterated its
""conviction buy"" rating and lifted its price target to 38 euros
from 35 euros. BMW rose 2.5 percent after Nomura upgraded it to ""neutral"".
 Oils were higher with crude little changed just below $62 a
barrel. BG, BP and Total were up between 0.9 and 2 percent. Among miners, Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Rio
Tinto and Xstrata were up between 2 and 5.2 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 each gained 0.9 percent. UBS lifted its year-end target for the FTSEurofirst 300 to
1,000 from 900, or an increase of nearly 15 percent from the
current level, as it expected a turn in the earnings cycle. British Airways rose 5.9 percent as the market responded
well to plans to raise around 600 million pounds ($1 billion)
through a combination of bondholder debt and bank credit. On the downside, French group Accor sank 7.8 percent after
it posted a 9 percent drop in second quarter sales as the
economic crisis weighed on its hotel business. Carrefour, the world's second-biggest retailer behind U.S.

full-year earnings forecasts as it benefits from focusing more
on higher-margin businesses in software and services. Google's  quarterly profit also beat Wall Street

 (Adds detail) PARIS, July 16 (Reuters) - French group Accor posted a 9
percent drop in second-quarter sales as the economic crisis
weighed on its hotel business despite slight growth in its
prepaid services division. Accor said the figures, sightly ahead of analysts'
expectations, reflected the global economic situation which it
said remained extremely depressed. It said it was cutting costs and scaling back capital
expenditure in 2009 and 2010 but gave no new target figures. Accor's hotels, which range from budget Ibis to
top-of-the-range Sofitel, saw revenue decline 11.1 percent to
1.35 billion euros in the three months to June 30 from a year
ago, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Prepaid services sales, meanwhile, grew 0.5 percent to 233.6
million euros. Total group sales were 1.79 billion euros, against an
average expectation of seven analysts of 1.71 billion euros. U.S. rival Marriott International on Thursday reported a 76
percent drop in second-quarter profit and cut its 2009 earnings
forecast. The group has been forced to lower room rates to
entice leisure travellers as business trips decline.
Accor is cutting costs and spending to help weather a
decline in demand for its upscale, midscale and U.S. budget
hotels and is expanding into services such as payment cards and
holiday vouchers to bolster its main hotel business. The group is cutting 2009 spending on renovating hotels by
170 million euros to 315 million, lowering support costs by 80
million this year and 45 million in 2010, and reducing operating
costs by 120 million this year. Accor has also allocated 100 million euros for possible
acquisitions in its hotels business and a further 100 million
for purchases in prepaid services.

quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still

212,"May 06, 2009 04:00AM ET",French services sector decline eases in April,nan," By Vicky Buffery PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - The pace of contraction in the
French services sector eased for a second successive month in
April, a key survey showed on Wednesday, but economic conditions
remained extremely difficult, prompting firms to slash prices in
a bid to attract customers. The Markit/CDAF final services purchasing managers' index
(PMI) reached its highest level in six months in April, rising
to 46.5 from 43.6 the previous month. The composite PMI -- which combines data from services and
manufacturing firms -- also rose to 43.8 for the month, from a
revised figure of 40.2 in March. But the readings were still well below the 50 mark
separating growth from contraction as firms continued to
struggle in the face of a slowdown in global demand that set in
after last year's financial sector meltdown. ""The (services) index remained at a level unmatched prior to
the Lehman Brothers-related collapse of global economic activity
in September 2008,"" Markit said. ""Panellists continued to report that overall operating
conditions remained unfavourable and that falling new business
had again negatively impacted on activity."" New orders to service providers fell for the seventh
consecutive month, with hotels and restaurants bearing the brunt
of the downturn as customers cut back on discretionary spending. In an illustration of the trend, French hotel operator Accor
said in April it had suffered a 9.6 percent drop in
first-quarter sales, as weakening economies hurt demand for its
hotels. Some of the firms surveyed also reported cancellations of
existing orders, contributing to another steep fall in work
backlogs, Markit said. In a sign that the severity of the economic crisis may be
starting to ease, companies' future expectations moved further
into positive territory, reflecting growing confidence that the
worst has now passed. The business expectations index for the service sector
climbed to 58.3 in April from 51.9 previously, and Markit said
37 percent of respondents expected output to be higher in twelve
months' time. But in the short term, firms continued to make painful
adjustments to cope with the difficult economic context,
slashing prices to boost sales, and making further sweeping cuts
to staffing levels. April's output prices component showed prices falling for
the eighth straight month, with the index hitting a record low
of 38.1, compared with a reading of 38.4 in March. The services employment index rose marginally to 41.0 from
40.8 in March, but still remained close to February's survey
record low of 40.6, indicating a further steep contraction in
the service sector workforce, Markit said.

 (Adds details) LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Land Securities Group Plc is to
sell its Trillium outsourcing arm for 750 million pounds ($1.1
billion), in a deal which streamlines its business and bolsters
its balance sheet amid miseries in the UK property market. Trillium, which had gross assets of almost 1.3 billion
pounds at Sept. 30, has been sold to property investment and
services company Telereal, bringing to an end months of
speculation concerning its future ownership. The sale, which does not include the Accor Hotels arm, is
expected to complete on Jan. 12 and will generate around 444
million pounds of cash proceeds, which will be used to pay down
Land Securities group debt. ""We are pleased to have concluded this sale in a challenging
economic environment. We will now focus on our core property
investment and development activities,"" said Land Securities
Chief Executive Francis Salway. ""We continue to run the group with a cautious outlook and a
focus on balance sheet management,"" Salway said.  Trillium (excluding Accor) generated an underlying
operating profit for the year to March 31 2008 of 102 million
pounds. In November Land Securities axed year-old plans to demerge
into three specialist entities focused on London, retail and
property outsourcing amid volatile market conditions, but it
reiterated it was still evaluating a trade sale of Trillium.
