That would give it the clout to push through change after months of feuding between TIM's current top shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), and No. 3 investor, U.S fund Elliott.CDP already owns just under 10% of TIM and has put itself at ""the center of the game"" in recent weeks, initiating contacts with TIM executives and Vivendi, the sources said.That influence is yielding results. On Thursday, TIM said it had signed an agreement with CDP and Enel to start talks on ways of integrating its fiber network with its rival's, including a possible merger.No final solution has been found, but all options under scrutiny involve merging TIM and Open Fiber network assets in a share-based transaction that would lift CDP's stake in TIM close to or more than Vivendi's 23.9%, the sources said.That could give CDP a decisive vote over TIM strategy and put it in the strongest position to advance a government plan to rapidly develop a national broadband network.Enel, CDP, Vivendi and TIM all declined to comment.WANTED: BROADBAND INVESTORSUnder CDP's main option, TIM would buy the sovereign wealth fund's 50% stake in Open Fiber, using its shares as payment, said the sources familiar with CDP's thinking and a banker with knowledge of the matter.Enel, also controlled by the state through a 23.6% stake held by the treasury, would sell out of Open Fiber in a separate sale to institutional investors under this scenario, they added.""The idea is Enel cashes out and its stake offered to long-term investors. It's not Enel's (core) business but of course it all depends on the price,"" the banker said.At this point, however, Italian fixed-line broadband would be dominated by TIM and would likely fall foul of competition regulators, so CDP's plan envisages a further, large infusion of private investment to dilute TIM's position, the sources said.The details have yet to be hammered out, but in the end the assets of both networks could be put under one roof outside TIM, perhaps under Open Fiber itself, with TIM emerging with only a minority stake in it, the sources and banker said.They said it was too early to speculate on how much private investment would be required to achieve this outcome, but it could run into billions of euros based on network valuations. Telecoms analysts have made widely varying valuations of the two networks, reflecting different assumptions on future growth.They value TIM's fixed-line assets, both optic fiber and old copper wire, at 10-15 billion euros ($11-$17 billion) and Open Fiber's exclusively optic fiber network at 2-8 billion euros.A unified and regulated broadband network could be an attractive proposition for private investors, offering steady and predictable returns. HIGH DIGITAL STAKESEnel has right of first refusal over CDP's stake in Open Fiber and can in theory derail CDP's plans by exercising it. In practice, though, Enel will go along with Rome's plan, said another source familiar with the matter.""(Enel CEO Francesco) Starace has regular meetings with CDP but it's clear he's waiting for TIM first to put its house in order before making any decision,"" this source said.The government has the option anyway of replacing Starace early next year when he comes up for reappointment.Elliott and Vivendi, locked in a year-old battle for board control at TIM, recently met to try to settle their governance differences, one person close to the matter said.Analysts say that only a neutral network, where TIM would not have an incentive to limit competition from rival services, has the best chance of delivering the content and pricing needed to spur more Italians to go digital.In 2017, Italy had the lowest internet usage in western Europe alongside Greece, a problem that is holding back the development of a big digital economy deserving of a G7 economy with a population of around 60 million people. ""The number of people in Italy interested in fast broadband services is not that high so a lot depends on pricing. A single network could nudge prices up so the regulator's role is important,"" says Michele Polo, an expert in antitrust and regulation issues at Milan's Bocconi university.""The risk of TIM using its dominant position is there,"" Polo said, but he added strong regulation could deal with this.Italy's telecoms and broadcaster incumbents have never faced the competition from cable TV that have driven connection speeds up and prices down elsewhere.Separating fixed-line networks is seen as one of the few ways that legacy telecoms providers can create new value for shareholders.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts described infrastructure as ""the most dynamic subsector in telcos"" in a note on Friday.Altice is considering a sale of its Portuguese fiber network, while Denmark's TDC, and O2 in the Czech Republic, have already spun off their networks.Another Bocconi expert, Carlo Alberto Cardinale Maffè of the SDA Bocconi School of Management, said if the plan was just to re-nationalize TIM and leave it with de facto control of a national broadband network, it would not work.""I don't think it's in CDP's interest. It would take TIM back 20 years and it would be a failure. Italian and European regulators would never allow that,"" Maffè said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

2,"Jun 18, 2019 05:20PM ET",Vivendi could be excluded from voting at Mediaset's new Dutch TV group: document,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset hostile shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) could be excluded from voting at shareholder meetings of a new Amsterdam-based TV company the Italian broadcaster is setting up, according to a bylaw of the new holding.Mediaset earlier this month unveiled a corporate overhaul that includes putting the group and its separately-listed Spanish unit under a new Dutch holding company as part of a pan-European growth strategy.The broadcaster, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will have around 35% of the holding MediaforEurope (MFE) and just above 50% of voting rights.Vivendi, Mediaset's second-biggest shareholder, is set to have around 23 percent of MFE once the deal is signed off. However, most of that stake will be held in a trust reflecting the current set-up at Mediaset.Vivendi could potentially scupper the corporate overhaul if it exercises its right of withdrawal for its whole stake as Mediaset has set a ceiling of 180 million euros on the cash outlay for the option, well below the Vivendi stake. The French media giant is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with Mediaset stemming from a failed 2016 pay-TV deal.After Mediaset's pay-TV sale to the French group fell through, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns.Vivendi is also the top shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).On top of that Vivendi and the trust have both been excluded from voting at Mediaset's shareholder meetings, because the broadcaster considers the stake illegitimate. A legal case is ongoing in court. A document posted on Mediaset's website late on Tuesday said that state of affairs would also be applicable to the Dutch holding until the legal dispute is resolved. The bylaws, which will be voted on at an MFE shareholder meeting called early in September to approve the deal, will need signing off by the new MFE board.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

3,"Jun 17, 2019 03:32PM ET",Sotheby's snapped up by French tycoon Drahi for $3.7 billion,nan,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Mathieu RosemainPARIS/BOSTON (Reuters) - Franco-Israeli cable magnate Patrick Drahi made a surprise move into the art world by snapping up Sotheby's in a deal worth $3.7 billion, marking the art auction house's return to private ownership after 31 years.The acquisition allows Drahi to join French billionaire Francois Pinault - who owns Sotheby's main rival Christie's - at the top of the art world and New York society.Drahi joins an exclusive club of French billionaires active in the global art market, which also includes LVMH's boss Bernard Arnault through his Louis Vuitton foundation.Drahi's expansion in the United States also has echoes of former  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) boss Jean-Marie Messier, who turned a struggling French water company into a global media giant with stakes in established U.S. institutions.The deal also marks a new chapter for the 275-year-old auction house that became a destination for a new generation of wealth created on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and around the world. In many ways, being public put Sotheby's at a competitive disadvantage to its main U.S. rival Christie's, which was already private, art experts said. ""Now the company can become more flexible and nimble as a privately-held enterprise and it will be interesting to see the changes that will be made,"" said Abigail Asher, a partner at international art consultants Guggenheim, Asher.Founded in London in 1744 before expanding overseas in the 20th century, Sotheby's had the distinction of being the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Famous items sold by Sotheby's include the collections of the late Duchess of Windsor, the personal collection of artist Andy Warhol and Edvard Munch's painting ""The Scream"".Sotheby's said BidFair USA, an acquisition vehicle set up by Drahi, had offered $57 in cash per share to buy it out. The offer represented a premium of 61% to Sotheby's closing price on Friday, and gives it a market capitalization of $2.6 billion. LOEB WELCOMES DEALThe art world has been a favorite in recent times for investors looking to make extra returns in a world of ultra-low interest rates, with the prices of many expensive works of art having steadily increased.A report published by Swiss bank UBS and Art Basel in March said that the global art market had enjoyed another uptick in 2018.Drahi - who is better known for engineering debt-fueled acquisitions in the cable and telecom business through the Altice group he controls - said he would be funding the takeover through financing arranged by French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and by equity provided by his own funds. Drahi has also been selling non-core assets in recent years to ease concerns over the debt levels of his businesses.The businessman said he would not be selling shares in his Altice Europe business, but would be cashing in a small stake in his Altice USA division. Shares in Altice USA fell around 2% on Monday.Born in Morocco, Drahi, 55, was trained at the selective Polytechnique school in Paris, and holds dual French and Israeli citizenship. Despite controlling influential French media outlets such as leftist bible Liberation and the country's most-watched news channel BFM TV, Drahi has shied away from elite gatherings of France’s establishment and spends much of his time between Switzerland, the United States and Israel.""This investment will further demonstrate the anchoring of my family in the United States, a country where we have been very welcomed since the successful acquisitions of Suddenlink in 2015, Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) in 2016 and just recently Cheddar,"" Drahi said in a statement, referring to the two U.S. cable companies and an online news network respectively.He said he had full confidence in Sotheby's management and did not expect any change to the company's strategy.About five years ago, Sotheby's ended a long-running fight with activist investor Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point, by asking Loeb and two associates to join Sotheby's board, and Loeb was instrumental in hiring Smith as CEO.Loeb, a prominent art collector, on Monday praised the sale.The price ""affirms the value we saw when we first invested in Sotheby’s, and rewards long-term investors like Third Point who believed in its potential,"" Loeb told Reuters.BNP Paribas and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Drahi, while LionTree Advisors worked on behalf of Sotheby's.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

4,"Jun 17, 2019 10:35AM ET","France's women smash TV viewing records, advertising costs spike",nan,"By Rachel JoynerPARIS (Reuters) - France is once again gripped by football fever -- a year after the men's national team triumphed on the world stage, the women's team is cruising through the group stages and smashing TV audience records in their own World Cup.Stadiums are selling out, and TV broadcasters are bumping up the price of advertising slots as millions tune in. Les Bleues' star players are fast becoming household names.TF1, France's main broadcaster for the tournament, had expected the team's opening match to draw up to 5 million viewers. Instead, numbers peaked at 10.9 million, while almost 1 million followed the game on Canal+, a pay-TV unit of  Vivendi  (PA:VIV). TF1, owned by family-controlled conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), described the numbers as a French record for a women's soccer match.But the records did not stop there -- in France's second group game against Norway, domestic viewer numbers spiked to 11 million on TF1 - on par with the number of people who watched the men's opening matches in 2018. The French women play Nigeria on Monday in their last group game before the knock-out stages. The surprising level of interest prompted TF1 to drive up the cost of advertising slots by 50-60 percent the day after France's first match, Le Parisien newspaper reported.Thirty-second slots during the half-time break of France's group stage matches, initially slated at 73,000 euros, now cost 116,000 euros, it said.The surge in viewer numbers extends beyond the French games. England's match against arch rival Argentina drew nearly 1.5 million viewers on TF1, while up to 1.1 million people have tuned in to watch the United States. Women's soccer is steadily growing in popularity in many parts of the world.Soccer's governing body FIFA has said it has received a record number of expressions of interest for hosting the next women's tournament, in 2023, including a joint bid by South Korea and North Korea football associations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

5,"Jun 12, 2019 08:30PM ET",Musicians lament reported loss of recordings in decade-old Universal fire,nan,"By Lisa Richwine and Steve GormanLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Several big-name musicians voiced dismay on Wednesday that some of their recordings may have been among thousands of original masters that The New York Times Magazine reported were lost in the Universal Studios Hollywood backlot fire of 2008.The blaze, which gutted a popular ""King Kong"" attraction and a swath of the studio's fabled outdoor lot, also destroyed nearly all the master recordings stored there in a Universal Music Group archive, a loss that has long gone undisclosed, the magazine reported on Tuesday.Universal Music estimated in a confidential 2009 report that the loss encompassed about 500,000 song titles, the article said.In a statement on Wednesday, the company called the incident ""deeply unfortunate,"" but said the Times story contained ""numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident."" The extent of the loss, documented in litigation and company records the article cited, was largely kept from the public eye through a concerted effort on the part of the music label, the magazine said. Many of the artists whose own material was reported to have been destroyed expressed shock.""Oh my Lord ... this makes me sick to my stomach,"" singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow wrote on Twitter, posted with a link to the article. ""And shame on those involved in the coverup.""The rock band R.E.M said in a Twitter statement that concerned fans were making inquiries. ""We are trying to get good information to find out what happened, and the effect on the band's music, if any,"" the group tweeted.Original sound recordings of many of the greatest names in popular music since the 1940s - from Louis Armstrong and Judy Garland to Tom Petty and 50 Cent - are believed to have gone up in smoke in what the article described as ""the biggest disaster in the history of the music business.""Master recordings are typically owned and controlled by the music labels for the artists in their catalog. But they are seen as vital to musicians' legacy as they are original, one-of-a-kind recordings considered the truest representation of sounds captured in the studio. Masters are the source material for all reproductions, including re-releases and remixes, made for distribution, whether on digital medium or vinyl.Universal Music Group, now owned by French media conglomerate  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), said the fire ""never affected the availability of the commercially released music nor impacted artists' compensation."" The New York Times article ""ignores the tens of thousands of back catalog recordings that we have already issued in recent years, including master-quality, high-resolution, audiophile versions of many records that the story claims were 'destroyed,'"" Universal Music said.Irving Azoff, manager for the group Steely Dan, said in a statement that the musicians had ""been aware of 'missing' original Steely Dan tapes for a long time now.""""We've never been given a plausible explanation,"" Azoff said. ""Maybe they burned up in the big fire. In any case, it's certainly a lost treasure.""Krist Novoselic, a founding member of the 1990s grunge band Nirvana, responded to a fan on Twitter asking whether the Times article meant that the masters for the group's landmark ""Nevermind"" album were gone. He wrote: ""I think they are gone forever.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

9,"May 29, 2019 01:36PM ET",Fraught Franco-Italian relations a roadblock risk for Renault-FCA,nan,"By Richard Lough and Giuseppe FontePARIS/ROME (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler's proposed $35 billion merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) has cheered investors, won conditional support from Paris and Rome and even earned cautious backing from trade unions.Beneath this veneer, however, the bold attempt to create the world's third largest carmaker risks becoming rapidly embroiled in the fraught relationship between France's europhile President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's euroskeptic leaders.For while Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini hailed the proposal as a ""brilliant operation"", Italy's creaking, state-subsidized Fiat factories are likely to bear the brunt of any production-related cost savings.FCA and Renault said this week that more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of annual savings would come mainly from combining platforms, consolidating powertrain and electrification investments and the benefits of increased scale.Salvini and France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who called the deal a ""good opportunity"" to build a European industrial champion able to compete with China and the United States, have both said they want guarantees on local jobs.""It's not every day that I agree with Salvini,"" said Le Maire, whose government appears to hold the trump cards.When it comes to where any job cuts fall, France will be helped by its existing 15 percent holding in Renault, whose superior efficiency at its five French plants makes it better placed to handle a supply glut, the demise of the petrol engine and the investments needed for electric and autonomous vehicles.""It will take many, many years to find real savings and ugly political and operational realities can often swamp the potential of such new entities,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said of the FCA-Renault plan to rival Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).ADVANTAGE FRANCE?As well as Italy's government having to cope with the aftermath of European elections which coincided with news of the FCA-Renault plans, political leaders in Rome were only informed shortly before the deal was made public, an FCA source said.This contrasted with the way the French government was treated, with Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann, a fluent French speaker, letting it know of his merger proposal to Renault weeks ago, a French government official said. It is not clear how advanced the secret talks between the automakers were at this stage or what opportunity Le Maire had to lay down any red lines, but it reflects FCA's need to have President Emmanuel Macron on side.And it gave France time to prepare its position, with Le Maire on Tuesday laying out four conditions for state approval, including protection of French blue-collar jobs.Meanwhile, Italy's Salvini said Rome might buy a stake the new entity to defend domestic interests.Corporate France has been the biggest overseas investor in Italian companies over the past decade with deals totaling $43.3 billion, Refinitiv data shows.Some are closely scrutinized by Rome, which is fretting over the vulnerability of corporate champions such as  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), in which Italian state lender CDP took a direct holding after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) took a controlling stake.Under the FCA proposal, Elkann, scion of the Agnelli family, would chair the merged group while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO, sources say.'ECONOMIC FANTASY'? While Le Maire has appeared well briefed, Italy's leaders seemed blindsided and Salvini's suggestion that Italy could mirror France's stake signaled concerns over Rome's influence. With cash-strapped Italy locked in a renewed row with Brussels over euro zone budget rules, some French officials dismissed talk of an Italian stake as a bluff, with one describing it as ""economic fantasy"".There are signs the effort to save jobs will focus on the factory floor. Le Maire is demanding that no ""industrial jobs or industrial plants"" are axed in France, leaving scope for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as downsizing plants.Indeed, the merger plan dovetails with Macron's push for cross-border industrial champions that have the muscle to compete with Chinese and U.S. rivals of today and the future. Le Maire urged trade unions to look at job creation potential in a company with the financial clout to be a global player in electric battery and self-driving car technology.Macron has stared down unions before, including over the proposed Franco-German merger of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Siemens rail businesses, which was derailed by antitrust concerns. Even so, it is unclear how realistic the demands for blue-collar job protection are, with ""substantial product and platform overlap in Europe"", UBS analyst David Lense said.Renault has improved the competitiveness of its French plants, shedding 8,000 jobs via voluntary departures since 2013 and paring back production lines to curb excess capacity. It employs 48,000 people in France, with its plants operating at about 70 percent capacity, while Fiat's six plants in Italy struggle. Turin's historic Mirafiori plant, which makes the Maserati Levante SUV, is expected to operate at just 5 percent capacity this year. Only two plants producing between them the Fiat Panda, Fiat 500 X and the popular Jeep Renegade top 50 percent capacity, research group LMC Automotive said. Higher carbon dioxide emissions may also focus attention on FCA's plants as the combined company looks to tackle tightening emissions regulations and far-reaching technological changes.""These challenges are potentially big push backs and are bigger issues for FCA than for Renault, which doesn't need to restructure in France and which has much lower CO2 emissions,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

12,"May 27, 2019 05:50AM ET","As Leaders Quarrel, Fiat and Renault Seek Detente in Car Deal",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- French and Italian leaders have reveled in throwing mud at each other, but two of the countries’ flagship companies are now looking beyond the bad blood to cozy up to each other.The prospective deal, a proposal by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) to merge with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), could create the world’s third-biggest carmaker. The prospect is already triggering contrasting responses from politicians, though the Italian company has said there won’t be plant closures as a result of the combination.On hearing news of the tie-up, the rightist League party of Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, who has in the past clashed virulently with French President Emmanuel Macron, swiftly invoked Italy’s “national interest” and dangled the option of the Rome government stepping in. The League, after all, campaigned for Sunday’s European Parliament election on an “Italy First” platform.“Given the state presence in Renault, the fact that two companies of this size plan to merge has to be looked at with special care,” the League’s Claudio Borghi, who heads the lower house budget committee, told La7 television. Borghi was quick to remind viewers that the French government fought tooth-and-nail against a bid by Italy’s Fincantieri for the France-based STX shipyard.Italy will ensure “that the historic value of Fiat is guaranteed, otherwise we’ll intervene,” Borghi said, adding that could include the state taking a stake in Fiat to match the French holding in Renault.Debt MountainA French government official said it would be surprising if the founding Agnelli family welcomed a state presence in the company. The official, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters, also wondered aloud whether the Italian government -- already burdened with a mountain of debt -- would have the funds to pay for it.Still, the official could not see any political risks to the merger, and insisted it would be a win-win for the two countries and their economies.The merger will promote European “economic sovereignty,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told BFM TV, adding the government favors the link-up, though it’s waiting to examine all the conditions.With the League surging to become Italy’s biggest political force in Sunday’s European elections, Salvini could be more tempted than ever to fly the nationalist flag and take a provocative stand on the merger, especially if jobs are at risk.“We welcome the FCA-Renault deal, as long as factories in Italy stay open,” the League’s Massimo Garavaglia, deputy finance minister, told Radio 24. “The market is always right.”Recent cross-border transactions have inflamed nationalism in both countries.  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA’s two biggest shareholders, French media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA and U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp., have been locked in a battle for influence at the carrier for more than a year.Salvini has taken particular pleasure in launching folksy broadsides against Macron, last year calling him “a polite young man who drinks too much champagne.” Salvini has also accused Macron of protecting fugitives wanted by Italian authorities, including convicted members of the far-left Red Brigades.Macron, who has spoken of “populist leprosy,” retorted that Italians “deserve a government worthy of their history.”The sparring between the two neighbors has quieted down from its low point, when France recalled its ambassador for a week in February, although Salvini repeatedly took aim at Macron in the European election campaign, calling the French leader a symbol of the liberal, establishment class he pledged to overthrow."

Vivendi, which controls a 23.9% stake and could block any deal, opposes losing control of the network. Open Fiber is co-owned by Italy's biggest utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender CDP, which recently built a stake of almost 10% in TIM to become its second-largest shareholder.TIM, Italy's biggest phone group, is exploring the options as part of a three-year strategic plan unveiled by CEO Luigi Gubitosi earlier this year.Maintaining some sort of control would be the ""best solution"", Gubitosi said in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.""There are different ways of keeping control,"" he said without elaborating but added that issues including valuations still needed to be discussed with shareholders and the board.A merger of Telecom Italia's copper and fiber network with wholesale-only broadband group Open Fiber could raise antitrust concerns, but Gubitosi said regulatory hurdles could be fixed.""We don't think there's anything that could not be solved"", he told analysts. A complete assessment of folding Open Fiber into Telecom Italia would be wrapped up next month and would be examined by two company board meetings scheduled on June 27 and August 1, the CEO said.Shares in Telecom Italia rose more than 4% on Tuesday as the company reported adjusted net debt of 25.1 billion euros ($28 billion) at the end of March, down 1.8% year on year. Core earnings fell 2.1% to 1.83 billion euros after a 9.9% drop in the previous quarter. That compared with a consensus forecast of 1.794 billion euros.""Results are broadly in line to slightly ahead; net debt progress is encouraging,"" Berenberg said in a note.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Apr 29, 2019 11:50AM ET",Mediaset to move pay-TV content to video streaming app after losing customers: source,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's top commercial broadcaster Mediaset plans to close its pay-TV channels and move their content to a video streaming service after losing 80 percent of its paying clients in six months, a source close to the matter said.The move is part of a downsizing of the group's pay-TV unit, which is called Mediaset Premium, following years of losses and a failed sale to French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).A second source confirmed the shift to streaming but was unable to provide details about customer numbers.After years of heavy spending to secure soccer rights as it competed with rival Sky Italia, Mediaset Premium then cut back on investment. Last year it lost rights to broadcast Serie A and UEFA Champions League soccer matches, leading to a large loss of subscribers. The first source said Mediaset Premium's clients had shrunk to just 300,000 customers by the start of this year from around 1.5 million in mid-2018, mostly as a consequence of having dropped soccer from the pay-TV offer. Mediaset is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Embroiled in a legal battle with Vivendi over the failed Premium sale, Mediaset has shifted focus back to its core free-to-air business and will decide by the end of July whether to expand in Europe.It will give its remaining Premium clients notice of the channels' switch-off from digital terrestrial television at the beginning of May, the first source said.Clients will be given the opportunity to migrate to a video-streaming app service which would include most of the pay-TV channels' content, both sources said.As part of a wider agreement sealed last year with Sky Italia, Mediaset Premium's movie and TV drama packages will continue to be available to customers of Comcast's Sky Italia.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"Apr 18, 2019 08:30AM ET",Mediaset to make decision on pan-European TV project by July 25 board meeting: CEO,nan,"By Giancarlo NavachCOLOGNO MONZESE, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's Mediaset will make a decision on a possible pan-European free-to-air television alliance by the time of a July 25 board meeting, its chief executive said on Thursday.The board meeting had already been scheduled to review the broadcaster's decision not to pay a dividend for 2018.The broadcaster, owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding company Fininvest, has in recent months repeatedly raised the idea of creating a pan-European TV player to fend off competition from established rivals and new entrants.Speaking to reporters after the group's annual general meeting, CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi, who is the son of the former premier, said there were several options for Mediaset's pan-European project.""Once we have all the elements, we'll understand how to go about this,"" he said.Most recently, speculation has intensified that Mediaset and German rival ProSiebenSat.1 Media could strike a deal, but the two companies denied last Saturday a press report that they were in merger talks.Mediaset's Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani told the shareholder meeting there were currently no plans to expand in Germany with ProSiebenSat.Like other European free-to-air broadcasters, Mediaset is suffering competition from internet giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the advertising market and is struggling to keep up with investments in content production by video-streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video.France's largest private TV broadcaster, TF1 has also been mentioned in the press as a possible partner for Mediaset, though the company said last September it was not discussing a major cross-border deal with its Italian rival.Thursday's shareholder meeting approved a loyalty share scheme that rewards longer-term investors with additional votes under an Italian law that is traditionally used by controlling shareholders to strengthen their grip on companies. Fininvest currently owns 44 percent of Mediaset. Under the new scheme, investors will have two voting rights for each share held for at least 24 straight months.Mediaset has been embroiled in a legal battle with hostile shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the French media conglomerate controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, since 2016 when Vivendi pulled out of a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit.After the failed pay-TV sale, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns. Vivendi is also the top shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).As Mediaset considers Vivendi's stake illegitimate, its board rejected requests from both the French group and the trust in which it has transferred most of its stake to vote at Thursday's shareholder meeting.Vivendi said in a statement that it could challenge the validity of the decisions approved by the meeting.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's Dax was leading the way, up 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 was up 0.3%.Data showing a solid increase in Chinese house prices has been the immediate trigger, but they merely add to recent evidence that the world’s second-largest economy is bottoming out, responding to fiscal and monetary stimulus measures from Beijing.Other macro issues are also helping. Markets have responded particularly brightly to the recent drip of news out of trade talks between China and the U.S., suggesting that they’re close to an agreement to remove the threat of a full-blown trade war for the foreseeable future.EU members also last week signed off on a mandate for the European Commission in trade talks with the U.S. The talks are unlikely likely to lead anywhere in the short term, due to political resistance from France, but they may at least stop the U.S. imposing new tariffs on EU exports.Such issues generally outweigh many of the company-specific problems punctuating this week’s news. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), for example, has hit a 10-month high this morning despite Monday’s news that German prosecutors have filed charges against former CEO Martin Winterkorn – a step that also raises questions over current board members such as Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch.Corporate news so far Tuesday has been mixed. Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI) is up 1.0% after announcing it would pay $1.3 billion to settle U.S. allegations of violating sanctions. German online retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG)has risen over 10% after announcing better-than-expected results for the first quarter late Monday, but airlines are under pressure after Germany’s Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned its first-quarter loss would be wider than expected due to higher fuel costs.French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was down 2.0% after shareholders voted to approve a buyback that will increase the stake of its biggest shareholder, Vincent Bollore. The move had been opposed by corporate governance activists who argued the step allowed Bollore to sidestep requirements on making an offer to all shareholders."

The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was also essentially unchanged at 387.40, despite more hints over the weekend that China and the U.S. are approaching agreement on their various trade disputes. The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% and Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, not helped by a drop in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares after a report alleging further emissions-related misdeeds on Sunday.Meanwhile in London, IWG (LON:IWG), the office space company formerly known as Regus, rose as much as 20% in early trading after agreeing to sell its Japanese business to Tokyo-based TKP for 320 million pounds ($420 milion), a sum that’s around 3.4 times the business’s annual revenue.Under a franchise agreement due to start next month, IWG will also continue to get an unspecified fee from TKP, which will act as operator for all of IWG’s flexible workspaces in Japan.Finally, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was up 0.5% after reporting further progress in preparing the sale of a stake in Universal Media Group. Vivendi said it would soon complete the process of choosing banks to manage the sale of up to half of the unit, which is worth $30 billion by some estimates. UMG’s revenue rose 19% in constant-currency terms in the first quarter, accounting for nearly all of a 5.7% increase in group revenue."

Vivendi  (PA:VIV), which holds 29 percent of Mediaset, last year transferred a 19.19 percent holding in Italy's biggest private broadcaster to the Simon Fiduciaria trust to comply with antitrust demands it cut its stake in either Mediaset or telecoms incumbent  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).In June, Mediaset prevented the trust from voting at its annual general meeting, prompting Simon Fiduciaria to launch a legal challenge to have two of the decisions taken at the meeting scrapped. The two decisions related to the establishment of an incentive and retention plan and of a stock option plan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

22,"Mar 28, 2019 12:11PM ET",Explainer: Telecom Italia at crossroads over network's future,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is pushing to create a single ultrafast broadband operator by merging Telecom Italia's copper and fiber network with smaller rival Open Fiber to avoid duplicating investments and narrow the digital divide with Europe.But the future of Telecom Italia's (TIM) network has become a key bone of contention between the phone group's top shareholders,  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and activist fund Elliott.Elliott wants TIM to spin off its network and merge it with Open Fiber. Vivendi is not opposed to a merger but insists on TIM keeping control of its biggest asset.Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), which co-owns Open Fiber with utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI), recently became TIM's No. 2 shareholder to oversee Rome's interest in a company seen as strategic. CDP is keen on the single network project.The idea to spin off TIM's network has been flirted with multiple times over the last decade and was last seriously attempted in 2013 before it was eventually abandoned.TIM Chief Executive Luigi Gubitosi said in February all options on the network would be evaluated. Below are some possible outcomes: TYING THE KNOTA merger between TIM's network and Open Fiber would create a near-monopoly for broadband rollout in Italy, but such a move could prove difficult to implement. TIM's network is valued at up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion), analysts say, versus a valuation for newcomer Open Fiber of more than 2 billion euros.Each day that passes the value of the copper-part of TIM's network loses value as more customers migrate to fiber. TIM is saddled with more than 25 billion euros of debt and employs around 50,000 people in Italy. Stripping out TIM's network would leave a services stub with a potentially bloated workforce and debt pile that would struggle to compete with leaner rivals.Elliott said a network spin-off would unleash up to 7 billion euros in hidden value, attract new investors and drive a re-rating of shares -- estimates some critics called optimistic.Vivendi does not want TIM to lose control of the network because it is deemed strategic for deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services. Industry regulator AGCOM last year said it was opposed to TIM keeping control of the network as it would still have ""a significant competitive advantage"". THE RAB CONUNDRUMItaly has said it could regulate a potential single network like an energy grid offering state-guaranteed investment returns on a regulated asset base (RAB) model to tempt players on board and create Europe's first RAB-rewarded broadband grid. Proponents say that because of the massive costs involved in rolling out fiber across the country, operators will require a RAB-like system to guarantee investments and funding.Critics say such a system is hard to implement since it requires a monopoly and convincing all network players to club assets. Broadband services, unlike energy, are not basic commodities, and customers may choose to opt for cheaper or alternative services, such as mobile Internet, if prices rise. FIBER ONLYAn alternative could be a merger of Open Fiber with TIM's fiber-only assets which would be a cleaner and simpler fit. Former TIM CEO Amos Genish and Enel CEO Francesco Starace had discussed this option, sources have said. FRIENDLY COEXISTENCEAnother option is for TIM and Open Fiber to cooperate commercially and carry out co-investments but without going to the altar. Talks in that regard have been ongoing. One possibility is for Open Fiber to build its network in non-economically viable areas and then rent it to TIM who would channel clients on to the line. In return TIM would give Open Fiber access to its network in mainly urban areas.($1 = 0.8909 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Feb 27, 2019 11:48PM ET","Exclusive: KKR, China's Tencent eyeing bids for Universal Music - sources",nan,"By Pamela BarbagliaLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund KKR and China's Tencent Music Entertainment Group are exploring rival bids for up to half of Vivendi's iconic Universal Music division, a deal potentially worth up 20 billion euros ($22.73 billion), sources told Reuters.French tycoon Vincent Bollore, who controls  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) with a 25 percent stake, is in the process of selecting banks to oversee a partial sale of Universal Music Group (UMG), two sources familiar with matter said.Sell-side banks are expected to be appointed in March, with a process likely to kick off in the second quarter, they said.But informal discussions with potential bidders are underway as banks are trying to gauge appetite for the unit. UMG is the world's biggest music label ahead of Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music, and is home to artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Drake and Kendrick Lamar.Vivendi and KKR declined to comment. Tencent Music declined to comment.Analysts have expressed different views on UMG's valuation.JPMorgan's media analyst Daniel Kerven recently described the business as ""a unique asset – under-monetized, must-have global content that is strategic to the tech giants and can't be replicated"". He pegged UMG's fair value at 44 billion euros.That is higher than rival estimates.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) put it at 29 billion euros, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) at 35 billion euros and Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) at 25 billion euros.Vivendi's boss Arnaud de Puyfontaine said in 2017 that the unit could be worth more than $40 billion. At the time Vivendi was exploring a possible stock market listing, a plan later shelved amid challenges in eking out big profits in the sector, with many customers still unwilling to pay much for songs they can hear free on the radio, in music blogs or on free apps.Universal will generate roughly 1.5 billion euros of free cash flow excluding interest payments in 2023, Deutsche Bank forecast. Tencent Music Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of China's biggest gaming and social media firm Tencent Holdings Ltd, has an existing licensing agreement with Universal and wants to strengthen its collaboration with a partial acquisition, the sources said, cautioning that no deal was certain.But industry bidders may find it hard to negotiate a joint venture deal with Bollore as they would not be able to secure a majority stake and have a meaningful say on UMG's strategy going forward, the sources said. Bollore wants to stay in the driving seat, they added. Some private equity funds including U.S.-based KKR are willing to enter an equity partnership with Bollore and help fund UMG's international expansion, even if they won't be able to take full control, the sources said.KKR previously entered a joint venture deal with Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, to back music rights management company BMG. It proved to be a lucrative investment for KKR, which doubled its money when it sold its stake back to Bertelsmann in 2013.One of the sources said other big buyout funds who are technology-savvy and have conducted similar investments in the TMT sector have shown interest in making a bid for UMG.For private equity investors the deal offers a high-profile platform to tap into the music industry, which is recovering from a 15-year long downturn and has grown for the past three years.Global recorded music revenues rose 8.1 percent in 2017 to $17.3 billion, according to record industry trade group IFPI.Streaming revenues represented the bulk of the growth, with sales up more than 41 percent, driven by 176 million paid subscribers.UMG owns 4 percent of Spotify, the world's most popular paid music streaming service, a stake that Vivendi executives have always described as a core investment, ruling out any plans to cash out.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But Brexit isn’t the only problem it faces – tighter emissions standards in Europe and slower demand in China aren’t helping either.New data out Friday showed new car registrations in Europe were down 4.6% on the year in January, suggesting that the industry is only slowly getting over the problems it had with new testing standards last year.

""In many cases, we are talking about artists who have never received royalties from the recordings.""Both lawsuits cover recording artists who served termination notices effective Jan. 1, 2013 or later.They seek injunctions requiring that the notices be honored, monetary damages and other remedies.The cases are Waite et al v UMG Recordings Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-01091; and Johansen et al v Sony Music Entertainment Inc in the same court, No. 19-01094.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

AGCOM said that under TIM's plan, by keeping control of the new company it would be in the position of being able to favor its own companies to the detriment of competitors.Pressure on TIM to spin off its fixed access network intensified after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the Italian phone group's biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, named Genish at the helm of the group in September 2017 and began to exert greater influence, which upset the Italian government.Since coming to power in June the government has placed the creation of a fast broadband network at the heart of its industrial policy and is drafting measures to help create one single network player for the country, which could combine TIM's network with that of smaller rival Open Fiber.TIM has also been caught since early last year in a battle between Vivendi and U.S. activist fund Elliott over how to revive the Italian company, which is saddled with 25 billion euros of debt.TIM appointed Luigi Gubitosi as chief executive in November.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The exit of Genish and the appointment of Gubitosi add speculative appeal but also strategic and governance uncertainty,"" Banca Akros said in a note. Gubitosi was appointed to the TIM board after a boardroom coup in May in which Elliott wrested control from Vivendi.The former Merrill Lynch banker is expected to pursue the activist agenda proposed by Elliott, which included the spin-off of TIM's network infrastructure and its merger with smaller, state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber, asset sales and a conversion of its savings shares.However, Genish, who had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, remains on the board and is determined not to give up without a fight.He said on Sunday he would seek to call a shareholder meeting to have investors decide on the drastic change in strategy. Vivendi voted against Gubitosi, a spokesman for the French investor said, adding it would be up to shareholders to decide what is the right board to roll out TIM's future strategy.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

46,"Nov 18, 2018 06:20PM ET","With new CEO, Telecom Italia 'opera' edges towards finale",nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Barely a year into the job as the boss of Italy's biggest telecoms company, Amos Genish had just finished celebrating a joint venture with electronics group Samsung (KS:005930) at a dinner in South Korea when a WhatsApp message arrived sealing his fate.The  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) CEO had been in conflict with some of his fellow board members over strategy at the former state phone monopoly but the company had said there would be no board meeting while he was away.""Amos, the board has been called for tomorrow morning at 7 to resolve on the revocation of your delegation of power. I'm sorry it happened when you're out,"" read the message, a copy of which has been viewed by Reuters.Twelve hours later, the telecoms industry veteran was fired in a board meeting he dialled into from Seoul. He was the third CEO to leave the group in as many years and his successor was chosen on Sunday.The new CEO, Luigi Gubitosi, is backed by U.S. activist investor Elliott Management, which had pushed for the spin off of the company's fixed line network (NetCo) and the sale of other assets, shifting the focus from the operational turnaround pursued by Genish.The sacking, which Genish called a Soviet-style putsch, was the latest twist in a corporate drama that one board member described in an email as an ""opera"".In theory, it paves the way for Elliott's plan. But conversations with sources both inside and close to the company show that in practice there may be many more twists to come.The underlying plot pits Elliott against TIM's main shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), over how to revive an underperforming business whose shares have dropped 27 percent this year alone.The outcome will decide both the future of TIM and whether Italy can overcome the digital divide that separates it from more advanced economies in Europe.Genish, who was appointed by the French investor last year, wants TIM to keep control of the network, deeming it strategic both to the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services and to the survival of the company's service operations.Elliott, which took control of the board in May, has an ally in Italy's anti-establishment government elected in June, which has prioritized the creation of a single broadband network to help Italy catch up digitally with European peers.A new draft amendment to a government fiscal decree, seen by Reuters on Friday, aims to advance the project via incentives to twin TIM's network with small, state-backed rival, Open Fiber.""All the stars are aligned, this is a massive project and it needs to be pursued, you can’t say you won’t do it because there are risks associated with it,"" a source familiar with the matter said of Genish.""DYSFUNCTIONAL"" ENVIRONMENTGenish supports the idea of a single network provided TIM is in control of the merged entity. A former Israeli army captain, he told Reuters he will remain on the board ""to fight and defend"" shareholders' rights.On Sunday, Genish said he would seek support to call a shareholder meeting as soon as possible to ask investors to vote on which strategy they prefer: his focused on organic growth or one he said would bring about a ""dismantling of TIM"".Gubitosi, a former CEO of telecoms group Wind, is politically well-connected as commissioner for struggling carrier Alitalia, making him well placed to negotiate with the government over a potential spin-off and merger with Open Fiber.Coming out of the board meeting that sealed his appointment, Gubitosi said he would seek to ""boost cash-flow generation, cut debt and examine with care and speed the project for the creation of a single network"".But if the last six months are anything to go by, getting the board to approve the network spin-off and a merger with its rival will not be a smooth ride.Genish said he had been working in a ""totally dysfunctional"" environment inside TIM, adding that several directors had been campaigning against him from day one.""It was totally counterproductive and there was constant uncertainty about my position,"" he told Reuters.Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan - backed by both Elliott and Vivendi in May - focused on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances. Some directors, however, wanted to see the shake-up proposed by Elliott, calling Genish's plan ""obsolete"", one source said.Business decisions were leaked to the media hours after they were taken, sometimes being texted even as board meetings were ongoing, sources said.New CEO Gubitosi campaigned for the job against another director from the Elliott camp, three sources said, pointing to rivalries that could persist. ""Some board members have been after Genish's job for months,"" said one. Gubitosi did not reply to a request for comment.Last week Genish was forced to agree to a 2 billion euro writedown of TIM's domestic assets, the people added, in a move that overshadowed signs of an operational recovery applauded by sector analysts. ""All these months, it was all about the network,"" a person familiar with board proceedings said. ""There was a lot of pressure to do the spin-off and sell assets.""The government's draft amendment said the creation of a single network company would have to be on a consensual basis. That means Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of TIM, will have to agree to any inclusion of its network.Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud De Pufyontaine said a full spin-off of the network was ""crazy"", although that comment came before Rome's plans were leaked. The French investor said this week it has no intention of selling its stake in TIM, so its battle with Elliott is only bound to intensify in the months to come. THE PERFECT ASSET?The Netco, TIM's biggest asset, is worth up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion), according to analyst estimates.Elliott has argued that spinning it off would realize up to 7 billion euros in hidden value, attract new investors and drive a re-rating of shares. It would help TIM offload big chunks of its 25 billion euros of debt and leave behind a capex-lighter service stub. Italy plans to introduce a regulated asset base (RAB) for the merged network firm, allowing regulated returns on investments made, the draft amendment showed.""This huge change makes NetCo into the perfect infrastructure asset investors love,"" one source said, adding a RAB would allow NetCo to trade at the 10-12 times EV/EBITDA multiple of RAB-regulated utilities such as Snam or Terna. TIM trades at 4.6 times, according to Refinitiv.With no examples of RAB-regulated NetCos in Europe, it could take at least 18 months to put such framework in place, a critic said, adding Italy's fragile political front could complicate matters further.Italy ranks 25th out of 28 EU member states in terms of take-up of ultrafast Internet, also raising questions about the possible returns for massive broadband rollout. TIM management has argued Elliott's calculations for the ServiceCo's cashflow and dividends were too optimistic and a NetCo spinoff risked leaving a much weaker stub behind, without the financial benefits that vertically integrated telcos enjoy, potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk. ""They have no idea what they are up against. If not done right, this will be financial suicide,"" one source said.An industry source said a single network operator made sense from an industrial and financial perspective but the competing interests of Elliot, Vivendi and the state made it very complex.""It's not so much about the issue as it is about the power play between the two opponents and the government on the sidelines that has nothing to do with industrial logic.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The chief financial officer of car maker  Fiat  until 2005, Gubitosi is pitted against Alfredo Altavilla, who until recently was also a top manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA).Both Gubitosi - who also headed telecoms group Wind - and Altavilla sit on TIM's board as independent directors proposed by Elliott.The first source said the name of Rocco Sabelli, a former head of Alitalia, was also ""drifting around.""Telecom Italia has given no reason for Genish's abrupt exit.Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, focusing on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances, but sources say some Elliott directors wanted him to put higher priority on a possible spin-off of its fixed-line networks.The spin-off could pave the way for the creation of a single broadband infrastructure company combining TIM's network with that of smaller fiber-optic rival Open Fiber.The populist 5-Star Movement, which took office with ruling coalition partner the League in June, has placed the creation of a fast broadband network at the heart of its industrial policy.A document seen by Reuters on Friday showed Italy was set to introduce measures to help create a single broadband infrastructure company.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

51,"Nov 13, 2018 08:34AM ET",Telecom Italia ousts CEO in boardroom tussle,nan,"(Reuters) - Italian phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) sacked Chief Executive Amos Genish while he was away on business in Asia on Tuesday, ousting a man viewed by some directors as an obstacle to their campaign for a more aggressive shake-up at the company.Genish was appointed last year to run the underperforming former monopoly by TIM's then controlling shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), but since then directors backed by activist fund Elliott have wrested control of the board. Telecom Italia said in a statement that it would meet on Sunday to appoint a new chief executive. It gave no explanation for the abrupt departure which Genish condemned as a Soviet-style putsch.Speaking a few hours after the board stripped him of his executive powers, Genish told Reuters that the environment inside TIM was dysfunctional and that several directors had been campaigning against him for months.Genish, who was born in Israel, said he was concerned about the future of the company and wanted to remain on the board.""I personally will and am committed to do anything to fight and defend the rights of all shareholders from my position as a board member.""I don't know why people always refer to me as a Vivendi guy because I want what's best for all shareholders,"" he added.BOARD TENSIONSFormer FiatChrysler executive Alfredo Altavilla is seen as a leading candidate to replace Genish and is currently on the board as an independent director.Luigi Gubitosi, who previously ran the Wind telecoms business in Italy and is also on the Telecom board is seen as another candidate, along with Stefano De Angelis the former head of the company's Brazilian business.Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, focusing on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances, but sources say some Elliott directors wanted him to put higher priority on a possible spin-off of its fixed-line networks. Elliott pulled off a boardroom coup in May when it secured two thirds of the seats on the Telecom Italia board after a shareholder vote.Vivendi reacted angrily to what it called a mean and cynical maneuver by some board members who moved secretly against Genish, convening the board while he was overseas on business.""We decry, we condemn the destabilization behind this decision and the disgraceful methods. We reserve all our rights to defend all shareholders interests,"" a Vivendi spokesman said.Elliott responded by saying that Vivendi had rebuffed previous attempts at dialogue.""We are open, and remain open, to a dialogue between us as shareholders of TIM,"" an Elliott spokeswoman said.On Monday, Genish said in a statement he supported the idea of merging TIM's fixed-line assets with the broadband network being developed by smaller rival Open Fiber, provided TIM was in control of the combined network. Italy is preparing legislation that could lead to such a merger, sources close to the matter have said. Chairman Fulvio Conti will hold the chief executive's powers until the board meets again on Sunday to appoint a new CEO. Tuesday's meeting was convened while Genish was visiting South Korea. He joined the meeting by phone, said a source familiar with the matter. TIM shares fell around 1 percent after the company statement but quickly recovered ground.           /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Based on Wednesday's closing price, the stake was worth around 645 million euros ($755 million).A second source familiar with the matter said core investors at the bank were now considering creating a lighter shareholder pact without Bollore that could rope in just under 20 percent of capital.The pact would remain in force until 2020 when the current board comes up for reappointment, the source said.The pact, which 15 years ago accounted for around 60 percent of capital, currently locks in 28.47 percent.Bollore's decision to leave the pact would not affect his other investments in Italy and both he and Vivendi remained long-term shareholders in  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) and  Mediaset  (MI:MS), the first source said.Vivendi, which has been looking to build a southern European media giant, is the largest shareholder in TIM but lost control of the Italian phone group in May to activist fund Elliott.TIM's share are down 51 percent since Vivendi first invested in the Italian phone group back in mid-2015, leading the French investor to write down its stake earlier this year.It also has just under 30 percent of Mediaset but has got bogged down in a legal spat with the TV broadcaster controlled by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.""Given the poor performance of his Italian investments and uncertainty created by the new populist government, it could be a first step to reassessing Italy,"" said IG analyst Vincenzo Longhi.CHANGING ROLEMediobanca, the leading shareholder in Italy's top insurer Generali (MI:GASI), was for years at the heart of Italian finance with key stakes in a number of leading companies.But in recent years it has sold most of those stakes to focus on traditional banking and plans to sell down its stake in Generali to help fund its wealth management business.Last year Generali fended off a takeover bid from Italy's biggest retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).""Bollore's move certainly increases the M&A appeal of Mediobanca as the pact's grip loosens and prospects improve,"" a Milan-based analyst said.Under the stewardship of CEO Alberto Nagel Mediobanca has become leaner and more profitable and reported record revenues in its last financial year.Other key shareholders in Mediobanca include Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI), asset manager Mediolanum (MI:MED) and the Benetton family's holding company Edizione.UniCredit, the biggest shareholder with 8.4 percent, has not announced any decision on its commitment to the pact.($1 = 0.8542 euros)"

59,"Sep 10, 2018 08:15AM ET",Elliott hits back at Vivendi over Telecom Italia accusations,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Gwénaëlle BarzicMILAN (Reuters) - Activist fund Elliott on Monday struck back at  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) after its accusations over the management and share price performance at  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) since the U.S. fund staged a boardroom coup at the Italian firm. Vivendi, TIM's top shareholder with a 24 percent stake, said last week the management of Telecom Italia (TIM) had been ""disastrous"" since Elliott wrestled board control away from the French media group in May. It also said TIM's share price had lost 35 percent since Elliott's involvement, while the fund had promised to double it within two years.Elliott-backed candidates succeeded in securing two-thirds of TIM board seats in May after a two-month campaign by the activist fund to shake up the way Vivendi had been running the former telecoms monopoly.On Monday, Elliott said it had not promised to double TIM's share price but offered ""an assessment of the upside potential"" to the stock over the medium-term if some of its proposals were executed by an independent board. Besides a governance overhaul, the activist fund had proposed a spin-off and partial sale of a soon-to-be-created network company, a conversion of savings shares, a return to dividends and asset sales.""To date, the board has not adopted any of those recommendations. Instead, the board has thus far adhered to Vivendi's own approach,"" Elliott said.Vivendi officials could not immediately be reached for comment.TIM shares were up 3 percent at 0.54 euros by 1102 GMT, outperforming a 2.2 percent rise in Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB). A trader said Elliott's note suggested the fund could resurrect its push for strategic changes at TIM, lifting the stock. Shares in European telecoms firms were also helped by a positive  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) report on the sector. FRESH IDEAS Under CEO Amos Genish, appointed when Vivendi controlled the board, TIM is working to execute a three-year turnaround plan focusing on a digital transformation, fixing the group's finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.However, the former state phone monopoly has been facing growing challenges in both fixed and mobile: broadband group Open Fiber is rolling out a rival fiber optic network while French telecoms group  Iliad  (PA:ILD) in May launched its low-price mobile offer for Italy.Elliott said Vivendi had ""fallen prey to the 'short-termism' it has previously decried"", casting judgment on the new board just four months after it was appointed.""If Vivendi now takes the view that fresh ideas are needed, Elliott would welcome its help in promoting value-creative solutions at the board level,"" Elliott added. Before the May boardroom coup, Elliott and Vivendi have been at loggerheads for months, with Elliott accusing Vivendi of serving only its own interests and the French media group saying Elliott was looking only for short-term financial gain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It added TIM's governance was ""failing"" and said the company and its results were suffering as a result.Vivendi, TIM's largest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, said, however, it remained convinced that the company had strong potential.TIM Chairman Fulvio Conti, appointed in May with the support of Elliott, rejected Vivendi's accusations, calling them ""absurd and unfounded"". ""Since its appointment, the board, in its entirety, has been and still is working to implement the strategic plan put in place by Vivendi,"" Conti said in a statement. He added that TIM, Italy's biggest phone group with about 50,000 employees, was in a position to face market developments and its competitors. TIM CEO Amos Genish, appointed when Vivendi controlled the board, is looking to execute a three-year turnaround plan focusing on a digital transformation, fixing the group's finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.

61,"Aug 29, 2018 11:01AM ET",'Spinal Tap' creators may pursue fraud claim in $400 million U.S. lawsuit,nan,"By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said the creators of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" may pursue the fraud claim underlying their $400 million lawsuit against  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA over the 1984 cult film.The decision on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles is a victory for Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Rob Reiner and Harry Shearer, who accused Vivendi of depriving them of a ""fair return"" from the film, its music and related merchandise.Gee said the plaintiffs could try to show that Vivendi's StudioCanal unit breached a 1982 agreement to finance and produce the film through self-dealing, failing to provide required accounting statements, nonpayment of royalties, and ""nefarious accounting"" to hide profits.""This alleged misconduct amounts to more than mere false assurances that defendants were complying with the 1982 Agreement,"" Gee wrote.Vivendi, through spokeswoman Solange Maulini, declined to comment on Wednesday. The Paris-based company has controlled ""Spinal Tap"" rights for nearly three decades.""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a pioneering example of the mock documentary, and is part of the U.S. National Film Registry.Its scenes include the band getting lost backstage before a concert; the deaths of drummers by spontaneous combustion, a bizarre gardening accident and other hazards; and amplifiers that ""go to 11"" rather than the normal maximum volume of 10.According to the complaint, Vivendi had estimated that the plaintiffs' share of ""Spinal Tap"" income was just $81 from merchandising between 1984 and 2016, and $98 from music sales between 1989 and 2016.Shearer, who played bassist Derek Smalls, had sued for $125 million in October 2016. His Spinal Tap bandmates Guest and McKean and the film's director Reiner joined the lawsuit four months later.""We are entitled to ownership and control over our film, music, and the Spinal Tap brand,"" Shearer said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We look forward to finally getting our day in court, at a trial, with the evidence that to date Vivendi has tried to hide from us.""Gee also dismissed a fraud claim against Vivendi's Universal Music Group unit, finding a lack of intent to commit fraud through the alleged underreporting of music-related profits.She said the plaintiffs could pursue a copyright claim to reclaim music rights.Gee gave the plaintiffs 21 days to amend their complaint to address the UMG claims. Shearer said they plan to do so.The case is Century of Progress Productions et al v Vivendi SA et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 16-07733.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Vivendi, reporting a 32 percent jump in first-half core operating profit, also announced it had entered in exclusive talks with Spanish group Grupo Planeta to acquire French publishing group Editis for an enterprise value of 900 million euros ($1.05 billion). Pressure had been mounting on Vivendi in the last few months to update investors on its plans for UMG -- worth between 20 billion and 30 billion euros ($23 billion-$35 billion), according to analysts. UMG artists include Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, Drake, Lady Gaga, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.The recent listing of streaming platform Spotify and the signing of several major license deals, including with tech giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have given a lift to the division's value and that of its parent company.“We started a process working on the different assumptions. We did receive the agreement to go up to 50 (percent) because it gives a range of possibilities just to welcome maybe more than one potential partner,"" said Vivendi's Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine on a call with analysts.Vivendi gave no clues as to potential buyers of the UMG stake, but said that it would soon be engaging banks to help identify strategic partners.The transaction is likely to be launched this autumn and could be completed in the next 18 months, Vivendi said in a statement. The group ruled out the option of listing the music division, citing the ""complexity"" of the process. Proceeds of the sale may be used to buy back shares and reduce the group's share capital, it said. LOADED WITH CASHA deal to acquire Editis would help the media giant, loaded with fresh cash thanks to the recent sale of stakes in video-games group Ubisoft and electronics retailer Fnac Darty, to further diversify its activities, which range from telecoms to advertising with Havas.Mediobanca is acting as financial adviser to Vivendi on the Editis deal.The potential acquisition of Editis and the 5.2 billion euros Vivendi has spent to buy stakes in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and Mediaset are all part of a plan to transform the group into an integrated European media powerhouse, de Puyfontaine said during the call, reiterating past commitments made by Bollore. Vivendi's investments in Italy currently reflect paper losses of over 1 billion euros and the group had to take a 512 million-euro writedown on the value of its stake in Telecom Italia in the first half.Some analysts questioned the relevance of a return to publishing, as Vivendi exited the industry in the early 2000s, with the notable sale of Editis. ""Editis is not related to what was the structure of the group once upon a time,"" de Puyfontaine said. Separately, Vivendi reported that first-half core operating profits had jumped by 32 percent, based on constant currencies and like-for-like businesses, to 542 million euros ($635 million), beating the average estimate in a Reuters poll of 513 million. Revenues over the period were up by 4 percent from a year ago to 6.46 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

72,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."
73,"Jul 13, 2018 02:17PM ET",EU digital chief urges lawmakers to ease tough copyright stand,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU digital chief Andrus Ansip on Friday called EU lawmakers to tone down their tough line on copyright reforms as Europe races to agree rules which will force tech giants to share revenues with publishers, broadcasters and artists.Ansip, who put forward the European Commission's proposal two years ago, said the overhaul was necessary to protect Europe's cultural heritage and create a level playing field between big online platforms.Regulators are particularly worried about creative industries losing out when their works are uploaded illegally on to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube,  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) majority-owned video-sharing site Dailymotion and Berlin-based free streaming music app SoundCloud and others.Ansip's comments came as lawmakers at the European Parliament scrambled to come up with a unified stance on the issue, a week after a majority rejected the tough approach proposed by a key committee at the assembly.Lawmakers are set to vote on amendments to the committee's proposal on Sept. 12 before kicking off talks with the Commission and the 28 EU countries to reconcile the three different positions.Time is short as the assembly faces elections in May next year while the Commission's mandate ends in November next year.""It is clear they have to move towards our initial proposal,"" Ansip told journalists. He said the vote showed that lawmakers were against a proposal that went too far.While the Commission's proposal targets big online platforms, the parliamentary committee subsequently broadened the scope to give more power to Europe's creative industries.""We have to get rules for the digital age,"" Ansip said.He said it was time to stop the lobby slogans, referring to the fierce campaign waged by both sides in the run-up to the parliamentary vote last week, and time to start looking for compromise solutions.(This version of the story has been refiled to fix the typo in Ansip's name in the first paragraph, clarifies proposal as European Commission in the second paragraph.)"

The Rome-based administrative court had already suspended the fine in June. It will hold a new hearing on the issue on May 8, 2019, according to a copy of the court ruling. In September, Rome began to look into the failure by the French media group, which is TIM's biggest shareholder with a 24-percent stake, to communicate to the prime minister's office that it had de facto control over the former state monopoly. After months of friction between Vivendi and the Italian government, Rome in October applied the so-called ""golden power"", allowing the government to veto strategic decisions such as asset sales and mergers at businesses deemed to be of strategic national importance.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"Jul 04, 2018 01:40PM ET",Content-hungry bidders circle 'Big Brother' maker Endemol,nan,"By Arno Schuetze, Douglas Busvine and Pamela BarbagliaFRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Several bidders, including Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), are preparing offers for TV production company Endemol Shine, maker of classic reality show 'Big Brother' and the dystopian 'Black Mirror' dramas, before an initial deadline next week. ITV  (LON:ITV), RTL Group's FremantleMedia and Lions Gate Entertainment are also eyeing Netherlands-based Endemol, sources close to the matter said, in a deal that comes as the rise of streaming giants Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime has thrown the industry into turmoil.The sellers are aiming for a price tag of between 2.5 and 3 billion euros ($2.9-$3.5 billion), said one banker familiar with the process, but this may prove ambitious with bids expected to be in the 2-2.5 billion euro range. That works out at roughly 10 times core earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which a second banker said would be the most the seller could hope to get.A source close to one potential buyer said Endemol's catalog was heavy with ageing formats, making it potentially less attractive than buying small production outfits and working directly with top creative talent.This person, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Endemol carried sizable debts and had already gone through a round of cost cutting, meaning the potential for synergies with an acquirer might be limited.""We're interested, yes, but skeptical,"" this person said. ""Is Endemol really a creative company any more? It's financially weak.""Endemol declined to comment. Its owners, private equity firm Apollo Global and Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.HUNGER FOR QUALITYThe sale comes as traditional TV players need more quality scripted serials to fill their fledgling video-on-demand services, with binge-watching online viewers less likely to be satisfied with their staple fare of reality and lifestyle shows.It also creates an opening for Liberty, the U.S. telecoms and pay-TV company built by John Malone, to leverage its distribution expertise and assets.Liberty may bid for Endemol via All3Media, the production joint venture it owns together with Discovery Inc, CEO Mike Fries said at a recent industry gathering.""It would be surprising if we didn't look at it through All3Media,"" Fries told C21 Media, adding Liberty would continue to ""get its feet wet"" through content deals.Discovery, for its part, has joined forces with Germany's ProSiebenSat 1 Media to build a German streaming TV platform and has invited others to join.France's Banijay Group, in which  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) owns a minority stake, may also join the contest for Endemol, another source said.Liberty, Discovery, ITV, Banijay, Vivendi and RTL - controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann - all declined to comment. Los Angeles-based Lionsgate, which has movie and TV divisions, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. Independence Day holiday.Apollo Global and Fox have hired  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Liontree to advise on the deal.They are ready to sell Endemol outright, although a potential buyer may seek a deal in which Fox retains a minority, said one banker familiar with the process.Liberty has just agreed the $22 billion sale of its telecoms assets in Germany and central Europe to  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and, assuming the deal clears antitrust scrutiny, will be looking to reinvest some of the proceeds. Britain's ITV and ProSieben are more financially constrained and would have to raise cash for a bid, a second banker said, while RTL, the European broadcaster, may lack the appetite for a big deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

80,"Jun 28, 2018 03:50AM ET",French design studio takes aim at hit game Fortnite on mobile phones,nan,"By Eric AuchardLONDON (Reuters) - This year's breakaway hit video game, Fortnite, which has drawn a younger generation to free-to-play multiplayer games, sending shockwaves through the console gaming market, has attracted new rivals ready to battle it out for vast mobile phone audiences.Oh BiBi, a small French studio run by former game designers from Gameloft, on Thursday is introducing FRAG, a first-person shooter that lets mobile phone users stage ""short but epic"" one-on-one battles that could attract more casual game players.Like Fortnite, FRAG sets out to break down the barriers that have existed between genres and platforms by bringing the free-to-play format to battle action games, which for technical reasons were once limited to higher priced consoles. ""At Oh BiBi we are on a mission to make mobile free-to-play fun to play by focusing on bringing epic multiplayer action games to mobile,"" co-founder and chief executive Stanislas Dewavrin said.Dewavrin and Oh BiBi co-founder Martial Valery were responsible for Gameloft’s biggest blockbuster titles more than a decade ago: Minion Rush, based on the cartoon character film franchise, which drew 860 million players, and Asphalt, an original car racing concept that counted 650 million players.Gameloft was later acquired by media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) .Fortnite, created by U.S.-based studio Epic Games and backed by China's Tencent, the world's largest game studio and investor, has signed up tens of millions of users in recent months for its last-player-standing ""battle royale"" format. The free-to-play game has challenged console-based fighting games for which users typically pay full prices of up to $60 per title.Oh BiBi, which was founded in Paris in 2012, has previously focused on driving-themed games. Its mobile phone focused arcade racing title SUP has attracted 30 million downloads to date. With its move into battle games, Oh BiBi is also incorporating social features to FRAG which will allow players to record and share their battlefield record with fellow gamers.Oh BiBi is set to launch a private beta test of FRAG in July that can be played against single opponents (https://www.ohbibi.com).Oh BiBi also said it has raised $21 million in new funding in a round led by Atomico, one Europe's most successful game venture investors, which has backed Supercell, Rovio, Teatime and Bossa Studios. French firm Korelya Capital also took part.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"Jun 20, 2018 12:43PM ET",Telecom Italia keen to discuss fiber-to-the-home tie-up with Open Fiber,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) is keen to discuss combining the Italian phone group's fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband assets with those of smaller rival Open Fiber, Chief Executive Amos Genish said on Wednesday.In a briefing, Genish said he saw clear economic benefits of such a tie-up, especially given the long timeframe for recouping the costs of multibillion euro investments to bring ultrafast internet to homes in Italy, where demand for speeds of up to 1 gigabyte per second is still very low. ""We are more than open ... to participate in a dialogue on such a combination,"" Genish said. A source familiar with the matter later added that TIM had spoken about the idea to the shareholders of Open Fiber, which is jointly owned by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and state-controlled utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI). The source said the next move in any tie-up depended on CDP's new management, due to be reshuffled following a recent change of government in Italy, coming on board.""The ball is in Open Fiber's court, we are willing to sit down with them,"" the source said. Open Fiber said it was ""open to cooperate with anyone who can add value to its fiber optic investments"". TIM's idea is that the combined FTTH entity could gain a regulated asset base (RAB) status, the person added. A RAB-based scheme allows operators to get regulated returns on investments they make in the infrastructure on top of fixed tariffs.TIM is not interested in combining its entire network infrastructure with Open Fiber, partly because the chance of that larger entity getting RAB status is very low, the source said. TIM is in the process of putting its network infrastructure into a legally separate company (NetCo) fully controlled by TIM. Next year, the group will evaluate further options for NetCo, including a potential stake sale and listing, the source said. Genish, who took over at Italy's biggest phone group last year, also said a three-year business plan presented in March was proceeding well and he was encouraged by the feedback he had received from credit rating agencies. He said he expected TIM to return to an investment grade rating next year, which would pave the way for the former state monopoly to resume dividends payments, last handed out in 2012.Genish said he was committed to TIM and to its strategy to 2020, dismissing suggestions he could leave early following a reshuffle after activist fund Elliott wrestled board control from top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV). However, the Israeli-born executive said there were some individual members on the board who were ""feeding untrue, unreliable, speculation"" behind the scenes, interfering with every day management. He did not give details.After its boardroom coup last month, Elliott appointed 10 independent directors - or two-thirds of seats - to TIM's board.Genish said all those members needed to act in accordance with their mandate of being independent and non-executive. He added the disruption neither impacted his nor the management's commitment to delivering on the new strategy plan.Commenting on the launch in Italy of new mobile rival Iliad last month, Genish said the French telecom operator's low-priced offer was ""aggressive"", but ""not disruptive"", and TIM's position remained solid.He added TIM was seeking clarity from authorities on whether Iliad's move to sell SIM cards via automatic sales machines violated a law that requires the identity of a person buying a SIM card to be verified by an authorized official. If the practice is deemed legal, TIM would probably adopt the same method to cut costs, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Tuesday's motion was opposed by 95 percent of the company's investors on Tuesday, including the Norwegian fund, whose spokesman said it believed companies were in a better position to set their own targets.The world's largest sovereign wealth fund had a 2.19 percent stake in Shell, worth around $6 billion, at end-2017 - its third-largest equity holding at that time.It has announced a push for the 9,000 companies it invests in to disclose more non-financial data, such as the amount of climate gas they emit, so that it can evaluate the risk climate change can pose to its investments.It also wants companies to have scenario analyses of how more heatwaves, droughts or floods might affect their earnings.Asked to comment on the fund's stance on the AGM motion, spokesman Thomas Sevang said: ""We believe the companies are best positioned to set the specific targets in-line with their long-term strategy.""Boards should integrate relevant climate change challenges and opportunities in their business management,"" he added, reiterating the fund wanted firms ""to take climate change into consideration and openly report on emissions."" Like many of its peers, Shell has faced growing investor pressure to address the need to reduce fossil fuel burning, forcing it to seek a delicate balance with a need to secure growing returns from its traditional business.In November, Shell outlined plans to halve carbon emissions from its operations and sales of its fuels by 2050, viewed as one of the most ambitious goals in the sector.The fund said it had also voted in favour of the remuneration package of Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, worth 8.9 million euros ($10.51 million) in 2017 and adopted by 75 percent of investors.The fund declined to comment on Wednesday on why it voted that way.Since 2017, the fund has called for executive pay packages to be simpler and more transparent and to not include long-term incentive plans.So far in this AGM season, the fund has voted against a stock option plan for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder.It has also voted against the pay of Disney CEO Bob Iger, Christian Dior CEO Sidney Toledano, Peugeot CEO Carlos Tavares, Vinci CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

91,"May 17, 2018 07:30AM ET",Blood but not much treasure: Vivendi's European media crusade,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Pamela BarbagliaMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - French tycoon Vincent Bollore's stated goal to create a southern European media empire faces defeat in Italy, despite pumping 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) into his biggest foreign conquest, raising questions over whether the strategy ever existed.Three years into the venture, the billionaire's media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) appears to have made more enemies than allies, estranging the Italian government and falling out with Silvio Berlusconi, the influential former prime minister and media magnate. Vivendi also fought a losing battle this month with minority investors for boardroom control of  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT), the business it hoped would form a key platform for distributing music, video and gaming content. ""I never believed in this pan-European empire story,"" a top-30 Vivendi investor told Reuters, saying the idea of cross-border synergies between media and telecoms companies was hard to follow.""It's a pure financial investment: Bollore sees an opportunity and tries to catch it; and then he's telling a story that nobody really believes ... he's been doing this his whole career, for decades."" Vivendi insists strong European players are needed to not ""be swallowed"" by the big U.S. media giants. ""If not, we are doomed,"" CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine said at a recent event. But Vivendi's failure to build a European powerhouse highlights the political challenges of stitching together national media assets, especially when the buyer limits itself to minority stakes without full control. Ironically, big U.S. firms like Comcast (O:CMCSA), Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and video-streaming giant Netflix (O:NFLX) are closer to building European heavyweights, eclipsing Vivendi either with outright acquisitions or by using online platforms and vast content resources to extend their reach.When it first became a TIM shareholder back in 2015, Vivendi said the phone group was a stepping stone to expanding in a market with significant growth prospects and strong appetite for quality content. It chose Italy, saying the country shared its cultural roots and would help create Latin content to complement that of its Anglo-Saxon rivals. 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' But its aggressive stakebuilding at TIM and Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS) has ruffled feathers and strategic alliances remain elusive. The stocks never took off and the two investments carry a 1.3 billion euro loss on Vivendi's books.""The plan to create a southern European media and telecoms giant is buried,"" Mainfirst analyst Jean-Baptiste Sergeant said. Italy's industry minister said Vivendi had been an ""awful"" investor. Rome eventually stepped in to loosen Vivendi's grip and even backed activist fund Elliott in its boardroom coup.""For Vivendi, Italy has become mission impossible,"" a banking source close to TIM said. ""There is no quick fix ... in one word they're stuck.""Vivendi received a stake in TIM when it sold off Brazilian operator GVT to  Telefonica  (MC:TEF). Bollore, already a long-term shareholder in investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), ""felt very comfortable in Italy"", one source close to the matter said. ""He saw an opportunity and the stock was very cheap so he bought more,"" the person said. ""Originally this was a pure financial investment.""Less than a year later Vivendi agreed to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit Premium, fuelling speculation of a future three-way alliance including TIM.The deal also involved Vivendi and Mediaset - controlled by Berlusconi's family - taking a stake in each other, thus cementing the ties between Bollore and the politician. But the deal turned sour when Vivendi backtracked from the acquisition, calling Premium's business plan unrealistic.The two sides have been embroiled in a legal spat since, only aggravated by Vivendi buying more shares to become Mediaset's second-largest shareholder after the Berlusconis.Vivendi keeps reiterating it is a long-term industrial investor in TIM. It repeatedly shot down speculation it could sell its stake on to French telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN). Any deal to sell the TIM stake to a rival looks unlikely, with its planned turnaround only at the start, and Bollore not in a position to negotiate a deal after facing graft allegations over his work in Africa, sources familiar with the matter said. ""Bollore has lost his credibility and he would not be in a position to sit down in front of government representatives and soothe concerns,"" the banking source added. Bollore strongly denies the allegations.A full takeover of either TIM or Mediaset is also out of the question, with Vivendi lacking the cash to pull it off. A plan to create a content joint venture between TIM and Vivendi's pay-TV unit Canal+ was put on hold after opposition from some TIM board directors. TIM clinched a content deal with Mediaset instead, while a separate deal between the broadcaster and Sky (L:SKYB) signed in April isolated Vivendi further.A chance to distribute pay-TV content over TIM's fiber optic network is also at risk if U.S. hedge fund Elliott has its way and the infrastructure is spun off and TIM loses control.To view a graphic on Vivendi and its Italian investments, click: https://reut.rs/2wOtcnvTRACK RECORD Yet despite the setbacks, Vivendi has no wish to exit Italy. Bollore brushed off any criticism over Italy, saying ""we don't count the chickens until they're hatched"".Many investors bet on Vivendi because of its UMG music label and what a potential listing could bring.They see the Italy venture as a distraction, although they also trust that Bollore would exit at a profit, as happened when Vivendi sold its share of gaming group  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP). ""He's playing Monopoly with the money available at Vivendi. You can decide not to play along, but our interests are aligned, his track record is not bad,"" the first investor said. Most investors expect Vivendi to sell out once TIM's and Mediaset's shares recover, although the size of the investments - it owns 24 percent of TIM and nearly 30 percent of Mediaset - makes finding a buyer difficult. Despite a recent rally, TIM's share price still trades 30 percent below the average price at which Vivendi entered. ""Bollore is pragmatic and rarely sticks around at companies he cannot control,"" another Vivendi investor said, but added the industrialist never committed to a single plan. ""It's hard to underestimate Bollore because historically he pulls out rabbits out of the hat,"" he added. Still, looking at Italy, it's hard to imagine how the 66-year-old can turn the tables in his favor. Marina Berlusconi, Silvio's eldest daughter, said Bollore and Vivendi had ""behaved with the delicacy and composure of Attila"" when they entered Italy.But unlike the king of the Huns, they did not conquer an empire, and their strategy was ""so well disguised that it makes you wonder if there is a strategy at all"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In the first set of results after activist fund Elliott wrestled board control from top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), TIM said comparable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 4.9 percent to 1.89 billion euros ($2.23 billion). This compares with a consensus of analysts' forecasts provided by the company of 1.96 billion euros.Italy's biggest phone group said comparable sales fell 1.6 percent to 4.74 billion euros, compared with expectations of 4.69 billion euros, hit by falling revenue in its only foreign market Brazil. Domestic sales rose 1.7 percent. Commenting on the outlook, TIM referred to targets set out in its 2018-2020 industrial plan unveiled in March. Adjusted net debt stood at 25.54 billion euros by the end of March, in line with expectations. In a separate statement, TIM said Vivendi was no longer a party exercising control and coordination over the company. The French group's control and coordination started after Vivendi appointed two-thirds of the phone group's board last year and named its own CEO as TIM's executive chairman. Vivendi lost control of the board after a shareholder vote on May 4.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

TIM said in a statement late on Monday the board had unanimously backed Genish's reappointment and would support the CEO and his team in implementing the 2018-2020 business plan.""I confirm my long-term commitment to the transformation of the group,"" Genish said.The 58-year old CEO is close to Vivendi but is also respected by Elliott, the Italian government and investors. He had previously said he would only continue in his role if the new board backed his plan, which focuses on a digital transformation of the company, fixing its finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.In an earlier statement on Monday, Vivendi said it welcomed the appointment of Genish and reaffirmed its long-term commitment to TIM.It said it would make sure the group's plan was ""coherently implemented in its entirety"" and that measures taken to improve profitability continued.ACTIVIST CAMPAIGNElliott launched its campaign to loosen Vivendi's grip over TIM in March. It built a stake of 9 percent to try to shake up the way Vivendi - which owns 24 percent - runs it.Elliott accused Vivendi, backed by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, of serving its own interests, while the French group said Elliott was only after short-term financial gains.After becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi gradually tightened its grip on TIM, appointing the majority of its board last year - all in the name of Bollore's stated ambition of building a southern European media powerhouse. The hands-on approach led to friction with politicians in Rome, concerned about a nationally important asset.TIM said on Monday it had temporarily given its head of security, Stefano Grassi, powers to manage all assets deemed strategic for national security and defense.Five of Vivendi's candidates, including Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, will be on the board, so the two sides will have to find a way to work together to help the company slash debt and become more competitive. TIM said the new board had also appointed Fulvio Conti, a former TIM manager and CEO of state-controlled utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI), as chairman.""Today, we have confirmed our full confidence in Amos Genish and his management team...,"" Conti said.De Puyfontaine, the previous executive chairman, was one of the board members who resigned in March, triggering the full board reshuffle.Beyond asking for a governance shake-up, Elliott had called for the spin-off and partial sale of TIM's soon-to-be-created network company, a conversion of savings shares, a return to dividends and potential asset sales - all moves TIM management had called premature, unfeasible and financially risky. But recently the U.S. hedge fund has toned down its requests, saying it would be up to the new board and management to decide whether and when to carry out any such initiatives.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

98,"May 04, 2018 02:10AM ET","Vivendi, Elliott set to clash in Telecom Italia board seat battle",nan,"By Agnieszka Flak ROZZANO, Italy (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's (TIM) (MI:TLIT) top two investors will face off for the first time on Friday as they put their battle over board seats at the Italian phone group to a shareholder vote. Activist fund Elliott has built a stake of 9 percent in the former state phone monopoly to try to shake up the way top investor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) - which owns 24 percent - runs it.The two investors have been at loggerheads for two months, with Elliott accusing Vivendi of serving only its own interests and the French media group saying the fund was looking only for short-term financial gains.Since becoming a TIM shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has gradually tightened its grip on Italy's biggest phone group and last year appointed two-thirds of its board as well as making its own CEO, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, executive chairman.The hands-on approach has led to friction with Rome, concerned about an asset it considers of strategic importance, and has unnerved other investors at the telecoms group.On Friday, shareholders are asked to pick between Elliott's slate of 10 independent Italian business heavyweights and Vivendi's list, that did little to allay governance concerns.The vote was called after the majority of directors resigned in March, triggering a full reshuffle. Whoever secures the most votes will get two-thirds - or 10 seats - on the board, while the remaining five will come from the other slate. Proxy advisers recommended backing Elliott's list, saying Vivendi had been damaging for governance and investor returns.But the vote is likely to be close given the size of Vivendi's stake, and will depend on where big institutional investors place their bets. Italian state lender CDP bought 4.8 percent of TIM, a move widely seen as political endorsement of the Elliott campaign, but what the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard might do is harder to predict, analysts and fund managers said. Vivendi's slate features CEO Amos Genish, who managed to impress the government in Rome and whose ambitious new three-year strategy, presented in March, was welcomed by investors and could sway the vote in favor of the French camp.Last week shareholders nearly unanimously backed Genish who, despite being a Vivendi ally, is well respected for his track record in the telecoms industry and is seen as key to re-launching the slumbering Italian telecoms heavyweight.This might prove a conundrum for some investors who may want to weaken the French grip but will not want to lose the CEO.Genish has said his position would be ""untenable"" if TIM ended up with a board that did not back his strategy, prompting Elliott to reiterate its support for the CEO and his plans. The activist fund also toned down its requests for major strategy moves, saying management and an independent board would evaluate whether and when to carry them out.Regardless of who wins, other shareholders and analysts say Vivendi and Elliott will eventually need to bury the hatchet to allow the new board to push through measures to slash TIM's debt, tackle growing competition and unlock value at a group that's been underperforming peers for years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

99,"May 03, 2018 12:20PM ET",U.S. hedge fund Elliott amps up campaigns in Europe,nan,"By Maiya Keidan, Arno Schuetze and Agnieszka Flak LONDON/FRANKFURT/MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Elliott is stepping up its activities in Europe, a Reuters review of data shows, as it sees more opportunities to unlock value for shareholders by pushing through management changes, company break-ups and merger deals.Filings with regulators show that eight of Paul Elliott Singer's activist fund's 15 disclosed positions in the first four months of 2018 were in Europe, compared to three out of eight in the same period of 2017.Activist hedge funds rarely disclose reasons behind their strategy. But, four sources familiar with Elliott's thinking said Europe offered a lot of scope, as fewer activist funds operated there than in the United States, and European companies have been subject to the attentions of activists for less time.The first quarter was the most active in Europe for Elliott in at least five years, separate data from research group Activist Insight showed. Last month, Elliott bought British bookshop chain Waterstones, disclosed stakes in software firm Micro Focus, shopping center operator Hammerson and hotel and coffee-shop company  Whitbread  (LON:WTB), and upped its holdings in Sky and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM). Industry experts say Elliott appears to be acting on a plan to open up a region that until recently was regarded as less fertile ground for activist funds.""I think it's a concerted effort that there is too much money to be made here and (they're) not going to be deterred by the structural or cultural defenses (anymore),"" said Chris Young, who works with companies on the receiving end of activist campaigns at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York. ""I think that Elliott - given their size, their relative aggressiveness versus other activists – are saying we've got the capital, we've got the patience that's necessary and we're going to try to now unlock Europe,"" said Young, who is working with Telecom Italia (TIM) where Elliott is attempting to overhaul the board at a shareholder meeting on Friday.Elliott has accused the Italian company's top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) of serving only its own interests, while Vivendi says Elliott is looking for short-term financial gains.A spokesman for Elliott said: ""Our activity in Europe is not a specific strategy shift. It’s just a function of the way this market is growing.""He said there had been a change in the way people view activism. ""There has just been a shift in the last few years in thinking and you're seeing it now in terms of capital deployed.""The fund, which in London is led by Singer's son Gordon, manages $35 billion in assets, dwarfing European rivals, like TCI Fund Management, with $17.5 billion, and Cevian Capital, with assets of more than 13 billion euros ($15.6 billion).It is among the biggest global activists by assets, with peers Icahn Enterprises and Third Point managing around $32 million and $18 billion respectively.Since it was founded in 1977, Elliott has made gains of 13.3 percent annually after tax, only ever ending a year down in 1998 and 2008, according to an investor letter seen by Reuters. Not all of its positions are activist, as in the case of its investment in Italian football club AC Milan.As well as making returns, activists say they improve long-term performance. More traditional investors say Elliott's swoop on a company does not necessarily mean better returns for long-term shareholders.""Any time an activist like Elliott comes in, the stock jumps as everyone is betting on some strategic changes happening soon. In reality, it takes much longer than that if it ever gets to that,"" said a U.S. investment fund which also owns TIM stock and fears the fight with Vivendi may drag on and harm the company. DISTRUSTThe U.S. market, where investors like Singer, Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s, has a long history of so-called ""activists"".Similar moves were not made in Europe until the 1990s and 2000s, when Elliott, TCI and Cevian all set up there.Europe has long been considered a more difficult place for activists due to cultural and structural impediments.Many European companies have bylaws, including voting right caps, loyalty schemes and other legal mechanisms that protect management, as well as a deep distrust of activists.Deutsche Boerse's Chief Executive Werner Seifert once called TCI's Chris Hohn the leader of a swarm of locusts in a book about the exchange's battle with the hedge fund.The Elliott spokesman said things had started to change and activist investors were getting a better reception.""In the last 12 months, a lot more shareholders are willing to consider that maybe management doesn’t know best.""Elliott registered its London office with the UK regulator in 2004. It does not have another base in Europe, but flies its traders in and out of various countries as necessary. ""Corporate constitutions in some European jurisdictions can make it more difficult to yield the right results for activist investors versus the U.S., but for Elliott they know the vagaries of European corporate laws and defense tactics very well,"" said Ian Harris, senior analyst at Elevation Securities.Last year, Elliott failed in its push for Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel to accept a bid from rival PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) and oust Chairman Antony Burgmans.Last week, Whitbread yielded to pressure from Elliott and U.S. hedge fund Sachem Head to spin off Costa Coffee, while German activist fund Shareholder Value Management's slate of board candidates at Italy's Retelit was approved.Sources told Reuters government thinking in Europe is gradually changing. Shortly after Elliott's investment in TIM became known, state lender CDP bought a 4.8 percent stake, a move seen as political endorsement of the activist investor.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

100,"May 02, 2018 08:34PM ET",Spotify hits wrong note with new customer forecast,nan,"By Eric Auchard and Munsif VengattilLONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA missed the beat on Wednesday. The streaming music leader fell short of investor hopes that it could turn free music listeners into paying subscribers at a faster clip, and its shares dropped as much as 9 percent.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading ahead of its first report as a public company, and analysts said expectations may have become overblown. They voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company's average revenue per user. First-quarter revenue also fell shy of analysts' average forecasts.The Swedish company, which began trading in an unorthodox direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange in April, reported steady growth by most financial measures but failed to deliver the commanding performance that could justify the bullish stock recommendations published in the days ahead of the results.Spotify said paid subscriptions for the second quarter would range between 79 million and 83 million, which at the midpoint was below Wall Street's consensus forecast of 81.79 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Spotify appears to be discounting many full-price music subscriptions and extending the length of free-trial plans to convert free, advertising supported users into paying subscribers.Average revenue per user in the first quarter fell to 4.72 euros, down from around 6.84 euros towards the end of 2015.""It looks like there may be too many discounts and too high a percentage of premium subs may be in for the cheaper family and student plans,"" Mogharabi said.Shares of Spotify ran up 14 percent from their first day of trade a month ago, closing at $170 ahead of its first quarter financial report. Afterward, the stock was trading at $155.50, down 8.5 percent at 2245 GMT/6:45 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Spotify reported first-quarter revenue of 1.139 billion euros ($1.36 billion), up 26 percent from a year earlier, or 37 percent excluding currency effects. The revenue was broadly in line with the 1.10 billion euros to 1.15 billion euros the company had forecast but just short of the 1.143 billion euro consensus estimate among 13 analysts.""Results and guidance are pretty much exactly in line with expectations, but the stock reaction clearly suggests investors were hoping for a little more,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. One soft spot was slow growth in North America, Cordwell said, which despite Spotify's global reach could be seen as a gauge for how well it is competing for subscriptions with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Spotify, which launched its streaming music service a decade ago, has enjoyed a surge in subscriber growth only in recent years. Since launching in 2015, Apple Music has grown rapidly to 40 million paid users and 8 million trial users and is looking to overtake Spotify in the lucrative North American market. Amazon Music, the No. 3 player in the global streaming music outside China, does not disclose exact figures but reported last week it had ""tens of millions of paid customers"" and that subscriptions grew more than 100 percent in the last six months. The Swedish company said it expected revenue for the second quarter of between 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion euros, up 10 percent to 29 percent year on year, including foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding currency effects, Spotify expects revenue growth of 20 percent to 38 percent. It projected gross margins of between 24 percent and 26 percent, roughly in line with the 24.9 percent margin it reported in first quarter.MUSICAL REVIVALOn Wednesday, Spotify kept its outlook for full year 2018 unchanged, with monthly active users rising to between 198 million and 208 million. It posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago. Spotify said it had 170 million active monthly users at the end of March, up 30 percent from the year-ago quarter. The rising popularity of Spotify's subscription services have led stock market investors to once again prize the music industry after shunning it for more than a decade amid a wave of piracy by users and in the face of major technology shifts.France’s  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the owner of Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest music label, said recently it is mulling a stock market listing of its wholly owned music unit.Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), which attracts three-quarters of China’s booming music-streaming market, has been reported to be eyeing a listing in 2018. TME is controlled by internet giant Tencent and also holds a stake in Spotify.Revenue from free, advertising-supported services which Spotify uses to woo new listeners to the service in order to eventually convert them to paying members, grew to 102 million euros in the first quarter, up 38 percent, year-over year. Advertising sales are a tenth of what it makes from subscribers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

103,"Apr 29, 2018 06:50AM ET",Telecom Italia CEO says his position 'untenable' if Elliott wins board majority,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) CEO Amos Genish said his position at Italy's biggest phone group would be ""untenable"" if activist fund Elliott manages to win the majority of board seats at a shareholder vote on Friday, according to a newspaper interview.Elliott has built a stake of 9 percent in the former state phone monopoly to try to shake up the way top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) - which owns 24 percent - runs it.The two investors have been trading blows for the past eight weeks, with Elliott accusing Vivendi of serving only its own interests and the French media group saying the fund was looking only for short-term financial gains.""The issue for me isn't about which side I'm on,"" Genish, who was brought in last year by Vivendi, told The Sunday Telegraph. ""I am the CEO of Telecom Italia and I am on Telecom Italia's side. The question is whether or not I have shareholders and a board who stand behind the business plan.""Elliott could not immediately be reached for comment.On May 4, TIM shareholders will meet to elect an entire new board after the majority of directors resigned last month, triggering a full reshuffle. They will have to pick between Elliott's slate of 10 independent Italian business heavyweights and Vivendi's list, which did little to allay governance concerns, but features Genish.This might prove a conundrum for some investors who may want to weaken Vivendi's grip but will not want to lose the CEO, who presented his 3-year business plan last month.At a separate vote last Tuesday, nearly 98 percent of shareholders present at a general meeting backed the new CEO who is well respected for his track record in the telecoms industry and as a dealmaker in Brazil. ""I can't see how a CEO could implement a plan he doesn't believe in,"" Genish said. Elliott has repeatedly said it fully supported Genish and wants him to stay on after the board renewal, although several proposals made by the activist investor clash with that of the current management. TIM's management has defended its own strategy, saying alternative moves proposed by Elliott were premature, unfeasible and carried financial and execution risks.Should Elliott win the majority, Vivendi could still appoint five board members one of whom would be Genish. However, the Israeli-born executive may choose not to stay on.""If the Vivendi slate does not get the majority of votes, because this is clearly the only slate to support our long-term industrial plan, I firmly believe my position as CEO would be untenable,"" Genish told the paper. New York-headquartered Elliott Management Corp was founded by U.S. billionaire Paul Singer and manages two funds with combined assets under management of about $35 billion. Its push for change at Telecom Italia is being spearheaded by London-based affiliate Elliott Advisors (UK).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a op-ed article entitled ""Should we abandon Africa?"" in the weekly Journal du Dimanche (JDD), the businessman said the accusations were not credible and stemmed from ""malicious"" and ""false"" information spread on local leaders on the continent. The article came four days after a French judge placed Bollore, 66, under formal investigation over allegations his conglomerate - a logistics empire in former French colonies across West Africa - undercharged for work on behalf of presidential candidates in Togo and Guinea.The company confirmed this week its African business interests were under investigation over the billing for work carried out in the two countries between 2009 and 2010 by its communications business Havas Worldwide.The group denied any wrongdoing.""How can one imagine that communication expenses of a few hundred thousands euros, accounted for in all transparency by a global and renowned communication group, could have determined investments of hundreds of million euros in port operations...,"" Bollore said. The executive added his group, which operates 16 container ports in West Africa, invested about 4 billion euros ($4.85 billion) in the region over the last 30 years. He said he also pushed French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), which he controls, to invest in the continent. Claiming that he is the target of a ""witch hunt,"" Bollore said the investigation could weaken the ties between France and its former colonies on the African continent.""Isn't there a risk that the France of Enlightenment they had so admired may break this bond through witch hunts and unfair and disproportionate inquisitions...,"" Bollore asked. Bollore is suspected of corrupting foreign public officials and complicity in corruption, his lawyer Olivier Baratelli said earlier this week.(The story was refiled to add the missing word 'between' in paragraph 8)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It has also voted against the pay of  Disney  (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) CEO Sydney Toledano,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) CEO Carlos Tavares,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.The fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.""It is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,"" Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.""If you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.""The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The  Weir Group  (L:WEIR), which the fund praised this month for being willing to ""challenge conventional thinking on remuneration"" by being simple and transparent.""The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,"" said Slyngstad. ""We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching."" The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's  Alfa Laval  (ST:ALFA) and Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa).NEGATIVE RETURNThe fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund's equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.""Any changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,"" Slyngstad told reporters. Some 66.2 percent of the fund's assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate. The fund's return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.The most negative contributions were Nestle (S:NESN), Facebook (O:FB) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed. Investments in Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Netflix (O:NFLX) made the most positive contribution.The Norwegian government withdrew 11 billion crowns during the first quarter to pay for public expenses, compared with 61 billion crowns for the whole of 2017.

Improving finances have led to a tentative re-evaluation of the music industry by stock market investors, who had shied away from the struggling media category for much of the past decade due to a wave of piracy by users and major technology shifts.Just in the past month, streaming music subscription leader Spotify of Sweden held a record-setting public stock offering. France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the owner of Universal Music Group, the world's biggest music label, said last week it was mulling a stock market listing of its wholly owned music unit.Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), which attracts three-quarters of China's booming music streaming market, has been reported by The Wall Street Journal to be eyeing a listing later in 2018. TME is controlled by internet giant Tencent.Industry leaders say the growing adoption of paid music streaming services is enabling the market to reach new regions of the world while helping weaning a generation of music fans away from free or pirated music.""We estimate that only half the world’s population lives in a thriving music environment and we want to bring the streaming revolution to all of it,"" Stu Bergen, from Warner Music Group, told reporters in London.During the 15 years ending in 2014, music sales plunged by 40 percent to $14.3 billion after music file-sharing services such as Napster ravaged sales of CDs while the rise of download services like Apple iTunes failed to offset those declines.IFPI - The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry - charts the recent recovery to the rise of streaming music. It said there were 176 million users of paid streaming subscription services in 2017. Streaming subscriptions in 2017 accounted for 38 percent of recorded music revenue, up from 29 percent in 2016. The streaming business expanded 41 percent, offsetting a 5 percent decline in physical sales and a 20 percent drop in download revenue.Despite these improving finances, revenues for 2017 are still only 68.4 percent of the market’s peak in 1999, IFPI said.Latin America and China saw the biggest market growth, with a rise in overall music revenue of 17.7 percent and 35.3 percent respectively. The United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France are the world's top five music markets by revenue. Brazil ranked No.9 and China was No.10 in 2017, IFPI said.IFPI renewed calls for governments to tackle the ""value gap"" between the value created by some digital platforms such as Google's YouTube for their use of music and what they pay those creating and investing in it. Rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been gearing to launch its own music video sharing service.""Things are looking good but there’s a structural fault in the system. Until we fix it, it will always be a struggle,” said IFPI Chief Executive Frances Moore.Ed Sheeran ranked as the top global recording artist overtaking Drake, who slipped to No. 2 and Taylor Swift who ranked third, according to the IFPI.(This version fixes date in paragraph 5)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a document released online on Tuesday, media group Vivendi - which is the top TIM shareholder - said it provided ""stability and expertise"" to the Italian phone company, in contrast with the ""quick fixes"" that Elliott would bring. Elliott did not immediately reply to calls seeking comments. TIM has lost a quarter of its market value since Vivendi first took a stake in mid-2015. Vivendi has since increasingly tightened its grip on Italy's biggest telecoms group, raising concerns in Rome over an asset Italy considers as being of strategic importance.The fall of TIM's shares, and the mounting criticism about Vivendi's strategy and control over the company, brought Telecom Italia to the attention of Elliott in March. The activist fund has since then built up a 9 percent stake and is asking for changes at the board at a shareholders vote on April 24. However, Elliott said it wanted the chief executive supported by Vivendi, Amos Genish.""Vivendi can provide stability and expertise while enabling other shareholders to invest and participate in any future upside,"" the French group said in the document. ""We are also committed to preserve Telecom Italia as an Italian company with Italian governance and representation,"" it added.""ITALY'S UNIQUENESS""Vivendi's defense of its stake in TIM came a day after Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda had described the French company as being an ""awful"" investor in TIM. Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, insisted that its 24 percent stake in TIM represented a 4 billion-euro ($4.95 billion) investment and that it had a vested interest in the success of the phone operator. It also stressed that Elliott was backing the 2018-2020 strategic plan laid out by Genish for TIM and that it did not see the how a divided board could help run the company.The appointment by Vivendi of two thirds of TIM's board last year, including its CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine as chairman, unnerved many Italian politicians at the time.""Perhaps Vivendi in the past underestimated some of Italy's uniqueness,"" the group said in the document, adding that it recognized the ""important stake"" of Italian authorities in ensuring that the phone company is well run.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

TIM has lost a quarter of its market value since Vivendi first took a stake in the middle of 2015. The French company is now TIM's biggest investor with just under 24 percent. Last year, Vivendi, using its position as TIM's largest shareholder and backed by investment funds, appointed two thirds of Telecom Italia's board and picked its CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine as chairman. It also made Amos Genish, a favorite of Vivendi's Chairman Vincent Bollore, CEO of the Italian group.Vivendi's management of the company has led to tensions with the Italian government and Rome eventually decided to use its so-called ""golden powers"" to ensure it had a say in some key decisions.The French company is also facing a challenge from activist hedge fund Elliott, which has a built a 9 percent stake, and wants to make changes to TIM's board.To increase its influence, the government bought a 4.262 percent stake in TIM through its investment arm Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) at the beginning of April.The CDP investment follows a decision by TIM to put its telecoms network, which analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros, into a legally separate company, called Netco and fully controlled by TIM.Calenda also defended CDP's move and said that Italy should have a single telecoms network, speaking in the interview. ""CDP has intervened to support a project to turn Telecom Italia into a (genuine) public company and spin off the network,"" the minister said, adding that CDP did not want to take control of the company.Calenda, a member of the caretaker centre-left government headed by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, remains in his ministerial post pending efforts to end a political stalemate following a national election last month.Some politicians and Elliott have advocated the creation of a single national network via the merger of Telecom Italia's NetCo with rival Open Fiber, a broadband firm jointly owned by the CDP and state-controlled utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI).Calenda had previously said that Elliott's plan for soon-to-be network company Netco to be listed or partially sold was in line with government's strategy to protect public interests.(Additional reporting Mathieu Rosemain in Paris,; Editing by Robin Pomeroy/Keith Weir and Jane Merriman)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"Apr 08, 2018 06:13AM ET",Proxy adviser Glass Lewis tells Telecom Italia investors to back Elliott's proposals,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) investors back a proposal by activist fund Elliott to replace six board members and shake up the way top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) runs the phone group, a document showed.Elliott, which wants to improve governance and performance at Telecom Italia (TIM), has built a potential holding of 5.7 percent in the company. Last month, it called for six Vivendi-nominated board members, including TIM Chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, to be replaced through a vote on April 24.""Elliott's proposals provide the opportunity to functionally evict those directors clearly serving Vivendi's interests and replace them with new, independent candidates bringing experience and expertise plainly germane to Telecom Italia's operational scope and strategy,"" the influential proxy adviser said in a report for shareholders seen by Reuters.TIM declined to comment, while Vivendi could not immediately be reached for comment. Since first becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has increasingly tightened its grip on TIM. It now owns 24 percent. Vivendi eventually appointed two-thirds of TIM's board and named its own chief executive as TIM executive chairman, raising concerns among other shareholders and politicians in Rome who consider the company of strategic national importance.The stakes in the fight for leadership at TIM were upped last week after Italian state lender CDP said it would buy up to 5 percent in the group to safeguard Rome's interest.Even if Elliott's board candidates are backed, no clear indication of who will end up calling the shots at Italy's biggest telecoms group is likely to emerge for several weeks.Following Elliott's move last month, eight board members nominated by Vivendi resigned, triggering a full board renewal at a separate shareholder meeting called for May 4.Elliott believes there will be no need for TIM shareholders to choose a new board in May if its candidates are elected in April. Meanwhile TIM says even if Elliott's candidates are elected on April 24, a new board would be voted in May.Shareholders have until Monday to present their slates. For the April meeting, Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders vote in favor of Amos Genish serving as chief executive for the next two years. Genish was co-opted by the board last September following the resignation of his predecessor, but his appointment has to be approved by shareholders to continue beyond the April AGM. Most institutional investors approve of Genish, despite him being an ally of Vivendi Chairman Vincent Bollore, because of his track record as a telecoms veteran and dealmaker in Brazil.Genish already features on the slate put forward by Vivendi.This may prove a conundrum for some shareholders who may want to weaken Vivendi's grip, but will not want to lose Genish, whose three-year business plan presented last month was welcomed by investors. At the same time, the Israel-born CEO is unlikely to remain at TIM if it ends up with a board that would not give him the majority backing necessary to push through with his business plan, sources close to the matter have said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The deal comes as Mediaset's struggling pay-TV business is rethinking its business model, and broadcasters in general are tuning their strategies to fend off competition from online content providers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Mediaset said in a statement the deal would allow it to broadcast its pay-TV Premium Cinema and TV series channels on Sky's satellite platform. In turn, the agreement would allow Sky Italia to use Mediaset's Premium pay-TV digital platform for its own offering of services and channels.On Thursday, Sky Italia signed a long-term deal with broadband company Open Fiber that will allow it to offer internet TV in Italy. ""The agreement reached today... ensures that both companies will enjoy a number of benefits... both operators will achieve optimisations that guarantee a new multi-platform scope and wider access for their respective clients to high-quality TV products,"" the statement said. Mediaset's Premium business, with under 2 million subscribers, has struggled to make a return on its large investments for broadcasting rights to Champions League and Italian Serie A soccer matches, and over time it has lost market share to Sky, its major competitor.The Milan-based TV group, controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, had agreed to sell Premium to France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) in 2016, but the deal collapsed, locking the two groups into a bitter legal battle. The failed agreement prompted a change in Premium's strategy, shifting it towards on-demand offerings and moving to a strategy that relied less on expensive, premium sporting content.""If you don't make alliances over pay TV to enrich the content offered to clients, other players, like Netflix, will come and eat you up,"" a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The statement added that the accord gave the Milan-based TV group the option to hand over to Sky Italia, between November and December of this year, full control of a newly created company, to which the technical, maintenance and operational assets of Premium would be transferred. ""The two groups are 'smelling' each other to see if they get along for future agreements,"" the source said.

122,"Mar 29, 2018 09:01AM ET","In Italy, activist investors find a happy hunting ground",nan,"By Maria Pia QuagliaMILAN (Reuters) - When U.S. activist investor Elliott Advisers laid siege to Italy's dominant phone company this month, a shiver went through the country's corporate sector.Once a gentile club that resolved its problems in quiet, behind closed doors, corporate Italy is increasingly becoming prey for activist shareholders. North American and British investors, who favor more aggressive investment styles, have been steadily building their presence in Italy as its cosy network of cross-shareholdings has broken down following the global financial crisis.Anglo-Saxon funds own 60 percent of the blue chip Italian stock market according to Borsa Italiana -- itself part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE).The Italian exchange does not give historical comparisons but corporate governance experts say the influence of these funds has been climbing.""The Italian market seems to have become ripe for activism, especially in the last three years,"" said Fabio Bianconi, director of corporate governance consultancy Morrow Sodali.""Activists in Italy, for example, are pushing for business simplification with spin-offs and disposals.""Elliott made its move into  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) early this month, declaring itself a new, minor shareholder and challenging the former phone monopoly's controlling shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), to launch a major shake-up. [nL8N1R51TP]TIM has lost more than a third of its market value since Vivendi first took a stake in mid-2015. Elliott, founded by Wall Street hedge fund pioneer Paul Singer, wants TIM to partially sell its fixed-line network, possibly through a listing, and has called for Vivendi's directors on the TIM board to be replaced.This week, a battle of activists broke out over Italian telecoms infrastructure firm Retelit (MI:LIT). German activist fund Shareholder Value Management lined up against a plan by other investors to depose Retelit's current chief executive as it supports the current business plan. [nI6N1QR01X]CHANGING DYNAMICSActivist investor Amber Capital, which looks for opportunities to improve corporate governance, has run 10 activist campaigns between 2015 and 2017 in Italy.""The shareholder structure of Italian companies has become less concentrated: when the financial crisis started to hamper banks' lending, controlling shareholders were forced to place part of their stakes with institutional investors,"" said Arturo Albano, corporate governance specialist at Amber Capital.The weight of institutional investors in Italian firms has more than doubled in the last 20 years, based on Bank of Italy and financial accounts data.Their participation in shareholder meetings has also grown.Until 2010, when a law clarifying voting rights came into force, shareholders were unclear of their voting rights in the event that their holdings had changed in the weeks leading up to a shareholder meeting. That often deterred them from voting.The law introduced a 'record date', usually seven trading days before a meeting, which gave funds certainty over how many votes they could cast at the upcoming meeting.""They are now in the position to back the proposals of other shareholders, including those of activist investors, if they create value for all stakeholders,"" Albano said.PUTTING DOWN ROOTSShareholder activism still faces challenges in Italy.Families control firms accounting for 33 percent of the Italian exchange's total market value and can wield powerful blocking stakes against activist investors.Politics can also get in the way: the Italian government holds indirect stakes in some of the country's most important listed companies and it has a legal veto -- its so-called 'golden power' -- over changes of control in strategic firms.Rome held a 30 percent stake in oil major Eni (MI:ENI) in 2009 when the firm resisted calls from U.S.-based hedge fund Knight Vinke to break itself up. It took three years before Eni sold its gas transport group Snam (MI:SRG) to state investor CDP.Politics have not deterred Elliott, whose push for a shake-up at TIM touches on assets deemed by the government to be of national interest, such as its fixed-line network and its submarine cable business, Sparkle.""Political risk is something activist funds are learning to deal with after Knight Vinke's mixed experience with Eni,"" said finance expert Hannes Wagner, of Milan's Bocconi University.Today's activism is sprouting from roots that were put down a decade or more ago, as share registers opened up and activist investors gained more experience of working in Italy.Last year, Wagner published a detailed analysis of 1,740 activist ""engagements"" with listed companies in 16 countries between 2000 and 2010, concluding that around 13 percent of Italian firms had had to deal with shareholder activism.""Italy is second in the list after the U.S. because it has a decent absolute number of engagements but a relatively low number of publicly traded firms,"" said Wagner, who studied instances where activist funds engaged management teams.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A final proposal to the communications regulator will be filed in the coming days.Last week, activist investor Elliot, which has built up a stake in TIM and wants to replace six board members to shake up how Vivendi is running the company, said it would push for NetCo's listing to unlock value.""You cannot list the network without an adequate regulatory framework and without the ability to stabilize the cashflow which is shrinking. The asset needs to acquire regulated asset base (RAB) status first,"" one of the sources said. Under a RAB-based scheme, on top of fixed tariffs paid by users, operators get regulated returns on investments they make in the infrastructure.TIM CEO Amos Genish has not ruled out selling a stake in NetCo in future, but would like control to remain with TIM. Any decision on a future IPO also needs to take into account TIM's remaining commercial operations, given the network - valued by analysts at up to 15 billion euros ($18.5 billion)- is used as collateral for part of TIM's debt. ""Ratings agencies are nervous and there is credit risk deriving from a potential spin-off,"" the source said. Elliott has also said it favors the creation of a single national network, which suggests it would push for the merger of NetCo with rival Open Fiber, a broadband firm jointly owned by utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and CDP. TIM is open to buying Open Fiber, the source said, but not at any price. Asked about Elliott's plan to replace six board members, the source said TIM rejected the idea of a board overhaul, adding a fully independent board would make reaching consensus difficult.""Management would not be confident it has the backing of the majority of the board,"" the source said, adding an alternative would be to allow Elliott to put two members on the board.TIM's board will discuss Elliott's proposals on Thursday, while investors will vote on the suggested board changes on April 24. Elliott also wants TIM to convert its saving shares into ordinary shares to help cut debt, and to reintroduce dividend payments.Genish has said TIM will pay dividends when financially feasible and the savings share conversion - last voted on in 2015 but blocked by Vivendi - would be discussed in due course.""The savings share conversion is only convenient if the spread between the two types of shares is 20 percent,"" the source said.

He restored the jury finding that the Interscope record label, part of  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA, and Clifford Harris, the rapper known as T.I. who added a verse to ""Blurred Lines,"" should not be liable.Jurors had awarded the Gayes $7.4 million, but U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt reduced the sum to $5.3 million, while adding royalties. Kronstadt also said T.I. and Interscope should be liable, but the appeals court disagreed.The ""Blurred Lines"" case has transfixed the music industry, prompting debate over the line between plagiarism and honoring works by popular artists like Gaye, whose songs also include ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" and ""What's Going On."" Gaye was fatally shot by his father in 1984 at age 44.Wednesday's decision prompted a strong dissent from Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, who said the decision let the Gayes ""accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style,"" and expanded the potential for further copyright litigation.""That is the consequence of the majority's uncritical deference to music experts,"" she wrote.Howard King, a lawyer for Thicke and Williams, said the dissent ""enhances the prospects"" his clients may prevail in an appeal. ""These are two entirely different songs,"" he said.""We are thrilled,"" Richard Busch, the Gayes' lawyer, said in an interview. ""The decision protects songwriters, and encourages new songwriters to create original works themselves.""Two of Gaye's children, Frankie and Nona, called the decision ""a victory for the rights of all musicians.""Williams, whose songs also include ""Happy,"" admitted in court to being a Gaye fan since childhood but said ""Blurred Lines"" and ""Got to Give it Up"" were similar in genre only.Thicke has in interviews acknowledged drawing on Gaye's song but maintained in sworn statements that he exaggerated his contribution to ""Blurred Lines.""Song theft lawsuits have proliferated in recent years.This month, for example, Miley Cyrus was accused of stealing her 2013 hit ""We Can't Stop"" from a 1988 work by a Jamaican songwriter.Some artists like Ed Sheeran have settled, while, in contrast, Led Zeppelin persuaded a federal jury in June 2016 it did not steal the opening guitar riff to ""Stairway to Heaven.""The case is Williams et al v Gaye et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-56880.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The real question is are my crown jewels really protected.""Pardo brought with him hackers that were on the offence teams of Israel's security services, including the Mossad, the Shin Bet and the army's elite 8200 unit.Many companies assemble so-called red teams of hackers to find vulnerabilities in their networks but this option is expensive and once they leave, their findings can quickly become outdated as corporate networks are constantly changing.Pardo, who while at the Mossad initiated the idea for a fund to help develop new spy techniques that was launched in 2017, said his company's platform continuously simulates attacks and exposes a network's blind spots.""We built a machine that sits on site doing the job done by human hackers,"" Pardo said, adding that the technology provides protection by blocking a network's holes.XM Cyber raised $15 million, mostly from Israeli billionaire Shaul Shani, who sold his Brazilian company Global Village Telecom to  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) for $4.5 billion in 2009.The company has customers in Europe, Israel and the United States in insurance, banking and critical infrastructure, though Pardo declined to name them.""By the end of the year we will have more than 30 paying customers,"" Pardo said."

135,"Mar 06, 2018 10:54AM ET",Telecom Italia shares jump as Elliot said to counter Vivendi influence,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) rose more than 6 percent on Tuesday after reports activist investor Elliott Management had bought a stake in the phone group to challenge the way top investor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is running the company.Bloomberg reported on Monday that Elliot may nominate directors to TIM's board and push for other changes. La Repubblica daily said Elliot had bought 6 percent of TIM and plans to present an alternative business plan for the company.Both TIM and Elliott declined to comment.TIM has lost more than one-third of its market value since French media group Vivendi first took a stake in mid-2015.On Tuesday, shares rose as much as 6.3 percent, hitting their highest level in more than four months. By 1449 GMT, they were up 6.04 percent.Later on Tuesday, TIM is due to present a new strategy plan under recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a favorite of Vivendi chairman Vincent Bollore. Investors hope the plan will set out a more aggressive course for the company, which has 26 billion euros ($32.24 billion) of debt. It is facing new competitors in both broadband and mobile and its only foreign business, in Brazil, is only gradually recovering from that country's economic malaise.The business plan ""should increase further interest for this equity story. Finally, news flow on Elliott could add some speculative appeal,"" Mediobanca Securities said in a note.Genish is TIM's third CEO in less than two years, leaving some investors guessing what is Vivendi's ultimate aim for the company: use it as a pillar of its plan to create a southern European media empire or as an asset to trade in the next wave of mergers in European telecoms.TIM has long been seen as a takeover target because it is smaller than many of its European rivals and it has first-mover advantage in Italy's ultrafast broadband market.Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of TIM, ousted Genish's predecessor, who cut costs and boosted profitability but clashed with the top investor and Rome over broadband rollout.Vivendi has increasingly tightened its grip on the former state phone monopoly by appointing two-thirds of its board and naming its own chief executive as TIM's executive chairman. The hands-on approach led to tensions with Rome, which considers TIM of strategic national importance. Italy's government eventually used the so-called ""golden power"" last year to ensure it had a say in some strategic decisions at TIM, a move widely seen as a bid to rein in Vivendi's influence.Genish undertook a charm offensive with the outgoing government and even proposed to separate the company's network assets to boost transparency and smooth the relationship. But the clashes between Rome and the phone group are bound to increase with the more radical government that is likely to emerge from last Sunday's elections. The anti-establishment party that performed best in the vote has long called for TIM's network assets to be state-controlled.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a way that is quite comforting for the market,"" Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index said.""(Italy seems) to have a knack for pulling out a political solution which the markets can live with and that's happened time and time again.""Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was particularly buoyant, rising more than 1 percent, led higher by autos stocks Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) which have been hit by concerns over an imminent trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum.Those worries have dissipated slightly as Trump faces a growing pushback from political and diplomatic allies as well as U.S. companies.European autos (SXAP) were the best-performing sector on the day, up 1.8 percent and putting the industry back into positive territory for the year, along with tech stocks (SX8P).Paper and packaging maker Smurfit Kappa (I:SKG) jumped 18 percent after rejecting an approach from International Paper (N:IP).

137,"Mar 05, 2018 09:58AM ET","Italian banks, bonds bear brunt of election fallout",nan,"By Valentina Za and Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - Italian bonds and banking stocks took the brunt of a market sell-off on Monday after a national election delivered a hung parliament and strong gains for anti-establishment parties.The prospect of power passing to a eurosceptic coalition, which might boost spending in defiance of EU budget restrictions and row back on the previous government's market-friendly reforms, turned the spotlight on Italy's 2.3 trillion euro public debt pile, one of the world's biggest.Its banks hold around 345 billion euros ($425 billion) of that debt and are considered a proxy for sovereign risk.""Italy is far from having sorted its long-standing problems, and now it will have new ones,"" Lorenzo Codogno, founder of LC Macro Advisors, said. ""Be prepared for long and complex negotiations that will take months.""By 1422 GMT Italy's main stock index (FTMIB) lost 1.3 percent as investors awaited more clarity on possible coalitions but took some comfort from an economic expansion that hit a seven-year high in 2017.The banking index (FTIT8300) was 2.9 percent lower.Benchmark 10-year bond yields  stood at 2.11 percent after rising to 2.14 percent at the open, their highest level since October.Italian bond yields risked spiraling out of control during the sovereign debt crisis of 2011-2012 and were only reined in by the European Central Bank's ultra-expansionary policies, which are being scaled down.With Bunds strengthened by the prospect of a new government in Germany after Social Democrats voted to join forces with Angela Merkel's conservatives, the yield premium Rome pays over  Berlin on 10-year debt rose to 1.54 percentage points, the highest since January.""The spread refrain has started anew but who cares ... Italians decide when it comes to Italy ... markets have nothing to fear,"" said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant League which emerged as the main party in a rightist alliance that got the biggest bloc of votes. UNCERTAINTYBoosted by Italy's fastest growth in seven years and expectations of a tighter monetary policy, Italy's banking index hit a near two-year high in February after state rescues last year removed the threat of a systemic crisis.The outgoing center-left government also passed measures to help lenders shed problem debts and encouraged mergers which are seen as necessary to beef up profits.Italian lenders hold 300 billion euros in soured debts after a deep recession, and their shares are seen as cheap as they trade below the value of their assets.After Monday's drop, the banking index is still 6.5 percent higher year-to-date but it is seen as vulnerable to a worsened economic outlook. ""The prospect of a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty risks weighing on the ongoing recovery,"" said Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. Mid-sized Italian banks with domestically focused operations and high bad loan burdens were worst hit. BPER Banca (MI:EMII) lost 6.4 percent, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) 5.3 percent and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) 4 percent. Heavyweights  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) lost only around 2 percent.The 5-Star Movement that won the most votes of any party has promised to compensate further small savers left out of pocket by a string of banking crises, and wants to split lenders' commercial and investment banking businesses.""Although the season of bank bailouts is virtually over, Italy should not let its guard down,"" Lazard's Managing Director Massimo Pappone said. ""Key issues are at stake: bank lending ... and the handling of so-called unlikely-to-pay loans (to borrowers in trouble but not yet insolvent), which can be a lever to support the economy.""Another notable Italian loser, with shares dropping 6 percent, was broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), which is controlled by the Berlusconi family and is mired in a legal spat with French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) over a derailed pay-TV deal.Berlusconi's party's poor results in the election are seen weakening Mediaset's bargaining power.

138,"Mar 02, 2018 11:01AM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) -1/ BEATING THE TRADE DRUMThe specter of a full-blown trade war has reared its head. U.S. President Donald Trump has mooted steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, declaring that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win"".Market reaction has been swift, with heavy stock market falls, especially in steel producers' shares - some names such as ArcelorMittal have tumbled as much as 5 percent. As for policy reactions, the European Union has pledged firm counter-measures, China urged Trump to show restraint, and Canada, the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said it would retaliate if hit by duties.The sustained multi-year rebound in global trade has driven much of the upswing in equities. Trade is currently expanding at annualized rates of more than 4 percent, the strongest since 2011.Now with trade war possibly brewing, global stocks are on course for a hefty weekly loss of around 3 percent. Next week could bring more.2/ BUMPY ROAD IN ITALYItaly goes to the polls on Sunday and with the worst case scenario of a euro-sceptic government looking remote, investors have been relaxed. In fact before Friday's trade tantrum, Italian shares had risen 2.5 percent year-to-date, bucking broader European equity losses.Still, with no clear winner expected and no immediate clarity on the new government's make-up, next week may bring turbulence. Atop equity investors' watch-list is media firm Mediaset, which will get a boost if its owner, right-wing leader Silvio Berlusconi, does well in the election. A good result for the 81-year-old ex-premier could give Mediaset more bargaining power in a long-standing pay-TV dispute with  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).Financials, a proxy for political uncertainty given their big sovereign bond holdings, may also see volatility, especially smaller names such as Banco BPM or UBI Banca with little or no foreign exposure. State-run firms such as Eni and Leonardo will face worries over management if the anti-establishment 5 Star movement scores strongly in the election.Bond investors meanwhile appear sanguine - Italy's 10-year yield touched a three-week low on Friday and the yield premium over German peers was the tightest in two weeks.3/ECB, BOJ MEETINGSA big week for central banks, with the ECB and Bank of Japan both deciding on policy. Neither is expected to change rates or alter their QE programs, but that doesn't diminish their importance. They are pumping more stimulus into the global system than anyone else, yet both are making noises about wanting to bring their extraordinary policy measures to an end.Trouble is, even though economic growth is strong, inflation continues to undershoot. Recent market turbulence, the strong euro and a dip in both headline and underlying inflation should ensure ECB officials hold off signaling the end of asset buys until the summer. The BOJ is juggling similar issues and the yen's recent surge, especially, will be unnerving.4/JOBS FOR ALLThe U.S. unemployment rate has held at 4.1 percent since October and is currently at a 17-year low. So will it go any lower? February jobs data is due on Friday March 9, with the latest Reuters poll of economists showing a consensus on a 4.1 percent reading.But is there any more labor left?U.S. Federal Reserve officials consider the labor market near or a little beyond full employment. The U-6 rate, which measures discouraged workers who quit looking for a job and part-time workers looking for permanent employment, is hovering at 11-year lows. Weekly jobless claims are the lowest since 1969. With tax cuts likely to juice up growth, the Powell Fed may raise interest rates more aggressively.So four hikes this year instead of three? Maybe. But Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Thursday he saw little evidence of the economy overheating or of a decisive upward move in wages, and nothing to suggest wage inflation was about to take off. A core PCE of 1.5 percent suggests there's still some slack in the economy too.5/CHINA CONGRESSChina kicks off its annual National People's Congress on March 5 with 3,000 delegates gathering in Beijing for the two-week session. Participants in the parliament will have more on their minds than the 2018 economic growth target; this will be kept steady around 6.5 percent, sources say.For one, President Xi Jinping has already set the stage to rule well beyond his current five-year term, possibly indefinitely. Parliament is expected to ratify this, stoking confidence in the reform process but also worries about Beijing's commitment to free market principles.The government recently took control of major insurer Anbang Insurance Group and is investigating the chairman of CEFC China Energy, a conglomerate with global ambitions. Some China watchers reckon that given financial system problems, the government may assume control of more firms.Investors will also want to see how the world's largest steel producer might react to Trump's plans to impose heavy import tariffs on steel and aluminum.What of markets? Money markets and yuan have been steady but Hong Kong-listed stocks have seen heavy selling by mainland investors (HSCE). Reasons put forth for the exodus of Chinese money from Hong Kong markets includes concerns over Beijing's tough crackdown on big-spending, high-profile global conglomerates and the Federal Reserve's policy hawkishness."

Traders said the underlying result missed expectations, while the lack of an update on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities also weighed. ""It's taken a while but after many false dawns over the past decade, RBS has finally managed to return an annual profit, albeit a minor one... and for that we can thank the fact that the bank hasn't settled its outstanding dispute with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.French auto parts maker Valeo (PA:VLOF) slumped 9 percent to a six-month low, making it the biggest faller on the STOXX 600 (STOXX). Its second-half profit fell on adverse exchange rates and raw materials prices, prompting UBS to cut its price target on the stock The STOXX was up 0.06 percent by 0936 GMT.

The STOXX is on course to end the week flat as markets stabilize and volatility calms following a turbulent start of the month that sent the index to a near-six-month low. It has since risen 3.5 percent from that level.Elsewhere among financials,  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) rose 1 percent after agreeing to sell the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group (L:PHNX) for 3.24 billion pounds, while Swiss RE rose 2.1 percent after reporting better than expected 2017 net income.Oil services firm  Subsea  7 (OL:SUBC) jumped 5 percent after news of joint venture talks with larger rival Schlumberger (N:SLB), which also supported shares in rival  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), up 2 percent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Neste (HE:NESTE) hit a record high following an upgrade from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which said demand for renewable fuels should continue to increase. Telecoms were lifted by a 4 percent rise in BT Group (L:BT), after Britain's telecoms regulator OFCOM set a more generous cap on prices the company can charge rivals to use its fast broadband service. Berenberg analysts upgraded BT to buy from hold saying clarity over the investment case was set to improve and that its share prices already reflected ""fairly negative"" outcomes on regulation, its pension review, and capex risk.The sector, which has been underperforming the broader market in the past few years on worries over competition, regulation and costly investment plans, was also boosted by gains in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)  on heavy newsflow about possible dealmaking.Three sources told Reuters that the Italian former phone monopoly had chosen Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to work on a spin-off of its fixed-line network.Another source said Telecom Italia could ditch a proposed joint-venture with Canal+, the pay-TV arm of its top shareholder French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to similar requests.The case is Rose v Hewson et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-01471.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

157,"Dec 10, 2017 06:10PM ET",Mediaset hopes truce with Vivendi to come with content deal with Telecom Italia: media,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset's (MI:MS) chief executive said he hoped the shared interest over TV content with  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) could pave the way to a truce with France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), speaking in a interview published late on Sunday. ""TIM needs our content, it is very interested in an agreement, but there is a pending matter with their controlling shareholder Vivendi,"" CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi told Italian daily Corriere della Sera. ""Let's see if these common interests on content will help us overcome difficulties,"" he added. Mediaset  and Vivendi have engaged in a legal battle since the French group last year unexpectedly backed out of a deal handing it control of the Milan group's pay-TV unit Premium. The rift deepened when Vivendi built up a 28.8 percent stake in Mediaset, controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Vivendi also controls TIM, with a 24 percent stake. Sources close to the matter have said the two sides are in talks over a possible deal, with Vivendi hoping to reach an agreement before a Dec. 19 court hearing in Milan on the case.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Dec 07, 2017 03:08PM ET","France's Ubisoft delays three releases, back catalog sales remain strong",nan,"By Alan Charlish(Reuters) - French video game producer  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP) said on Thursday it was delaying the release of three games and lowering its 2017/18 sales goals while raising its targeted profit margin.While the company opted to spend more time developing the new games, it said sales of its back catalog remained strong.Ubisoft has seen its share price almost double year-to-date, boosted by higher-than-expected sales and speculation about a takeover bid from French media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).The company said it would delay the release of ""Far Cry 5"" by a month to March 27, 2018 while also pushing back the release of ""The Crew 2"" and a franchise game initially planned for release in fiscal year 2018/2019.The company now sees 2017/2018 sales of 1.64 billion euros ($1.93 billion), versus its previous goal of 1.70 billion euros.However, it expects its operating margin to be higher than its previous target of 15.9 percent, at 16.5 percent, and it confirmed its operating income target of 270 million euros.The company also confirmed its targets for fiscal year 2018/2019.""Our back catalog performance throughout November followed the same excellent trends as in the first half of the year and sales for 'Assassin's Creed Origins' continued their positive launch trajectory,"" Chief Financial Officer Alain Martinez said in a statement.The decision to delay the release of the games was seen by analysts as a sign of confidence.“It shows that the sector is very strong at the moment, and that the company can nearly live on its back catalog,” said Midcap Partners analyst Charles-Louis Planade. “They don’t need to release these games because they can allow themselves to delay the release and maintain their [operating income] guidance.”However, Bryan Garnier analyst Richard-Maxime Beaudoux said investors could be disappointed as consensus estimates had seen the company beating its 2017/2018 operating income guidance.“The stock is expensive, with no speculative appeal from Vivendi over the next six months and there won’t be any outperformance for this fiscal year,"" he said.In November, Vivendi ruled out a hostile takeover of Ubisoft for six months after the video games maker beat forecasts, pushing its shares to a record high.($1 = 0.8482 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

159,"Dec 03, 2017 10:30AM ET",TIM's board to discuss network options this week: source,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - The board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) will this week discuss options for its fixed-line network, including possibly splitting it off, although no decision is expected to be made, a source close to the company said on Sunday.Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion). The pressure has intensified since French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), TIM's biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5. ""As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,"" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.""A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM's boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government's hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn't need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision ""on our terms when we really believe it's needed.""He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.Italy's communications regulator AGCOM will decide by the middle of next year how to address competition concerns regarding TIM's network, an AGCOM official said on Nov. 15.There are three options open to the watchdog, the official said, including moving toward imposing a clearer functional separation of the network.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We look forward to benefiting from their collective guidance.""Shareholders were led by the City of Monroe Employees' Retirement System in Michigan. Their lawyer, Max Berger, said in a statement the accord would provide ""meaningful benefits"" for shareholders and Fox News employees.The accord is not the first big derivative settlement involving a Murdoch-led company.In 2013, former Fox parent News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) reached a $139 million settlement of derivative claims that its board turned a blind eye to phone hacking at its London tabloids.Two years later, the Delaware court approved a $275 million settlement involving ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) over a stock sale by  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA.The scandal at Fox began in July 2016 when former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing Ailes of harassment. O'Reilly lost his job in April after being accused of harassment, and has denied wrongdoing. Ailes died the next month. Fox faces other private civil litigation tied to the scandal.The case is City of Monroe Employees' Retirement System v Murdoch et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2017-0833.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

163,"Nov 17, 2017 10:15AM ET","Vivendi's music unit UMG worth more than $40 billion, CEO says",nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Sophie SassardBARCELONA/LONDON (Reuters) - Vivendi's Universal Music Group (UMG) could be worth more than $40 billion, Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine said on Friday, helping buoy shares in the French media group following third-quarter results where UMG was a highlight. Vivendi  (PA:VIV) has floated the idea that UMG, the world's biggest music label, could be ripe for a stock market listing, boosting the group's shares in recent months amid concerns about its investments in Italy.Shares in Vivendi were up 4 percent at 1450 GMT, after falling in early trade. Strong trends in UMG and signs of recovery at Vivendi's Canal Plus unit helped offset overall third-quarter results that fell short of analyst forecasts on Thursday.Asked about UMG's valuation at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Technology, Media and Telecoms conference in Barcelona, de Puyfontaine said he had seen an estimate this week that valued the division at $40 billion. ""I wouldn't put a number, but I think that number is higher than the highest one that is currently expressed by the markets,"" he said. When asked if he thought UMG was worth more than $40 billion, he said: ""yes"". In April, Vivendi General Counsel Frederic Crepin had said estimates given by banks proposing a listing for UMG had valued the business at up to 20 billion euros. While UMG has significant growth potential as the leading player in a market dominated by three global music labels which pocket the largest part of streaming revenues, Louis Citroen, an analyst at independent firm Arete Research, said he currently valued the business at 18 billion euros ($21 billion). The rising value of UMG - which has a partnership with music streaming business Spotify - has also fueled speculation that Vivendi, chaired and controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, could sell a minority stake of the music division. ""This is an option,"" de Puyfontaine said when asked about it. ""We are not pro-actively working on that option,"" he added. Vivendi has built up stakes in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), MediaSet and video games group Ubisoft, and it bought advertiser Havas this year. Its shares are up by around 20 percent in 2017, outperforming a 6 percent decline on the STOXX Europe Media & Publishing index.TRICKY VALUATIONSUMG's core operating profit jumped 25.5 percent, excluding currency moves, acquisitions and disposals, in the first nine months of the year to 442 million euros ($521 million), helped by rising revenues. But that might not be enough in itself to justify such high valuations, said Mark Mulligan, a senior music analyst at MIDIA. ""The traditional ways of valuing record labels are becoming less useful,"" he said. ""Especially the value of catalog which is becoming less valuable as we are moving away from the age of greatest hits albums and classic album re-releases.""Interest in a potential UMG flotation comes as investors as trying to gauge the main beneficiaries of the digitalization of music products: distributors such as Spotify, or rights owners such as UMG.Spotify is gearing up to file for an initial public offering (IPO) late this year in order to float in the first quarter of 2018, sources have told Reuters. The listing would value the platform at $16-$20 billion, sources said in September.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.2 percent by 1000 GMT, taking its losses so far so far this week to 1.1 percent and leaving it set for its second weekly loss in a row. The pan-European benchmark index is still up more than 6 percent so far this year.""The big question remains as to whether this is merely a pause in the context of a wider correction or whether we’ll see a resumption of the uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of 2016,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.A speech from ECB President Mario Draghi in Frankfurt had little impact on stocks, even though traders said his tone was relatively upbeat on the economy.Among gainers,  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) rose 1.5 percent, reversing earlier weakness as investors digested an earnings update from the acquisitive French media conglomerate. Vivendi missed analysts' third-quarter estimates but kept its 2017 growth targets for revenue and EBITA. It also ruled out a hostile takeover of Ubisoft for the next six months. UBS affirmed its buy rating, saying the confirmed guidance suggested that a sales slowdown at its Universal Music Group unit could reverse in the fourth quarter, while it expected its Canal+ business to help grow earnings in the short term.Outside the STOXX,  Carillion  (L:CLLN) fell 33 percent after the UK builder said it would breach its financial covenant and warned on profits for the third time this year.""Some investors might think this is the end but Carillion is too big to fail. Government intervention is possible but this is a nightmare for ministers at such a sensitive moment for the economy,"" said ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson.Sky (L:SKYB) rose 3.2 percent. Reuters reported that Comcast (O:CMCSA) and Verizon (N:VZ) had both expressed interest in acquiring a significant part of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox's (O:FOXA) assets, including the European pay TV provider.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

168,"Nov 07, 2017 12:30PM ET","Privatizations Italian Style Raise Eyebrows, May Snub Investors",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s attempt to cut its ballooning public debt with a possible year-end sale of assets to the state lender is pointing to an unclear privatization strategy that excludes potential commercial buyers.“In this way, the government is able to raise some revenues without facing the risk of a political backlash triggered by the sale of an important asset,” said Wolfango Piccoli, senior analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London. It is a “privatization ‘all’Italiana’ aimed at removing from the state budget one entity while keeping it essentially under government control,” he added.The Italian Treasury may cede by year’s end part of its stake in energy giant Eni SpA and its holding in air-traffic controller Enav SpA in a bid to raise about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to meet its privatization targets and reduce debt, people familiar with the plan told Bloomberg on Monday.The state-owned lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA may buy the additional Eni stake -- now valued at about 1 billion euros -- and a 53 percent stake in ENAV, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. State lender CDP, as it is commonly known, is owned 83 percent by the Italian Treasury and 16 percent by banking foundations.The sales might help Italy to meet this year a target of revenue from state asset sales equal to about 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, or 3.4 billion euros.Eni rose as much as 1.7 percent on Tuesday to the highest in five months, giving the company a market value of 53.6 billion euros. Enav fell as much as 1.5 percent.Strategic Assets“The opportunism of such a use of CDP as opposed to a sale to private investors is apparent in the light of the current market value of a company like Eni that lots of investors would be happy to buy,"" said Riccardo Puglisi, economics professor at the University of Pavia.“To me that is window-dressing and revealing of a government that doesn’t want to reduce the presence of the state in the economy, implementing genuine privatizations and accepting the political consequences,” he said.CDP’s investments in state-owned companies include 25.8 percent of Eni and 35 percent of Poste Italiane SpA, the postal company that is also one of the country’s main insurance and financial operators. The CDP group owns a total 410 billion euro. About two years ago Eni agreed to sell a stake in oil-services company Saipem SpA to a fund controlled by CDP.Twice RevisedItaly last year failed to meet privatization targets that it said were key to reducing public debt that stands at 2.28 trillion euros, or more than 130 percent of the country’s GDP. It postponed a plan to sell a stake in the national railways company Ferrovie dello Stato as well as additional shares of Poste Italiane.This year the government led by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has twice cut its target for revenue from the sale of state assets. The goal, originally 0.4 percent of GDP, was first cut to 0.3 percent in April’s budget-planning document and then to 0.2 percent in September. The target for the three years through 2020 is of an annual 0.3 percent of GDP.The government’s privatization strategy does not include “the information needed to assess the program’s viability and thus amounts to a risk element” for the public finances, Giuseppe Pisauro, president of the watchdog Parliamentary Budget Office told lawmakers on Tuesday.‘Short Term’The government’s possible “review of its Eni stake is clearly an attempt to raise money to cut in the short term the country’s public debt,"" said Enrico Valdani, a professor of strategic marketing at Milan’s Bocconi University. The main question is whether that’s just an accounting game or if there’s a real strategic and industrial logic behind it, he added.In addition to the debt-cut target, “there might be other factors at play, including the need for the state to control strategic assets in the energy sector,” said Puglisi, adding that the government should decide “once for all what is the perimeter of those strategic assets.”Last month, Italy decided to exercise so-called golden power over  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA assets considered of national interest in a move aimed at reducing  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA’s influence over the country’s largest phone carrier."

Pooling resources will allow Canal+ and TIM to drive a harder bargain in the content war with bigger rivals such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It will also step up the convergence between TV content and distribution that is at the heart of the strategy pursued by  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), which holds a 24 percent stake in TIM, to create a southern European media empire.""The joint venture with Canal+ will in fact allow us to seize new opportunities for growth in a market undergoing continuous evolution through a commercial offer of fiber connectivity combined with premium video content,"" TIM Chief Executive Amos Genish said in a statement.TIM will have a 60 percent stake in the joint venture, with Vivendi's Canal+ holding the remaining 40 percent. The venture's board will have five members, three appointed by TIM and two by Canal+, while its chief executive will be chosen from among the TIM-appointed directors.One source close to the matter told Reuters last week that Mediaset could become part of the joint venture at a later stage, also as a way to help to settle a dispute between the Italian broadcaster and Vivendi. Vivendi and Mediaset have been at loggerheads since July last year, when Vivendi pulled out of an 800 million euro ($942 million) contract that would have given it full control of Mediaset's pay-TV arm Premium, saying the unit's business plan was unrealistic.The French group also received the strongest sign yet that Rome intends to rein in Vivendi's growing influence over former state phone monopoly TIM, announcing this week that it wants a say in TIM's decisions regarding assets of national interest.TIM said on Friday that, while it shared Rome's worries about the protection of national security and defense interests, it would examine the government's decisions and measures it is asked to implement in greater depth.The company plans, ""irrespective of any further evaluation in legal terms, to engage in all useful discussions with a spirit of full collaboration"", it added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We hope to close it during the first quarter of 2018,"" Roures said.Chinese investors have been snapping up sports and entertainment assets abroad.The acquisitions range from Swiss sports marketing firm Infront Sports & Media AG to Italian sports media rights company MP & Silva or soccer clubs Inter Milan and AC Milan.Orient Hontai entered into exclusive talks with Imagina's shareholders in May, scooping a dozen other bidders, including French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), Chinese real estate and entertainment firm Dalian Wanda Group Co or U.S. media company Liberty Media (O:FWONA).The selling shareholders are Spanish private equity firm Torreal, which holds 23 percent of the share capital, Mexican broadcaster Televisa (MX:TLVACPO), which owns 19 percent, and one of the firm's founders Gerard Romy, who has 12 percent.Imagina, Torreal and Romy declined to comment. It was not immediately possible to contact Televisa and Orient Hontai for comment.The deal was made at a multiple of 10 times 2016 core profit (EBITDA) and values the company at 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion), Roures said.Under a shareholders' pact with Orient Hontai, Roures and Tatxo Benet, who are the other two founders of Imagina with Romy and still each own a 12 percent stake, will remain at the helm of the company.""The shareholders' pact does not have any expiration date,"" Roures said.($1 = 0.8510 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

177,"Oct 13, 2017 12:11PM ET",Italy regulator explores forced Telecom Italia network split - sources,nan,"By Stefano Rebaudo, Agnieszka Flak and Giselda VagnoniMILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Italy's communications regulator is considering whether it could force Telecom Italia (TIM) (MI:TLIT) to put its fixed-line network into a separate company to address competition concerns, three sources close to the matter said.Such a move would result in the network becoming a legal entity in its own right, with its own governance and management structure although the company would still be fully controlled by TIM, the sources told Reuters on Friday.Politicians and rival phone companies have long called for TIM to separate its network, but pressure has increased since Rome took issue with the growing influence of French media group Vivendi (PA:VIV), which is its top investor with a 24 percent stake and recently appointed two of TIM's top managers.One option that could be explored to make the new company more independent from TIM would be to put representatives from the regulator, known by its acronym AGCOM, on its board, one of the sources said.If it went ahead with the plan, AGCOM would follow the example of British counterpart Ofcom, which forced BT (L:BT) to separate its network unit Openreach. The deal was finalised in March after a two-year regulatory battle.""It's not easy to do, and TIM would likely fight it, but it's technically possible,"" one of the sources said, adding the watchdog was conducting a market analysis to establish whether there were any grounds that would justify such a move.A TIM spokesman reiterated that the network, which is valued at up to 15 billion euros (13.38 billion pounds), is a strategic asset. He declined any further comment. Italy's biggest phone group is vertically integrated, which means it gives rivals access to its backbone infrastructure, but also competes with the same players in commercial activities. While TIM has put in place measures to boost transparency and ensure equal access to competitors, notably by setting up an in-house structure called Open Access, the regulator regularly reviews the set-up to see whether any changes are needed.AGCOM's latest review will be concluded before the end of the year, two sources said, adding that if it is not satisfied, the regulator could take advantage of a European directive allowing it to impose the separation of the network.What could prompt AGCOM to push for a split is the fact that Italy's antitrust authority has opened two investigations into TIM's broadband rollout this year, one of the sources said. The regulatory review comes as Vivendi's role at TIM is under increased scrutiny by the government which considers it a strategic asset.The president of Italy's ruling PD party said this week a separation of TIM's network could lead to a merger of the infrastructure with that of broadband rival Open Fiber, which is jointly controlled by utility Enel (MI:ENEI) and state lender Cassa Depositi e Presiti (CDP).Heavily-indebted, TIM has been criticized for putting off costly upgrades to its aging copper network.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In the document published by online magazine Key4Biz, Matteo Orfini said the state needed to push for the creation of a single integrated network company and eliminate infrastructure rivalry which he called ""unsustainable in the long term"". ""The status quo is not an option,"" he said.Listing a series of scenarios to resolve the network tiff, Orfini said a public or private Italian investor could flank Vivendi as a shareholder in TIM, to help sharpen the Italian phone group's business focus. Orfini, who is a lawmaker in parliament but not a government member, added that CDP could propose to buy part or all of Vivendi's stake in TIM.Orfini said Vivendi should be given the opportunity to give up control of Italy's biggest phone group and instead focus on its plan to build a European media powerhouse, by involving broadcaster Mediaset, in which it has built a stake of just under 30 percent.Plans to spin off TIM's network, which according to some estimates could be worth up to 15 billion euros ($17.7 billion), have foundered in the past over its valuation and because TIM insisted on hanging onto the business.Orfini said that while a spin-off might be difficult in the short term, the network could be separated into a regulated newco, fully controlled by TIM but legally distinct.That move, along with some state participation in TIM, could facilitate a later integration with network rival Open Fiber.TIM shares rose more than 3 percent after the position paper came out. The stock was up 2.1 percent at 0.77 euros by 1153 GMT.TIM, which considers its network a strategic asset, declined to comment.

The two companies have been at loggerheads since July last year when Vivendi, in an unexpected U-turn, pulled out of a 800 million euro ($945 million) contract that would have given it full control of Mediaset's pay-TV arm Premium, saying the unit's business plan was unrealistic.One of the sources said Vivendi would pay a first tranche of 250 million euros as part of a wider tentative agreement. The person said more money would be paid at a later stage, but did not quantify the amounts. One of the other two sources said Mediaset could join a joint venture being set up between Vivendi's own pay-TV arm Canal+ and Italian phone group Telecom Italia (MI:TLIT). Vivendi is the biggest shareholder in Telecom Italia with a 24 percent stake.This source said it was too early to say whether the two sides would eventually reach a compromise.""There is a long list of problems to solve,"" the person said.Mediaset, Vivendi and Telecom Italia declined to comment. Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday that Vivendi was considering making a cash and stock offer to settle the dispute as part of a compensation package that may be valued around 1 billion euros, pushing Mediaset shares up more than 5 percent. The stock closed up 1.8 percent.The sources refused to comment on the size of an eventual settlement. Mediaset and top shareholder Fininvest, the holding company of the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, have asked for damages totaling 3 billion euros.Since the dispute first broke out, the two companies have been trading blows, launching legal action and raising alarm bells in Rome, where politicians have already been growing increasingly wary of French influence over corporate Italy. Mediaset said in April it would have broken even last year had it not been for the failed sale of its pay-TV arm.The spat was aggravated in December when Vivendi bought shares to become the second largest shareholder in the Milan-based TV group after Berlusconi's family. The French company has repeatedly said the move was not hostile but a sign of long-term interest.(Reporting Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris, Sophie Sassard in London, writing by Agnieszka Flak; editing by Silvia Aloisi and David Evans)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The offices of French bank Natixis in Paris were also being searched, an Italian source with direct knowledge of the matter said. A Natixis spokeswoman declined to comment.Vivendi said Thursday's raid was the result of an ""unfounded and unjust complaint"" by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose holding company Fininvest lodged a criminal complaint last December alleging market manipulation against Vivendi.Berlusconi and his family are the biggest shareholders in Mediaset through Fininvest, with a 39.5 percent stake and 41.1 percent of the voting rights, according to Mediaset. Vivendi comes second with a 28.8 percent stake and 29.9 percent of voting rights. ""Vivendi’s management reaffirms that it acquired its stake in Mediaset totally legally and transparently and remains absolutely confident in the conclusion of this disagreement,"" the group said in a statement that confirmed the raid of its offices on Thursday. The police raids follow a formal request sent by Milan prosecutors to French authorities several months ago.Vivendi, led by tycoon Vincent Bollore, became Mediaset's second largest shareholder in late 2016 when it bought a 20 percent stake in the Italian broadcaster.Last December, when Vivendi acquired an 800 million-euro ($938 million) stake in Mediaset, two sources said Natixis was one of two banks mandated by the French group to carry out the purchase.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

188,"Sep 28, 2017 03:01PM ET",Telecom Italia picks ex-Israeli army officer as CEO,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) has picked a former Israeli army captain and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) top manager as its new chief executive, betting on him to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and appease politicians in Rome. Amos Genish was promoted just two months after being named general manager for operations at the Italian phone group, where Vivendi is an increasingly assertive top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.The choice of the 57-year-old telecoms dealmaker - a former chief convergence officer at Vivendi and a favourite of its chairman Vincent Bollore - comes at a time of growing unease in Rome about the French group's influence over Italy Inc.As Telecom Italia's (TIM) board met in Rome, Italian government officials discussed a possible fine for Vivendi on the grounds that it failed to notify authorities of its effective control of TIM - a company deemed strategic.Genish's predecessor, Flavio Cattaneo, left in July after clashing with both Vivendi and the Italian government. Smoothing the strained relationship between the former state phone monopoly and Rome will be a key priority for the new boss.""TIM must have a constructive collaboration with the institutions and regulators,"" Executive Chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who also serves as Vivendi's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.In an apparent olive branch to the Rome government, Vivendi left TIM's Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi - an Italian national - responsible for all assets associated with national security and defence, including international wholesale unit Sparkle.Genish takes the helm as TIM is fighting battles on several fronts: Its fixed-line business is losing value, new competitors are appearing in both broadband and mobile and its only foreign business, Brazil, is grappling with economic malaise.""The investment case remains complex,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which has an 'equal weight' rating on the stock, said in a note. MILITARY STYLEGenish's predecessor Cattaneo had launched a drive to cut costs, boost profitability and make Telecom Italia a more nimble competitor. He returned the domestic business to growth and raised investment in broadband and mobile infrastructure.Still, Genish inherits a company saddled with 25 billion euros ($29 billion) of debt, while the imminent arrival of low-cost French mobile operator Iliad is likely to squeeze margins. Also, rival investments in broadband infrastructure by power firm  Enel  (MI:ENEI) are undermining TIM's broadband drive.Barclays said Iliad's entry and Enel's plans created ""uncertainties about the revenue trends in 2017 and beyond"".Genish is TIM's third CEO in less than two years, leaving some investors guessing what is Vivendi's ultimate aim for the company: Use it as a pillar of its plan to create a southern European media empire or as an asset to trade in the next wave of mergers in European telecoms.TIM, whose board also backed ""in principle"" a joint-venture with Vivendi's pay TV unit Canal+, is regarded as a takeover target because it is smaller than many of its European rivals.Genish and Vivendi go back years: Genish sold Brazilian telecoms start-up GVT to Vivendi in 2009 and five years later convinced Bolloré to sell it on to  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), making a capital gain of $4 billion for the French media group.At Telefónica Brasil, Genish grabbed market share from rivals and turned it into Brazil's most profitable carrier in spite of the worst recession in more than eight decades.Investors hope Genish, who once described running GVT like ""a military operation"", will set in motion a similar overhaul at TIM.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

198,"Sep 01, 2017 05:17AM ET","Stocks, dollar advance ahead of U.S. jobs data",nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Gains for Europe and Asia pushed world shares back towards record highs on Friday, while the dollar crept up ahead of the monthly excitement of U.S. payrolls data.Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) had been at risk of their second red week in a row but a 0.5 percent early rise looked to have dug them out of trouble, following gains in Asia and on Wall Street overnight. (N)Near 6 percent jumps in French media firm  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and Swedish car and truck maker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) lifted spirits, as did a rise in euro zone manufacturing data that showed the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011.On-form mining companies (SXPP) remained hot as copper and iron ore [MET/L] headed for their eighth straight week of gains.There was also some relief the euro seemed to have stalled and this year's 13 percent rise wasn't hurting firms just yet.The latest factory PMI figures showed strong traction across all major euro zone economies and at 57.4 matched June's strongest reading since April 2011.It left the euro buying $1.1894  and despite having topped $1.20 on Tuesday for the first time since the start of 2015, it was down slightly on the week. ""The euro zone's impressive manufacturing upturn regained momentum in August, with a summer surge in factory activity suggesting rising goods production will support another strong GDP reading in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data's compiler IHS Markit.It left attention firmly on the dollar and U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due at 1230 GMT.Economists polled by Reuters expect an increase of 180,000 jobs in August after a 209,000 surge in July and forecast that average hourly earnings will have gained 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in July.""The wages component of the jobs report will be key,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. ""If earnings are to have picked up along with employment, we will see a straightforward reaction with U.S. stocks and yields rising and the dollar being bought."" The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 92.716. Although on an individual basis the greenback was up against the euro and the yen , the index was poised to end the week down 0.1 percent, having also hit a 2-1/2-year low.On Thursday, U.S. consumer spending data for July rose slightly less than expected and annual inflation advanced at its slowest pace in more than 1-1/2 years, diminishing expectations of a U.S. interest rate increase in December.That also fed into bond markets. Yields on U.S. Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction to price, were down for a fourth week in five and German yields  were down for a second week, having just seen their biggest monthly drop since February.SURGING EMERGINGEmerging market stocks were still cheering their eighth straight month of gains as China's yuan hit a fresh 14-month high and metals markets continued to rally. [EMRG/FRX]Industrial bellwether copper  was up 0.4 percent at $6,818 a tonne. The LME contract price touched a peak of $6,872 on Thursday, the highest since September 2014.Gold was near a 9-1/2-month high, supported as the dollar steadied and by lingering concerns over tensions in the Korean peninsula. [GOL/]Oil futures fell, partly reversing sharp gains from the previous session, amid turmoil in the oil industry with nearly a quarter of U.S. refining offline. [O/R]Hurricane Harvey, which brought record flooding to Texas, has shut at least 4.4 million barrels per day of refining capacity, according to company reports and Reuters estimates.""It looks like everyone thinks that the hurricane will affect refining more than production,"" said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.""Production will come back faster than refining so it is just going to exacerbate the situation where there's too much oil.""U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 1 percent at $46.76 per barrel.

199,"Sep 01, 2017 04:57AM ET","Results boost European shares, Indivior plunge puts pressure on UK mid caps",nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - European shares started September on a firm footing on Friday after three months of losses as financials rose and an update from  Vivendi  boosted media stocks.A record plunge in pharma firm Indivior weighed on British mid caps, however.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.4 percent and euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) gained 0.6 percent, with investors poised for the U.S. monthly jobs report later in the session which could provide clues on the Federal Reserve's next decision on interest rates.Germany' DAX (GDAXI) gained 0.5 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) rose 0.2 percent, though a near-40 percent slump in Indivior's (L:INDV) shares put pressure on the FTSE 250 (FTMC) which retreated 0.2 percent.""There has been some stock-specific volatility, but overall I think the markets are still relatively well-supported by the low interest rate environment, so that's probably going to be the case for the foreseeable future,"" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said.""While there is some ... negative sentiment towards markets, I think investors haven't really got anywhere else to go because bonds are yielding very little and cash is yielding very little,"" Khalaf added.Indivior's shares were set for their biggest one-day loss on record after the firm said it would appeal against a U.S. court ruling that generic drug maker Dr Reddy's (NS:REDY) had not infringed its patents, potentially opening the way to a rival to the firm's Suboxone Film opiod addiction treatment. On an otherwise relatively quiet day for corporate news, shares in Swedish vehicle maker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) jumped 7.2 percent and were on track for their biggest one-day gain in more than four months after setting new financial targets.Results drove some sizeable moves, with shares in French media firm Vivendi (PA:VIV) rising around 5 percent after the group confirmed its outlook, reporting better than expected profit growth for the year. Europe's media sector (SXMP) was the top-gaining sector, up 1 percent.""These results mean that investors are likely to believe management’s claim of a Canal+ turnaround and listen to music bulls even more,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said, upping their rating on the stock to ""equal weight"" from ""underweight"".French telecoms stock  Iliad  (PA:ILD) edged 1.1 percent higher on the back of robust first half earnings, which saw profit rise 22 percent thanks to winning new subscribers.Swiss security firm Dormakaba (S:DOKA) was another top riser, boosted 4.3 percent to an all-time high after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) began its coverage of the stock with a ""buy"" rating.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

201,"Aug 31, 2017 02:40PM ET",France's Vivendi confirms outlook as second-quarter shows Canal Plus improving,nan,"By Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) reported better than expected core profit growth for the second quarter on Thursday and confirmed its outlook for the year, saying its struggling Canal Plus pay TV arm was showing signs of improvement.Earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) grew 16 percent from a year earlier to 203 million euros ($242 million), it said in a statement. A poll of analysts for Reuters by Inquiry Financial had forecast on average an EBITA result of 183 million euros. Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, has ambitions to become a European media powerhouse and has made acquisitions in the telecoms, broadcasting, advertising and video gaming sectors to that end.Vivendi's two main units, Canal Plus and Universal Music Group (UMG), have offered contrasting performances lately. Canal Plus's results have been hampered by the operating losses of its French channels, while UMG is benefiting from higher streaming revenues.However, Thursday's statement said that ""tangible signs of improvement in revenues and EBITA"" had been seen at Canal Plus in the second quarter.Although the core French Canal Plus business is still struggling with falling sales, international pay-TV operations did well with a net increase in its subscriber base in the first half.Meanwhile, the Canal Plus French operation is beginning to benefit from its foray into the bundled telecoms, TV and internet market. A presentation accompanying the results showed that it now reached about 3 million out of its 8 million clients through telecoms networks.Vivendi reaffirmed an EBITA target for the year of 350 million euros for the unit.'DESPACITO' BENEFITSUMG, which Bollore has said he may list separately on the stock market, reported healthy 14 percent revenue growth for the first half in part thanks to impressive sales of Luis Fonsi’s record-breaking “Despacito”, featuring Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber.The song has become the most-streamed of all time with over five billion streams across all streaming platforms.It is the first non-English U.S. No. 1 in more than two decades, and in Britain, it has become the longest-running foreign language No. 1 in history.Vivendi has been under a spotlight in Italy lately after it built up significant stakes in  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) and the country's biggest private broadcaster,  Mediaset  (MI:MS). In July, the group bought out the 60 percent stake of advertising group  Havas  (PA:HAVA) owned by Bollore's holding company.Havas warned last week that it may not achieve its target for between 2 and 3 percent organic revenue growth in 2017 because of falling advertising spending and a downturn in high growth markets.However, the Vivendi statement said the integration was still expected to have a positive impact on group earnings for the second half of 2017.Yannick Bollore, one of the billionaire' s sons, heads Havas and has been lined up by his father to eventually take over as the boss of Vivendi.Bollore also appointed two of his allies to the Vivendi board on Thursday to exert even tighter control on the group.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A second source said a bilateral meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, scheduled for late September, could be key in deciding the matter.""The meeting today is one of a series,"" the source said.Vivendi referred questions to Telecom Italia (TIM), which declined to comment. The government's investigation aims to establish whether the French media giant actually controls TIM and if Rome can exercise a so-called ""golden power"" over it, enabling it to veto certain operations including asset sales, merger and any change of control of the company. TIM's international telecoms service provider unit Sparkle is seen as a particularly sensitive asset because of its submarine network which connects to countries in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Americas.Vivendi said earlier this month that it considered it had no ""de facto control"" over TIM under Italian law.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

209,"Aug 11, 2017 10:24AM ET",Telecom Italia advised that Vivendi's role doesn't breach rules,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Legal experts commissioned by  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) to give an opinion on Vivendi's (PA:VIV) growing influence over the company have said the French group does not breach Italian rules aimed at protecting strategic companies, a document reviewed by Reuters shows.Telecom Italia (TIM) has sent the opinion to the Italian government, which is looking into whether  Vivendi  failed to meet an obligation to notify it of its effective control of a firm considered a strategic national asset. Vivendi's influence in Italy came under increased scrutiny late last year as it built up a stake of 29 percent in the country's biggest private broadcaster,  Mediaset  (MI:MS). It had already tightened its grip on TIM, where it has held a stake of around 24 percent since March 2016.Rome's investigation aims at establishing whether Vivendi - which on July 27 acknowledged ""direction and coordination activity"" at TIM - actually controls the telecoms group and if Rome can exercise special powers over it.Such powers could range from a fine to imposing conditions or vetoing decisions taken at TIM that Rome may consider a threat to national interests.In the opinion drawn up at TIM's behest, two prominent Italian legal experts said Vivendi's role at TIM only related to management of the company and did not imply any change of ownership or control over TIM or its assets. ""The actions taken... do not constitute events requiring any need of notification and are not susceptible to triggering the use of any veto power,"" the document, dated Aug. 6, said.The Italian inquiry into the role of Vivendi in TIM comes at a time of increased tension with France after Paris temporarily nationalized STX France shipyards, cancelling a deal in which Italy's state-owned Fincantieri (MI:FCT) and another Italian investor would have taken a majority stake in STX. But in an interview with la Repubblica newspaper on Friday Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said the idea of resorting to special powers to protect TIM had nothing to do with the shipyard dispute.Calenda said he would be proposing new rules, but with no retroactive effect, to force companies buying over 5 or 10 percent of an Italian company to state their intentions.Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said on Monday it had no ""de facto control"" over TIM under Italian law, responding to a request by Italy's market regulator.It has appointed two-thirds of TIM's board and played a role in the departure last month of Chief Executive Flavio Cattaneo, whose powers were taken over on an interim basis by TIM's executive chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who is also Vivendi's CEO. Amos Genish, Vivendi's chief convergence officer, was also recently appointed general manager for operations at TIM.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

212,"Aug 07, 2017 03:22PM ET",Vivendi denies it controls Telecom Italia under Italian law,nan,"By Mathieu RosemainPARIS (Reuters) - French media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) said on Monday it has no ""de facto control"" over  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) under Italian law.Acknowledging ""de facto control"" over Telecom Italia would compel Vivendi to consolidate its accounts, including an adjusted net financial debt of 25 billion euros ($29.6 billion).Vivendi's statement, albeit technical in its wording, underscores the growing pressure it faces in Italy, where local authorities are increasingly questioning the way it has erupted in the telecommunications and broadcasting businesses.The group, led by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, has shaken up Telecom Italia's governance since becoming its biggest shareholder, with a 24 percent stake, and has lately placed two of its top executives at the helm.It has also built up a 29 percent stake in the country's biggest commercial broadcaster, Mediaset, becoming its second-biggest shareholder after former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.Italy's government is looking into whether Vivendi breached an obligation to notify Rome of its ""direction"" role at Telecom Italia, a company considered a strategic national asset.In an interview with newspaper La Stampa last month, the chairman of Italy's markets authority Consob said there could be a transparency issue around top Vivendi's management of Telecom Italia.""(Vivendi's) participation in Telecom Italia is not sufficient enough to allow it to exercise, on a stable basis, a dominant influence at Telecom Italia shareholders’ meetings,"" Vivendi said in its statement on Monday, to explain why it did not consider fully controlling the operator.The statement came two months after Vivendi got the conditional approval from European Union antitrust authorities for its plan to gain control of Telecom Italia.The notion of control is shared by antitrust, commercial and accounting authorities, but does not necessarily entail the same implications.“There’s a single concept of sole control, but three different fields in which this concept is applied (corporate law, antitrust law and accounting law),"" said Christophe Clerc, a Paris-based lawyer at Descartes Legal and financial law expert.""To add to the confusion, the existence of such a control is not necessarily assessed by the same bodies.”Under accounting law, the notion of control is key to determine whether a company exerting a significant influence over another company must consolidate the financial accounts."

Vivendi appointed two-thirds of the phone company's board and recently played a key role in the departure of CEO Flavio Cattaneo.According to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Vivendi will have to declare whether it controls Telecom Italia on Monday following a request from Italy's market watchdog Consob.Telecom Italia could spin off its fixed-line network and list it on the stock market, allowing the company to extract more value from the asset and offload some of its debt, according to Italian media reports.Britain's BT has faced similar criticism from rivals who say it has not invested enough in upgrading its own copper network to speed up internet connections around the country.After months of negotiations, the British regulator in March allowed BT to keep the network, but said it must be legally separated, with an independent board responsible for setting its strategy and operations. The Czech Republic is one of the few in Europe to separate its network infrastructure from consumer telecoms businesses to allow each to focus on its specialization and unlock value.In 2015, O2 Czech Republic, which included former fixed-line monopoly Czech Telecom and mobile operator Eurotel, was split.The fixed-line networks business was spun off to become part of the PFF private equity group controlled by the Czech republic's wealthiest man, billionaire Petr Kellner, leaving the phone operations with O2 Czech Republic."

In a statement released at the request of market regulator Consob, TIM said another reason for the July 27 declaration was a proposed joint venture between the phone group and Vivendi's pay-TV unit Canal+ that would strengthen the links between the two companies.The issue of whether Vivendi controlled TIM under Italian law was not part of the board discussions, it added. The statement comes just days after Italy's industry minister had asked the government to look into whether Vivendi duly informed the prime minister's office of it exercising de facto control over TIM.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Paris has suggested shared ownership. ""The Italians know how to count very well and 50-50 will not be accepted,"" Padoan said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

AGCOM said in April that Vivendi's stake-building at both broadcaster Mediaset and phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power in the country's telecoms and media sector. It told the French group to reduce its stake in one of the two companies to below 10 percent.Vivendi is the biggest single shareholder in Telecom Italia, with 24 percent, and also holds a 29.9 percent voting stake in Mediaset, making it the second-largest investor in Italy's biggest private broadcaster behind the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. ""AGCOM would rather see Vivendi sell the stake above the 10 percent threshold. But if they transfer it to a blind trust which is set up properly, but really properly, it could be okay"", the source, who has direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters.One condition for the blind trust to be considered effective would be that the transferred shares can never be used by the French group to vote at Mediaset shareholder meetings, the source said. Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, has one year to comply with the AGCOM ruling and avert a fine of up to 5 percent of its revenues - or 540 million euros. It has lodged an appeal against the decision with an Italian administrative court and the first hearing has been set for February 2018. In the meantime, the French group must tell AGCOM how it intends to comply with the divestment order. On Tuesday, AGCOM said Vivendi had submitted an amended proposal to reduce its position of influence at Mediaset, adding that further talks were necessary to make sure a ""structural"" solution was found.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

222,"Jul 28, 2017 11:39AM ET",Genish's arrival tightens Vivendi hold on Telecom Italia,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) named Vivendi's Amos Genish as its general manager for operations on Friday as the French media giant tightened its grip on the Italian phone group, where it is the largest shareholder.The appointment comes after Telecom Italia (TIM) parted ways with Chief Executive Flavio Cattaneo, who is leaving the company after only 16 months in the job following clashes with  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), which holds a 24 percent stake.Genish, whose latest job was chief convergence officer at Vivendi, formerly headed the Brazilian subsidiary of Spanish operator  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and founded GVT, a Brazilian mobile operator.A 57-year-old former Israeli army captain, he will oversee al of TIM's operations and be based in Rome, the company said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report. Cattaneo is the second CEO to leave TIM in less than two years after locking horns with the French group led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, whose stated ambition is to build a southern European media powerhouse. TIM's executive chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who also serves as Vivendi CEO, is taking on most of Cattaneo's powers on a temporary basis.In a conference call with analysts following first-half results, the Frenchman said further announcements on governance will be made in September. Some investment funds that hold TIM's shares have taken the latest leadership change in their stride, betting on Genish to complete the company's overhaul with a burst of deals - from a possible sale of the Brazilian unit to a spin-off of the Italian fixed-line network. NEXT STEPS Questions about potential M&A moves dominated the analyst call, but de Puyfontaine said he rejected speculation that has appeared in the press, declining further comment. The stock retreated after his comments and traded down 1 percent.De Puyfontaine said a combination of TIM with  Mediaset  (MI:MS), in which Vivendi has built up a stake of 29 percent angering the Berlusconi family who is the broadcaster's top shareholder, was ""not on the agenda"". He said a plan to set up a joint venture between TIM and Vivendi's pay-TV unit Canal+, which would foster Vivendi's goal of expanding content distribution across platforms, would be examined next month. A source close to the matter said first production could start in October. Regarding TIM's Brazilian unit, the company's only asset abroad, he said ""Brazil is part of the group and the good job that has been done by the team is going to be pursued"", without elaborating. The idea of TIM exiting Brazil has been gaining traction among investors since Vivendi became a top shareholder, because the French group sold its own Brazilian operations before investing in Italy. Genish's arrival only reinforces that expectation: he sold GVT to Vivendi in 2009 and five years later convinced Vivendi to sell it on to Telefonica, making a capital gain of $4 billion for the French.Asked about the future of TIM's fixed-line network, estimated by analysts to be worth up to 15 billion euros, de Puyfontaine said he would keep an ""open mind.""He said the idea of separating the network - an option favored by the Italian government - was ""interesting"" and ""something that will be discussed in future"", but it was not part of the company's current business plan.Rome, where Vivendi's growing influence on Italian business is under scrutiny, considers the network as strategic and some ruling-party lawmakers say it should be state-controlled, a neutral platform open to all.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

223,"Jul 27, 2017 09:40AM ET",Investors want to put ex-soldier on Telecom Italia frontline: sources,nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Agnieszka Flak and Tatiana BautzerPARIS/MILAN/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's fund investors are counting on a former Israeli army captain and telecoms dealmaker to complete the company's overhaul -- with a burst of deals.The company this week let go chief executive Flavio Cattaneo after just 16 months of a four-year contract, even though many regard him as the author of a remarkable turnaround at  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).The European telecom has nevertheless managed to keep the faith of investors thanks to the expected arrival of Amos Genish. Three sources close to the matter say he will become the new boss to finish the work begun by Cattaneo.Reuters could not reach Cattaneo for comment. An email query to Genish was referred to his employer and main Telecom shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), whose spokesman said he did not want to comment for the story.For graphic on Telecom Italia shares in the last two years click:  A spokesman for Telecom Italia, which has yet to announce a successor to Cattaneo, declined to comment.""Genish will get to work right away,"" said Tommaso Iaquinta, head of New York-based hedge fund ONCE Capital Management, among Telecom Italia's top 100 investors.He and some other fund investors say they are counting on Genish to spin off its Italian fixed-line network and perhaps sell Telecom Italia's Brazilian business before, ultimately, merging the remaining business with a bigger European rival. The listed Brazilian unit, Telecom Italia's only international operation, has a market value of about $8 billion.""The game is only starting now,"" Iaquinta said, adding that the changing of the guard should accelerate the deal-making required to realize the hidden value of Telecom Italia's assets.Sources say Genish, 57, has been chosen to take the reins of Telecom Italia by its controlling shareholder, Vivendi, where the Israeli-born executive works as chief convergence officer.They say he is a favorite of Vivendi chairman Vincent Bolloré who hired him in January after Genish left Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF).Bolloré had wanted Cattaneo to hand some key responsibilities to Genish, an idea that rankled the Italian and led to his exit, said a source close to the matter, adding that Vivendi viewed him as ""too independent"".When Genish starts calling the shots, it may be as general manager or managing director rather than chief executive, said the source familiar with the matter. Given Telecom Italia's chairman, Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, already has executive powers, there would be no need for a chief executive.In that scenario, De Puyfontaine could trump Genish but would leave key decisions to him, the source said. For political reasons, it would keep an Italian as deputy chairman, the source added. Rome, which has no stake in the company, would prefer an Italian to play a senior role in overseeing a business that holds strategic communication assets. 'TOUGH GUY'Genish and Vivendi go back years: Genish sold Brazilian telecoms start-up GVT to Vivendi in 2009 and five years later convinced Bolloré to sell it on to Telefonica, making a capital gain of $4 billion for the French media group.""Genish is part of the (Vivendi) family,"" another source close to the matter said. ""He is a tough guy, but he knows how to gather teams around him. He can create a lot of value.""As boss at Telefónica Brasil, Genish grabbed market share from rivals and turned it into Brazil's most profitable carrier in spite of the worst recession in more than eight decades. ""He has a strong leadership style and little regard for corporate politics,"" one former Telefonica Brasil executive said, recalling how Genish's brash manner sometimes ruffled feathers and ""created a stressful environment"".Genish co-founded GVT with the idea of connecting people in remote areas of South America with a satellite-based phone network which would later stretch from the jungles of Peru and Chile to guerrilla-controlled regions of Colombia.Investors hope Genish, who has described running GVT like ""a military operation"", will set in motion a similar overhaul at Telecom Italia, a former state monopoly saddled with 25 billion euros ($29 billion) of debt.That is why Telecom Italia's stock rose this week after Cattaneo's exit, albeit modestly.Cattaneo, who leaves the company on Monday, launched a drive to cut costs, boost profitability and make Telecom Italia a more nimble competitor. He returned the domestic business to growth and raised investment in broadband and mobile infrastructure.His achievements left Telecom Italia the awkward task of announcing it was ending the employment of its much-lauded CEO by mutual consent and was paying him 25 million euros to go.The announcement gave no reason and was issued days before the firm is expected to unveil its strongest half-year results in many years. UNFINISHED BUSINESSCattaneo left unfinished business.Telecom Italia's fixed-line business is losing value, new competitors are appearing in both broadband and mobile and in Brazil it is grappling with economic malaise.Investors expect Genish to tackle the future of Telecom Italia's fixed-line network, estimated by analysts to be worth up to 15 billion euros. The Italian government considers the network as strategic and some ruling-party lawmakers say it should be state-controlled, a neutral platform open to all.In any deal, Genish is expected to defend the interests of Vivendi whose growing influence in Italy is under scrutiny in Rome. The French firm has also recently built a heavy stake in the country's biggest private broadcaster, Mediaset.""Vivendi will expect Genish to be on their side,"" said Xavier Laurent, European Equities Fund Manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, which has shares in both Telecom Italia and Vivendi.Cattaneo is the second CEO to leave Telecom Italia in less than two years over what sources have said were clashes with Vivendi.That leaves some investors wondering about Vivendi's ultimate aim for Telecom Italia: whether to use it as a pillar of its plan to create a southern European media empire, or as an asset to trade in the next wave of mergers in European telecoms.Telecom Italia has long been seen as a takeover target because it is smaller than many of its European rivals and it has first-mover advantage in Italy's ultrafast broadband market.""Telecom Italia has always been, in many ways, a pawn in other people's games,"" said a top-20 Telecom Italia shareholder.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The government had in the meantime planned state-subsidised tenders for the project and said TIM's change of heart could undermine those tenders.TIM's u-turn led to a probe by Italy's market watchdog into potential anti-competitive conduct and also prompted clashes between Chief Executive Flavio Cattaneo and the company's top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV). Sources have said the dispute has contributed to Cattaneo's premature exit; TIM's board is set to discuss his departure after just 16 months in the job later on Monday. ""Today's step is clearly an exercise in damage-control by Vivendi,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note. The French media company is keen to maintain good relations with Rome, particularly as it is already under scrutiny for its growing influence in Italian business through its stake in TIM and a 30 percent share in private broadcaster Mediaset.SEVERANCE PACKAGEOne of the sources said the connections so far installed by TIM in rural areas had not been activated and no other work was planned for now. Another person added TIM was struggling to find partners to fund the rollout. TIM said on Sunday Cattaneo was leaving because the company had ""reached important results ahead of plan, which allows it to start a new phase."" It dismissed suggestions his departure was linked to clashes with Rome. Cattaneo, meanwhile, has defended what is likely to be a multi-million euro severance package, saying he delivered on many of his goals ahead of time, La Repubblica newspaper reported on Monday.""The severance package I will get is not a scandal,"" he was quoted as saying by a person close to him. Under a ""special award"" clause in his contract, Cattaneo could claim up to 40 million euros ($47 million) if his term is terminated early or his powers reduced. One source close to the situation said he would get 32 million euros, the biggest severance pay ever awarded to an executive in Italy after just over one year in office. Sources familiar with the matter said on Friday Vivendi executive Amos Genish, a former head at Telefonica's Brazil unit, was set to be appointed as TIM's managing director, effectively taking over from Cattaneo.La Repubblica said Cattaneo fell out with Vivendi, which has a 24-percent stake in TIM and has been tightening its grip on the company, because of its plan to appoint Genish at his side.Shares in TIM rose more than 3 percent on Monday, as analysts bet management change could help improve TIM's relationship with Rome and that the cost cutting drive set in motion by Cattaneo would continue. TIM is expected to report another strong set of results later this week. ""The strategic uncertainty could be balanced by a more positive relationship with the government and on speculation for potential corporate action,"" Banca Akros said in a note, citing the possibility of TIM spinning off its fixed line network.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

226,"Jul 24, 2017 09:04AM ET","Exclusive: Spotify, Warner hope to clinch royalty deal by September - sources",nan,"By Sophie SassardLONDON (Reuters) - Music streaming company Spotify is close to agreeing a new licensing pact with Warner Music Inc, the last big music royalty deal it needs before pushing ahead with a U.S. stock market listing, four sources familiar with the situation said. The parties are positive a deal could be signed by September as major issues such as granting loss-making Spotify a more favorable revenue split in return for making some new albums accessible only to its paying subscribers for a defined period have already been agreed, the sources said. However, the precise revenue split and the size of a potential guaranteed upfront payment to the label, home to artists including Ed Sheeran and Muse, have yet to be agreed, said two of the sources. ""The negotiations are at a crossroads,"" said one of the sources, asking not to be named because the talks are private, adding discussions were taking place daily. ""There are still a number of key points that remain to be agreed. If we manage to come to terms on these points, then it could lead to a very quick transaction. If not, any deal would remain at bay.""Others saw a deal being done by late summer.""Given the way talks are progressing, I would be surprised if we don't have a deal in September,"" said another source on the other side of the table. SPOTIFY TAKES WINGSweden's Spotify has grown in less than a decade into the world's most popular streaming music service, but its financial sustainability hinges on its ability to strike music licensing contracts at less onerous royalty rates.. Basic features of Spotify are free and supported by advertising while paying subscribers enjoy unlimited listening and other premium features.It faces mounting competition from far bigger internet players such as Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN), which can afford to subsidize their push into music by drawing on money they make in other businesses.The streaming firm, which was recently valued at $13 billion, is pushing for a 50-50 revenue split but Warner Music is demanding it retains at least 52 percent of the royalties, in line with the other labels, according to the sources.Under the terms of their current agreement, Spotify pays 55 percent of royalties to Warner.Warner is also pushing to receive a guaranteed upfront payment regardless of subscription growth, said one of the sources. The label, owned by billionaire investor Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, is also asking for protection against the potential rise of unsigned artists who could over time reduce its revenue share.This follows recent press reports that Spotify was filling its playlists with anonymous or little known artists to reduce the influence of the majors, said one of the sources. Warner would be ready to reduce its royalties rate from 55 percent to 52 percent provided these issues were resolved, said the same person. Spotify declined to comment.OTHER DEALS Earlier this year, the Swedish company struck a licensing deal with Vivendi's (PA:VIV) Universal Music Group (UMG) to pay the world's largest label a lower royalty rate. This was recently followed by a similar agreement with Sony Music.Spotify didn't disclose the terms of the deals but it was widely reported that the streaming firm had managed to lower the royalty rate from about 57 percent to 52 percent, based on growing volumes of paying listeners.In return, the streaming service agreed to restrict new albums to paying subscribers for a couple of weeks before offering access to free users. As of June, Spotify had 53 million paying users or 40 percent of streaming music subscribers worldwide, according to MIDiA Research. It has more than 140 million active users, including free listeners.By comparison, Apple had 19 percent, or 28.2 million music subscribers, in June, up from 20 million in December, while Amazon held 12 percent, or 16 million subscribers, MIDiA estimated.HEADING FOR THE MARKETOne of the sources said Spotify, which hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to advise it on a stock market listing, is still aiming to go public via a direct listing toward the end of this year or the beginning of the next. Spotify recorded revenues of 2.9 billion euros for 2016, up 51 percent from 2015, according to company filings in Luxembourg in June. Operating losses grew 48 percent to 349.4 million euros, but including financing costs, its losses before tax leapt 133 percent to 539 million euros. Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, according to MIDiA Research. The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chief Executive Flavio Cattaneo, who is expected to step down this week, has been at loggerheads with Italy's government for weeks over the group's plans to roll out superfast Internet in so-called non-economically viable areas - a project dubbed Cassiopea. It is the deteriorating relationship with Rome that other sources have said led to clashes between Cattaneo and Telecom Italia's (TIM) top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and ultimately prompted the manager's early exit. ""Cassiopea has been put on ice,"" one of the sources said.A second source said TIM had told Italy's antitrust watchdog that the connections so far installed in those areas had not been activated and no other work was being planned for now.TIM initially said it would not roll out broadband in areas where it could not guarantee a return on its investment, forcing Rome to step in with state subsidized tenders.But in March TIM said it would invest its own money in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed. This shift angered Rome, which claimed it undermined the state tenders.TIM's change of heart came after the phone group lost out in the first of the tenders to Open Fiber, a broadband unit set up by power utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) which the state drafted in to help after claiming TIM was dragging its feet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The watchdog said it would look into whether TIM had tried to obstruct the process, including by changing its own investment plans in the areas and appealing against the tenders.By slowing down the tenders ""TIM could obstruct the development of infrastructure competition and the entry of new rivals"", the authority said in a statement. The watchdog is also looking into whether TIM tried to pre-emptively capture clients in those areas, using anti-competitive commercial practices, locking them into long-term contracts and applying prices alternative players are unable to match. TIM, a former state phone monopoly, had initially said it would not invest in areas where it could not guarantee a return on its investment, forcing Rome to step in to ensure it made good on its promise to connect all Italians to superfast internet and kick-start a stagnant economy. But in March the phone group, whose main shareholder is French media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), said it would be investing its own money in developing a network in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed and justified the investment.That decision came after TIM lost out in the first of the tenders to Open Fiber (OF), a broadband unit owned by power utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender CDP. The development of ultrafast internet is a top priority for the government, which last year drafted in Enel to help bridge the digital divide between Italy and the rest of Europe after claiming TIM was dragging its feet. The two firms have since been embroiled in a race to roll out their networks across Italy, in a contest experts said could lead to a mutually damaging war where both lose money and infrastructure is duplicated.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The government's attack is worthy of a 'dirigiste' state. We are a private company and in Italy companies are free to do business,"" Cattaneo said. Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of Telecom, also holds 28.8 percent of Mediaset, the country's biggest private broadcaster. An Italian regulator has ordered it to cut its stake in one or other of the companies.""It seems to me Vivendi has said it intends to maintain its investment in Telecom Italia,"" Cattaneo said.Asked if the group was interested in bidding for soccer rights for Italy's top-tier Serie A league, the CEO said he would wait to see what the new tender looked like.""But in the next few days we will announce important agreements for other sports,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Revenue rose by more than 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros as paid subscribers increased to 48 million in 2016 from 28 million the previous year. Overall, the service said it now has 140 million monthly active users, against 126 million at the end of last year. The company, which depends on acquiring content licenses from a limited number of music majors, struck a new deal with Vivendi-owned (PA:VIV) Universal Music in April. The move could make the streaming platform more attractive to its top-selling artists, such Adele, Lady Gaga, Coldplay and Kanye West, by letting them release albums exclusively to premium users. American singer Taylor Swift recently made her music available again on Spotify and other streaming platforms. Spotify is now hoping to strike deals with Sony Music and Warner Music in the run-up to a market listing, a source close to the matter said in May.Most recently valued at $13 billion, Spotify could be floated within a year, a separate source told Reuters this month.The music streaming service, which competes for users and advertising with cash-rich rivals such as Apple Music (O:AAPL) and Amazon Music (O:AMZN) among others, will be the first major company to carry out a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange when it goes public this year or early next year, two sources have told Reuters.The company is working with investment banks  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Allen & Co to advise them on the process, the sources said.Last year Spotify raised $1 billion in convertible debt from private equity firm TPG Capital Management and hedge fund Dragoneer Investment Group.($1 = 0.8965 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

253,"May 30, 2017 01:43PM ET",Vivendi gets conditional EU approval to gain control of Telecom Italia,nan,"By Foo Yun Chee and Agnieszka Flak BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its plan to gain control of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) after pledging to sell the Italian company's majority stake in broadcasting services group Persidera.Vivendi is Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder, with a 24 percent stake, and tightened its grip on the former phone monopoly this month by appointing two thirds of its board. Last year it also took a 29 percent stake in Italian broadcaster Mediaset, controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, raising concerns about the French group's growing influence over Italian firms. The offer to sell the Persidera stake came after the European Commission voiced concerns that Vivendi might charge TV channels more for wholesale access to digital terrestrial television networks given both Persidera's and Mediaset's significant share in the sector. ""In order to address the competition concerns identified by the Commission, Vivendi committed to divest Telecom Italia's stake in Persidera,"" the EU competition enforcer said.Analysts said a sale of Persidera, which had a book value of 138 million euros in Telecom Italia's latest annual report, was far from certain given its owners have been unable to secure a good offer for the asset in the past. Telecom Italia owns 70 percent of Persidera, with the remainder in the hands of publisher GEDI. Telecom Italia could not immediately be reached for comment, Vivendi had no immediate comment and GEDI declined to comment. Telecom Italia and Vivendi shares were little changed after the ruling, with traders saying the market had already priced in the fact that Vivendi had de facto control of Telecom Italia.Vivendi had been expected to put forward its own CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine as Telecom Italia chairman when the board came up for renewal this month, sources said, but in the end incumbent Giuseppe Recchi was confirmed in the post pending the EU ruling. Analysts said investors were more concerned about the impact of a separate regulatory review in Italy on Vivendi's plan to build a media empire in southern Europe. Italian communications regulator last month ordered Vivendi to cut its stake in either Telecom Italia or Mediaset, saying the French group's stakebuilding at both companies was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power in the country's telecoms and media sector.The EU said its green light had no relevance to the AGCOM review and ruling. The French group, which is considering an appeal, has until about mid-June to present the regulator with a proposal.Some analysts expect Vivendi to cut its weight in Mediaset, with which it has been embroiled in a dispute over a failed pay-TV deal, and focus on Telecom Italia instead. ""The real value upside for Vivendi is in getting the Telecom Italia turnaround story right ... it's far easier for them to execute on that than try to deal with Mediaset in a contentious situation,"" said Paul Marsch, an analyst at Berenberg. Mediaset declined to comment.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

257,"May 16, 2017 01:07PM ET",Ubisoft sees slower mid-term sales growth but improved margin,nan,"(Reuters) - French video games maker Ubisoft cut its mid-term sales forecast on Tuesday but sees room to boost profitability by relying more on older games, the company said as it continues to oppose the advances of prospective suitor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).Annual sales for the year ending March 2019 are now expected to total about 2.1 billion euros ($2.33 billion), down from the 2.2 billion euros the company expected when announcing its medium-term targets in February 2016.However, the company maintained its operating profit target for the 2018/19 year at around 440 million euros, increasing its operating target margin to 21 percent from 20 percent previously.""We depend much less on new games launches...,"" Chief Financial Officer Alain Martinez said in call with reporters. ""This allowed us to largely offset the fact that we have one fewer game and still be able to have an improved profitability,"" he added.Back-catalogue sales, or older games, already accounted for nearly half of total sales in the past fiscal year, up from around a quarter a year ago.In the year just ended, Ubisoft reported a 4.7 percent rise in full-year sales to 1.46 billion euros, at the bottom of its lowered target range of 1.46-1.50 billion euros announced in February.Full-year operating income last year rose 40.7 percent to 237.7 million euros, in line with the company's original target of 230-250 million euros, Ubisoft said in a statement.The maker of the Assassin's Creed and South Park game series also announced it expects annual sales for the current fiscal year of around 1.7 billion euros, adding that first-quarter sales should account for approximately 170 million euros, a 22 percent increase on last year's figure.Operating income is expected to rise to 270 million euros, the company added.Martinez also again rejected the possibility of a takeover by French tycoon Vincent Bollore's Vivendi, its largest shareholder after gradually amassing a 25 percent stake.""We still consider that there is a lot of value to create at Ubisoft, and we still consider that our independence is the best guarantee to create this value,"" he said.Vivendi plans to speed up its expansion in video games and advertising this year, with Ubisoft and Havas expected to be the first targets, sources close to the matter said last month.Following Vivendi's move on Friday seeking to buy Bollore's 60 percent stake in the advertising agency, ""there is a sense that a deal for Ubisoft could follow,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Conor O'Shea wrote in a note after the announcement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

266,"Apr 25, 2017 02:40AM ET",Exclusive: Vivendi to accelerate expansion in video games and advertising - sources,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - French media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) will accelerate acquisitions in video games and advertising this year to allay investor concerns about its strategy, mixed results and poor share performance, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.Advertising group Havas and video games maker Ubisoft are expected to be the first targets as Vivendi moves into the next phase of its expansion, the sources said.In three years, Chairman Vincent Bollore has spent nearly 15 billion euros ($16 billion) of Vivendi's cash on shareholders and acquisitions, including taking large stakes in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and Italian broadcaster Mediaset.Yet Vivendi's shares have fallen by about 3 percent over the period and analysts are still awaiting more details from the company about how exactly its strategy will pan out.Bollore is expected to defend his record at an annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday in Paris, a rare occasion for the billionaire to flesh out his plan to turn Vivendi into an integrated European media powerhouse.On paper, merging Havas with Vivendi would be the easiest deal as the ad company is 60 percent owned by Bollore and run by his son Yannick, who joined Vivendi's board last year. Bollore is also Vivendi's biggest shareholder with 20.65 percent.In the case of Ubisoft, which is 25 percent owned by Vivendi, resistance from its founding Guillemot family could potentially lead to a costly, unsolicited full takeover bid. ""Vivendi is moving to the second phase, everything will take place this year,"" one of the sources said, referring to Havas and Ubisoft. ""The logical thing would be to buy Ubisoft,"" the second source said, adding that Bollore would not buy the video games maker at any price and could consider other targets in China. ITALIAN SETBACKS Bollore, a 65-year-old businessman who made his fortune by building a family-run conglomerate with activities from logistics to electric batteries to advertising, is known for his capacity to turn businesses around and make shrewd investments. But he has suffered a series of setbacks lately in Italy, a country he knows well through his investment bank in Mediobanca, raising questions about his capacity to deliver a rapid return on investments there and his long-term strategy.""The lack of visibility over Vivendi's intentions regarding its existing stakes (Telecom Italia, Mediaset) and a potential acquisition of Havas could remain an overhang on Vivendi's share price in the near term,"" Lisa Yang, an analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said in a note to clients this month.Other analysts said Vivendi needed to lay out its strategy with greater clarity to attract new investors. ""Any increased transparency on investment policy, strategic view on ownership of telecom companies, and the vague Southern European strategy and vision for gaming stakes would be very welcome to existing and potential new shareholders,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note.An Italian regulator ordered Vivendi last week to cut its stake in either Telecom Italia or Mediaset within a year, ruling that the French company was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of corporate power.FRENCH WOESIn France, competition for TV sports rights, including those for Formula One and the Champions League, is expected to be cut-throat and analysts worry that Vivendi's pay-TV subsidiary Canal Plus could lose them to rivals such as SFR Group.Any such loss would just add to the difficulties at Canal Plus in France. Losses at the pay-TV's channels in that country alone cut 399 million euros ($434 million) off the group's core operating profit for 2016.However, Vivendi expects Canal Plus' turnaround efforts to bear fruit in 2017 and it is targeting a 25 percent rebound in group core operating profit. It also expects group revenues to rise by more than 5 percent. Questions are also being raised about Vivendi's governance. Proxy adviser ISS is recommending that shareholders oppose the re-election of Bollore and the appointment of his son Yannick as board members.ISS has cited concerns about the lack of independence of the company's board and opposed 15 out of 25 resolutions that have been proposed ahead of Tuesday's annual general meeting.The last time Vivendi was challenged by a minority shareholder was in 2015. U.S. hedge fund P. Schoenfeld Asset Management (PSAM) campaigned over Vivendi's perceived lack of transparency, unclear strategy and poor governance, but shelved those concerns after wringing more money from the company.Vivendi agreed to increase payouts to investors by more than 1 billion euros following the investor's campaign.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

270,"Apr 18, 2017 06:27PM ET",Italy orders Vivendi to cut stake in either Telecom Italia or Mediaset,nan,"By Giulia SegretiMILAN (Reuters) - An Italian regulator ordered French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) on Tuesday to cut its stake in either  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) or broadcaster Mediaset (IT:MS) within a year, ruling it was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power.Vivendi, which aims to build a media empire in southern Europe, is the biggest single shareholder in Italy's main telecoms firm, with 24 percent, and recently acquired 28.8 percent of Mediaset, the country's biggest private broadcaster.In its ruling, communications authority AGCOM found Vivendi exercised significant influence over both firms and was therefore in breach of the anti-trust rules. It threatened to fine Vivendi an amount equal to between 2 and 5 percent of its revenues unless it complied with the divestment.The authority did not say how much Vivendi would need to divest in either company but ordered the French group to present it with a ""specific plan of action"" within 60 days.AGCOM said the links between Vivendi, Telecom Italia and Mediaset risked producing a negative effect ""on the existing level of competition in the markets involved and on the degree of pluralism in the media system"".Vivendi said it was surprised by the decision and reserved the right to take ""any appropriate legal action"", including an appeal and a formal complaint to the European Commission for breach of EU law. It did not elaborate.Italy's media laws grew partly out of parliamentary concerns in the 1990s over the combined political and business power of then prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, who remains the largest shareholder of Mediaset.Now, the laws appear to be working in Berlusconi's favor.Vivendi drew regulatory scrutiny after building an unwelcome stake in Mediaset, becoming its second-largest investor. That angered Berlusconi and raised concerns in Rome about Vivendi chairman Vincent Bollore's influence over corporate Italy.Bollore is also a key shareholder in influential Italian investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), which controls insurer Generali (MI:GASI).Mediaset said it was satisfied with the regulator's decision, which came late on Tuesday, and was waiting to read the full ruling before deciding on any future action.In relation to Mediaset, AGCOM said Vivendi's influence could be expressed through its voting rights, its potential to nominate its own representatives to the board and block any decisions of an extraordinary nature.AGCOM opened the investigation into Vivendi on Dec. 21 after Mediaset filed a complaint.Mediaset and Vivendi are battling each other in court over the decision by the French group to pull out of an 800 million euros ($860 million) contract to buy the Italian group's pay-TV unit Premium.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

271,"Apr 09, 2017 05:10PM ET",Vivendi indicates it wants its CEO to be Telecom Italia's new chairman,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) indicated that it wants its CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine to be the Italian group's new chairman, putting him top of its list of candidates for board members on Sunday.The term of Telecom Italia's current board is three years and expires next month. Shareholders will pick board members at a meeting on May 4 and the new board will then choose a chairman at a meeting scheduled for the following day. Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), is aiming to nominate 10 seats on the Italian company's new board, which is expected to be reduced to 15 members. The top name on the list of board nominees at Italian companies usually designates the proposed chairman, and sources have said Vivendi is considering appointing de Puyfontaine as Telecom Italia's next chairman.However, the French media group kept its options open by also including on the list Telecom Italia's current Italian chairman, Giuseppe Recchi, making it technically possible that he could be confirmed in the job.The choice of Telecom Italia's next chairman is politically sensitive because it could aggravate concerns about Vivendi's growing influence over Italian companies. The French group's sway over the Italian telecoms group has come under the spotlight after it took a significant holding in Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), leading to speculation over whether it plans to combine the two companies.Sunday was the deadline for shareholders to submit candidates for Telecom Italia's new board.Two other Vivendi top executives also featured on Vivendi's list: CFO Herve Philippe and General Counsel Frederic Crepin, as did Telecom Italia's CEO Flavio Cattaneo.Italy's communications regulator is already looking into Vivendi's stakebuilding at Mediaset, given domestic anti-trust regulations that prevent companies from having an excessive market share both in telecommunications and media.Vivendi filed a pre-emptive notification to the European Commission on March 31, saying that after the shareholder meeting it could de facto control Telecom Italia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Mediaset is seeking court enforcement of an April 2015 contract to sell its Premium pay-TV to Vivendi. Vivendi pulled out of the accord in July and went on to build a 28.8 percent stake in Mediaset in a move that has angered both the media group controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and the Italian government.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

283,"Feb 24, 2017 07:00AM ET","Beyond phones and 5G, mobile world seeks to reinvent itself",nan,"By Eric Auchard and Sophie SassardFRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Seeking to escape a cycle of falling prices and tight regulation, big telecom operators from Vimpelcom (O:VIP) to  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) are set to reinvent themselves as internet players to escape the industry's straight-jacket of low growth.Next week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona will feature phone companies in various stages of acceptance that the industry's predictable, decades-old business model based on selling data packages by the millions is running out of steam.Beneath the facade of shiny new phones and dusty debates over network technical implementations, Europe's largest annual technology fair will see top phone companies parading far-reaching business makeovers.Spain's Telefonica (MC:TEF) is set to introduce a broad plan it calls the ""4th Platform"" to help both consumer and business customers keep greater control over their data rather than giving it away to web giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Russian and emerging markets operator Vimpelcom (O:VIP) is tearing up many parts of the telecom rule book to remake itself as a tech player in the fast-growing world of messaging apps.U.S. telecom giant AT&T (N:T) has inked a series of huge deals to diversify by acquiring Direct TV for $67 billion and is awaiting approval to buy Time Warner for another $110 billion.""Regulatory and pricing pressure on telecom operators forces them to look to adjacent areas for new sources of revenue and margins,"" said attorney Tom Levine, head of Allen & Overy's global telecoms practice.""There isn't a consensus on how to do this.""It's also an open question whether the industry is structurally capable of big change. Telcos have dreamed for decades of breaking free of the shackles of consumer regulation and branching out into Internet services in their local markets, only to be consistently beaten by newer, global upstarts. RUSSIAN LABORATORYThese dramatic changes come as telcos brace to offer new networks ready to handle not just spiralling data use on phones but in cars, in factories and offices and even crop fields. The new generation of 5G networks will provide them new business options but also spells mounting competition from computer, internet and industrial players with digital plans of their own.Russia has emerged as the world's most advanced laboratory for telecom companies seeking to reinvent themselves as Internet players, as classic telecom business pressures, Western economic sanctions and government rules that reduce Silicon Valley giants to small local players create space to combine forces.Vimpelcom, Russia's No.3 operator, has undertaken a top-to-bottom overhaul of its business while gearing up for deeper Internet partnerships with the likes of streaming music and online taxi services. The company also focuses on emerging markets from Bangladesh to Algeria and is the world's sixth largest operator in terms of number of mobile customers served.Megafon, the No.2 network provider, has acquired control of sister company Mail.ru, a major Russian Internet player - the Russian equivalent of Verizon buying Facebook - and plans to offer a new mobile version of social media site VKontakte. Top Russian telecoms player MTS (MM:MTSS) is so far sitting on the sidelines, but its executives have signaled they too believe their long-run future lies in Internet services.Meanwhile, Telefonica sees its ""4th Platform"" strategy as a way to stoke faster growth and compete aggressively with globally dominant internet players while being a logical evolution of existing businesses, a senior company source said.The strategy builds on its long-standing investments in communications services, its broad geographic reach across Europe and Latin America and efforts to offer advanced money-making services on top of basic communication connections, but does not require making huge new investments, the source said.""Now is the turn of the fourth platform: the data. That is Telefonica's (new) equity story,"" the source said of its bid to boost margins by, for example, enabling customers to analyze mountains of data to make their own businesses run smarter.Other phone companies are taking more modest steps.Norway's  Telenor  (OL:TEL), another emerging markets operator, has pushed into data analytics, while  Vodafone  (L:VOD) is making inroads in new industrial internet and connected car applications, through its 2014 acquisition of Cobra Automotive.DO THEY HAVE THE DNA?Still, many telecom operators take a dim view of some of the aggressive moves being made by these peers, especially when it comes to business models based on commercializing customer data.Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Europe's largest telecom operator by revenue, sees this as no-go territory in privacy-conscious Germany. Instead, it is focused on making strides into new connected industrial arenas and cloud computing.Telekom's main growth story is likely to remain the United States where it revolutionized the mobile industry by offering unlimited data plans and international roaming packages. Using aggressive marketing, T-Mobile has gained at the expense of rivals, making it nearly as big Telekom's core German business.France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), which embarked on a grand misadventure last decade to combine telecom and media assets, offers a cautionary tale for investors betting on these new reinvention stories.For telecom operators used to predictable cash flows and firm regulatory boundaries, the main issue may be cultural: Most just don't have the stomach for such drastic transformation.""Working out how to bring in that entrepreneurial DNA, without disappointing users' expectations of reliability, and recognizing the financial expectations of institutional shareholders, is not easy,"" Levine said of healthy dividend payouts which remain the industry's main draw to investors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We have already cashed in the benefits of low interest rates,"" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Padoan suggested phasing out the scheme could be good for Italy's banks, which are groaning under almost 200 billion euros ($212.7 billion) in bad loans, as it would end an era of very low interest rates.""With higher interest rates the banks will have wider margin to get profits so this will help improve their balance sheet position,"" Padoan said.Following concerted stake-building by France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) in broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), and a merger between eyewear makers Essilor (PA:ESSI) and  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) which will create a Paris-listed group, Padoan said interest in Italian firms was a sign of their quality.""There is an element of paranoia in the debate,"" he said. ""The fact that many Italian companies are being considered by other companies is a sign that there are many good, profitable Italian companies.""Regarding Mediaset, which is controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Padoan said: ""We are of course watching what is going on, but these are private companies so the government has nothing to do or say specifically.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

289,"Jan 12, 2017 09:18AM ET",UniCredit says will complete cash call in time for bond payouts,nan,"By Valentina Za and Gianluca SemeraroMILAN/ROME (Reuters) - The chief executive of Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) pledged on Thursday to complete a 13 billion euro ($14 billion) share issue by March 10, in time to make payouts due on high-risk bonds that came under pressure on the market.UniCredit's shareholders met on Thursday to approve Italy's biggest corporate cash call to help clean up its balance sheet and restructure under new CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, distancing itself from the protracted banking crisis.Responding to market watchdog Consob, UniCredit on Thursday clarified the cash call had not been requested by European Central Bank supervisors.UniCredit detailed a plan last month to offload 17.7 billion euros in bad loans and cut 14,000 jobs. It said then that loan writedowns would make up two thirds of 12.2 billion euros in one-off charges it would book in the last quarter. UniCredit warned on Thursday that fourth-quarter charges could make it hard to pay coupons on Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds due in March if it did not carry out the share issue.The comments weighed on UniCredit's outstanding AT1 bonds. By 1340 GMT (8:40 a.m. ET) the 8 percent bond  on which the coupon payment is due yielded 9.5 percent, slightly higher on the day but below a session high of 9.7 percent. A 6.75 percent AT1 bond the bank issued in December  yielded 8.6 percent, up from 8.3 percent at Wednesday's close.UniCredit can temporarily write down the value of its AT1 bonds if its core capital falls below a certain threshold. It can also cancel their coupon payments at any time.Mustier, however, told La Stampa daily that UniCredit would not have to do so.""It (the share issue) will be completed in time for the UniCredit bond payment on March 10,"" he said.UniCredit has found a group of banks to take on any unsold shares, unlike rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) which in December had to be rescued by Italy's government after failing to find buyers for its stock.Mustier said the share sale had drawn interest from both Europe and the United States but ruled out that a rival bank could use it to buy a stake.""We'll have only financial investors. Ours is a plan for standalone growth; we won't turn it into something different,"" he said.PARANOIAThe French banker also sought to dismiss long-standing concerns about a possible takeover of Italy's top insurer Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI) by French rival AXA (PA:AXAF).""Let's put a stop to this paranoia,"" he said in the newspaper interview.Concerns have mounted in Italy that more companies would fall prey to French rivals after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) became the biggest shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and, more recently, aggressively built a large stake in broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS).The appointment of Frenchman Philippe Donnet as CEO of Generali and the arrival of Mustier at UniCredit have further stoked speculation.""For me, as an 'Italian citizen', Generali is crucial for the country ... Generali must remain Italian, Mediobanca must preserve the insurer's independence,"" Mustier said.UniCredit is the top shareholder in Mediobanca, which in turn is Generali's biggest investor.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

293,"Dec 20, 2016 05:23AM ET",European stocks mixed as attacks weigh on sentiment; Dax trades flat,nan,"Investing.com - European stocks registered mixed trade on Tuesday as a suspected terrorist attack in Berlin weighed on sentiment, but corporate movements pushed buyers into the market.In mid-morning European trade, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.31%, France’s CAC 40 advanced 0.37%, while Germany’s DAX 30 inched up 0.07%.A truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin early Tuesday morning, reportedly killing 12 people and injuring 48 others.

294,"Dec 16, 2016 08:10AM ET",Sky's not the limit for European media mergers,nan,"By Sophie SassardLONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's bid for Britain's Sky is expected to drive traditional European media players to do their own deals to attain the scale they need to compete with online platforms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for increasingly costly programs.While Twenty-First Century Fox's offer for Sky is not a done deal, bankers and industry sources expect it will win control of a 22 million household pay-TV network in Britain, Ireland, Austria, Germany and Italy and spark deal-making. ""Without doubt we will see further consolidation across the sector in the months ahead, and crucially, at a quickening pace,"" said David Elms, UK head of Media at KPMG. Consolidation among European broadcasters such as  ITV  (LON:ITV), Prosieben and RTL Group has so far been held back because the companies were pursuing different strategies focused on their home market. However, the rapid emergence of global players such as Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) means scale is becoming crucial to buying and producing high-quality content. Sky's deal to bring Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland under one umbrella was a first move which others could follow, said the bankers. ""Scale is becoming increasingly important, with companies who have a broad suite of offerings in terms of content and distribution platforms growing in strength and, from an M&A perspective, increasing in firepower,"" KPMG's Elms said.Murdoch's move to buy the 61 percent of Sky that Twenty-First Century Fox does not already own is the latest deal to marry a distribution network with content after AT&T's $85 billion bid to buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) earlier this year.The business case for bundled services including mobile, fixed-line communication and pay-TV services was also underlined by French telecom operator Orange which said earlier this week it would be interested in buying pay-TV channel Canal+ if owner  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was to sell. Analysts at UBS said such a move would mirror  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) acquiring pay-TV operator Digital+ in Spain and that Orange would benefit from cost synergies in areas such as call centers, customer billing, marketing and corporate overheads. In Italy, Vivendi chairman and shareholder Vincent Bollore is seeking to take control of Silvio Berlusconi's TV and production house Mediaset. Bollore, who controls Vivendi and owns 24 percent in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) via Vivendi, is expected to use his web of shareholdings to strike more deals in Europe, bankers told Reuters.BUYING THE BOX SETAmong the potential targets, bankers say ITV could appeal to both European and U.S. buyers given a low market value - down 26 percent since January - a strong brand and expanding production business which includes series such as Victoria, Come dine with Me and Coronation Street. Cable and TV mogul John Malone's Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), is seen as a logical buyer as it already owns 10 percent of ITV and could distribute its content via its Virgin Media platform.""Even if the regulator prevents Virgin Media from exclusively distributing ITV's content, Virgin could take advantage of the transfer of competence to then create its own exclusive content,"" one banker said. Others said that despite Malone's stake in ITV, others such as Liberty's sister company Discovery Communication or Germany's Prosieben could be interested in ITV.Some of Europe's largest broadcasters have similar market values and could explore stock mergers to preserve their strong regional identities and fend off U.S. buyers.So far, ITV has invested in its film studio, while Prosieben embarked on an ambitious digital strategy targeting 1.5 billion euros revenues by 2018 partly through bolt-on deals such as price comparison site Verivox. But combining these businesses could make sense and help diversify from cyclical TV advertising, the bankers said. In France cable operator Altice, which bought France's number 2 mobile player SFR two years ago, has recently created Altice Channel Factory and Altice Studios to offer exclusive content to its fixed and mobile clients. Altice's content push is so far restricted to the French market, although the group led by French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi operates telecoms and cable services in other European countries and in the U.S. One potential hurdle to deals is that some of the largest European media companies have owners who value their influence and may not want to sell, said one of the bankers.Despite this, dealmakers expect the battle for dominance of the airwaves triggered by Murdocch to keep them busy in 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

312,"Oct 10, 2016 09:55AM ET",French tycoon Bollore tightens grip on Vivendi,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - Vincent Bollore has raised his stake in  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) to above 20 percent, the French tycoon's holding company said on Monday, further tightening his grip on the media giant as he presses ahead with trying to turn Vivendi into a European media powerhouse.Vivendi's share price, which has fallen by about 8 percent since the start of the year compared with a drop of more than 11 percent in the Stoxx Europe 600 media sector index (SXMP), was up 2.2 percent at 18.47 euros by 1227 GMT. Shares in Bollore SA (PA:BOLL) were up 1.5 percent at 3.09 euros.The Bollore Group, which until now had held a 15 percent stake in Vivendi, said in a statement that as a result of a number of transactions the size of its holding had now moved above 20 percent and would be around 29 percent by April next year after taking into account the build-up of the double voting rights which have been granted to established shareholders by a new French law.""These operations reflect the confidence the Bollore Group has in Vivendi's potential for development and its willingness to remain as the primary shareholder of the company in the long term,"" Bollore's holding company said.The 64-year-old businessman has made no secret of his plan to gradually increase his holding in Vivendi while pursuing his expansion strategy. Since Bollore became chairman in 2014 Vivendi has bought a key stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and moved back into the video games business by acquiring French company Gameloft and buying a 22.8 percent stake in sister company  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP), despite opposition from the founding Guillemot family.However, Bollore has also encountered a number of obstacles this year, including continued resistance by the Guillemots to allowing Vivendi to take control at Ubisoft. In addition Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS) is now suing Vivendi for damages after it backed away from a deal to buy its pay-TV unit Mediaset Premium.""We see this more as a move to consolidate the long-term control of the company, perhaps for the benefit of the next generation of Bollores, rather than a conviction that certain share price drivers (recovery at Canal Plus) are about to turn positive,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analysts said in a note.""That said, the investment in Vivendi now represents close to 5 billion euros, more than half the market cap of Bollore Group, so the long-term conviction can be said to be firmer than ever,"" they added.Losses at TV subsidiary Canal Plus' French channels totalled 264 million euros in 2015 and could reach 400 million euros this year, Vivendi has said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

315,"Sep 27, 2016 01:43PM ET",Vivendi loses U.S. appeal in long-running investor lawsuit,nan,"By Nate RaymondNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday upheld a judgment against  Vivendi  SA (PA:VIV) in a long-running shareholder class action lawsuit accusing the French media group of defrauding investors in the early 2000s.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected Vivendi's appeal of a 2010 verdict by a federal jury finding it liable for violating federal securities laws, resulting in around $50 million in judgments against the company.U.S. Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston wrote that contrary to Vivendi's contention on appeal, investors had relied on false or misleading statements specifically identified at trial and as a result had not failed to present a claim of securities fraud.""Plaintiffs presented a case to the jury based on Vivendi’s alleged misstatements, and the jury entered a verdict against Vivendi based on fifty-seven of them,"" Livingston wrote.The three-judge panel in its 91-page ruling also rejected various other arguments by Vivendi, including its contention that certain statements it made to investors constituted opinions that could be the subject of a lawsuit.Vivendi in a statement said it was grateful the court rejected a cross-appeal by the plaintiffs, who sought to expand the class. But the French company said it otherwise ""strongly disagrees"" with the decision and may take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.Lawyers for the investors did not respond to a request for comment.Filed in 2002, the lawsuit contended Vivendi made false or misleading statements about the company's health following its $46 billion, three-way merger with Seagram Co and Canal Plus in 2000.That merger helped transform Vivendi, a water utility, into Europe's largest telecommunications and entertainment company.In a rare trial of a securities class action lawsuit, a federal jury in 2010 found Vivendi liable for violating federal securities laws.But a federal judge later threw out claims by investors in the company's ordinary shares, following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that limited investors' ability to pursue claims over the purchase of foreign securities.The class action now only covers investors who bought Vivendi's American depositary shares between Oct. 30, 2000, and Aug. 14, 2002.Vivendi said it maintains a reserve of 100 million euros ($112.2 million) for any damages it may have to pay in the case. It previously reserved 550 million euros, but lowered the sum after the 2010 Supreme Court decision.The case is In re Vivendi SA Securities Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-180.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

317,"Sep 19, 2016 04:52PM ET",Tesla says lawsuits may delay SolarCity deal,nan,"By Liana B. Baker and Rachit Vats(Reuters) -  Tesla Motors  Inc (O:TSLA) said on Monday its proposed acquisition of  SolarCity Corp  (O:SCTY) could be delayed because of shareholder lawsuits alleging board members breached their fiduciary duty, the latest hurdle to a $2.6 billion deal.The four lawsuits were filed by two individuals, a police pension fund, and a group of retirement funds, according to a regulatory filing by Tesla on Monday.If a judge grants any of the plaintiffs an injunction, the closing of the deal could be delayed beyond the end of the year when it had been expected, Tesla said. A hearing is scheduled on Oct. 18 in Delaware. Tesla said in the filing that the actions are without merit and the shareholders were unlikely to prevail in delaying the transaction. SolarCity declined to comment.""Simply because someone uses litigation to try to delay an acquisition does not mean it will be successful. At this point, it is not yet known if anyone will even end up pursuing such a request. If anyone does, Tesla will oppose it,"" a Tesla representative said in a statement.FAMILY TIESFamily and ownership connections between the two companies have raised concerns about Tesla's motivations in buying SolarCity, which has been burning through its cash pile to finance its growth.Since Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is the biggest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity, both companies have acknowledged the conflict of interests inherent in the merger and have taken steps to avoid them. SolarCity, in considering Tesla's offer for the company, formed a special committee to review Tesla's offer independent of the influence of Musk and other executives close to him including his cousins, SolarCity co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Lyndon Rive and co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Peter Rive.If the deal is approved by minority shareholders, his stake in Tesla could increase to 23.4 percent from about 21 percent, including the conversion of his current stake in SolarCity.Arkansas Teacher Retirement system and Boston Retirement System said in their lawsuit that Tesla's board did not form a special committee to evaluate the acquisition. While Musk and Antonio Gracias, a board member at both companies, recused themselves from voting on the deal, the shareholders called this move ""superficial."" Injunctions sought by shareholders are rare but can be granted. In 2013, the Delaware Chancery court blocked Activision Blizzard Inc (O:ATVI) $8.2 billion buyout of its shares from  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA, after a shareholder filed a lawsuit. A higher court lifted the injunction less than a month later. Lawrence Hamermesh, a professor of corporate law at Delaware Law School, said while the shareholders will have to convince a judge that Tesla's board was not disinterested, the case could go forward.""It's not impossible. Most M&A litigation is kind of a weak argument about getting the right price, but in this case, you have conflicts of interest and familial relationship you don't see in other public deals,"" Hamermesh said. SolarCity shares have been trading at a 31 percent discount to Tesla's stock swap offer, which valued SolarCity shares at $25.37 on Aug 1.Tesla's shares have fallen nearly 11 percent amid skepticism that the deal will happen. Tesla is facing its own cash crunch and has said it plans to raise additional money this year. Some of the funds being raised could also support the SolarCity acquisition if the deal goes through, Tesla said.Tesla shares were about up 0.9 percent at $206.34 on Monday on the Nasdaq. SolarCity shares were down 1.5 percent at $17.23.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Talks are going on, despite appearances,"" one of the sources said. ""It's a crucial strategic alliance for both Vivendi and Mediaset.""Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said on Thursday that the binding share-swap agreement it signed in April with Mediaset for its Premium pay-TV unit could be void after Sept. 30, citing the initial regulatory calendar to obtain the go-ahead from the European Commission. Mediaset and its controlling shareholder Fininvest swiftly rejected Vivendi's assertions in two separate statements.""Fininvest reaffirms the absolute linearity and correctness of its and Mediaset's behavior,"" the investment holding, which is 61-percent owned by former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, said. ""It completely rejects the reconstruction of facts supplied by Vivendi today which it finds groundless."" Mediaset said that Vivendi's statement was ""devoid of any legal or commercial grounds"".Vivendi and Mediaset signed an agreement in April, which would give the French group full control of Mediaset's pay-TV unit Premium and hand the two companies a 3.5 percent stake in each other.But Vivendi said in July it had backed out of the agreement, saying it no longer wanted the whole pay-TV unit but only a 20 percent stake. It also said it intended to acquire around 15 percent of Mediaset shares in the next three years.Separately, Vivendi said it would implement a 300 million euro ($338 million) cost-cutting plan to stem losses from the French channels of its pay-TV unit Canal Plus. The goal is to reach breakeven in 2018 for Canal Plus channels in France, it added. Losses at Canal Plus' French business weighed on Vivendi's results. The group reported lower-than-expected quarterly core operating profit, partly due to increased losses at its French channels. Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) for the three months that ended in June plummeted by 41.5 percent to 174 million euros, missing an average estimate in a Reuters poll of 247 million euros.

The Guillemot family said on Tuesday it will reluctantly sell its Gameloft stake to Vivendi, following an unsolicited bid from the media giant.Asked whether the family would use the proceeds to strengthen its position in Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot said: ""This is something that we're discussing with my brothers.""Vivendi is Ubisoft's biggest shareholder, controlling 18 percent of its capital, while the Guillemots own about 9 percent of the shares, according to Reuters data. Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said it was seeking a suitable level of board representation at Ubisoft, owner of the ""Raving Rabbids"" and ""Assassin's Creed"" franchises.""We don't want them sitting on the board, because they're implementing a creeping control strategy to take over the company,"" Yves Guillemot told Le Monde.A spokesperson for Vivendi declined comment on Guillemot's comments.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

345,"May 07, 2016 01:50PM ET",Enel has presented informal offer for Metroweb stake: source,nan,"By Silvia AloisiMILAN (Reuters) - Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) has presented an informal offer to buy a majority stake in fiber network company Metroweb as part of its plans to roll out a high-speed Internet network, a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday.The offer would see Enel acquire the 54 percent stake in Metroweb currently owned by infrastructure fund F2i for around 400 million euros, valuing the whole of Metroweb at 776 million euros, the source said.The preliminary, informal bid was presented to state-owned Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), which owns the rest of Metroweb and a minority stake in F2i, the source added. Effectively, any friendly bid for control of Metroweb would need CDP's consent.Enel and CDP declined to comment. F2i said in a statement it had not received an offer for its stake in Metroweb, adding it would assess any proposal in the interest of its own investors and of the fiber network company. Rolling out a national ultra-fast broadband network is a key plank in the reformist agenda of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who has enlisted state-controlled Enel's help to achieve the goal.Taking a majority stake in Metroweb would boost Enel's ambitions because of its fiber assets and skills. Italy's biggest utility earlier this year set up Enel Open Fiber (EOF) to develop its fiber ambitions and plans to invest 2.5 billion euros ($2.85 billion) to bring ultra fast broadband into peoples' homes using its existing power network.Under the informal proposal, Enel Open Fiber and CDP would jointly manage Metroweb, the source said.However, phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) is also interested in taking full control of Metroweb to boost its own plans to expand fast Internet coverage in Italy.The source said Telecom Italia was expected to present its own, rival offer for Metroweb as soon as Monday. A second source said Telecom Italia would make its offer early next week.Enel's board meets on Monday to approve first-quarter results and should also discuss the offer for Metroweb, although no statement on the matter is expected. Telecom Italia's board meets on May 13. The former state telecoms monopoly is in parallel talks with F2i and CDP to buy Metroweb for cash and in exchange for a stake in its international wholesale unit Sparkle, which may give its offer an edge over Enel's, sources have said.CDP, which controls Italy's gas and power grid companies Snam and Terna, is keen to tighten its grip on strategic networks in the country.Sparkle is deemed strategic because its submarine network transmits information between countries in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Americas.If CDP were to own a slice of Sparkle this would help the government prevent it from falling into foreign hands, especially given the growing influence of French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) as the top investor in Telecom Italia.The decision on the fate of Metroweb is politically sensitive and the government is likely to wait until municipal elections in early June before choosing between Enel's and Telecom's offers, another source said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renzi, who praised Enel for its technological prowess, said the first broadband subscription would be made in May in the city of Perugia, one of the five cities chosen as frontrunners for the project.Roll-out to a second batch of five cities will begin in the autumn before a second round of connections starts to another 40 cities.""The future has arrived,"" Renzi said.The first tenders to build broadband networks in the so-called economically non-viable areas, outside major towns, would start on April 29, Renzi said.The government is waiting for approval from the European Commission on how the tenders should be executed before it goes ahead with development in these areas, sources close to the matter said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

353,"Apr 03, 2016 07:20PM ET",Suspicion and soured relationships sank Bouygues Telecom's deal,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Sophie SassardPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - When French Prime Minister Manuel Valls phoned billionaire Martin  Bouygues  on Thursday evening in an attempt to save a merger between Bouygues Telecom (PA:BOUY) and state-controlled Orange, it was already too late. The deal would have created the dominant player in an industry damaged by fierce competition, but collapsed on Friday morning with Bouygues deciding not to sell his telecoms business to the former state monopoly even though he had floated the idea himself four months earlier. The fact Bouygues had confirmed that the unprofitable telecom service provider he founded in 1994 was for sale made his rivals and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron think the businessman had decided he had no choice but to sell, said four people involved in the talks who spoke to Reuters on Saturday and Sunday.""It's probably because of this first call that they all tried to rip him apart,"" one of the sources who is close to Orange (PA:ORAN) said, referring to the French government, which owns 23 percent of Orange, and rivals  Iliad  (PA:ILD) and SFR (PA:NUME).For the deal to go through, Iliad and SFR would have had to agree to buy some Bouygues Telecom assets to ease competition concerns. Spokespeople for the French Economy Ministry, Orange, Bouygues, SFR and Iliad declined to comment for this story. The weeks of deliberations were the best chance in years to take a contender out of the game and ease competitive pressures that had hammered profits in the industry and drained the capital needed for network investments to better serve an increasingly data-driven economy. The deal's collapse is a blow not just for the companies but for the French government.The perception among Martin Bouygues' rivals that they had the upper hand proved decisive on March 24 when a stand-off between the 63-year-old businessman and 38-year-old Macron came to a head and Bouygues stormed out of a meeting at the economy ministry, according to two of the sources.Bouygues felt humiliated by Macron's demands, said one of the sources, who is a banker. The scene highlighted the rocky relationship between France's Socialist government and Bouygues, who is godfather to a son of former right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy.CONTROL OF ORANGEThe complex telecoms merger, whose price tag Bouygues fixed at 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) in cash and Orange shares, would have made the conglomerate the second-biggest shareholder in Orange after the French state, which would have seen its stake diluted. For Macron, a former Rothschild & Cie banker, that raised questions about the role Bouygues would play in Orange which owns and manages submarine cables that are central to France's surveillance apparatus, making it a strategic asset for the government. Macron did not want to be perceived as having let Bouygues gain control. He wanted the government to keep three seats on the Orange board and a blocking minority at shareholder meetings, an idea that Bouygues understood and accepted from the start. But Bouygues was not happy with Macron's request to cap his potential stake in Orange for seven years and give up for 10 years the double-voting rights he was entitled to as a long-term investor in Orange, three of the sources said ""It's criminal to impose such conditions on Bouygues,"" the banker said. ""It's treating him like a second-class citizen. Any foreign raider who starts buying Orange shares would get better terms."" Macron and his advisers feared that Bouygues would use the same tactic as another French billionaire, Vincent Bollore, whose media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) quietly expanded its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) to eventually gain control. FRICTIONBouygues himself was not present at the discussions between Orange, Bouygues, Iliad and SFR at the Paris offices of his lawyer Jean-Michel Darrois where about 40 people gathered in the ten days preceding the collapse of the deal.All four companies wanted an agreement to end their price war. But the talks soured in the final week, according to several people present, with Bouygues increasingly mistrustful of the two other players Xavier Niel, the founder of Iliad, and the owner of SFR, Patrick Drahi. Bouygues became increasingly wary of the risks to his interests from the break-up of his telecom assets and the manner of their distribution among his rivals. Disagreements over break-up fees and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal proved intractable, said several of the sources. ""Niel made concessions but only on the last day,"" said one of the sources who is close to Bouygues. ""He tried to obtain as much as he could.""($1 = 0.8782 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Italy does not own a stake in Telecom Italia, but has a say over so-called strategic assets, including the phone group's network.Telecom Italia, which has net debt of around 27 billion euros ($30 billion), is widely seen as a potential takeover target in a consolidating industry, partly because of its relatively small size.""We see the European telecom market as a single legal entity: in this scenario, there would be room for just a few players,"" Mediobanca said in a note.Vivendi has gradually built up a stake of 23.8 percent in Telecom Italia and has secured four seats on its board, giving it greater sway over strategy at the former state monopoly.Some analysts were skeptical about the benefits of an Orange-Telecom Italia combination, especially given Telecom Italia's debt burden and the French state interest.While major savings can be reaped from telecoms deals within countries, the case is less clear for cross-border ones where local networks and commercial operations are not being combined.One trader said a paper offer with a 30 percent premium would dilute the French state to 14 percent, which would be ""too much for Italy to digest, and too low for France""."
357,"Mar 04, 2016 03:10PM ET",Heat is on Telecom Italia's CEO as Vivendi pushes on strategy,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak and Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - A jump in the company's share price should brighten the mood of any chief executive but that is unlikely to have been the effect this week on Marco Patuano, the head of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).After he strategy meeting in Paris with executives from his new top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) on Wednesday, market speculation mounted that the French group led by business tycoon Vincent Bollore might force change with or without Patuano, sending Telecom Italia's shares up by over 6 percent.Investors bet the evidence of increased pressure from Vivendi could open the way to a radical overhaul of the heavily-indebted group.""Patuano is a bit of a man of the past and I'm not sure how long he can stay in the saddle, unless he aligns himself with Vivendi,"" said Tommaso Iaquinta of boutique investment bank Livolsi-Iaquinta & Partners.Since taking over as CEO in late 2013, Patuano has had to steer a course for one of Italy's most politically sensitive companies which will not upset the sometimes conflicting interests of the state, employees and shareholders.Patuano, who started his career in Telecom Italia in 1990 straight after university and worked his way up through the ranks to become chief operating officer before taking over as CEO, has stepped up spending on faster fixed and mobile networks as the government seeks to get internet connections across the nation up to speed with the rest of Europe. He has also struck deals with content providers such as Sky Italia, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Mediaset in a search for new sources of income and to better compete with rivals.Unlike his predecessor Franco Bernabe, who opposed asset sales and pushed for a share issue before quitting in a clash over strategy with core investors, Patuano began to sell non-core assets to continue cutting Telecom Italia's debt of around 27 billion euros ($29.6 billion).He struck the deal to sell its controlling stake in Telecom Argentina, which after much delay a regulatory source said was finally approved on Thursday, and spun off radio masts unit INWIT.However, Patuano's relations with Vivendi were tense from the start, a source close to the matter said. The French group took 8 percent of Telecom Italia in June as part payment for selling Brazilian broadband firm GVT to Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), which at the time was Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder.Vivendi has since steadily built up its stake, tightening its grip on the company, and leaving Patuano under pressure to cut costs at home and decide what to do with its Brazilian business, TIM Participacoes, where Patuano was once chief financial officer.What to do is a bone of contention. ""Vivendi wants to sell Brazil, and Patuano does not,"" the source said. Patuano has said he sees TIM Participacoes, Brazil's second-biggest mobile network operator behind Telefonica Brasil, as strategic.And last month Telecom Italia walked away from a proposal to merge TIM with rival Oi because, according to a source close to the matter, it would not have had control of the combined entity.Meanwhile the sudden emergence last October of French telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel as potentially Telecom Italia's second-largest shareholder - he has bought options relating to a 15.1 percent stake - is further complicating matters.Vivendi and Niel have repeatedly said they are not acting in concert, but their exact long-term aims for investing in Telecom Italia remain unclear.However, Vivendi described Telecom Italia as ""a rudderless ship"" in December before going on to secure four board seats.It has since turned up the heat further by raising its stake in the Italian group to 23.8 percent. However, another source close to the matter said Vivendi might be pushing for change but is not in a position to act alone, given it only has four of 17 board members.""Telecom Italia is strategic for the whole Italian industry, the financial sector and the political powers. Nothing can happen without the involvement of these big powers,"" the source said.Telecom Italia has seen revenues decline steadily amid tough competition in its mature home market, which is just emerging from a protracted recession, and is now grappling with an economic downturn and currency devaluation in Brazil.Analysts say Vivendi's interest might lead to a tie-up between Telecom Italia and another telecoms or media operator. So far the French group has only said that it wants to use Telecom Italia to develop its existing businesses in southern Europe and boost its content offering. ""Vivendi's investment in Telecom Italia is the launchpad for something bigger to come, like an M&A deal, as the telecoms industry in Europe is expected to consolidate,"" said Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy's Consultinvest.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The former telecoms monopoly, which has been struggling for years with a lack of clear strategy and is regarded as a potential takeover target, is seeking new sources of income as its traditional phone services lose appeal amid competition from Internet rivals. Outlining its new investment plan to 2018, the heavily indebted company said it would spend 12 billion euros ($13.4 billion) over the period in Italy, including 3.6 billion to lay fiber optic cables. The development of ultra-fast broadband infrastructure is one of the top priorities of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government. Telecom Italia's new investment target for Italy is 20 percent higher than what the phone group earmarked in its previous three-year plan.Telecom Italia said its fiber optic cables would reach 84 percent of Italy's population by 2018, while its 4G mobile network would cover more than 98 percent. Not more than 14 billion Brazilian reais ($3.49 billion) will be spent to upgrade its mobile network in Brazil, where the company expects its local unit TIM Participações SA to raise market share and grow its EBITDA margin over the plan period. Telecom Italia, whose top shareholder is French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) with a 21.4 percent stake, said it plans to strengthen its position in multimedia entertainment, including in video, music, gaming and publishing. The group said its net debt would fall to below 3 times EBITDA by the end of 2018, despite the negative impact of accounting adjustments worth 2 billion euros. The new target is less ambitious than the 2.5 multiple Telecom Italia forecast for end-2017 in its previous plan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Metroweb, a small fiber optic company controlled by infrastructure fund F2i and CDP, has long been seen as the corporate vehicle for realizing the Italian government's multi-billion-euro plan for the nationwide fiber network. The plan has initially stalled due to difficulties in bringing the former monopoly network operator Telecom Italia on board, but talks between the two companies have picked up again in recent weeks.CDP Chairman Claudio Costamagna said on Thursday that Telecom Italia and Metroweb were in talks on bringing the ultrafast network to 250 Italian towns and should the project succeed, it could lead to ""moves on shareholder structure"".Costamagna declined to clarify whether this meant CDP taking a stake in Telecom Italia.

364,"Dec 10, 2015 07:54PM ET",Special Report: Buybacks enrich the bosses even when business sags,nan,"By Karen Brettell, David Gaffen and David RohdeNEW YORK(Reuters) - When health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings in late 2014 – including a 21 percent drop in net income – it softened the blow by immediately telling investors it would make a $500 million share repurchase.In addition to soothing shareholders, the surprise buyback benefited the company's senior executives. It added around two cents to the company's annual earnings per share, allowing Humana to surpass its $7.50 EPS target by a single cent and unlocking higher pay for top managers under terms of the company's compensation agreement.Thanks to Humana hitting that target, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard earned a $1.68 million bonus for 2014.Most publicly traded U.S. companies reward top managers for hitting performance targets, meant to tie the interests of managers and shareholders together. At many big companies, those interests are deemed to be best aligned by linking executive performance to earnings per share, along with measures derived from the company's stock price.But these metrics may not be solely a reflection of a company's operating performance. They can be, and often are, influenced through stock repurchases. In addition to cutting the number of a company's shares outstanding, and thus lifting EPS, buybacks also increase demand for the shares, usually providing a lift to the share price, which affects other performance markers.As corporate America engages in an unprecedented buyback binge, soaring CEO pay tied to short-term performance measures like EPS is prompting criticism that executives are using stock repurchases to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term corporate health, capital investment and employment.""We've accepted a definition of performance that is narrow and quite possibly inappropriate,"" said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager of the executive compensation initiative at As You Sow, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that promotes corporate responsibility. Pay for performance as it is often structured creates ""very troublesome, problematic incentives that can potentially drive very short-term thinking.""A Reuters analysis of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index found that 255 of those companies reward executives in part by using EPS, while another 28 use other per-share metrics that can be influenced by share buybacks.In addition, 303 also use total shareholder return, essentially a company's share price appreciation plus dividends, and 169 companies use both EPS and total shareholder return to help determine pay.STANDARD PRACTICEEPS and share-price metrics underpin much of the compensation of some of the highest-paid CEOs, including those at Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc, 21st Century Fox Inc,  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO).Fewer than 20 of the S&P 500 companies disclose in their proxies whether they exclude the impact of buybacks on per-share metrics that determine executive pay.Humana would not say whether it adjusted targets to account for its buyback last year. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it sets annual per-share targets for executives that take into account the company's ""capital allocation strategy,"" which includes buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and investments.Experts said Humana would not have reached the target without the $500 million buyback. The company told analysts at the time of the repurchase announcement in November 2014 that it expected to report annual earnings per share of between $7.40 and $7.60 for the full year.""Given the magnitude of the repurchase, the EPS would have been below $7.50 had it not been for the repurchase,"" said Heitor Almeida, a professor of finance with the College of Business at the University of Illinois in Champaign.As reported in the first article in this series, share buybacks by U.S. non-financial companies reached a record $520 billion in the most recent reporting year. A Reuters analysis of 3,300 non-financial companies found that together, buybacks and dividends have surpassed total capital expenditures and are more than double research and development spending.Companies buy back their shares for various reasons. They do it when they believe their shares are undervalued, or to make use of cash or cheap debt financing when business conditions don't justify capital or R&D spending. They also do it to meet the expectations of increasingly demanding investors.Lately, the sheer volume of buybacks has prompted complaints among academics, politicians and investors that massive stock repurchases are stifling innovation and hurting U.S. competitiveness - and contributing to widening income inequality by rewarding executives with ever higher pay, often divorced from a company's underlying performance.""There's been an over-focus on buybacks and raising EPS to hit share option targets, and we know that those are concentrated in the hands of the few, and that the few is in the top 1 percent,"" said James Montier, a member of the asset allocation team at global investment firm GMO in London, which manages more than $100 billion in assets.The introduction of performance targets has been a driver of surging executive pay, helping to widen the gap between the richest in America and the rest of the country. Median CEO pay among companies in the S&P 500 increased to a record $10.3 million last year, up from $8.6 million in 2010, according to data firm Equilar.At those levels, CEOs last year were paid 303 times what workers in their industries earned, compared with a ratio of 59 times in 1989, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit.SALARY AND A LOT MOREToday, the bulk of CEO compensation comes from cash and stock awards, much of it tied to performance metrics. Last year, base salary accounted for just 8 percent of CEO pay for S&P 500 companies, while cash and stock incentives made up more than 45 percent, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of Reuters News, used EPS to determine half of the performance awards in the three-year pay cycle ended in 2014 for CEO Jim Smith and other executives. Smith last year took home $6.6 million in compensation. The company's three-year performance awards going forward are based on both EPS and free cash flow per share. A company spokesman said Thomson Reuters does not adjust for the impact of stock buybacks on those metrics.Share repurchases can make the difference in meeting preset targets, according to a Reuters review of corporate proxies.At  Xerox Corp , revenue, net income and spending on research and development all declined last year. But the printer and copier maker's EPS target of $1.12 was unchanged from the prior year, and managers hit it exactly after $1.1 billion in share repurchases.Half of CEO Ursula Burns's annual bonus target was predicated on hitting that EPS level; ultimately, she received a bonus of $1.98 million out of a possible $2.2 million. EPS is also a major determinant of even bigger bonuses for a three-year performance cycle ending this year.Xerox (N:XRX) repurchased $1.35 billion of its shares in the first three quarters of this year. The company declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not indicate whether it adjusts targets to account for buybacks.Managers at information technology company EMC Corp (N:EMC) hit their EPS target for 2014 of $1.90 with the help of $3.7 billion in share repurchases. Based on the share count before the buybacks, EPS last year would have been only $1.81, little changed from $1.80 a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation.The EPS target accounted for half of CEO Joseph Tucci's annual $1.01 million bonus. It also is used to determine 45 percent of bonus share awards for the company's future three-year targets.EMC declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not address whether it makes adjustments to account for buybacks. It has bought back $3.11 billion in shares so far this year.Buybacks can boost a company's share price to benefit executives whose shares vest over a period of years. Activision Blizzard Inc (O:ATVI), purveyor of ""Guitar Hero,"" ""Call of Duty"" and other well-known video games, signed Chief Executive Robert Kotick to a contract in 2012 that included $56 million in share awards that vest over time, depending in part on the share price and EPS.Last year, Kotick ended up getting about $22 million in performance-based cash and stock awards, about the same as the year prior, even as net income dropped 17 percent. How? The stock rose substantially, meeting goals for total shareholder return and increasing the value of share awards.Total shareholder return was helped by an $8.2 billion repurchase made in late 2013 – when the company and a group of investors led by Kotick and Activision Chairman Brian Kelly bought out a stake held by then-majority shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV). The company said the deal allowed Activision to operate with more flexibility.The shares rose 33 percent from the date of the buyback announcement in July 2013 through the end of 2014. The share price has continued to rise this year, making the awards even more valuable.Activision declined to comment.In 1992, Congress changed the tax code to curb rising executive pay and encourage performance-based compensation. It didn't work. Instead, the shift is widely blamed for soaring executive pay and a heavier emphasis on short-term results.Companies started tying performance pay to ""short-term metrics, and suddenly all the things we don't want to happen start happening,"" said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. ""Despite 20 years of trying, we have still failed to come up with an objective performance metric that can't be gamed.""Shareholder expectations have changed, too. The individuals and other smaller, mostly passive investors who dominated equity markets during the postwar decades have given way to large institutional investors. These institutions tend to want higher returns, sooner, than their predecessors. Consider that the average time investors held a particular share has fallen from around eight years in 1960 to a year and a half now, according to New York Stock Exchange data.""TOO EASY TO MANIPULATE""Companies like to use EPS as a performance metric because it is the primary focus of financial analysts when assessing the value of a stock and of investors when evaluating their return on investment.But ""it is not an appropriate target, it's too easy to manipulate,"" said Almeida, the University of Illinois finance professor.In 2011,  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) CEO Kevin Sharer oversaw $8.32 billion of buybacks, by far the largest in the pharmaceutical maker's history. More than $5 billion of those repurchases came in the fourth quarter of the year.Soon after, Amgen reported that net income was lower than it had been in the three preceding years. At the same time, the buybacks lifted EPS far above the target level that determined 30 percent of Sharer's bonus, doubling the amount he earned for that portion of his $4.88 million annual bonus. Without the buyouts, EPS would have fallen below the target level.Sharer left the company in May 2012 and is now on the faculty of Harvard Business School. He did not respond to requests for comment.The Amgen board's compensation committee removed EPS as a performance metric the next year. It opted, instead, to begin using net income, saying in a 2012 proxy statement that doing so would ""align compensation with a measure that more directly correlates with the underlying performance of our operations.""Members of Amgen's 2011 compensation committee declined to comment.Some companies, including software developer Citrix Systems Inc (O:CTXS) and kidney dialysis company DaVita Inc, say they avoid EPS in pay calculations because it is too vulnerable to manipulation.Most companies that use per-share metrics for executive awards, however, say little about whether they adjust results to account for buybacks. A select few, including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), FedEx (N:FDX),  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) and  IBM  (N:IBM), do disclose that they strip out the potential effect of buybacks on performance metrics.FedEx, in its most recent filing, said it excluded the effect of buybacks because the positive effect on EPS ""did not reflect core business performance."" Time Warner Inc said it adjusts for buybacks ""so that payouts were not advantaged"" if the media company repurchased more shares than it initially anticipated when setting performance goals.Steve Pakela, managing partner at Pay Governance LLC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which advises more than 40 S&P 500 companies on executive pay, said some directors ""believe you shouldn't strip out the effect"" because share buybacks may be the best use of capital.In addition to EPS, there is total shareholder return, which typically comprises a company's share price appreciation plus dividends over time. Total return, often used to compare performance among peer companies, has also become a popular performance measure for executive pay.By providing a lift to a stock's price, buybacks can increase total shareholder return to target levels, resulting in more stock awards for executives. And of course, the higher stock price lifts the value of company stock they already own.""It can goose the price at time when the high price means they earn performance shares … even if the stock price later goes back down, they got their shares,"" said Michael Dorff, a law professor at the Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.Exxon Corp, the largest repurchaser of shares over the past decade, has rejected shareholder proposals that it add three-year targets based on shareholder return to its compensation program. In its most recent proxy, the energy company said doing so could increase risk-taking and encourage underinvestment to achieve short-term results.The energy giant makes half of its annual executive bonus payments contingent on meeting longer-term EPS thresholds. Since 2005, the company has spent more than $200 billion on buybacks.ADDITIONAL TWEAKSWhile performance targets are specific, they aren't necessarily fixed. Corporate boards often adjust them or how they are calculated in ways that lift executive pay.Humana specifies EPS ranges to determine annual bonuses paid to its executives. For the past three years, buybacks of more than $500 million a year increased EPS. That wasn't all, however. For each of those years, the board altered calculations in ways that also bumped EPS higher.For 2012, then-CEO Michael McCallister received a higher bonus than he otherwise would have -- $1.63 million -- after Humana's board removed litigation expenses from its EPS calculation.He was succeeded as CEO at the start of 2013 by Broussard. For that year, Broussard's annual bonus was lifted into the maximum range, for a payment $2.44 million, after accounting for the cost of posting additional reserves against long-term insurance policies.For 2014, Humana discounted from its EPS calculation losses from paying down some bonds, even as its overall debt levels increased. That adjustment brought the company just below its EPS target of $7.50.The $500 million buyback the company announced late last year, part of its total $872 million in buybacks in 2014, was an accelerated share repurchase. In this sort of deal, a company buys all the stock from an investment bank in a single transaction. That allows it to book the reduction in shares outstanding immediately, and the bank then buys the shares on the open market over the ensuing months.Humana's accelerated share repurchase lifted EPS to $7.51, just above the target.Susan Young, an associate professor of accounting and taxation at Fordham University in New York, said accelerated buybacks are commonly used to reach compensation targets. ""I can't think of a good reason for this form of repurchase,"" she said, noting that the programs restrict a company's flexibility to reduce or stop buybacks if shares become too expensive.Roy Dunbar, a member of the Humana board's compensation committee, declined to comment on Humana specifically. He said the benefit of accelerated repurchases is to, ""in a controlled way, buy a significant slice of available shares early in the program,"" before an announced buyback pushes up the share price and increases the cost to the company.He also said an accelerated program allows shareholders to see immediate action, which is ""important to signal a higher degree of confidence in something shareholders care a great deal about.""In general, he said, ""effective compensation committees are aware of impact of share repurchases on EPS, particularly when EPS is part of the equity compensation of management.""In July,  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) announced that it would acquire Humana in a deal that at the time valued Humana at $37 billion. If Broussard leaves after the deal, he won't go empty-handed.Just before the Aetna deal was announced, Broussard's compensation agreement was modified to accelerate equity awards and remove restrictions on exercising some stock options if he leaves or is terminated within two years of any acquisition, a regulatory filing shows.At the end of last year, Broussard held unvested share awards valued at around $12.8 million, which have since increased in value as Humana's share price has climbed 18 percent.(Edited by John Blanton)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It aims for positive monthly core earnings (EBITDA) and cash flow by the end of 2018, as well as sales of 750 million.The initial public offering (IPO) will allow Deezer to improve its product and content, Chief Executive Hans-Holger Albrecht said, without giving any details of the pricing of the issue, how many shares would be sold or how much money would be raised. The company also hopes to develop its partnerships with telecom providers, as well as with makers of phones and wireless speakers, through which it sells its service.Deezer decided to go public and not undertake another fundraising round in part because it wanted to tap markets before Spotify, Albrecht added.Deezer's largest shareholder with 27 percent is tycoon Len Blavatnik's Access Industries.

375,"Sep 14, 2015 03:52PM ET",'Fair use' matters in dancing toddler copyright case: U.S. court,nan,"By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - Copyright holders must consider ""fair use"" before demanding the removal of videos that people post online, including on Google Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday.In a closely followed case over a home video of a toddler dancing to the Prince hit ""Let's Go Crazy,"" the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco made it tougher for content providers such as  Vivendi  SA's (PA:VIV) Universal Music Group to force Internet service providers to remove material.""Copyright holders cannot shirk their duty to consider - ingood faith and prior to sending a takedown notification - whether allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use,"" Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote for a 3-0 panel.The decision could make it harder for copyright holders to remove alleged infringing content from the Internet by invoking the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law intended to curb movie and music piracy online. Critics say abusive takedown notices can suppress free speech.Stephanie Lenz of Gallitzin, Pennsylvania had in February 2007 uploaded to YouTube a blurry 29-second clip of her 13-month-old son Holden happily bobbing up and down to ""Let's Go Crazy,"" a 1984 song by Prince and The Revolution that played in the background.Lenz said she thought her family and friends would enjoy seeing the toddler, who had just learned to walk, dance as well.But Universal, which enforced Prince's copyrights, persuaded YouTube to remove Lenz's video, citing a good faith belief that the video was unauthorized.Lenz had the video restored, and sued Universal over the takedown notice, seeking damages.In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel in San Francisco said copyright holders must consider fair use, but denied Lenz's misrepresentation claim.Upholding that ruling, Tallman said there can be liability if a copyright holder ""knowingly misrepresented"" in a takedown notice that it had a good faith belief that a video ""did not constitute fair use.""But he also said courts should defer to a copyright holder who has a ""subjective good faith belief"" to the contrary.The 9th Circuit said Lenz failed to overcome this hurdle, and instead may seek nominal damages for the ""unquantifiable harm"" she suffered.Universal spokesman Andy Fixmer declined immediate comment.Corynne McSherry, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation representing Lenz, said the decision ""sends a strong message that copyright law does not authorize thoughtless censorship of lawful speech.""The case is Lenz v Universal Music Corp et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 13-16106, 13-16107.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

While James and Lachlan are said by company sources to have a good relationship and approach the business as partners, the dual-reporting line could prove to be confusing and a source of tension, analysts have said.""The family is obviously a big shareholder in the business, so we are all really invested in each others' success,"" said Murdoch.""We all see very eye to eye on the business, so I think we're in reasonably good shape there.""Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox through a trust that owns 39 percent of the voting shares, announced the long-expected elevation of his sons this month as he prepares the future of the company at a time of wrenching change in the television and entertainment businesses. James Murdoch will soon be running a sprawling media empire that owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox News and Star India. Fox is also the largest shareholder in European pay-TV group Sky PLC (L:SKYB) with 39 percent. The family spun off the newspaper business  News Corp.  (O:NWSA), long a passion of Rupert Murdoch, into a separate company in 2013.Some investors have questioned whether James is less attached to some parts of the media empire that his father built, such as the less profitable newspaper arm. The future of Fox's investment in Sky is also an issue after media reports of interest from European media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and telecom operator  Vodafone  (L:VOD)James Murdoch did not comment on Thursday on those topics in particular, but did not mention News Corp. or Sky when asked what he thought the most promising areas of development were for the company.""We are a global business and have always been so but I have to say we think India is the single greatest opportunity in the next five to ten years,"" he said, adding that Latin American and the United States were also bright spots.Asked whether he would one day like his own children to run the family business, Murdoch laughed. ""My kids are really little right now. I'd just like them to pass the fifth grade.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

390,"Jun 25, 2015 03:58AM ET",Vivendi CEO does not rule out raising Telecom Italia stake further: paper,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - France's  Vivendi  (PARIS:VIV) does not rule out increasing its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MILAN:TLIT) after becoming the group's largest investor with 14.9 percent, CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine was quoted as saying on Thursday.Vivendi said on Wednesday it had raised its stake in Telecom Italia to just under 15 percent, replacing  Telefonica  (MADRID:TEF) as the biggest shareholder and gaining a foothold in a country it said had significant growth prospects.Asked if the company would increase its stake further, De Puyfontaine told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Thursday: ""Time will tell, never say never.""As the biggest shareholder Vivendi could now be influential in whether Telecom Italia decides to sell TIM Participacoes, Brazil's second-biggest mobile operator, and in how much the Italian group invests in high-speed fiber broadband in Italy where the government wants it to do more to upgrade old infrastructure. Telecom Italia Chairman Giuseppe Recchi said last week his company wanted to stay in Brazil, which accounts for a third of revenue.Asked whether Vivendi would push for Telecom Italia to exit Brazil, De Puyfontaine said he was ""open and very flexible"".""The important thing is to take a decision that creates value in the long term ... but we have to be pragmatic,"" he said. He noted that his company had decided to exit its own Brazilian assets to invest in Italy. Vivendi's investment in Telecom Italia was for the long term, he said. The Italian phone group had ""great prospects"", especially given the push to develop ultrafast broadband network - a pet project of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. De Puyfontaine said it was too early to say whether Vivendi would seek to press Telecom Italia to take part in an alliance between Italy's Metroweb,  Vodafone  (LONDON:VOD) and Vimpelcom's Italian mobile phone unit Wind to help build the fiber-optic network.""The statements made by Prime Minister Renzi are very important. I will discuss this theme in Italy with insiders, and I will discuss it in depth with Telecom Italia's management,"" he said.""But I can say that Italy and Greece are the only European countries without a cable network.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

392,"Jun 23, 2015 09:24AM ET",Bouygues faces crossroads choice on telecoms business,nan,"By Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - Martin  Bouygues , scion of one of France's top industrialist families, must decide on Tuesday whether to part with the telecoms business that is his main contribution to the conglomerate built by his father.The Bouygues (PA:BOUY) board is due to meet later on Tuesday to discuss what sources said was a 10-billion-euro ($11.3 billion) bid by European telecom group Altice (AS:ATCE). In reality, the decision lies with the 63-year-old Bouygues alone.""No-one really knows what is on his mind, whether he'll sell now,"" said one person familiar with the situation.""(But) if he sells, he'll have commanded an amazing price for the business he founded and carries his name,"" the source said of a business ranked as France's third-largest mobile player.Martin Bouygues has already rebuffed at least two offers in the past year for the unit he founded in 1994, insisting as recently as last month that Bouygues Telecom could prosper on its own. He once even rebuffed a question about selling the business by firing back at a journalist: ""And you, would you sell your wife?""But the offer by Altice's Patrick Drahi outstrips all past approaches. Drahi's own empire-building took off in 2014 when he beat out Bouygues to acquire Vivendi's (PA:VIV) SFR, the second-biggest mobile operator.The 10 billion-euro price tag would value the unit as much as the entire Bouygues group before the offer was made public. It also eclipses earlier offers from Orange (PA:ORAN) and low-cost operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) - each around 5.5 billion euros - as well as a previous 8 billion-euro approach by Drahi.The business, which has been posting losses since Iliad broke into the French mobile market three years ago, had a 2014 total asset value of 5.8 billion euros.The deal value would be the equivalent of 14.4 times the division's 2014 EBITDA earnings of 694 million euros, well above a sector average multiple of 7-11, according to investment house Raymond James.If he sells, Bouygues could use the cash to cut debt, raise his family's stake in the group or finance other acquisitions, said Natixis analyst Gregoire Thibault. POLITICAL CONCERNPrice is not the only factor in Bouygues' decision.Drahi, known for aggressive cost-cutting, could extract as much as 1 billion euros a year in synergies to raise profit margins, analysts estimate, but only at the expense of painful job cuts - which Bouygues has indicated he wants to avoid.President Francois Hollande's Socialist government has moreover expressed concern over the deal.Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Tuesday set five conditions for any accord, including employment guarantees and assurances on investment in high-speed broadband and in the upcoming auction of radio spectrum for 4G mobile broadband networks, from which the state wants to raise 2.5 billion euros.Drahi is set to discuss the proposed deal with French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron later on Tuesday.Set against such obstacles to a deal is the increasingly cut-throat nature of the French telecoms sector and how Bouygues Telecom, after a strong start, has struggled to keep up since Iliad's 2012 arrival as a fourth national player.A turnaround plan including staff cuts and a re-positioning of the business has failed to generate positive cash-flow for Bouygues, while its late entry into the fixed-line market means it can only sell broadband by renting capacity from Numericable.By 1243 GMT Bouygues shares were up 0.16 percent, having jumped 13 percent on Monday despite uncertainties surrounding the deal, while Altice shares were up 1.58 percent and Numericable-SFR (PA:NUME) shares were down 1.04 percent.

404,"May 06, 2015 04:31PM ET","Pandora defeats ASCAP, music publishers in royalties appeal",nan,"By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Manhattan rejected appeals by a music licensing group and music publishers that could have forced Internet radio service Pandora Media Inc to pay higher royalties and have access to fewer songs.In a case closely watched in the music industry, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday rejected an effort by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers to charge Pandora more to license its music from 2013 to 2015.It also said rules governing ASCAP licensing ""unambiguously"" barred music publishers from negotiating higher rates for their works with ""new media"" users such as Pandora, even as ASCAP licensed the same works to other users. Vivendi  (PARIS:VIV) SA's Universal Music Publishing, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and EMI Music Publishing had withdrawn their new media licensing rights from ASCAP, while retaining membership in that group.Wednesday's decision is a defeat for publishers and songwriters who believe growth in streaming music has resulted in unfairly low licensing rates.It upheld rulings by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan federal court, which reviews ASCAP rate disputes under a 1941 antitrust consent decree.Pandora is the most popular Internet radio service. The Oakland, California-based company last month said it has more than 250 million users, including 79.2 million ""active"" users, who listen to 1.77 billion hours of music each month.ASCAP Chief Executive Elizabeth Matthews said the decision shows the need to change licensing rules that are ""completely out of step"" with how people listen to music today.Universal was not immediately available for comment. Sony/ATV, which administers the EMI catalog, had no comment.Kenneth Steinthal, a King & Spalding partner representing Pandora, said the decision helps ensure ""equal treatment under the consent decree, including the right to perform all works by all publishers that are ASCAP members.""The 2nd Circuit said Cote did not commit ""clear error"" by requiring Pandora to pay ASCAP a royalty rate of just 1.85 percent of revenue to use its songs from 2011 through 2015. ASCAP proposed an escalating rate that peaked at 3 percent.Moreover, the court said it could not ""rewrite the decree"" to let publishers pick and choose how works are licensed.""The licensing of works through ASCAP is offered to publishers on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,"" it said.ASCAP has about 525,000 members, and represents music from artists like Leonard Bernstein, Beyoncé, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, Alan Jackson, Jay-Z and Katy Perry.The cases are American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers et al v.

405,"Apr 23, 2015 11:12AM ET",Investors called on to give boardroom leaders greater scrutiny,nan,"By Simon Jessop and Sinead CruiseLONDON (Reuters) - After taking top executives to task over excessive pay and bonuses, investors are slowly turning their attention to the role of the chairperson, as concern about weak governance grows.As the person responsible for hiring and firing the chief executive and ensuring company strategy is on track, the chair is crucial to protecting shareholder returns over the long term, even though few ever find themselves rejected at the company's annual meeting.But as pension funds and other long-term asset owners demand investment firms be more active stewards of their stock, some money managers are reconsidering how they rate chairpersons, with a view to making them more accountable for company performance.""I'm not sure shareholders as a whole are particularly good at that. I think there's a little bit of an unwillingness to take a view on individuals and, frankly, I think we need to do that more,"" said Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management.UK fund firm trade body the Investment Association and consultancy EY recently launched a report calling for investors to engage more in how companies are run, including around the 'lynchpin' chair role.""The majority of chairmen understand the role but we sometimes find the board doesn't intervene as quickly as we would like. They sometimes give the benefit of the doubt,"" said Shade Duffy, head of corporate governance at AXA Investment Managers, the fund arm of French insurer AXA.""That's why we think it's important for chairmen to have a good relationship with investors, so they can access what markets think about the performance of the company and executives.""COUNTRY BY COUNTRYInvestor willingness to voice displeasure at a chair during the annual meeting, at which pay deals, board composition and other plans are rubber-stamped, differs from country to country. In Britain, which leads the world in many aspects of governance, concerns with the chair are usually raised behind closed doors as part of an 'engagement' approach. Chairs in continental Europe, meanwhile, can be much less responsive.National differences in the way boards are run can make it difficult for investors to influence company leadership in the same way. In France, for example, the CEO and chair are more often one and the same person, while in Germany the CEO leads the management board and the chair heads up the supervisory board.But the need to make good decisions about those in charge is clear, said Hans-Christoph Hirt, director at investor advisory service Hermes EOS.""We do not want to be running a company but we do want to make sure the right people are. Too much of our time is eaten up by talking about remuneration rather than the people on the board,"" he said.Recent examples of corporate governance issues rattling investors include that of German carmaker VW (DE:VOWG_p), where Chairman and key shareholder Ferdinand Piech's public attack on the performance of the firm's CEO sparked a 10 percent slide in the company's share price.In France, meanwhile, media company  Vivendi 's (PA:VIV) chairman, chief executive and biggest shareholder Vincent Bollore has tightened his grip on the company by securing double voting rights despite just over half of shareholder votes being cast against the motion.While still early days for the 2015 annual general meeting season in Britain, there have also been some high-profile 'oppose' recommendations made by shareholder advisory firms, including one against Chairman Douglas Flint at lender HSBC (L:HSBA) ahead of Friday's AGM, amid concerns over his executive duties. Recent history, however, shows the bar for most investors to vote against a chair has been set pretty high, reflecting concerns that a heavy vote against management could hurt the share price.""Voting is an important tool but the discussions you have with a chairman six to nine months or so before an AGM are much more important,"" Hirt said.Data from shareholder advisory firm Manifest showed just 134 of more than 15,000 director elections or re-elections at the UK's 350 biggest firms had received dissent equal to or greater than 30 percent of the votes in the five years to Jan. 2015.Just 15 resolutions had 'against' votes of more than 50 percent of the votes cast.""It's a very rare occurrence for a chairman to be voted off,"" said Sarah Wilson, at Manifest. ""A chairman would probably leave rather than face a negative vote ... voting against a chairman is a nuclear option.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Having exited telecoms and video games, Bollore and management want to build Vivendi into a stronger media group by adding to its Universal Music Group and French pay-TV operator Canal Plus, and making acquisitions.Orange has been looking for a partner for over a year to help Dailymotion expand internationally to try to compete with much larger rival Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube.The Vivendi negotiations come after Hong Kong conglomerate PCCW said it had ended talks to form an alliance with Dailymotion, citing the French government's desire to see the video-sharing site remain in European hands.French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said last week that Orange, in which the state is the biggest shareholder with about 25 percent, must consider all offers for Dailymotion, adding that France was seeking to promote a strong European digital sector.In 2013, Orange was in talks to sell all or part of the site to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), but the French government scuppered the deal over concerns about a promising start-up being snapped up by a U.S. giant.Dailymotion counts 128 million unique visitors per month, compared with 1 billion for YouTube, and achieves less than 100 million euros in annual sales.($1 = 0.9210 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Schoenfeld Asset Management (PSAM), which says it owns 0.8 percent of Vivendi, has urged Vivendi to consider spinning off Universal Music Group, one of its two remaining businesses alongside Canal Plus. Paulo Cardoso, who represents employees on the Vivendi board, said in a letter dated March 30 that such a move would amount to a ""dismantling and break-up of Vivendi"". ""We are vehemently opposed to such a proposal,"" he wrote. ""We are confident that our group can become an international player in media and content generating strong job creation through a long-term strategy.""Vivendi employees own 3.1 percent of the company's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. PSAM is trying to rally other shareholders to vote for two resolutions at an April 17 meeting that would require Vivendi to boost returns to shareholders to 9 billion euros ($9.8 billion) after asset sales left it with a pile of cash.The fund has also criticised Vivendi's governance and the role of Bollore, who recently bought 632 million euros worth of Vivendi shares to take his stake to 10 percent of the company.The French tycoon has overseen a radical slimming down of the company in the past two years, in which time it has sold four of six divisions, exited telecoms and amassed a cash pile which stood at 4.6 billion euros at the end of 2014.Vivendi said in April it planned to pay out 5.7 billion euros to shareholders in dividends and buy backs by 2017, but wanted to keep some cash to build itself into a stronger media company via organic growth and acquisitions.PSAM believes the money should be returned to shareholders instead and that it makes little sense to try to build up Vivendi into a bigger media company when its two businesses, music and pay-TV, have little in common.(The story corrects date of letter to March 30 from March 20 in third paragraph)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

420,"Feb 18, 2015 10:51AM ET",Telecoms tycoon seeks to buy out Vivendi from Numericable-SFR,nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - Billionaire Patrick Drahi is aiming to buy Vivendi's 20 percent stake in Numericable-SFR to strengthen his grip on France's No.2 telecoms group and prepare for a possible next round of industry consolidation. Drahi's holding company Altice and its subsidiary Numericable-SFR said on Wednesday they had offered Viven (PARIS:VIV)di 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion), or 40 euros a share, for the media firm's stake.While that is well below Numericable-SFR's current share price of over 50 euros, it is above the level at which Vivendi sold SFR to Numericable in November, which analysts say equated to around 33.30 euros.A deal could allow Vivendi to boost a return of cash to shareholders or add to its warchest for acquisitions, while for Drahi it could clear the way for a long-mooted bid for smaller French rival Bouygu (PARIS:BOUY)es Telecom. ""From a Numericable-Altice perspective, this offer could be interpreted as organizing its finances in readiness for a Bouygues Telecom offer,"" said Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis.Telecoms firms across Europe have been striking deals, taking advantage of low interest rates to build up scale and seek cost savings in a saturated market.Under Drahi's proposal, Numericable-SFR would pay half the offered sum to Vivendi in cash by buying back its shares, pending approval from shareholders in an April 30 vote. Altice would pay the rest by April 7, 2016, plus interest. Vivendi said its management board would examine the offer and its supervisory board, which next meets on Feb. 27, would decide on any action.Vivendi sold telecoms group SFR to cable company Numericable for 13.37 billion euros in November, and was supposed to remain a minority shareholder for at least a year. It holds two board seats, and Altice had options to buy Vivendi's shares between the 19th and 43rd month after closing.If it does accept, it would add to the cash pile Vivendi has accumulated from sales in the past two years as it exited telecoms and kept only its music and pay-TV businesses. Led by chairman and largest shareholder Vincent Bollore, Vivendi wants to expand its existing media activities, possibly also via acquisitions.Jefferies' Dellis estimates Vivendi had 8 billion euros net cash at the end of 2014, and said the Altice move would renew speculation of a larger return of cash to shareholders in 2015 than the 3.5 billion euros already planned. ""We remain skeptical that Vivendi shareholders will receive as much as some hope given management's presumed incentive to retain maximum capacity to re-engineer the rump media business and put it on a firmer growth footing,"" wrote Dellis. In November, Altice CEO Dexter Goei said his company viewed itself as the ""natural buyer"" of Bouygues Telecom and was open to talks. In recent days media reports have said Altice was preparing an offer for Bouygues, though Bouygues said no talks were underway.Separately, Numericable-SFR published pro-forma results for 2014 with revenue coming in at 11.4 billion euros. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stood at 3.1 billion euros, while pro-forma capital expenditure was 1.8 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The big issue at Telecom Italia is now how chief executive Marco Patuano will reshape the group's strategy to compete in a saturated European market and adjust to consolidation that is creating bigger global rivals.In Brazil, Telecom Italia faces yet more challenges. For years, the country has largely avoided the consolidation sweeping Europe because of its robust economy. But after mobile phone subscriptions in Brazil more than trebled in the eight years to 2012, growth in the continent's biggest economy has slowed, reducing the promise of the 200 million person market.The telecoms sector in Brazil has already started consolidating due to Telefonica's purchase of GVT and last year's merger of Brazil's Oi (SA:OIBR3) and Portugal Telecom (LS:PTC). Consolidation among the country's four mobile operators is now brewing, and Telecom Italia's TIM Brasil could end up either as a target or as a buyer.To strengthen its position in the market as well as in pending deal-making, TIM Brasil is considering a plan that would plow 750 million euros over the next three years to strengthen its 4G and 3G network infrastructure, the person said.Telecom Italia declined to comment.The loss of the bidding battle for GVT turned Telecom Italia into a potential prey in the fast consolidating telecoms industry, raising expectations Brazilian telecoms operator Grupo Oi could pursue plans to bid for TIM Brasil.But the M&A scenario in Brazil took another twist more recently and a source with knowledge of the situation said this week TIM Brasil had hired Banco Bradesco (SA:BBDC4) to analyze a potential bid for Oi.

The Telefonica Brasil stake was valued at 2.02 billion euros as of Sept 18 and the Telecom Italia shares being acquired by Vivendi at 1.01 billion euros.Vivendi will also have a tax bill to pay on the sale estimated at around 500 million euros.Telefonica, which will finance the deal through a capital increase by its Brazilian business and at the parent company, has estimated synergies of at least 4.7 billion euros in Brazil from the deal."

425,"Aug 28, 2014 07:18PM ET",Telefonica prevails in battle for Vivendi's Brazil unit GVT,nan,"By Leila Abboud PARIS (Reuters) - French media company Vivendi (PA:VIV) picked Telefonica (MC:TEF) for exclusive talks over the sale of its Brazilian broadband unit GVT, spurning a rival bid from Telecom Italia (MI:TLIT). Telefonica will fold GVT into its Brazilian mobile phone carrier Vivo (SA:VIVT3) to create the country's biggest telecom group. It will then use GVT's pay-TV and broadband know-how and its broad network to chase higher-value customers and keep profits growing as mobile subscriber growth slows. Vivendi's decision deals a blow to Telecom Italia, which needed GVT to shore up its own Brazilian mobile business Tim Participações (SA:TIMP3), which lacks a fixed-line network. For Vivendi, the GVT sale caps a tumultuous two-year overhaul in which it sold three telecom businesses and its video games arm to pay down debt and focus more on media and content. ""The Telefonica offer best meets the group's strategic and financial objectives,"" said the French company. ""Vivendi begins a new phase in its development to become an integrated industrial group focused on media and content."" In a statement late on Thursday Telecom Italia acknowledged Vivendi's decision to choose Telefonica for exclusive talks over GVT. ""From the start Telecom Italia has made it clear it would take a disciplined approach to its strategy in Brazil,"" it said, adding it would continue to pursue development plans in the country in line with its 2014-2016 business plan. Vivendi will get 4.66 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in cash from Telefonica, which boosted the cash element of a previous bid to see off Telecom Italia. Vivendi will also get a 12 percent stake in the combined Vivo-GVT, of which about one-third could be exchanged for a 5.7 percent stake in Telecom Italia if Vivendi so chose. Telefonica is Telecom Italia's largest shareholder but the two have had a tense relationship for years as they also compete in Brazil. French tycoon Vincent Bollore, who is Vivendi's largest shareholder, led the talks with Telefonica and Telecom Italia in recent weeks, in his first major strategic move since taking over as chairman in June. Bollore wants to get Vivendi's remaining units, which include Universal Music Group and French pay-TV operator Canal Plus, to work more closely together to generate growth. Vivendi is also expected to build up its media and content activities via acquisitions, and will be flush with cash even after returning money to shareholders. The French company is likely to take up the option to be paid for GVT partly in Telecom Italia shares, said two people close to the company. Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine said such a stake could be ""attractive"" and played down investors' concerns about whether the group was going back on its pledge to move out of telecoms. ""Our strategy is to be an integrated media group but opportunistically we can hold minority stakes in telecoms,"" he said. ""The priority is to ensure the widest possible distribution and monetization of our content."" After the GVT sales closes in mid-2015, Vivendi will own stakes in French telecoms group SFR, which it is in the process of selling to Numericable (PA:NUME), Telefonica Brasil, and potentially Telecom Italia. BRAZIL DEALS Winning GVT was crucial for both Telefonica and Telecom Italia since their European home markets have been shrinking. Brazil brings in one-fifth of Telefonica's revenue and one-third of Telecom Italia's sales. Telefonica has coveted GVT since it lost an initial bidding war to Vivendi to buy the company in 2009. With GVT, Telefonica will gain a much bigger broadband network in Brazil without having to build it. Vivo is the country's third-biggest broadband provider but is concentrated around the Sao Paulo region, whereas GVT has built coverage elsewhere, such as in Rio de Janeiro, the south and northeast. Telefonica will carry out capital increases at the group level and at Telefonica Brasil to pay for the GVT deal. Telecom Italia looks unlikely to come back with a new offer. Analysts say its balance sheet is too stretched and its chief executive has pledged not to do anything ""crazy"" in a bidding war. Its losing bid, also a cash-and-shares offer, valued GVT at 7 billion euros, including 1.7 billion euros in cash, a 16 percent stake in Telecom Italia and a 15 percent stake in the new Brazilian entity. Telecom Italia's Tim, number two in Brazil's mobile market, may now be vulnerable to a takeover by rival Grupo Oi (SA:OIBR3), which is exploring a bid to split up Tim between itself, Mexico's America Movil (MX:AMXL) and Telefonica. Telecom Italia shares closed up 1.3 percent as investors speculated that a sale of Tim Brasil could be in the offing. Oi shares jumped as much as 3.5 percent. ""If Tim had merged with GVT it would have been a much tougher target,"" said Alex Pardellas, a telecom analyst at CGD Securities in Rio de Janeiro. ""Now it remains a natural candidate for consolidation.""

426,"Aug 27, 2014 07:00PM ET","Brazil telecom battle heats up as Oi tries to buy, split TIM",nan,"By Luciana Bruno and Leila Abboud RIO DE JANEIRO/PARIS (Reuters) - Brazil's Grupo Oi SA unveiled plans on Wednesday to take over Telecom Italia's local mobile unit, in a move sources said was aimed at breaking up the country's second-biggest wireless carrier and upstaging merger bids by foreign rivals. Oi said on Wednesday that it hired Brazilian investment bank and shareholder Grupo BTG Pactual SA to explore alternatives to acquire Telecom Italia SpA's 67 percent stake in TIM Participações SA, the country's second biggest wireless carrier. Oi's plan is to bring in Mexico's America Movil SAB de CV and Spain's Telefonica SA in a deal to split TIM three ways, easing the financial and regulatory burdens of consolidation, according to two sources who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the deal. The move adds a new twist to the bidding war for Vivendi SA's Brazilian broadband unit GVT, which both Telecom Italia and Spain's Telefonica SA are pursuing to bolster their mobile businesses in the country. Telecom Italia said in a statement that it knew nothing about the move, was not involved in the plans, and saw TIM as a ""strategic asset.""  Telecom giants are jostling for position in Brazil as they struggle to add customers, invest in high-speed networks and protect profits in a stagnant economy. Those pressures have added to growing expectations of potential mergers, following a trend sweeping markets from Austria to Ireland. Oi has been sidelined in the consolidation, stuck with a fourth-place wireless carrier and 46 billion reais ($20 billion) in debt after a rocky merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA. To overcome financial and regulatory hurdles, Oi turned to BTG Pactual, a deep-pocketed shareholder that put up 2 billion reais to make sure the Portugal Telecom deal went through, two sources with knowledge of the deal said. Oi asked BTG Pactual to act as ""merchant commissioner"", creating a special investment vehicle of the kind that has been used to break up companies among multiple buyers. The Telecom Italia board, which met for nearly nine hours on the GVT bid on Wednesday, commented on Oi's move afterwards, saying Telecom Italia ""is completely extraneous to the Oi SA initiative about which it knows nothing.""  A separate statement detailing its offer for GVT is expected on Thursday morning. Telefonica was also set to meet on Wednesday to discuss its bid. The deals are estimated to be worth 7 billion euros ($9 billion). Vivendi is expected to hold a board meeting on Thursday.  Oi, Telefonica and America Movil, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's telecom giant, have been discussing a potential joint bid for TIM since late last year, according to several sources. America Movil owns Brazil's No. 3 wireless carrier and its biggest broadband operator.  ""We would expect Telefonica and America Movil to join Oi, as BTG Pactual works as the intermediary and figures out a way for them to buy TIM,"" said Mauricio Fernandes, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Breaking up TIM would likely reduce the financial burden for rivals and facilitate regulatory approval, said Antonio Espirito Santo, an analyst with Banco Espirito Santo in Sao Paulo. That scenario would also trigger significant cost savings for Oi, with an acquisition in the region of 35 percent helping save about 12 billion reais, he added.  Any move to consolidate Brazil's mobile market will face close scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have expressed concern that fewer players will weaken competition. Capital spending increases and diminishing returns have driven telecom mergers around the world but in Brazil, issues surrounding Oi's merger with Portugal Telecom and the bidding war for GVT have muddied the waters.  Preferred shares of Oi soared more than 5 percent in Sao Paulo, while the price for the company's 5.75 percent bond due in February 2022 dropped 2.5 cents on the U.S. dollar to 94.75 cents - indicating that investors expect Oi to fund any deal with more debt.  BOARD MEETINGS Oi's move shook up a key day for its European rivals. Sources told Reuters Telecom Italia's bid for GVT would value the company at roughly 7 billion euros and leave Vivendi with a 15 to 20 percent stake in the Italian group. Telefonica's board was also set to meet on Wednesday to discuss improving its bid for GVT as it seeks to head off Telecom Italia, according to a person familiar with the matter.  ""It will be higher than (Telefonica's original) 6.7 billion euros, but it won't be as much as 8 billion euros,"" the source said, referring to a figure cited in newspaper reports. Telefonica declined comment. Vivendi is expected to discuss the GVT offers at a meeting before it publishes second-quarter results on Thursday. Telecom Italia shares were up 3.2 percent at the end of Wednesday, while Vivendi's were up 1.2 percent. Telefonica was up 0.04 percent. Telecom Italia executives have said Brazil was core to its strategy but it would examine any bids it received for TIM. ""This places Telecom Italia under even more pressure in Brazil, as the company is apparently mulling the possibility of a counteroffer on GVT and is now faced with a bid on its local subsidiary,"" Espirito Santo said. The current mobile pecking order in Brazil has Telefonica with a 28.7 percent market share at the end of the first quarter, Telecom Italia's TIM with 27 percent, America Movil with 25.1 percent and Oi with 18.5 percent. In broadband, America Movil held 30 percent of the market, Oi 27.7 percent, Telefonica 18.4 percent, and GVT had 12.7 percent. Telecom Italia's lack of a fixed network has left it with less than one percent share.

427,"Aug 26, 2014 03:00PM ET",Telecom Italia to go ahead with bid for Vivendi's GVT,nan,"By Stefano Rebaudo, Stephen Jewkes and Pamela BarbagliaMILAN (Reuters) - Telecom Italia (MI:TLIT) will make a bid valued at roughly 7 billion euros ($9.2 billion) for Vivendi's Brazilian broadband unit GVT (PA:VIV), which would leave Vivendi with a 15 to 20 percent stake in the Italian group, said four people familiar with the matter.Telecom Italia is competing with Spain's Telefonica (MC:TEF) for control of GVT, which sells high-end broadband and pay-TV packages to consumers in Brazil.Telefonica, Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder, offered Vivendi (PA:VIV) around 4 billion euros in cash for GVT plus a 12 percent stake in the newly combined group.Brazil is crucial for both Telefonica and Telecom Italia, because its market still has growth potential, especially in broadband and pay-TV, compared with the more mature market in Europe.They already control the two largest mobile operators there, Telefonica's Vivo (SA:VIVT3) and Telecom Italia's Tim Brasil (SA:TIMP3).Acquiring GVT would be especially important for Telecom Italia since it is the only Brazilian mobile operator without a fixed-line network and has a market share of less than 1 percent in broadband.Telefonica had an 18.4 percent broadband market share at the end of the first quarter, behind America Movil (MX:AMXL) and Oi (SA:OIBR3), while GVT had 12.7 percent.Telecom Italia's offer, set to be discussed at a board meeting on Wednesday, is structured around a merger of GVT with TIM Brasil.Vivendi would be paid with a 15 to 20 percent stake in Telecom Italia via a reserved capital increase and would also get a small amount of cash, the sources said, without elaborating on the amount. It would also retain a roughly 12 percent stake in the Tim Brasil-GVT combined entity, one person close to the deal said.VIVENDI TO CONSIDERIt remains to be seen how Vivendi will respond to the dueling bids for GVT. The board of Vivendi is expected to discuss the situation at a meeting before second-quarter results are published on Thursday.The Paris-based group has sold two of its three telecoms businesses in the past two years in an effort to refocus on its media activities, which include Universal Music Group and French pay-TV operator Canal Plus.A sale of GVT, its last telecoms asset and smallest business, would fit that pattern, although Vivendi said in early August after Telefonica's bid that none of its units were for sale.A spokesman for Vivendi said on Tuesday that any offers it received for GVT would be reviewed by the board.Telefonica and Telecom Italia declined to comment.Telecom Italia has less balance sheet flexibility than Telefonica, and the cash portion of its offer is expected to be lower than the rival bid, the sources said.But Telecom Italia is pinning its hopes on the fact that Vivendi does not need cash after agreeing this spring to sell its largest unit, French telco SFR, for roughly 17 billion euros and that its powerful chairman and largest shareholder, Vincent Bollore, could be keen to expand in Italy, one of the sources said.""Vivendi is not all that interested in cash, since it's got plenty already, but wants a strategic deal where it can sell its content,"" a person close to the Italian company said.To that end, Telecom Italia is casting its offer as providing a way for Vivendi to distribute its music and television content in Italy, the source said.Telecom Italia is also hoping personal ties will tip the balance in its favor.French tycoon Bollore owns 7 percent of Mediobanca (MI:MDBI), the investment bank that has long been at the heart of Italy's high finance, according to the bank's website. Mediobanca is also one of Telecom Italia's advisers on the GVT deal.Telefonica too has included a clause in its GVT bid that would allow Vivendi a way to distribute more of its television content, a source said on Aug. 18.Italian newspapers said on Tuesday Telefonica could increase its overall offer for GVT to as much as 8 billion euros and that Bollore was meeting with Telefonica Chief Executive Cesar Alierta.(Writing by Silvia Aloisi and Leila Abboud; editing by Jane Baird)"

Mediobanca used to control Telecom Italia along with Telefonica and other financial players.Sources told Reuters last week that Telecom Italia was in talks with Vivendi to buy GVT and beat a 6.7 billion euro ($8.9 billion) bid from Spanish rival Telefonica, which is also Telecom Italia's biggest investor.The sources said the plan, which could be finalised over the next three weeks, would involve an equity swap to allow Vivendi to acquire a stake in Telecom Italia.Patuano has not ruled out a possible merger between the Italian group's local wireless unit TIM Brasil and GVT but said he will not make any ""crazy"" acquisitions in Brazil.The Latin American country is a crucial market for both Telecom Italia and Telefonica and still has growth potential, in contrast to relatively saturated European markets.A tie-up between TIM Brasil and GVT would create a stronger competitor to Telefonica's local unit Vivo.

 (Adds details on ITF timing, board) By Denny Thomas and Elzio Barreto HONG KONG, April 11 (Reuters) - Simon Murray, the South Pole
adventurer and former Vodafone board member, is in the running
for the role of chairman at Glencore, the commodities giant set
to detail plans for a $10 billion-plus listing later this week. Murray, who lives and works in Hong Kong, has spent 45 years
in Asia and has served on the boards of several major companies.
The UK-born businessman said on Monday he had a long history of
successful investment in the mining and resources sectors. ""This is very exciting, but you are talking to someone who
has been chased by a leopard. You are talking to someone who has
been shot at with a machine gun and missed,"" Murray told Reuters
in an exclusive interview.  ""As Mr. Churchill once said, the most exhilarating
experience in life is to be shot at without result."" Murray, a former French Foreign Legionnaire, said he was one
of three candidates on the shortlist for the position at the
notoriously secretive trading and mining firm.  Glencore has yet to take a decision on the non-executive
role but is widely expected to pick a name before Thursday, the
day it is targeting to publish details of its listing for the
first time in a so-called intention-to-float, according to
sources familiar with the matter. ""It's premature to say anything; it will be the board's
decision. They may feel I am a bit young for this,"" the
71-year-old joked in the 36th floor office of his private equity
firm in Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Center. Glencore's intention-to-float is expected to outline an
eight-strong board, including five non-executive directors as
well as a chairman to work alongside Chief Executive Ivan
Glasenberg and Chief Financial Officer Steven Kalmin.   ASIAN CONNECTION Glencore's choice of new chairman, a necessity as the
commodities giant abandons its once-fabled secrecy in favour of
a London listing, is being watched by many as a test of the
company's corporate governance credentials. The successful candidate will have to hold his own against
CEO Glasenberg, a notoriously tough dealer, and will also need
to reassure investors that remain uneasy about a company that
remains opaque to many and has dealings in some of the world's
least palatable economies. Some fund managers in London are sceptical Murray is the man
for the job. ""Realistically, if they want to appoint a proper chairman
for a five to 10-year period, is a 71 year old the right choice?
Or is this just an interim one for the IPO?"" said one
London-based equities fund manager specialising in mining and
commodities, speaking on condition of anonymity. The much-anticipated initial public offering will see
Glencore sell a roughly 15-20 percent stake, making it
potentially the largest listing to date in London. It will
dissolve the group's partnership structure and lift the veil
after decades of secrecy, but will also hand the world's largest
commodities trader the capacity to seize many more, and larger,
acquisition opportunities. The Hong Kong listing aims to capitalise on the deep pockets
of investors in Asia, who are well acquainted with surging
demand for metals and other natural resources from fast-growing
economies in China and India. ""Natural resources are always quite exciting; they tend to
turn up in the strangest places. So you get a good view of the
world,"" Murray said. ""This is an exciting company, this is
absolutely the right sector today, commodities."" Murray, wearing a navy blue jacket, collared shirt and no
tie, said that if selected as chairman, he'd ""be on the phone
with Ivan (Glasenberg) at least once a week"". ""I've met Ivan, I like Ivan. Apart from anything else, he
gave me a very, very long lift to the airport, which was very
nice of him. Saved me the taxi money. That was the other day in
Switzerland. I always appreciate gestures like that."" Among his previous roles, Murray was managing director of
Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing's Hutchison Whampoa and serves
on boards including Richemont and Essar Energy. He holds the
record for the oldest man to walk unsupported to the South Pole,
which he completed in 2004 aged 63. Murray said he would seek to make his mark on the board,
should he get the job, given the greater scrutiny on corporate
governance from shareholders and investors, particularly on huge
bonuses paid to financial executives. ""It's absolutely critical that the board understands what
its role is. In today's markets we are permanently under the
microscope, and we have to make sure we covered and ticked all
the boxes,"" he added.

 (Rewrites, updates prices, adds details) By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Commodities rose on Monday as
Brent crude topped $120 a barrel on concerns over the impact on
supply from unrest in the Middle East, while corn surged to
match a record-high price set during the 2008 global food
crisis. Merger and acquisition activity helped global equities eke
out gains. Wall Street was little changed, as the broad S&P 500
 struggled to break above its high for the year ahead of
the quarterly earnings season that kicks off next week. Expectations of higher euro zone interest rates took the
euro briefly to an 11-month high against the Japanese yen,
before easing back with expectations of an increase already
priced in. Brent crude oil prices rose above $120 a barrel to the
highest level since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
the global financial crisis in September 2008. After choppy
trading, U.S. crude settled up 53 cents at $108.47 a barrel,
the highest close since September 2008. Libya's continuing conflict and unrest in Yemen could pose
threats to supply in the Middle East, while investors expect
demand for oil could grow on signs of improvement in the U.S.
economy. Corn futures extended a rally that began last week when the
U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged quarterly corn stocks as
of March 1 at levels well below trade expectations, with
tightening supply underscoring the strong demand for the feed
grain. For details, see [ID:nLDE7300TD] ""There are no signs saying corn won't go higher. Stocks
were bullish for corn and now planting weather doesn't look
good,"" said Mario Balletto, analyst for Citigroup. Earlier in the day, spot corn equaled its record high of
$7.65 per bushel set on June 27, 2008. Chicago Board of Trade
corn futures unofficially ended up at $7.59. EQUITIES STRUGGLE World stocks as measured by MSCI  were up
0.3 percent, hovering around a one-month high and up nearly 5
percent for the year to date. European shares rose to a
three-week closing high. Among the day's M&A, Belgian chemicals group Solvay
 bid for French rival Rhodia , driving up
Rhodia's shares 48 percent, and Vodafone  said it was
selling its 44 percent stake in France's second biggest telecom
operator SFR to Vivendi . [ID:nLDE66P0SY]
[ID:nLDE73319N] The FTSEurofirst 300  closed up 0.04 percent at
1,142,84 points, the highest close since March 9. But the S&P
was slightly lower in the early afternoon, hovering just under
1,333, a level that it has been unable to close above since
mid-February. The S&P recorded its best two-week period since December on
Friday and the Dow industrials  hit the highest intraday
level since June 2008. The Dow Jones industrial average  added 10.33 points,
or 0.08 percent, to 12,387.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
 was off 1.50 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,330.91. The
Nasdaq Composite Index  dipped 6.19 points, or 0.22
percent, to 2,783.41.  Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global
Asset Management in Boston, said the earnings season would
likely push the S&P 500 to 1,400 by mid-May as stocks come off
the seasonally strong November-April period. ""If we make a successful break from here, I think you've
got the 1,400 range and I think that's probably likely during
the final seasonally favorable push,"" Zaro said. Economic improvement has cemented expectations that the ECB
will raise interest rates Thursday and led to speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve may be getting closer to withdrawing
exceptional liquidity. [ID:nLDE7330AC] A top Federal Reserve official said on Monday that U.S.
inflation is likely to remain low for now, but policymakers
will keep a close eye on potentially self-fulfilling consumer
expectations for higher prices. [ID:nN04244409] Reflecting expectations of differing rate paths, the euro
hit an 11-month high against the yen and touched a five-month
peak against the dollar. The euro later slipped back. The euro briefly popped above 120 yen  for the
first time since May 2010 and was later at 119.50 yen. It hit a
five-month high against the dollar of $1.4269 and was later at
$1.4223 .

while oil rose to 2-1/2-year highs on worries geopolitical
risks will hit supply. The M&A cheer did little for Wall Street with the broad S&P

since September 2008. Libya's continuing conflict and unrest in Yemen could pose
threats to supply in the Middle East, while investors expect
demand for oil could grow on signs of improvement in the U.S.
economy. ""Brent is up on Libya, Yemen unrest and the Nigerian
election,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in
Chicago. ""U.S. crude is hesitant because there is still worry that
the Federal Reserve might be nearing a rate hike or tighter
policy, which would lower liquidity and demand and strengthen
the dollar,"" he added. World stocks as measured by MSCI  were up
0.2 percent, hovering around a one-month high and up nearly 5

three-week closing high on Monday supported by merger news, with
Rhodia leading chemical stocks after Solvay's 3.4 billion euro
($4.8 billion) bid. Signs of an improving economic outlook also helped the
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares end 0.04 percent
firmer at 1,141.86 points, the highest close since March 9,
albeit with volumes at 82 percent of the 90-day average. Headwinds such as Japan's nuclear problem, unrest in the
Arab world and the euro zone's debt crisis were in the
background as investors focused on issues such as a likely rate
hike by the European Central bank on Thursday and an improvement
in the U.S. labour market reported last Friday. ""Positive sentiment is coming from mergers. We will see more
mergers and acquisitions and it is one of the reasons why the
stock market is still trading at these higher levels,"" a
London-based equity trader said. ""Some long-only institutions are going underweight retailers
as some stores have been complaining about dwindling sales. I
would imagine people will continue to be underweight the sector.
We have seen some good buying in construction stocks."" Chemical shares featured among the top gainers, with the
STOXX Europe 600 chemical index rising 1.2 percent. Rhodia
jumped 48 percent after Solvay launched a bid. In other M&A news, Vodafone sold its 44 percent stake in
French mobile operator SFR to Vivendi for 7.95 billion euros.
Vodafone ended 0.1 percent lower while the sector index rose 0.3
percent. ""M&A and fund flows into equity markets are providing
support to the asset class,"" said Graham Secker, European equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley. Analysts said equities remained attractive on valuation
grounds and by comparison with other asset classes. Europe's
STOXX 600 index carries a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
of 10.5, below its 10-year average of 13.6.  FINANCIALS SUFFER  Financials topped the fallers' list, with the STOXX Europe
banking index down 0.7 percent and the insurance sector index
 falling 1.1 percent, on persistent concerns about the euro zone
debt situation. Morgan Stanley said investors were positive on European
banks, but three factors were holding them back: funding; a need
for more clarity on capital and funding rules; and greater
policy support to peripheral countries. Investors waited for this week's rate decision by the
European Central Bank (ECB). A rate hike of 25 basis points from
a record low in reaction to rising inflationary pressures was
already priced in, analysts said. ""To me it is not a negative. The ECB is ready to hike rates,
which is also a vote of confidence in the strength of the
upswing. In terms of the macroeconomic impact, a 25 basis point
hike is really marginal,"" said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at
Generali Investments, which manages $465 billion. ""There is a risk to the oil price, there is Japan, but in
the end what matters is the strength of the global upswing and
all these risk factors will not derail it."" J.P.Morgan Cazenove saw technology shares leveraged to
economic upswing and said they remained attractively priced. It
was particularly bullish on semiconductors and software
companies, and was underweight on defensives such as
pharmaceuticals.

top share index higher on Monday, as brokers urged investors to
keep buying, and further M&A activity lent support, with
Vodafone selling its stake in SFR for $11.3 billion to Vivendi. By 1117 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 13.92 points, or 0.2
percent, at 6,023.84, having hit a nearly six-week closing high
on Friday after solid U.S. jobs data boosted confidence
surrounding recovery momentum in the World's largest economy. Volumes were light, however, with the FTSE trading just 31
percent off its average 90-day volume at midday. London's blue chips have rallied near 8 percent since their
2011-low on March 15, as investors' confidence has returned
following the shock of Japan's earthquake. Risk sensitive sectors were the top performers in the FTSE
100, led by speciality mining stocks and integrated oils as
bullish sentiment surrounding the global economic recovery
offset concerns over political upheaval in North Africa and the
Middle East and Europe's debt crisis. Precious metals miner Fresnillo gained 3 percent as gold
rose back above $1,430 against a weakening dollar, ahead of the
European Central Bank's (ECB) next interest rate decision. The ECB is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday,
with bets increasing that the Bank of England as well as the
U.S. Federal Reserve might follow suit. JP Morgan chose miners among its top sector picks in a note
on European equity strategy which also included: capital goods,
mining, autos, technology, insurance and banks. ""Stay positive on equities, keep buying any dips; Cyclicals
(will be a) key beneficiary of broadening recovery and rising

trade on Monday as merger activity kept the market's three-week
rally going ahead of an expected interest rate rise by the
European Central Bank seen as supportive for European equities. Shares in chemical group Rhodia jumped 50 percent after
Solvay launched a 3.4 billion euro agreed bid for its French
rival, while Vodafone also rose after selling its 44 percent
stake in France's second-biggest mobile telecoms operator SFR to
Vivendi for a total of 7.95 billion euros ($11.3 billion). Solvay was up 3.1 percent while Vivendi gained 0.4 percent. ""The newsflow coming from the M&A front is very welcome.
We've been expecting it for a while, so it's a very good start
for the quarter,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative
sales trading, at Global Equities in Paris. On Friday Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange launched
a counter bid to buy NYSE Euronext, trumping an initial bid from
Germany's Deutsche Boerse.
 At 0855 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,143.91 points, after gaining 1.5
percent on Friday. The benchmark index has risen about 7 percent since reaching
a floor in mid-March, but it is still down 4 percent from a peak
touched in mid-February.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Interactive graphic on M&A: http://r.reuters.com/kyb46q ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Heavyweight mining shares gained ground, with Xstrata up

Germany's DAX index up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.05
percent. Later in the week, investors will turn their focus on the
ECB's decision on interest rates, due on Thursday. Societe Generale strategists see the expected rate hike as
supportive for European equities, as it should boost the euro
currency and tame inflation fears. ""The euro strengthening versus the U.S. dollar should lead
to a re-rating of European equities. Cheap valuation should
allow European equities to absorb higher European bond yields,""
Societe Generale's strategists wrote in a note. Despite the brisk three-week rally, European stock valuation
levels remain comparatively low. Europe's broad STOXX 600 index
 carries a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.5, well
below its 10-year average of 13.6. Investors seeking protection for their equity portfolios
should start buying volatility derivatives again as the main
volatility indexes fall back toward their long-term averages
following a recent spike triggered by violence in Libya and
Japan's nuclear crisis, said Frederic Cezard, executive director
at Nomura in Paris. ""We're back to good entry levels. The market is getting used
to the negative newsflow coming from the Fukushima nuclear plant
... At these levels we see the return of inflows into volatility
derivatives,"" he said. Volatility indexes won't fall much further as a number of
worries, from unrest in the Arab world to the euro zone debt
crisis, will continue to rattle investors and could spark sudden
surges in volatility, Cezard warned. Volatility derivatives are used by equity fund managers as a
protection against market corrections because of their strong
negative correlation with stocks.

floated on the stock market if France's Vivendi decides to sell
its 20 percent stake in the group majority-owned by General
Electric, Vivendi's chief executive said. ""Why not?"" Jean-Bernard Levy said when asked at a media
conference on Tuesday whether an initial public offering would
be an option for the U.S. entertainment group, adding that it
would likely be in New York. ""It was part of the thinking we had back in 2003 when we
created NBC Universal that maybe when Vivendi would exit, one
way ... would be through a flotation on the stock market and
maybe that is what will happen,"" he said. French media group Vivendi has an annual window beginning in
mid-November to decide whether to sell the stake to GE. Levy
declined to say whether the company was leaning towards a sale
this year. ""We have said repeatedly it is not a core part of Vivendi
but we make no further comment,"" he said at the British
government-sponsored c&binet conference in Watford near London. Sources close to the discussions have said GE is negotiating
a sale of a majority stake in NBCU to cable operator Comcast to
create a powerhouse spanning TV broadcast, cable networks, movie
and theme parks worth about $30 billion. Such a deal would depend on Vivendi's selling its stake. NBC Universal is an incongruous asset for GE, whose
portfolio includes aircraft engines and power turbines. Levy declined to say whether Vivendi would be prepared to
raise its $3 billion offer for Brazilian telecoms operator GVT,
after Spain's Telefonica trumped it with an unsolicited bid of
$3.7 billion. ""The asset would fit very well with Vivendi's strategy,""
Levy said. ""We haven't yet formally bid. We are reviewing the
situation right now."" Vivendi has a long-standing policy of not engaging in
bidding wars for takeover targets.

be able to download songs from Apple Inc's iTunes music store
next year after the firm and other groups agreed to rules for
online music distribution, the European Commission said.  Existing practices for music licensing and the copyright
framework in Europe can make it difficult for consumers to buy
what they want on the Internet. Apple, which currently does not let European users buy from
iTunes online services outside their country of residence,
controls just over half of global digital music sales through
iTunes. Apple, Amazon.com and music company EMI were among several
signatories to a joint statement on Monday that set out general
principles for online distribution of music in the future, the
Commission said. ""Apple has indicated that they were optimistic about making
the iTunes store more available to European consumers in more
European countries in the coming year,"" Commission spokesman
Jonathan Todd told a regular briefing on Tuesday. ""This is a concrete step forward in terms of a better offer
of online music for consumers, which will also benefit the music
industry by ensuring better conditions in the market,"" he said. Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, mobile phone maker
Nokia, music royalty collecting societies SACEM, PRS for Music
and STIM, and consumer organisation BEUC also signed up to the
general principles. ""It is the first time that players from various parts of the
market have agreed on a common roadmap,"" Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement. EMI is set to announce non-exclusive deals with collecting
societies SGAE of Spain and France's SACEM, while SACEM will
look into setting up a pan-European, non-exclusive portal of
songs for online services, the Commission said. SACEM, which collects royalties for about 128,000 artists,
said in May it was willing to drop territorial restrictions and
allow national rivals to license its repertoire. The Commission, which polices competition in the 27-country
European Union, in July 2008 prohibited 24 European collecting
societies from anticompetitive practices such as membership
curbs that prevent authors from choosing their society.

Gulf's third-largest telecoms firm by market value, halted
talks to sell its African assets to appease potential buyers of
a stake in Zain Group, the firm's chief executive said. Last month, Kuwaiti conglomerate Kharafi Group said it had
agreed to sell 46 percent of Zain to a consortium led by
India's Vavasi Group and including telecoms firms Bharat
Sanchar Nigam [BSNL.UL] and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam
, and Malaysian billionaire Syed Mokhtar al-Bukhary.
[ID:nN08292119] ""Zain's Africa talks are halted for this reason,"" Saad
al-Barrak told reporters on Monday night when asked if talks
had been frozen at the request of the potential consortium to
buy the 46 percent stake in the whole company. On Sept. 8, the managing director of Vavasi Group said the
consortium will not sell Zain's African assets. [ID:nL8534327] Zain, which operates in 24 countries, had said it was in
talks to sell its African assets -- excluding Morocco and Sudan
-- after French media and telecoms conglomerate Vivendi
 broke off talks on buying the operations. India's Reliance Communications , the country's
No. 2 mobile operator, was said to be in talks for the assets. Earlier on Monday, Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund said it
might consider selling shares in Zain, in which it holds a 24.6
percent stake, though the fund is not party to talks between
stockholders of the telecom firm and potential buyers.
[ID:nL5211472] Despite the sale talk, Barrak reiterated on Monday that he
expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, to rise by 30 percent in 2009. ""Our (EBITDA) growth in the first eight months is 33
percent,"" he said. He declined to give a forecast of net profit
in 2009. ""This year we do not have losses, we have profits,
rewarding profits,"" he said.   Zain posted a 5.5 percent rise in second-quarter net profit
to 78.8 million dinars ($274.8 million) on a higher number of

that Comcast has a deal to purchase NBC Universal is
inaccurate,"" Comcast said in a statement.  But Comcast stopped short of quashing speculation it was
interested in NBC Universal, which is owned 80 percent by
General Electric Co and 20 percent by French media group Vivendi
SA. Asked if Comcast was looking at NBC Universal, a company
official declined comment. A spokesman for Vivendi had no
comment on the report but said the group had an annual window
from mid-November to early-December to exercise a put option on
its NBC Universal stake. The situation unleashes a media frenzy each autumn over what
Vivendi will do with its stake. It recently made a $2.9 billion
offer for Brazil's GVT Holdings. The Wrap.com reported late on Wednesday Comcast was in talks
to buy NBC Universal from GE and said bankers for both sides met
in New York on Tuesday to hammer out deal points. The report said two individuals informed about the meeting
said a deal had been completed at a purchase price of $35
billion. Bloomberg, citing three people with knowledge of the
discussions, reported Comcast was in talks with GE to buy a
stake of about 50 percent in NBC Universal (NBCU). The deal would partly depend on Vivendi making a decision to
sell its NBCU holding, one of the sources told the news agency. A spokesman for GE could not be reached for comment. NBC
Universal declined comment.  FULL CONTROL A $35 billion deal to buy 100 percent of NBCU would value
Vivendi's stake at 4.8 billion euros ($7 billion), above
estimated valuations ranging from 3 billion euros to 3.8
billion, analysts said. Analysts have recently said if GE does not want to take full
control of NBCU, Vivendi's share could be sold to another media
company. The names of Comcast, Time Warner and Liberty Media
have emerged in media reports. But Vivendi could also opt to sell the stake in an initial
public offering (IPO), assuming the stock market continues to
recover. ""A Comcast scenario would change the picture. The sale of
the whole of NBC Universal would be positive, raising hopes of a
better valuation (for Vivendi's stake) than under an IPO,"" said
CM-CIC analyst Eric Ravary. Natixis Securities analyst Richard Houbron said the Comcast
comments, in his view, left the door open to ""any scenario"". ""We understand that either Comcast is not talking with GE,
or that the two parties have not yet found an agreement, but
that they are indeed negotiating,"" Houbron said. The terms of a
Comcast transaction, if confirmed, would be ""clearly attractive""
for Vivendi,"" he said.Analysts say a sale of its NBCU stake would allow Vivendi to
buy out minority investors in Canal Plus France, its pay TV
business. Unlike NBCU, Canal Plus France is viewed as a key
business for Vivendi. ""We think the scenario of Vivendi's exit from NBCU is
credible and could be a positive catalyst for the stock,"" said
Oddo Securities analyst Bruno Hareng. Vivendi shares were up 0.1 euros at 21.245 euros by 1120
GMT.

500,"Sep 27, 2009 04:57PM ET",NEWSMAKER-New EDF boss Proglio is passionate team player,nan," By Dominique Vidalon and Marcel Michelson PARIS, Sept 27 ( Reuters ) - Henri Proglio, named boss of
French state-owned power company EDF  on Sunday, takes
up a post that is strategically important for the future of
nuclear energy in France and abroad. As head of the world's largest utility, with a market value
of 70.9 billion euros ($104.1 billion), he will also have to
juggle the state's conflicting demands as both shareholder and
regulator. Last but not least, good relations with trade unions will be
important -- France has a near 85 percent stake in EDF and the
former monopoly operator's labour unions still pack a punch even
as the company modernises and expands internationally. Proglio, 60 and a widower with two children, had spent his
entire career at the water and waste management group which
became Veolia , which he joined in 1973 after graduating
from HEC business school. He helped transform Veolia from a sleepy municipal utility,
then Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), into the world's biggest
water company with a market value of 13 billion euros and sales
of 36 billion. CGE became media group Vivendi during the stormy tenure of
Jean-Marie Messier. Industry observers say Proglio came into his
own during that time, resisting Messier's ideas to dismantle the
water business to fund his media expansion dreams. Vivendi Water was eventually split off to become Veolia and
Proglio became chairman in 2003. In 2004, Proglio was offered the top job at EDF but turned
it down. Some observers said he was reluctant to leave Veolia,
others that did not want to take the job from his friend,
Francois Roussely, then head of EDF. EDF and Veolia have a joint venture for energy services
called Dalkia and Proglio already sat on the EDF supervisory
board.  FOUQUET'S AND L'HUMANITE Born in 1949 in Antibes, southern France, Proglio has a twin
brother Rene who is managing director of Morgan Stanley France. ""Our parents sold fruit and vegetables in Antibes. Getting
into HEC was our first Parisian experience. With our southern
accent, we came straight from a Pagnol novel,"" Rene Proglio told
French magazine l'Expansion in a March 2009 interview, referring
to Marcel Pagnol novels set in Marseilles. Proglio has made training a priority of Veolia's social
policy, with the Campus Veolia training center accomodating 610
apprentices and 14,000 traineess each year. He was one of the few CAC-40 bosses to attend the Fete de
l'Humanite this year, the annual bash of the French Communist
newspaper. A friend of former French President Jacques Chirac, Proglio
is also close to President Nicolas Sarkozy and was among guests
at a dinner at Fouquet's restaurant on the Champs Elysees where
Sarkozy and friends celebrated his election win in 2007. Proglio's track record at the helm of Veolia was mixed. Recently, he has been busy rebuilding investor confidence
after two profit warnings, a mounting debt pile, an unexpected
management reshuffle and a 65 percent share slide in 2008. ""He did many acquisitions and not really the divestments
that were needed, the cleaning up that was expected,"" an 
industry source said, adding that tackling debt and expansion
abroad were the very issues Proglio will need to adress at EDF. In a March interview with Reuters, Proglio, who can be
short-tempered, joked that efforts to inform analysts about 
group strategy sometimes made him feel he was ""evangelising
savages"".

501,"Sep 22, 2009 08:30AM ET",New EDF boss faces struggle to assert independence,nan," * Meeting on appointment set for Sunday or Monday -sources * Sarkozy's office no comment on reports Proglio to get post * CEO has to deal with regulatory, political demands  By Marcel Michelson PARIS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The new head of power generator 
EDF will have the French president to thank for his job at the
helm of the world's biggest listed utility and his powers will
be limited to what the state will allow. The board of EDF, 84-percent state owned, has to appoint a
successor to Executive Chairman Pierre Gadonneix and sources
close to the matter told Reuters a meeting to discuss the issue
is set for Sunday or Monday. The office of President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is travelling
in the United States for United Nations and G20 meetings, had no
immediate comment on newspaper reports saying the post will go
to Henri Proglio, head of Veolia Environnement. Veolia Environnement, a waste, water and transport group,
had no immediate comment. Proglio is close to Sarkozy and was among selected guests at
a dinner at the famous Fouquet's on the Champs Elysees in
central Paris where Sarkozy and friends celebrated his election
win in 2007. Born in 1949, he graduated from the HEC business school and
worked at water firm Generale des Eaux from 1973. The company
later became media group Vivendi during the stormy tenure of
Jean-Marie Messier, during which time Vivendi Water was
split off to become Veolia. Proglio became chairman in 2003. He also sits on the EDF supervisory board and the two
companies have a joint venture for energy services called
Dalkia. EDF, the French group with the second-biggest market
value after Total, has a 3.7 percent stake in Veolia. Other names mentioned in connection with the EDF job have
included aides to the president, a minister and the head of a
company rescued by Sarkozy when he was finance minister. Proglio has management experience that other rumoured
candidates do not all have. But his track record is mixed. Veolia has net debt of 16.2 billion euros versus a market
capitalisation of 12.7 billion and an operating margin of 5.26
percent in a sector that should be a cash cow. Veolia shares traded at some 25 euros back in 2003 and are
currently at the same level, down from a 2007 high of 63 euros.
They underperformed the French CAC 40 blue-chip index, which
went from 3,200 points to 3,800 in that period.  LACK OF FREEDOM Yet any head of EDF, which has a market value of 72 billion
euros, will have to juggle conflicting demands due to the French
state's dual role of shareholder and regulator so political
connections may count for more than an ability to boost
shareholder value. Critics say direct political interference in the running of
listed companies such as EDF is holding back their profits and
share values. Any CEO of EDF will still have to take such
pressures into account while managing it to boost its
performance and share price. ""What EDF lacks is liberty in price setting and that
depresses the share,"" said Fabrice Remon, managing director of
investor services company Deminor. ""I have no problems with the
state stepping in when a company is doing badly, however it
causes a problem when it intervenes in a healthy company.""  At a time when the state wants to step up privatisations to
cut a deficit of some 109 billion euros, it may be in its
interest to boost these valuations and allow more autonomy. Even a labour representative on the supervisory board of the
company, a former bastion of union power, says the state needs
to wake up to the new dynamism of the world in which EDF
operates. ""The heart of EDF nowadays beats at the pace of credit
agencies, short-term investor demands, changes in regulation
etc. The dimension of time is not, unfortunately, as it was,""
said Philippe Pesteil, an employee representative on the EDF
supervisory board for the CFDT labour union. ""The state, however, continues to act as if nothing has
changed.""

502,"Sep 17, 2009 09:36AM ET",UPDATE 1-EU seeks to close digital divide with broadband aid,nan," * EU seeks to close digital divide between EU countries * State aid rules facilitate projects in rural areas * Telecoms organisations are positive on guidelines
 By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission
unveiled guidelines on Thursday specifying how public funds can
be used to help companies roll out high-speed broadband
networks, and help EU countries benefit from new technologies. Under the rules, state aid would be easier to obtain for
projects in so-called grey areas where broadband infrastructure
does not exist such as rural regions, and more difficult for
""black areas"" or cities with more than one network operator. The EU executive has pledged to make high-speed Internet an
important element of its economic recovery plan to drive growth
in the 27-nation bloc and hopes to achieve 100 percent broadband
coverage in the European Union by 2010. ""While this investment should be made mostly by private
companies, there is an important role for public investment in
achieving the widest possible access to broadband in underserved
and non-profitable areas,"" Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes
told reporters. ""Public investments in line with the present guidelines will
significantly contribute to shrinking the digital divide -- both
within and between European Union member states,"" she said.
Industry operators were generally positive on the state aid
guidelines. ""We see a potentially crucial role for the state wherever
private investors are not rolling out fibre networks which can
be continually upgraded and are open to competition,"" said
director Ilsa Godlovitch from the European Competitive
Telecommunication Association (ECTA). She said it was equally important not to crowd out private
investments where open networks are being built.
ECTA members include BT, Bouygues Telecom, SFR which is
jointly owned by Vivendi and Vodafone, and AT&T. The bigger operators could stand to gain from the new rules
as they expand their networks, said Michael Bartholomew,
director at European Telecommunications Network Operators'
Association (ETNO), which represents 41 telecoms operators in 34
European countries. ""Realistically, I would imagine the larger operators could
be the largest beneficiaries simply because they have the
resources available to make these kind of investments in rural,
outlying areas where there is no competition,"" he said. The Commission said 200-300 billion euros ($295 billion to
$443 billion) would be needed in coming years for building NGA
networks. It said recipients of state aid would have to allow
competitors access to its networks and not favour any particular
technology.

503,"Sep 09, 2009 05:57AM ET",DEALTALK-More questions than answers on $14 bln Zain deal,nan,"   * Zain deal orchestrated by major shareholder, not the
company* Funding sources of the deal still unclear* No word yet from state-backed Indian firms mentioned in
deal* Zain stock down 4pct; had risen 50% from July until Monday By Michael Flaherty and Eman Goma SINGAPORE/KUWAIT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Even after a news
conference gave out names of the buyers planning to purchase a
46 percent stake in Kuwaiti telecom Zain, questions still
surround the $13.7 billion deal. Any large acquisition comes with uncertainties, but rarely
does a deal this size fail to immediately identify key
questions such as funding sources and the identity of certain
buyers. Another key question centres around how Zain, the Arab
world's third biggest telecoms firm, and the buyers plan to
coordinate, as the deal was orchestrated by a shareholder and
not the company. Kuwaiti family conglomerate Kharafi Group led the sale of
its stake -- estimated at 20 percent -- along with a group of
smaller shareholders to an Indian, Malaysian group. The
company's largest shareholder is the Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA), which owns nearly 25 percent in Zain. The consortium is made up of India's little-known Vavasi
Group, state-owned telecom firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd,
state-run Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, and Malaysian
billionaire Syed Mokhtar al-Bukhary, according to the Kharafi
Group. But it's unclear whether or not the two state-backed Indian
companies are fully on board with the deal. ""We have held some initial discussions with one of the two
names you mentioned,"" Farid Arifuddin, a managing director a
Vavasi, told Reuters on Wednesday. Several loan industry sources at big banks say they have
yet to be tapped by any member of the consortium. Typically
with a multi-billion dollar deal, many banks are contacted
before any deal to ensure funding and to take the cash burden
from buyers. A nearly $14 billion deal would rarely be paid out
in cash. At Kharafi's news conference in Kuwait on Tuesday, the
group did not outline how the buyers intend to pay for the
stake. ""The idea that this group is going to just come up with
$13.7 billion seems a little far fetched right now,"" said a
telecom banker not involved in the deal but familiar with Zain.
""This just doesn't look like anything close to real yet."" Also, telecom industry sources say they are still trying to
sort out who exactly the Vavasi Group is. According to its
website, the New Delhi-based group has interests in telecoms,
real estate, renewable energy, steel and cement. The privately owned conglomerate does not give details
about its shareholders nor its ownership structure. As for the Malaysian billionaire involved in Zain, he may
have deep pockets but has kept a low profile. Syed Mokhtar
began his career as a rice and cattle trader in ex-prime
minister Mahathir Mohamad's home state of Kedah. He quit formal schooling early to help his father's cattle
trading, branching later into beef, rice and transport. The
50-something tycoon was regarded as close to Mahathir. Zain, Bharat Sanchar Nigam, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam were
not immediately available for comment on Wednesday, while Syed
Mokhtar could not be reached for comment. WHAT NEXT FOR BUYERS? Another unanswered question is what the buyers plan to do
once they have acquired the stake. There was fevered speculation about potential buyers in the
weeks before Sunday's confirmation a shareholder was looking to
sell, sending Zain shares soaring. Zain, backed by its CEO, previously tried to sell its
African assets, excluding Morocco and Sudan, with French
telecoms and media conglomerate Vivendi among the top
contenders. But talks with Vivendi died this summer. In July, BSNL's chairman said the company was looking to
expand into Africa by acquiring new licences or stakes in
firms, even as it awaits government approval to revive a
planned IPO. Sources close to the matter say Zain's 46 stake sale was a
Kharafi-led move, that goes against what the CEO was trying to
do. How the two plan to reconcile remains unclear.

 By Eman Goma and John Irish KUWAIT, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Kuwaiti family business the
Kharafi Group and other investors are preparing to sell a stake
in Zain Group in a deal valued at $13.7 billion, driving its
shares lower as investors booked profits on the news. The deal for the stake in the telecoms group, if it goes
through, would be one of the biggest acquisitions into the Gulf
region, and the most valuable Gulf telecom M&A deal ever.   A company controlled by the Kharafi Group, one of the main
shareholders in Zain, said on Monday that it was reviewing a
sale of 46 percent of Zain's shares at 2 dinars per share. ""There are talks now ... (we will reach a deal) probably by
the end of this week,"" a person familar with the matter in
Kuwait told Reuters on Monday, declining to be identified due to
confidentiality issues.  It remains unclear who the buyer is, although rival Gulf
Arab telecom firms and international operators have all been
linked to the deal. Emirates Telecommunications Corp said last week it was not
interested, while a spokesman for India's Reliance
Communications denied any interest in Zain on Monday. Zain, which operates in 24 countries including Saudi Arabia
and Nigeria, has seen its shares rally 20 percent in the past
month as speculation of a bid has intensified. It closed down
6.4 percent to 1.46 dinars on Monday.  ""Investors believe the transaction will be for a particular
group and not everybody will be able to sell at the price of 2
dinars, only the Kharafi group and its related partners,"" said
Naser al-Nafisi, general manager for Al Joman Center for
Economic Consultancy in Kuwait.  ""So for speculators the story is over and they are now
profit taking."" The Zain sale is a remarkable reversal of fortunes for the
group, a regional powerhouse once known for its aggressive
expansion, that now finds itself on the block. Zain Chief Executive Saad al-Barrak on Sunday told Reuters
shareholders were in talks to sell a stake but could not comment
on a reports shareholders were in talks with Asian groups. Officials at National Investments and Kharafi were not
available for comment. UBS, which has been advising Zain on its
restructuring, declined to comment. ""Even if a strategic investor is willing to pay such a hefty
premium for control ... we do not believe that this will have an
impact on the minority shareholders in the market, unless this
same investor is interested to buy up to 100 percent of the
company,"" said Rami Sidani, head of Middle East and North Africa
investments at Schroder Investment Management, which has a 0.5
percent stake in Zain.  WHY SELL? The firm's biggest shareholders are Kuwait's sovereign
wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority and Kharafi,
according to the Kuwaiti bourse website. Analysts estimate
Kharafi owns about 20 percent in Zain through its units. Al Kharafi, whose chairman Nasser Al Kharafi's net worth is
estimated at $8.1 billion, according to Forbes' rich list, is
one of the largest conglomerates in the Arab world. Its food division holds exclusive franchise rights to
international food chains such as Pizza Hut and KFC in the
Middle East, while its interests span engineering, construction,
hospitality and maintenance.  Why Kharafi wants to sell is still unclear. ""The Kharafis are asset traders like Alfa group for example
in Russia ... they own many businesses and are not committed to
any ... if they are getting a good return on invested capital
then why not?"" said a Dubai-based telecom analyst who declined
to be identified. Africa represents about 62 percent of Zain's 64.7 million
customers but only 15 percent of the group's net profit, as of
end-March. Seven out of 16 African operations made a
first-quarter net loss, compared with only one -- Saudi Arabia--
of its six operations in the Middle East. Zain said on July 20 it was reviewing a possible sale of its
African operations, excluding Morocco and Sudan, after French
media and telecom conglomerate Vivendi broke off acquisition
talks. It was not immediately clear how a shareholder stake sale
would impact those negotiations. (Writing by John Irish; additional reporting by Jason

percent down at 954.15 points, the lowest closing level since
Aug. 20. The index is up 15 percent this year and has jumped 48

HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, Societe
Generale and UBS falling 3.7-5.8 percent. But Commerzbank, rose 3.6 percent after its chief executive
Martin Blessing said in a newspaper interview that Germany's
second-biggest bank could return to profit as soon as next year.
 Analysts said the market slipped on profit-taking after
paring losses in the afternoon session on data showing the U.S.
manufacturing sector grew in August for the first time in over a
year and a half, while pending home sales surged to a two-year
high in July. ""It's surprising that the market didn't go higher despite
the good news. That's an indication that there is some kind of
fatigue starting to creep into investors' minds,"" said Franz
Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers, in Paris. ""The market is somewhat overbought. We wouldn't be surprised
to see the market consolidating in the near term, but that
should give some breath for the reminder of the year to climb
higher,"" he added. Figures also showed that euro zone manufacturing activity
shrank less than previously thought in August, but there were
stark differences amongst the bloc's countries with contraction
accelerating in Spain and Italy. Investors remained worried about the strength of an economic
recovery after a surprise drop in British manufacturing activity
last month and a sharp fall in consumer lending in July. ""Today's numbers have shown that there could still be a few
bumps left along the way for the UK economy, but as far as stock
markets are concerned, the mood for shares is still positive,""
said David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index. ""We have seen a couple of days of weakness around the world,
but for now there still seem to be enough buyers happy to step
in and provide support. It looks premature to start worrying
about a bigger correction.""  DEFENSIVES MAY GAIN  Analysts said that cyclical stocks such as financials might
suffer going forward, but defensive shares might be in demand. ""The strong rebound in cyclicals, which are now at
relatively high valuation, will lose steam and stocks seen as
more defensive, which have been shunned by investors this year,
will take the lead,"" said Francois Chevallier, strategist at
Banque Leonardo. Stocks in the FTSEurofirst 300 index now trade at 13.11

not seen since July 2007, just before fears over banks' balance
sheets started to derail the market's 4-1/2-year bull run. Energy stocks lost ground after crude oil prices fell nearly
2 percent. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol,

France's CAC 40  was down 1 percent.  ASTRAZENECA GAINS Drugmakers were the biggest risers on the index. AstraZeneca
 gained 1.6 percent, boosted by impressive trial results
with its experimental blood thinner Brilinta, a rival to
Sanofi-Aventis  and Bristol-Myers Squibb's  $9
billion-a-year blockbuster Plavix. Sanofi-Aventis was 1.3 percent higher, while GlaxoSmithKline

1.2 percent. Chemical company BASF  was 0.5 percent higher
following reports in a German daily that Chinese state-owned
companies might be interested in buying a stake in the company. Europe's largest entertainment group Vivendi  was up
1.5 percent after second-quarter earnings beat forecasts. Looking at macro economic news, investors will eye the U.S.
National Association of Realtors releases Pending Home Sales for
July at 1400 GMT. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a 2.0

activity or contribution to the economy has become very small.
Anything that shows new home sales rising and inventories
falling is good as it strengthens the case home prices are
stabilising,"" said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB
Stockbrokers. Earlier, the Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing
Managers Index for August jumped to 48.2 from 46.3 in July,
above economists' forecasts and revised up from the 47.9 flash

Monday, dragged down by falls in China and the United States,
where financials slipped after a strong run. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.7
percent to close at 972.02 points, after hitting a 10-month high
on Friday. The London market was closed for a holiday and will
resume trading on Tuesday. The index rose 4.7 percent in August and is up more than 50
percent from its lifetime low on March 9, as investors have
become more confident on the prospects of economic recovery. ""There's been a pull-back in Europe after a good performance
last week. Commodity prices are on the retreat following the
performance of Asian markets this morning,"" said Gerhard
Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit, in Munich.
""With the UK markets closed, we are a bit directionless."" The market would get direction from the European Central
Bank's statement on Thursday and from U.S. labour data due
Friday, he said. Financials fell, notably in Ireland, hit by worries the
government will not pay lenders the full price for commercial
property loans when they are transferred over to a state-run
""bad bank"". Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks fell 7.8 percent and
4.9 percent respectively. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Deutsche Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo
, Societe Generale and UniCredit fell between 1 and 2.3 percent. Oil prices tumbled 4 percent to below $70 a barrel as a fall
in China's key stock index stoked worries about the country's
economy. Royal Dutch Shell, Total and StatoilHydro lost 0.5-2.9
percent. Automakers were also weaker in Europe, down 1.4 percent, and
Porsche lost 3.2 percent. About 370,000 employees of Volkswagen and Porsche plan to
take a stake of up to 5 percent in the automotive group, VW's
labour chief Bernd Osterloh told German newspaper Sueddeutsche
Zeitung in an interview.  ARCELORMITTAL FALLS  Steelmaker ArcelorMittal eased 2.8 percent. The company said
prices have improved but it would take one or two years for
production levels worldwide to return to 2008 levels. Chinese stocks sank 6.7 percent to a three-month closing low
and recorded their second-biggest monthly loss in 15 years.
Chinese share trading is largely cut off from global markets but
the big drop in Shanghai had a psychological knock-on. Back in Europe, euro zone consumer prices fell for the third
month running year-on-year in August but by less than the record
drop in July, and economists expect them to start growing again
in coming months.  Among other individual movers in Europe, Deutsche Post fell
1.8 percent, after Juergen Gerdes, the head of the company's
mail unit, said it needed to cut costs to avoid losses over the
long run. French Vivendi rose 0.5 percent, ahead of results on Tuesday
and buoyed by an upgrade to 'buy' from 'add' from Oddo. Across Europe, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 fell 1.0
and 1.1 percent respectively. As European bourses were closing, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and
Nasdaq Composite were down 0.9-1.3 percent.

 (Adds analyst comment, details) WARSAW, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Quarterly profit at Poland's top
pay-TV provider Cyfrowy Polsat suffered from a bruising battle
for customers and a weaker zloty, and the result fell short of
market expectations, sending its shares down. Operating costs grew by half in the first six months of the
year to 506 million zlotys due to hefty marketing expenditures
to attract new customers and programming spending, which is
denominated in dollars and thus susceptible to the weaker zloty. The group earned a net profit of 56 million zlotys ($19
million) versus 63 million seen by analysts even as revenue came
in line with expectations, sending its shares down 2.9 percent
at 16.60 zlotys by 0707 GMT. Cyfrowy, controlled by Poland's richest man and media
magnate Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, has powered ahead of competition
thanks to focusing on cost-conscious clients, who are
increasingly opting for the cheapest programming options. Analysts said they were concerned by the number of
cancellations, with many customers choosing to switch to
Cyfrowy's rivals owned by France's Vivendi and eastern Europe's
largest media group, TVN. ""One can see the influence of stiff competition on the
market, which at the same time is becoming saturated,"" said
Leszek Iwaszko, analyst at KBC Securities in Warsaw. ""The results are poor."" Cyfrowy and its rivals are forced to spend heavily to
attract new customers, but Iwaszko said some 90 percent of
Cyfrowy's new clients in the quarter opted for its lowest
programming package. Shares in Cyfrowy have gained 47 percent since March to
value the company at $1.8 billion.

 (Adds new CEO quote, sales forecast, updates shares) By Adrian Krajewski WARSAW, Aug 13 (Reuters) - TVN, eastern Europe's largest
television broadcaster, replaced its chief executive with an
industry insider from Rupert Murdoch's media empire on Thursday,
after its ratings took a hit this year. The Polish media group said its supervisory board member
Markus Tellenbach, who also runs the supervisory board of German
pay-TV operator SKY Deutschland and once headed broadcaster SBS,
would take over the top post from Piotr Walter. Walter, who in 2001 took over the helm from his father, one
of the group's founders, will stay as Tellenbach's deputy. TVN also said its long-time chief financial officer was
leaving for personal reasons and its head of programming would
depart the management board, but would remain with the company. By 1216 GMT, shares in TVN were up 10 percent to 14.95
zlotys, its highest in 10 months, after an afternoon surge, as
Warsaw's main index rose 3.6 percent. The broadcaster said the reshuffle was related to the
group's growth following the controversial acquisition of a
controlling stake in Poland's smallest digital TV platform, 'n',
from TVN's main shareholder, ITI Group. ""I'm focused particularly on the 'n' venture,"" Tellenback
said in a meeting with analysts. Analysts said several other reasons could be behind the
unexpected move, ranging from shifting attention to the growing
satellite platform to closer cooperation with Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp, which controls SKY Deutschland. TVN has been expanding its core television business, which
also includes news and several other niche channels, and also
controls Poland's leading Internet portal, onet.pl. ""TVN and onet.pl are no doubt good businesses, but if the
group's results are to be made better, 'n' is the place,"" said
Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Lukasz Wachelko. The loss-making 'n' competes with market leader Cyfrowy
Polsat and a unit of France's Vivendi. ""The new chief executive works in that branch in Germany and
this is a positive change,"" Dominik Niszcz, analyst at
Raiffeisen said. ""SKY Deutschland is partly in the hands of News
Corp, so this might be an indication of some cooperation."" Murdoch abandoned his previous investment in small Polish
broadcaster TV Puls last year after it failed to boost its
miniscule ratings. Tellenbach plans to step down from SKY Deutschland's board
by the end of this year, he said. TVN, which has relied on its own productions and local
formats of shows such as Dancing with the Stars and You've Got
Talent to attract viewers, has been losing ground this year to
unlisted rival Polsat and the public broadcaster. Also on Thursday, TVN reported a smaller-than-expected drop
in second-quarter net profit to 149 million zlotys ($50.2
million) versus expectations of 112 million. Karen Burgess, the outgoing finance head, said the battered
Polish advertising market, which shrank an estimated 13 percent
in the first half, may be heading for a recovery. ""The worst is behind us, but it's hard to say whether the
second half will be much better,"" said Burgess, who is leaving
for personal reasons. Burgess later told a news conference she expected
second-half sales to rise, but only thanks to the pay-TV
platform TVN began consolidating this year.

million)  WARSAW, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Poland's top pay-TV provider
Cyfrowy Polsat is expected to report a 5-percent drop of its net
profit in the first half, as a weaker zloty and fierce
competition hit margins, Reuters survey showed on Wednesday. Cyfrowy -- controlled by Poland's richest man Zygmunt
Solorz-Zak, who also owns TV broadcaster Polsat -- is seen
reporting a six-month bottom line of 136 million zlotys ($46
million) with sales up by 25 percent to 656 million. A Reuters poll of 11 analysts also showed second-quarter net
profit fell 20 percent to 63 million zlotys with the top line up
17 percent to 324 million. Analysts expect the company's FX-denominated content costs
to rise due to a weak zloty, squeezing profitability. They also
believe the second quarter was weak in terms of attracting new
clients due to a usual seasonality. Also, fierce competition between the operators and price
incentives necessary to attract clients during the economic
slowdown have cut into the operators' average revenue per user
(ARPU). Cyfrowy competes locally with the likes of Cyfra Plus,
controlled by France's Vivendi, and the 'n' platform owned by
Poland's sole-listed broadcaster TVN. Analysts now await the company's plan, slated for the second
half of 2009, to launch triple-play services in cooperation with

 (Adds share price, new context in para 5, Libya line) By John Irish and Rania El Gamal DUBAI/KUWAIT, July 21 (Reuters) - Emirates
Telecommunications Corp (Etisalat) is interested in buying a 51
percent stake in Kuwait's Zain Group at the right price, the
chief executive of its international unit said on Tuesday. ""We are interested in Zain as a whole, given the right
values,"" Jamal al-Jarwan told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""We're looking at a 51 percent stake in Zain,"" he added. Etisalat, which operates in 18 countries, including Egypt
and India, is one of a number of Gulf Arab telecom operators
that have expanded overseas after losing their monopolies at
home. Both Zain and Etisalat operate in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia,
making integration of the two there more complicated than
entering a virgin market. ""We need to sort out the overlap in
Saudi Arabia and Nigeria,"" said Jarwan. Zain, which is partly owned by the country's sovereign
wealth fund, said on Monday it still hoped to sell its African
unit despite French media and telecoms giant Vivendi calling off
talks to buy a majority stake in the business. Jarwan said on Tuesday that Etisalat, the region's
second-largest operator by market value, was interested in ""the
whole package"" and not just Zain's African unit. ""We overlap with Zain in many countries, but overall we're
looking at it,"" he said. ""Zain makes a compelling story for us."" Jarwan declined to comment on whether it was already talking
to Zain about the possibility of taking a stake. ""Zain has no comment on that,"" Zain's spokesman Ibrahim Adel
told Reuters on Tuesday. Jarwan, asked by Arabiya television how Etisalat would
finance the purchase, said: ""There are several ways that we are
studying now but we haven't reached a final conclusion about it.
But in the end ... it will be possible to bring about this sale
of 51 percent.""  CASH ON HAND Zain has a market capitalisation of about $17.3 billion and
a potential deal would be one of the region's largest mergers
and one of the first cross-border deals. Etisalat has long been on the acquisition prowl and said
last November that it had more than $3 billion in cash on hand
to fund purchases in 2009. It said on Tuesday it had bid for a fixed and mobile licence
in OPEC member Libya. The Abu Dhabi-based telecom firm is 60-percent owned by the
UAE government, the world's third biggest oil exporter, and the
emirate of Abu Dhabi controls 90 percent of the country's oil
reserves. Etisalat is facing stiffer competition in its home market of
the United Arab Emirates, where some analysts predict that a
wave of job cuts could lead to a population decline, which would
weigh on the profits of Etisalat and rival du. Last year, Etisalat bought a 45 percent stake in new Indian
operator Swan Telecom for about $900 million. ""I don't think a takeover is possible because there are
strong national interests in play here,"" said an analyst who
asked not to be identified. ""Etisalat has a history of expanding through smaller
operators, obtaining licences, not through multi-billion
(dollar) deals."" A takeover of Zain by a foreign firm may not be disputed by
Kuwait, whose sovereign wealth fund -- the Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA) -- owns 24.61 percent of Zain. In 2007, Qatar Telecommunications bought a 51-percent stake
in Kuwaiti mobile operator Wataniyafor $3.72 billion in the
largest telecom acquisition in the region at the time.  KIA still owns 23.54 percent of Wataniya, according to
bourse data. Kuwaiti family-owned conglomerate Kharafi Group is Zain's
second largest shareholder behind KIA, with 13.7 percent through
one of its units, bourse data showed. Shares of Etisalat closed 0.96 percent up in Abu Dhabi,
while Zain's shares ended 3.45 percent up in Kuwait.  For a FACTBOX on Zain and Etisalat, click on

514,"Jul 09, 2009 08:32AM ET","ANALYSIS-Stocks contrarians favour growth laggards Europe, Japan",nan," By Natsuko Waki LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Investors who have long dismissed
Europe and Japan as laggards in any global economic recovery are
starting to view equities in these regions as adequately priced
for that underperformance and may look to put cash back in. Convinced that the euro zone and Japan will find it more
difficult than most to recover from one of the deepest global
recessions of the past century, the stock market consensus is,
for now, decidedly bearish. A recent survey by Morgan Stanley shows just 19 percent of
investors chose Europe as the best of 4 major equity market
regions for the next year, versus 42 percent for the United
States and 36 percent for emerging markets. Japan -- where local stocks have been stuck in a broader
bear market since late 1990s -- is the most unpopular region,
the favourite market for a meagre 3 percent of respondents. Fund managers polled by Banc of America Securities-Merrill
Lynch have been picking Europe as the region they want to
underweight the most on a 12-month horizon. However, strategists reckon it may pay to bet against any
big consensus positions on regional equity markets. According to Morgan Stanley's data, areas that won more than
30 percent of votes for best region underperformed in 7 out of 8
cases, by on average 5 percent. ""We recommend closing any underweight positions in Europe.
Valuation is attractive and at the bottom of the historical
range on many measures ... while booming liquidity and
recovering fund flows may also benefit non-U.S. markets,"" said
Ronan Carr, strategist at Morgan Stanley. ""Japan may be the market with biggest potential to surprise
on the upside... The contrarian today should favour Europe and
Japan over the United States and emerging markets.""  PAST PERFORMANCE Pan-European stocks have fallen 1.2 percent so far this
year, underperforming the 3 percent gain in MSCI's index of
world stocks. Tokyo stocks are also way behind the global
benchmark with a loss of 1.4 percent. Currency shifts may have flattered those returns for
unhedged overseas investors, but these markets have been far
behind emerging economies and even come in shy of Wall St. Mainstream economic forecasts may explain some of that. The International Monetary Fund expects the euro zone --
where monetary and fiscal boosts to ease the recession fall
short of those in the United States or Britain -- to contract
4.8 percent this year. That is almost twice the forecast 2.6
percent contraction for the United States. Japan's economy, which never fully recovered from its own
property-driven bust in the early 1990s, is expected to shrink a
whopping 6.0 percent in 2009. But looking into next year, the IMF expects Japanese growth
of 1.7 percent, outstripping its forecast for the developed
world as a whole by almost three-to-one. The expected 0.3 percent contraction of the euro zone will
continue to lag its major peers, but even there the gap next
year is forecast to narrow slightly to less than one percent. Valuations also argue for overweight position on Europe.
Morgan Stanley's calculations show the MSCI Europe index trades
almost at all-time lows on trailing price to earnings and price
to dividend ratios.  On the bank's measure using indices such as price by volume
and price/dividend, Europe is 35 percent cheaper than the United
States, within the bottom decile of the almost 40-year range. Clients polled by Credit Suisse said it might take a little
more time for Japan to get ahead of its peers, with its analysis
showing Japanese stock markets outperforming four months after
the upturn in leading indicators. ""To most clients, Japan is just a later cycle cyclical play
and into the downturn Japan had been hit more than other
developed countries,"" the bank said in a note to clients. Signs that increasingly risk-favouring U.S. investors have
begun to return to overseas markets would also help Europe and
Japan outperform in the medium term. U.S. mutual funds increased their share of foreign assets to
24.5 percent in May, having kept it to around 23 percent since
the beginning of the year, according to UBS. This compares with a peak of 26 percent reached in mid-2008. Within Europe, some like to focus on high-yielding stocks,
where dividends are well covered by cashflow. Tom Beevers, manager of the Newton Pan-European fund, likes
Europe's largest entertainment group Vivendi, which yields 8.5
percent, and Europe's biggest telecoms group Deutsche Telekom,
which yields 9.5 percent. ""It appears that the unprecedented fiscal and monetary
stimulus is starting to gain traction, restoring a degree of
confidence among consumers and corporates,"" he told clients. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)

percent, the highest in nearly 26 years. ""Payrolls were a wake-up call,"" said Jacques Henry, analyst

strong second quarter in terms of new subscribers for mobile and
fixed-phones and is ahead of its sales targets on the iPhone
smart phone, its chief executive said on Thursday. Frank Esser told a group of reporters on the sideline of a
telecoms conference that: ""We had a good momentum, a very strong
second quarter in mobile and in fixed phones."" Esser was answering a query over subscription levels. SFR, which started selling the iPhone in April, has
currently sold over 200,000 units and was ""ahead"" of its targets
despite a global economic downturn. Esser declined to disclose what these targets were. ""If one looks at the iPhone, one sees that people are ready
to spend more,"" he said. SFR, which last year bought fixed-phone operator Neuf
Cegetel, has no immediate plans to launch a ""quadruple play""
offer (internet, television, fixed-phone and mobile phone) for
the consumer market, he said. Some analysts expect SFR to react to Ideo, the first
quadruple-play offer in France launched by Bouygues Telecom on

said. ""If there is a real demand from clients, we will react but

accelerate investment in fibre optics. ""We will spend over 200 million euros in fibre this year. We
are keeping our pace,"" he said French telecoms regulator Arcep last week recommended using
the multifibre solution in large cities. That solution uses one
fibre per operator to connect a household and had been backed by
Iliad and SFR. France Telecom had been asking for a monofibre solution,
where one fibre is used for all operators to connect individuals
in one building. France's Vivendi has a 56 percent stake in SFR and Britain's
Vodafone Group Plc has 44 percent. SFR is France's No. 2 mobile operator behind France
Telecom's Orange with close to 20 million clients, and third in
broadband behind leader Orange and Iliad SA's Free.(Editing by Marcel Michelson and Mariam Karouny)

517,"Jun 30, 2009 01:32PM ET",FACTBOX-European stock market performance in H1 2009,nan," June 30 (Reuters) - European shares ended the first half of the current year
in positive territory, gaining 2.2 percent, against a 20 percent slide in the
Jan.-June period in 2008. The FTSEurofrst 300 index of top Euroepean shares hit a lifetime low on
March 9 following the financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and threatened much of
the world with a deep and vicious recession. The index surged 15.9 percent in the Apr.-June period of 2009, the best
quarter since the last three months of 1999 and the first positive quarter since
the market started to melt down in mid-2007. The benchmark index has jumped 31.7 percent sice the March low, but is still
down 48 percent from a multi-year peak scaled in the middle of 2007. The index lost 45 percent in 2008 after five straight years of gains. The
basic resources and banking sectors were among the worst perfomers last year,
both down 65 percent, but the sectors are the best performers so far this year,
up 39.2 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively. Performance of major European stock indexes (in percent) .                                 H1 2009   H1 2008    Full 2008  Full 2007

518,"Jun 30, 2009 03:33AM ET",UPDATE 2-Reliance Comm in talks for Zain's Africa ops-sources,nan," * Preliminary talks with Kuwaiti firm - sources * Zain's Africa operations valued at $10 bln - newspaper * Reliance Comm shares rebound after seesawing earlier * Zain shares rise as much as 4 pct to new 10-month high
  (Adds Reliance no comment, analysts view) By Devidutta Tripathy and Narayanan Somasundaram NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - India's Reliance
Communications has started talks to buy Kuwaiti Zain's African
operations, which media say are worth $10 billion, two banking
sources said. The move underscores a drive by Indian telecom companies to
gain a foothold in Africa, where mobile phone penetration is
low and the potential for growth high. Bharti Airtel, Reliance's bigger home rival, is in
exclusive talks with South Africa's MTN Group to create the
world's third-largest wireless firm with more than 200 million
users. Reliance and Bharti separately held talks with MTN last
year, but failed to seal a deal. Bharti revived its talks with
MTN in May. Mobile penetration is below 40 percent in half the African
markets, and a dozen are below 30 percent, offering a major
opportunity for global mobile firms battling saturated
developed markets and falling call tariffs, analysts say. ""Reliance Communications has been looking at some emerging
market assets since its deal with MTN fell through,"" said one
banking source with knowledge of the talks. ""They are in preliminary stages of evaluating the deal,"" he
said on Tuesday, and was yet to appoint merchant bankers. Another source also said the talks were underway. A spokesman for Reliance Communications declined to
comment. Zain said last month it was reviewing a possible sale of
its African operations -- minus Morocco and Sudan -- after
French media and telecoms giant Vivendi called off talks to buy
a majority stake in the African business. Zain's chief executive told Kuwait daily newspaper Al-Rai
the firm was in talks with three major telcos, including one
from India, to sell all or part of its Africa operations. The Times of India newspaper said Zain's African operations
were valued at $10 billion. Shares in Reliance Communications, which the market values
at about $10 billion, were up 2.7 percent by 0754 GMT. The main
Mumbai market was up 1.8 percent. GLOBAL AMBITIONS Billionaire Anil Ambani, who took over as Reliance
Communications chief in 2006 after a split with his elder
brother Mukesh, has been looking for acquisitions to expand
operations. Ambani lost out to Vodafone in bidding for Hutch Essar in
2007, the then fourth-largest cellular operator in India, and
last year withdrew from stake-swapping talks with MTN after a
claim on Reliance Communication's shares by Mukesh. While analysts say Zain's African operations will be a
strategic fit for Reliance, the Indian firm will have to nurse
its stretched financials and tread carefully over a feud
between the Ambani brothers. Reliance, predominantly a CDMA operator, earlier this year
spent $2 billion to expand its network on the popular GSM
platform, which has been an overhang on its profits. Reliance, which already owns telecoms firm Anupam Global
Soft in Uganda, may also face competition from UAE's Etisalat,
which has previously said it is keen to buy a majority stake in
Zain. Zain, which is undergoing a strategic review and is advised
by UBS, plans an extraordinary general meeting on Aug. 31 when
shareholders will be asked to vote on amending its ownership
restrictions -- a move that could pave the way for selling a
large stake. For a related Reuters blog, see:

519,"Jun 15, 2009 11:48AM ET",Canal Plus eyes over 1 mln Vietnam subs in 3 yrs,nan," PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - French pay-TV group Canal Plus said on Monday it
targeted over 1 million subscribers in Vietnam within three years, with the
launch of a pay-TV channel by the end of this year, run jointly with state-run
television VTV. This first foray by Canal Plus outside of Europe and Africa is the result of
negotiations which started in 2003, and is part of the Vivendi unit's strategy
of pursuing regions with high potential, amid slowing subscriber growth in
France. ""We have several other advanced projects, but not as symbolic as this one,""
Canal Plus head Bertrand Meheut said after a press conference on Monday. Canal Plus Groupe will hold 49 percent of the joint company -- versus 51
percent for VCTV, a unit of VTV -- but will run operations via its Canal
Overseas unit, with around 60 channels planned by the end of this year. Meheut estimated that Canal Plus invested around $50 million, with the goal
of breaking even after two years of operations. Vietnam has 22 million households, of which 97 percent have at least one
television, but less than 8 percent of these subscribe to a pay-TV channel,
Canal Plus said. Canal Plus has over two million subscribers and makes 20 percent of its
total sales outside France. The group saw its total number of subscribers in
France drift to 10.4 million at the end of March, compared to 10.6 million at
the end of December, and is banking on ""slight growth in 2009"".

520,"Apr 06, 2009 09:48PM ET",Labels bet on flexibility with iTunes new pricing,nan," * iTunes Music to launch three-tier pricing on Tuesday * Majority of songs will still be 99 cents - sources By Yinka Adegoke NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  and major
music labels are betting that the launch of three-tier pricing
at the iTunes Music Store will boost music sales with a new mix
of song-based packages and give consumers more options. Apple will announce its new three-tier price points at 69
cents, 99 cents and $1.29 on Tuesday, according to several
people familiar with its plans. Since opening in 2003 all songs
in the iTunes store have been priced at 99 cents. The previous 'one price fits all' strategy has long caused
friction between Apple and the music labels, who argued that
songs should be priced differently to reflect their perceived
value by consumers. The labels will finally get their wish. While the majority of songs will still be sold at 99 cents,
a certain number of new hit songs will now be raised to $1.29.
Many older catalog songs will now go for 69 cents. Perhaps anticipating a consumer backlash against price
increases executives, who spoke to Reuters on background ahead
of the launch, pointed out that for every one song they raise
to $1.29 they will be reducing 10 songs to 69 cents. But these executives said the biggest advantage of the new
pricing would be flexibility to create new digital products
beyond the album. ""We're thinking outside of the disc to reach a new
generation of consumers who are able to consume music on any
device, it's not just the track any more,"" said one music label
executive, who was involved with the talks, but did not want
the label identified ahead of the launch. For instance, a label could sell a brand new song and its
music video for $1.29 or package it with a ringtone. The lower
pricing could eventually mean that iTunes can sell albums at
more competitive prices though early indications are that album
prices will not change right way. Major label owners like Vivendi's  Universal Music
Group, Sony Music <6758.T>, Warner Music Group  and EMI
Music say they can make money with more flexible prices and
possibly help make music retail a profitable enterprise again. ""If we can gain traction with $1.29 that will be good for
greater margin,"" said another label executive, also involved in
discussions, but who did want to identify the record label. Music sales have plunged as traditional retail outlets for
CDs have shuttered and the growth in digital sales have slowed
in 2008. Data from Nielsen SoundScan show album sales, once the
profit engine of the music business, fell by 14 percent in the
U.S. Industry estimates show that 10 to 15 percent of albums
account for 90 percent of all sales, according to Digonex, a
dynamic pricing software company which has worked with major
music companies including Warner Music. ""This is an opportunity for the labels to get the maximum
they can for the music,"" said Michael Wanchic, vice president
of digital media at Digonex. ""The beauty of variable pricing is
that if the prices are too high customers simply won't buy."" APPLE'S ROLE According to NPD Group, 87 percent of digital music buyers
in the U.S. used iTunes to download music in 2008 versus just
16 percent who used Amazon.com's  digital music store. Apple has already been experimenting with new packages at
different prices. In February it partnered with EMI Music to
announce the first iTunes Pass with Depeche Mode, offering fans
the album, exclusive singles, remixes, video and other content
for $18.99. All parties are also betting that the new lower 69-cent
song offering will boost sales of catalog music -- described as
older songs and albums released about 18 months or more
earlier. According to one of the label sources, 35 to 40 percent of
iTunes music sales are of catalog songs and albums, and that
share is growing as labels digitize more of their older songs. ""Apple has such a dominant position, frankly another 30
cents won't make much of a difference to most people,"" said
Russ Crupnick, analyst at NPD Group. ""There may be more gold in
the discount on the catalog, Americans love a bargain.""
