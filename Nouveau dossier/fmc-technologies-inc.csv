6,"Jun 06, 2019 04:55PM ET",Stocks - S&P 500 Makes a Late Surge as Trade Tensions Ease,nan,"Investing.com - Stocks jumped for a third session Thursday in part because of news that the Trump Administration might hold back on imposing new tariffs on goods shipped into the United States from Mexico.In addition, there was continued speculation the Federal Reserve might cut rates when it meets in mid-June.The news on Mexico abruptly turned U.S. financial markets around. Crude oil moved higher, interest rates moved up slightly and so did most of the major sectors of the market.The S&P 500 jumped 0.61%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.53%, and the Dow jumped 0.71%. The Dow just missed its third-straight day of plus-200-point gains.The strength of the rally has set the Dow and the S&P 500 up for their best weekly performances in 2019, with the Dow up 3.65% for the week after Thursday's close and the S&P 500 up 3.3%. The Nasdaq is up 2.2%. Its best week was the week of March 11, when it gained 3.78%.But one aspect to Thursday's rally is worth watching.The Dow Jones Transportation index fell 0.92%, with railroads the laggards. Kansas City Southern Railroad (NYSE:KSU) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) are big players in the business of shipping goods north from Mexico. Kansas City Southern fell 1.64% and Union Pacific was off 1%.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Utility index hit a 52-week high as investors bet interest rates are headed lower. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool sees little chance of a rate cut in June. But fed funds futures are pricing in a rate cut by July and almost certainly by September. The Fed's key federal fund rate is now 2.25% to 2.5%. Most bond yields are lower than that.Financial markets have been driven in recent weeks by the reports or rumors of where U.S. trade policy is headed. The reports that the U.S. will delay tariffs on Mexico depend on whether Mexico can somehow curb illegal immigration into the U.S., the main point of contention, and whether President Donald Trump, traveling in Europe, will agree to the move. Late Thursday, Reuters tweeted the White House still plans to impose a 5% on Mexican shipments on Monday.Friday's market will start with investor reaction to the May jobs report, due for release at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists polled by Investing.com expect the Labor Department to show the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6%. And estimates are that nonfarm payrolls, a key measure investors watch, will grow by 185,000, down from April's 263,000 job gains.In the meantime, investors in big stocks were happy, especially with energy stocks.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the top-performing Dow stocks as Crude oil WTI futures moved up 1.8% to $52.29. Brent oil ,the global benchmark, rose 1.72% to $61.67. Only a day earlier, Brent briefly fell below $60 for the first time since late January.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), vulnerable to trade politics, also were higher and contributed about 32 points to the Dow''s gain.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) led the Nasdaq 100 0.76% higher. The index is dominated by big tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Winners and lowers among S&P 500 stocksAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) and TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day.L Brands (NYSE:LB), Macerich (NYSE:MAC) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers on the day."

34,"Feb 21, 2019 04:37PM ET",Stocks - Dow Falls as Dour Data Drowns out Trade Optimism,nan,"Investing.com - The Dow ended its three-day winning streak Thursday as downbeat economic data raised concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy, while U.S.-China trade talks remained in the spotlight.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.40%, the S&P 500 lost 0.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.39%.Fresh signs the U.S. economy may not be as robust as many believe prompted traders to rein in their bullish bets as they digested a slew of economic reports, some of which sank to multi-year lows.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business index fell to its lowest level since May 2016 and the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators fell for the second month in a row in January, the first time that's happened since early 2016.There wasn’t much to cheer on the housing front, meanwhile, as existing home sales slumped to their lowest levels since Nov. 15.The negative reports overshadowed optimism on trade, with China and the U.S. reportedly working toward drafting a memorandum of understanding to tackle structural issues, including forced technology transfers, cybertheft, market access and currency.The high-level trade talks come just a week before the March 1 deadline when, in the absence of a deal, the U.S. could impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports. But President Donald Trump fueled speculation the deadline could be extended, saying earlier this week that March 1 was not a ""magical date.""The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.In healthcare, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) continued to add to losses from a day earlier, when the drugstore and healthcare company reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed expectations and guided earnings short of estimates.Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), meanwhile, fell 4% after Stifel downgraded the stock to hold from buy and cut its price target to $346 from $397, citing ""decreased confidence in Alzheimer's, a looming Tecfidera legal saga and well-documented competitive threats to Spinraza.""On the earnings front, Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) fell 9.15% after reporting quarterly results that missed estimates provided by Investing.com. But  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE) rallied 5% as its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue miss was overshadowed by above-consensus comparable store sales growth of 1.9%.In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.7% after Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation for the company's Model 3, citing concerns over reliability.Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today: Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB), Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI), Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) and  Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

37,"Feb 21, 2019 03:45AM ET",European shares steady near four-month highs but poor earnings weigh,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - Optimism over China-U.S. trade talks helped European shares steady near four-month highs on Thursday, although a number of poorly received updates from the likes of utility  Centrica  (LON:CNA), engineer  Technip  (PA:FTI) and shipper Moeller-Maersk weighed.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat by 0830 GMT, while the trade-sensitive DAX index was up 0.3 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent.A Reuters report said Washington and Beijing had started to outline commitments on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war.Centrica was the biggest faller on the STOXX 600, down 11 percent after it warned a national price cap on energy bills would hit its 2019 results.Moeller-Maersk fell 8.7 percent after meeting fourth-quarter expectations, while TechnipFMC also tumbled more than 7 percent as the oil services company posted a fourth quarter loss.Prysmian was another heavy faller, down 9 percent, after the Italian cable maker said a system failure was detected in its Westernlink Interconnection. Barclays  (LON:BARC) rose 4 percent. Even though the UK bank reported a lower than forecast attributable profit, it did show signs of progress in its under-pressure investment bank, where profit for the full year increased as its equities trading unit saw income rise 25 percent.Still in the UK, BAE Systems (LON:BAES) fell 5.9 percent. Britain's biggest defense company said German moves to block exports to Saudi Arabia could hit its major deals with the Kingdom.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Nov 27, 2018 02:45AM ET",Dismantling the oil industry: rough North Sea waters test new ideas,nan,"By Shadia NasrallaLONDON (Reuters) - Scottish marine salvage group Ardent is adapting the tanks it used to refloat the Costa Concordia, the cruise ship wrecked off the Italian coast in 2012, to decommission North Sea oil platforms. It is one of several companies trying new ideas to win business in the market for dismantling disused oil platforms.In Britain's aging oil fields alone, the opportunities could be worth up to 17 billion pounds ($21.85 billion) before 2025, according to industry body Oil and Gas UK. The ideas could then be deployed to other maturing fields such as in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia. GRAPHIC: Decommissioning spending outlook by region - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ELrjMm Ardent says it needs at least two companies to sign up for a project to get off the ground. Well-Safe, another company offering a new approach, also needs several operators to commit.So far, Ardent has found it challenging to persuade companies to be the first to sign up. GRAPHIC: Offshore decommissioning - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OIThgl""Everyone is queuing to be second,"" said Ardent's Decommissioning Director Stuart Martin. Oil companies are keen to reduce costs in a part of the market dominated by major global players such as TechnipFMC (N:FTI), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB),  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) and AllSeas. Beyond the floating tanks, Ardent has also joined forces with oil services firm WorleyParsons (AX:WOR) and technology and shipping group Lloyd's Register, to bring a one-stop-shop service. This could save money by cutting out the need for lots of different contractors. Well-Safe proposes coordinating decommissioning work across companies to share equipment and staff. GRAPHIC: Cost of Ardent projects - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OIUVP3""You got to give Well-Safe and the others a real tip of the hat. We all want them to win. It's in the best interest of the industry,"" said Jim House, CEO of Neptune Energy, which is planning decommissioning for its Juliet and Minke fields in the North Sea. Oil platforms are usually removed piece by piece and taken to the shore using complex vessels. The floating tanks that Ardent used to lift the Costa Concordia, are much cheaper to use, industry experts say. GRAPHIC: UK North Sea Decommissioning Spending - https://tmsnrt.rs/2NZuZJr""This technology could have significant potential cost efficiencies,"" the Oil and Gas Technology Centre, which is funded by the British government, said in a report.But Ardent says it would need contracts for at least two buoyant tanks to go below current costs per ton of steel removed and three to get below its target cost reduction of around a third. Britain's industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority, has set a target of 35 percent cost cuts compared with 2015 levels.Well-Safe's main lever for cost reduction also depends on several operators committing to contracts.Ardent is also proposing to oversee a project from production to scrapping the metal onshore. Worley Parsons would operate the platform and maintain the equipment and Lloyd’s Register would plug the wells.""It's a lot about an emerging set of companies and we don't yet know which is going to be the winning model,"" said Boston Consulting Group’s Philip Whittaker.""One of the biggest sources of value is how to integrate the decom work with the final stages of the production work.""  GRAPHIC: UK North Sea Decommissioning Spending - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pf9mK3 MATURE BASIN With other fields maturing and drying up across the world and some experts expecting demand for oil to peak in the 2030s,the North Sea is a test bed for new decommissioning projects. If a company can plug oil wells without leaks and remove thousands of tonnes of steel platforms and pipelines, some 50years old, in the rough, deep seas between Scotland, England and Norway, they should be able to do it anywhere. Industry body Oil and Gas UK, expects oil companies to spend17 billion pounds ($22.05 billion) on removing around 1,600wells, 100 platforms, and 5,500 km of pipelines in the next seven years. Some 840,000 tonnes of material will be returned to shore to meet environmental regulations. ""We've got a mature basin with a steady flow of work,"" said Joe Laesk, decommissioning manager at Oil and Gas UK. ""Those resources and expertise can be exportable globally."" The Gulf of Mexico has had decommissioning projects in its warm, calm waters for years but Southeast Asia is a new hot spot, with more than 1,500 platforms and 7,000 subsea wells expected to be uneconomical by 2038, according to the BCG. That is followed by Latin America, West Africa and the Middle East Gulf.GRAPHIC: Future decommissioning hotspots - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rez5QbWith so much potential, more established players are also trying different approaches to make decommissioning cheaper. Service vessel group Allseas is experimenting with new ideas. It specializes in subsea construction but is converting huge ships to lift structures as heavy as 48,000 tonnes in one haul. ""We lift in a matter of hours and we're gone,"" said Allseas President Edward Heerema. The first job for Allseas' Pioneering Spirit, the biggest construction vessel in the world, was in the Norwegian North Searemoving Repsol's (MC:REP) 13,500 ton Yme production unit. Shell (AS:RDSa) also used it to remove its 24,000 ton Brent Delta platform in 2017.""We have taken substantial costs out of our major decommissioning project, the Brent, and we will continue to do so,"" said Steve Phimister, head of Shell's North Sea upstream.""The whole industry needs to do that by innovating.""($1 = 0.7782 pounds)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

86,"Aug 29, 2018 10:42AM ET",Tug of war for oil sector looking to feast after famine,nan,"By Shadia Nasralla and Gwladys FoucheSTAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - After years of restraint since crude prices slumped in 2014, oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the sector recovery.Oil industry suppliers say they have cut costs and prices to the bone and the recent rebound in crude justifies better rewards for anything from rigs to logistics and engineering services.Their overtures have met with stubborn resistance from producers. But there are increasing signs that something has to give, including recent strikes at North Sea platforms.""The cost savings that we have achieved over the past three years are not sustainable,"" said Thierry Pilenko, Executive Chairman of TechnipFMC (N:FTI), one of the world's biggest oil services groups.""A rig that was once at $600,000 day is now at $150,000, which is not even cash breakeven,"" he added, referring to rig rental rates. ""Cost inflation will come back ... The drilling industry working below breakeven is not sustainable.""The oil market is cyclical by nature -- if crude prices fall, so does investment and then output, which in turn drives up prices -- and oil services companies ride the rollercoaster by using the upturns to raise their prices to offset the downturns.Global exploration and production spending shot up by a quarter in 2005, fell 8 percent in 2009, jumped by about 12 percent two years later and then tanked by more than a fifth in 2016, according to data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy.GRAPHIC: Oil services sector's boom and bust cycles - https://tmsnrt.rs/2N4DlU0'FEAST OR FAMINE'Consequently, average rig rates that were about $200,000 for a floating rig in 2005 more than doubled by 2012 and then fell to about $160,000 last year, Rystad said.""It is still a feast or famine cycle,"" the CEO of oilfield services group Baker Hughes (N:BHGE), Lorenzo Simonelli, told an industry conference in the Norwegian oil capital of Stavanger.After benchmark oil futures contracts (LCOc1) slumped from more than $110 a barrel in 2014 to less than $30 in early 2016, oil producers cut spending drastically and promised shareholders that cost discipline was here to stay.GRAPHIC - Boom and Bust Cycles of Oil Services Sector: https://tmsnrt.rs/2wppPkeSigns of rising rates have begun to emerge in the United States, but oil producers are loath to put the genie back in the bottle.""There might be pressure on costs, but we will never forget what we have learned,"" Equinor Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told the Stavanger conference.Indeed, Equinor's announcement on Tuesday that it plans to drill 3,000 production and exploration wells off Norway during the next two decades came with a caveat.""There is no room for cost inflation in those plans,"" said Arne Sigve Nylund, head of Equinor's Norwegian operations.""We need to deliver at the same level we are now ... I call on suppliers to work with us on how to deliver at the lowest possible cost.""COLLABORATIVE APPROACH?But with oil now trading around $75 a barrel, strikes at several of Total's (PA:TOTF) North Sea offshore platforms are testimony to an industry wrestling with keeping efficiencies high and costs down. The way contracts are structured between producers and services will be key to the future level of costs.""There is a big dichotomy now. Some of the contractors are expecting to see price increases. They are almost saying ‘it’s my turn now’,"" Luis Araujo, CEO of oil services company Aker Solutions (OL:AKSOL), said.""I don’t buy into that. I think we should work together.""Araujo pointed to clients such as Aker BP (OL:AKERBP) offering contracts more akin to ""incentive schemes"" than ways to squeeze margins. ""In the future, maybe suppliers are going to get paid by performance. So instead of getting paid by the daily rates, (you) will be paid by how many meters you can drill.""Equinor's Saetre put it even more succinctly at the Stavenger conference, with the words of U.S. rock star Bruce Springsteen emblazoned on the big screen: ""Nobody wins unless everybody wins.""But given oil producers' own constraints, the message might not have trickled through quite yet.""We have to be a bit cautious because the guys doing the presentations are the leaders. But then there is the next layer in line who are being educated to squeeze suppliers and not collaborate,” Araujo said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

101,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."

143,"Apr 08, 2018 05:31AM ET",Aramco takes step to integrating petrochems into United States' biggest refinery,nan,"By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco took the first steps to integrating a petrochemicals business into the United States' biggest oil refinery, which is operated by its subsidiary Motiva Enterprises.Aramco's Chief Executive Amin Nasser signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth $8 billion-$10 billion with Honeywell UOP (N:HON) and Technip FMC (N:FTI) to study petrochemical production technology for use in a chemical plant the company is considering building at the Port Arthur refinery.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was winding up a two-week visit to the United States, was present at the signing in Houston, Texas, on Saturday along with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. ""These agreements signal our plans for expansion into petrochemicals,"" Motiva's Chief Executive Brian Coffman said.Aramco, which wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world's largest oil firm in an initial public offering (IPO) this year, wants to use oil as a major petrochemicals feedstock.Coffman also said Motiva was evaluating boosting the 603,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur refinery's capacity to 1 million or 1.5 million bpd, which would make it the largest in the world.The aromatics unit for which Honeywell UOP's technology is being considered under one of the MoUs, would convert benzene and paraxylene, byproducts of gasoline production, into 2 million tons annually of feedstocks for chemicals and plastics.The other MoU would allow Aramco to use Technip FMC's mixed-feed ethylene production technologies in the United States. The technology would produce 2 million tons a year of ethylene, which is used to make plastics, Motiva said.The final investment decision on setting up a multi-billion-dollar petrochemical plant at Port Arthur is not expected until 2019, and is ""dependent on strong economics, competitive incentives, and regulatory support,"" Aramco said in a statement.Coffman did not provide a timeline for the possible expansion of the Port Arthur refinery's crude oil processing capacity.""That's something we're evaluating, we're studying for in the future,"" he said.The 1.2-million bpd  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) refinery in Jamnagar, India, has the world's largest crude oil processing capacity.Aramco said last year that it would invest $18 billion in Motiva to expand the refinery and move into petrochemical production.Other U.S. companies, including  Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co  - a joint venture of Chevron Corp (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) - and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), have recently opened plants, like the one Motiva is considering, to process ethane into ethylene.Chevron Phillips is considering building a second ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast of Texas.The price tag for a large ethane cracker is typically over $6 billion, according to analysts. In addition to taking refining byproducts, ethane crackers provide hydrogen for refineries to use in making motor fuels.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"Apr 06, 2018 08:01PM ET",Saudi Aramco eyes new petrochemical plant in Texas: sources,nan,"By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's national oil company Saudi Aramco on Saturday is expected to disclose initial steps toward a multibillion-dollar chemical plant in Texas, according to sources familiar with the company's U.S. operations.Saudi Aramco has been weighing an expansion of its U.S. subsidiary Motiva Enterprises LLC's [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas refinery, already the largest in the United States by capacity. But Motiva wants to first move into petrochemicals, using abundant natural gas from U.S. shale fields to make the precursors for plastics, the sources said.Texas Governor Greg Abbott is expected to attend an event in Houston on Saturday where Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser are to discuss the plans, according to a Saudi Aramco representative.""Motiva is actively exploring a number of opportunities as part of its growth strategy,"" the company said on Friday. ""These opportunities include locations where we currently operate as well as new ones.""Saudi Aramco last year said it would invest $18 billion in Motiva's Port Arthur refinery, which can process up to 603,000 barrels of crude oil per day (bpd).Motiva wants to add an ethane cracker near its refinery that could produce more than 1.5 million tons of ethylene a year, the sources said. Saturday's announcement will also include an agreement with TechnipFMC (N:FTI) for a study of producing materials used in gasoline and industrial solvents, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.Motiva Chief Executive Brian Coffman last month said the company had yet to win approval for its major expansion projects.Other U.S. companies, including  Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co [CHEPH.UL] - a joint venture of Chevron Corp (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) - and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), have recently have opened plants to process ethane into ethylene. Chevron Phillips is considering building a second ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The price tag for a large ethane cracker is typically over $6 billion, according to Steve Lewandowski, vice president of Global Olefins at researcher IHS Markit. ""Ethane crackers make a lot of hydrogen which refiners can use in hydrocrackers and hydrotreaters"" to make motor fuels, Lewandowski said.Exxon is separately proposing to build with another Aramco unit, Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010), a $9 billion petrochemical plant near Corpus Christi, that would process ethane.Refiners see petrochemicals as a new market as demand for motor fuels is expected to plateau later in the century, said Sandeep Sayal, vice president, downstream energy research at IHS Markit.""Refinery industry growth is fairly subdued,"" Sayal added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Britain's FTSE (FTSE) meanwhile outperformed and was up 0.7 percent thanks to a weaker pound.A rotation out of the highly-valued tech sector, which has gained the most in Europe so far this year, saw investors shift to financials instead.Chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) was among the biggest fallers, down 3.2 percent, along with software firm Temenos (S:TEMN) and video games producer  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP). Also weighing were utilities and telecoms, two sectors which tend to underperform when interest rates rise, making their steady dividend flows less attractive.Traders said markets would likely remain quiet before the much awaited Fed meeting, which is widely expected to raise rates, a measure that could support banking stocks.""There is not much major data scheduled to be released today, which makes range-trading the most likely scenario... Also with the FOMC meeting just around the corner many traders might prefer to remain on the sideline for now,"" said Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets. Relief after last week's deal on new global banking rules also helped banks (SX7P) give a boost to European markets.HSBC (L:HSBA) was the biggest gainer, up 2.2 percent, while among other heavyweight banks, UBS (S:UBSG) rose 1.3 percent and Denmark's  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) gained 2.1 percent. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) fell 0.9 percent, despite its finance chief telling a German paper that it was able to cope with stricter capital rules agreed last week.Top gainers on the STOXX were South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG), which rose 24.4 percent to break three sessions of dramatic losses stemming from its discovery of accounting irregularities, and Altice (AS:ATCA).The French telecoms and cable firm jumped 11.1 percent in a slight relief rally. The stock, hammered by concerns over its debt, was still down 50 percent from the start of November.Oil and gas stocks also supported the index as crude prices rose, with  Tullow Oil  (L:TLW) up 4.1 percent and TechnipFMC (PA:FTI) up 4.2 percent.AB InBev (BR:ABI) reversed early gains to edge 0.1 percent lower after Reuters reported it is among the brewing groups looking to bid for a stake in Vietnam's largest brewer in a $5 billion sale process.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

196,"Nov 28, 2017 06:01AM ET","Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology",nan,"By Ernest ScheyderHOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE) Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effort to drain a global oil glut.""We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells,"" Portillo said.The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS). But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips (N:COP) - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.""The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly,"" Lance said in an interview. ""They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts.""Shell, in an initiative called ""iShale,"" has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc (N:FTI) that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co (N:EMR), to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface. Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs. Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.""There is still very little automation,"" said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. ""We haven't scratched the surface.""TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGYMuch of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill. ""There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology,"" said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc (O:CDEV) Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC),  Statoil  (OL:STL) and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites. Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze seismic data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.""It's not only removing costs that are superfluous,"" he said. ""It's boosting production.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

236,"Jul 25, 2017 12:31PM ET","European stocks spring higher led by banks, miners",nan,"By Kit Rees and Danilo MasoniLONDON (Reuters) - Strength among commodity firms and banking stocks as well as a string of solid updates boosted European shares on Tuesday.Earnings season remains front and center for equities investors though the focus will also be on the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which gets under way later in the day.Expectations are for the Fed to wait for the fourth quarter before raising rates, as U.S. economic data have been weaker than expected.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rose 0.4 percent, holding onto gains seen earlier in the session, as Wall Street opened higher and a key gauge of expected volatility (VIX) plunged to its lowest in more than 23 years. Yet some investors expressed a note of caution.""We're at that difficult junction in the middle of the year where we've rallied, we've done well, (we're) starting to accept that central banks are normalizing more, but we haven't actually seen much more,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. ""So are people starting to question the macro environment a bit more than they were?"" Corporate results season gathered steam with British business media group  Informa  (L:INF) and Dutch staffing firm  Randstad  (AS:RAND) up 2.7 and 4.9 percent respectively after well-received first-half updates.Among outperforming banks, Raiffeisen (VI:RBIV) was a standout gainer, up 6.8 percent, after second-quarter profit roughly tripled to 365 million euros ($425.41 million), helped by reductions in bad debt provisions. Miner  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) was the biggest gainer on the STOXX as the sector was buoyed by a surge in copper prices.Europe's tech sector (SX8P) saw iPhone supplier AMS (S:AMS) and mobile speaker maker  Logitech  (S:LOGN) rise in initial deals after both firms raised their outlook.Both stocks however reversed course as tech stocks in the United States lost ground following Google parent Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) warning that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices.""There's some truth about general fear in tech after the slight Google disappointment on traffic acquisition costs being higher, and the strong performance and generally positive positioning of investors to the sector,"" said Martin Moeller, head of global equity at Union Bancaire Privée, which holds AMS. Updates weighed on paper maker UPM (HE:UPM), Cembra Money Bank (S:CMBN) and Domino's Pizza (L:DOM), which all fell between 1.6 percent to 7.4 percent. While it is still early days for the European second quarter earnings season as only 20 percent of firms have given updates, more than half of those firms have beaten analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Paris-listed shares of TechnipFMC (PA:FTI) fell 1.8 percent after the oil services firm said that it had overstated its first-quarter earnings.European deal-making also rolled on with U.S. retailer Michael Kors (N:KORS) agreeing to buy luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo (L:CHOO) for $1.2 billion. That sent Jimmy Choo shares up 17 percent to an all-time high.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

297,"May 05, 2016 12:20PM ET",Oil rivals cooperate to slash equipment costs: Shell,nan,"By Ron BoussoLONDON (Reuters) - Ten oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Chevron  (N:CVX) and  BP  (L:BP) are working together to develop standard production equipment, a rare cooperation among rivals to save money as low oil prices put pressure on budgets.Bespoke valves, paints and underwater equipment are among the items that could be mass-produced at a cheaper cost, Harry Brekelmans, Shell's Projects and Technology Director told Reuters.The companies also want to set up institutions to find future savings after the past two years' industry downturn led to a near standstill in new project approvals.""We're coming together with a number of other operators and suppliers to focus on standardization and common requirements and pushing it all the way into how we can create common inventory,"" Brekelmans said in a phone interview on Wednesday. The other companies involved in the project are France's  Total  (PA:TOTF), Sonangol, Eni (MI:ENI) , Woodside (AX:WPL), Engie (PA:ENGIE), Saudi Aramco, and  Statoil  (OL:STL). Industry executives have long complained about inefficiencies that stem from companies' desire to protect patents for parts as simple as bolts, ladders and paints to complex high-pressure pipe systems.A number of services companies have already teamed up over the past two years in an effort to reduce costs of field development and technology, including FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI) and  Technip  (PA:TECF).Four years of oil prices over $100 prior to the mid-2014 crash led to spiraling costs in the sector as producers raced to develop frontier oil fields in ever deeper waters with more complex technology.But a 60 percent drop in oil prices over the past two years sent companies into a desperate drive to cut budgets and save costs, pushing standardization high up the agenda and Brekelmans believes there is commitment from senior executives.""We have to be far more thoughtful about how we create sustainability,"" Brekelmans said.He said the companies should benefit from the developments even if the oil price recovers. He said the initiative, which is known as the project for Standardization of Equipment Specifications for Procurement and is backed by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, could save Shell and other companies billions of dollars. However, some analysts were skeptical about how easy it would be for the rivals to collaborate.""It is still too early to say whether the push for standardization is working,"" said Jon Clark, oil and gas advisor at EY.""While this is an industry that prides itself for its technology it has not always been unable to work together to lower costs even as companies try to adjust to the lower price environment.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Technip and FMC Technologies, which have market capitalizations of 5.3 billion euros ($5.8 billion) and $6.8 billion respectively, have not yet agreed on terms and there is no certainty they will do so, the people said.Technip has also held talks with other potential buyers, one of the people added. Shares of Technip rose as much as 10 percent in late afternoon trading in New York after Reuters reported on talks. Technip shares had already closed up 3.6 percent in Paris. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. FMC Technologies and Technip did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Earlier this year, FMC Technologies and Technip formed a joint venture, Forsys Subsea, aimed at reducing the cost of subsea oilfield exploration, a sector that has been badly hurt by the drop in the price of oil. Technip tried to do a deal with CGG SA (PA:GEPH) last year, but talks fell apart when CGG rebuffed Technip's 1.47 billion euro preliminary takeover approach.  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), the world's No. 2 oilfield services provider, is currently in the midst of securing regulatory approvals for its acquisition of smaller rival  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) in a stock-and-cash $34.6 billion deal.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

305,"Sep 04, 2014 04:46PM ET","Wall Street ends down as energy shares decline, offset ECB",nan,"By Akane Otani NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down on Thursday, retreating from intraday records for the S&P and Dow, as a decline in energy shares sapped an earlier rally following the European Central Bank's new stimulus measures. Analysts attributed the late-day pullback to nervousness ahead of Friday's key U.S. jobs data. Expectations are for payroll growth of 225,000 in August, according to a Reuters poll. The wait for jobs data ""might have dried up the markets a bit and made it a light day,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The S&P energy index  ended down 1.3 percent as the day's worst performing sector in the S&P. Drilling equipment maker FMC Technologies (N:FTI), the sector's biggest percentage decliner, fell 4.4 percent to $57.05. Crude oil futures lost 1.1 percent to $94.55 as the dollar strengthened and weighed on commodities priced in the U.S. currency. The Dow and S&P 500 had touched record intraday highs after the ECB's surprise move, with the benchmark index hitting a high of 2,011.17 earlier in the session. All three main indexes pared gains in the afternoon as energy shares sunk with oil prices. ""We saw an initial rally from the ECB, but we're once again seeing those rallies muted, which I think is more of a factor as momentum slows down near the 2,000 level,"" said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. The Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) fell 8.7 points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,069.58. The S&P 500 (SPX) was down 3.07 points, or 0.15 percent, to end at 1,997.65. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) lost 10.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to 4,562.29. Shares of PVH Corp (N:PVH) rose 9.6 percent to $128.38 after the apparel company's quarterly profit beat expectations, bolstered by sales of Tommy Hilfiger-branded clothes. U.S.-listed shares of BP Plc (N:BP) fell 5.9 percent to $44.89 after a U.S. district judge ruled the company was ""grossly negligent"" in a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The stock suffered its worst one-day percentage decline since August 2011. Data showed U.S. initial jobless claims rose to 302,000 last week, within levels consistent with a strengthening labor market, though the private ADP survey's gauge of hiring came in a bit lower than expected. About 5.7 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the five-day average of 4.8 billion.  (Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski) "
