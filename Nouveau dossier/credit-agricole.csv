1,"Jun 20, 2019 09:51AM ET",Exclusive: HSBC gets top adviser role in Qatar for first time since Gulf row - sources,nan,"By Davide Barbuscia and Eric KnechtDUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - HSBC has been hired by a state-controlled port operator in Qatar, QTerminals, to coordinate a $500 million loan, sources familiar with the matter said, securing its first mandate as top adviser for a deal in Qatar since a regional rift between Doha and its neighbors erupted.The London-listed bank -- along with other lenders -- was caught up in Qatar's dispute with its neighbors Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which in 2017 cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar accusing it of financing terrorism, a charge Doha denies.Along with other banks, it side-stepped high-profile Qatar deals in the aftermath of the diplomatic crisis and prioritized business in Saudi Arabia, where it has a strong presence, as the kingdom promised a slate of deals as part of its efforts to open and transform the economy in an era of lower oil prices.As a result of that, HSBC has not arranged any bond deals out of Qatar since the crisis began in 2017, according to Refinitiv data, after having been at the top of bond league tables.Though it has participated in Qatari loan transactions over the past two years, it never won lead roles, and its ranking in the local bank debt market has fallen.But after missing out on profitable mandates, like Doha's $12 billion sovereign bond issuance, the lender has been seeking to regain its foothold in Qatar, sources familiar with the matter said.QTerminals did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HSBC, which declined to comment, has been appointed as sole coordinator for a $500 million five-year bank facility for the company, in charge of developing and operating Qatar's Hamad Port, and it has recently approached other lenders for the transaction, said the sources.LEAD ROLEThe bank has led almost every sovereign bond issue in the Gulf over the past few years, as governments in the region increased their dependence on debt to refill budget deficits caused by a drop in energy prices.In its latest bond this year, a jumbo $12 billion debt sale, Qatar hired almost the same group of banks that arranged its bond issue last year, in what a source at the time said was a demonstration of the country's commitment to its existing partners.Those banks included  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), and four banks with Qatari investment:  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Qatar National Bank. None of these banks has arranged Saudi Arabia's recent bond issues.Over the past few years HSBC has consolidated its presence in Saudi Arabia, as the kingdom opened up to foreign investors as part of economic reforms pushed forward by its new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.It was one of the banks appointed to lead state-owned giant Aramco's debut international bond this year, and had been previously mandated as an adviser for the company's initial public offering, which is now expected to take place between 2020 and early 2021.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

3,"Jun 17, 2019 07:21PM ET",Banks to include CO2 emission measures in shipping loan decisions,nan,"By Jonathan SaulLONDON (Reuters) - A group of leading banks will for the first time include efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions in their decision making when providing shipping company loans, executives said on Tuesday. International shipping accounts for 2.2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization (IMO), has a long-term goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050.Working with non-profit organisations the Global Maritime Forum, the Rocky Mountain Institute and London University's UCL Energy Institute, 11 banks have established a framework to measure the carbon intensity of shipping finance portfolios.The banks involved in the ""Poseidon Principles"" initiative, which will set a common baseline to assess whether lending portfolios are in line or behind the adopted climate goals set by the IMO, represent around a fifth or $100 billion of the total global shipping finance portfolio. The results will be published annually in individual sustainability reports and the data will be obtained by banks from borrowers under existing loan agreements. Although the IMO agreed stricter energy efficiency targets last month for certain types of ships, environmental campaigners are calling for tougher goals. ""We are helping the shipping industry emerge into the 21st century in a responsible way,"" Michael Parker, global head of shipping at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), told Reuters.'HUGE ROLE'Those involved so far are Citigroup,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), DNB, ABN Amro, Amsterdam Trade Bank,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, Danish Ship Finance, Danske Bank, DVB, ING and Nordea. ""Banks have a huge role to play here because there is about $450 billion of senior debt that the world's shipping banks and Chinese lessors grant to the sector and about 70,000 commercial vessels,"" Paul Taylor, global head of shipping & offshore with Societe Generale CIB, said.Banks will in the longer term be more selective about which ships they include in their lending portfolios, bankers said.""Will there be companies that will find it difficult to get finance as they have less efficient ships, yes, it will be a consequence of it - but it's not going to be used to look for those companies and somehow find a way of getting them out,"" Citigroup's Parker said.Oivind Haraldsen, Danske Bank's global head of shipping, said more institutions would join the efforts to cut the carbon footprint of the sector. ""All of us have to push - we as banks probably have more power than we are aware,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

4,"Jun 13, 2019 09:35AM ET","Oil surges after Gulf tanker attacks, stocks claw higher",nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Suspected attacks on two tankers off the coast of Iran saw oil markets erupt out of their recent slump on Thursday and kept traders gobbling up ultra-safe government bonds, gold and the Japanese yen.Brent surged as much 4% after reports of the attacks added to already heightened tensions between Iran and the United States. The area is near the Strait of Hormuz through which a fifth of global oil consumption passes from Middle East producers.The crude spike helped Europe's oil producers pull stock markets there higher and lift Wall Street futures. There were also some stellar gains in the telecoms sector as Germany dished out new 5G mobile network licenses to some new entrants. ""Whenever you have an incident in the Arabian Gulf a little bit of nervousness always starts to kick in about that particular artery getting clogged up,"" CMC Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson said.Given that oil was at five-month lows on Wednesday, people were taking precautions in case it might escalate into something more serious, he added.""But personally I think it will be much like in the past, where you get a spike higher (in oil) but ultimately it doesn't change the underlying supply and demand dynamics."" Wall Street oil majors like  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were pointing 1% higher while S&P and Dow e-minis were up 0.4% and Nasdaq futures climbed 0.6%.But Asia had been a different story. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped sharply again overnight as public tensions continued there about a bill which would allow extradition to China.Doubts were growing too about any improvement in what U.S. President Donald Trump called ""testy"" trade relations with China before this month's G20 summit while some market anxiety emerged that Federal Reserve rate cut speculation may be overdone.Investors will be looking to what Fed policymakers say after their next policy meeting on June 18-19, with Fed Funds rate futures pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut for the subsequent policy review on July 30-31. That is completely at odds with the Fed's projection three months ago, when policymakers saw gradual rate hikes in coming years. ""The U.S. real economy has not worsened that much. But given market expectations, the Fed will have no choice but to cut rates,"" said Kozo Koide, chief economist at Asset Management One.RATE EXPECTATIONS With bonds in demand again, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped to 2.113 percent, near Friday's 2.053 percent, its lowest level since September 2017, while in Europe, German borrowing costs sank back toward all-time lows. Italy also paid the lowest rate in more than a year to sell seven- and 15-year debt on Thursday, helped by signals last week from the European Central Bank that it will keep borrowing costs down, and Rome's efforts to avoid a budget clash with Brussels.Yields had tumbled in Asia too. Long-dated Japanese government bond yields hit their lowest levels since August 2016, before rising back a bit after a weak 30-year bond auction.In Australia, long known for its high-yield currency, rates fell to record lows, with three-year yield now slipping below 1 percent after jobs data pointed to another interest rate cut in July to follow one last week.Currency markets saw plenty of action as well. The safe-haven yen gained 0.2% to 108.32 to the dollar as risk sentiment soured, while the Australian dollar dropped 0.3%..The euro steadied at $1.1293, having taken a hit on Wednesday after Trump said he was considering sanctions over Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project and warned Germany against depending on Russia for energy.The pound was still subdued at $1.2680 after British lawmakers defeated an attempt led by the opposition Labour Party to try to block a no-deal Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary agenda from the government.Turkey's lira tanked, though, dropping 1.4% as the rising cost of oil compounded tensions in Syria and a dispute with Washington over Ankara's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system.""You still have a lot of uncertainty when it comes to geopolitics,"" said Manuel Oliveri, analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""The focus is shifting to the G20 meeting. Risk sentiment remains relatively unstable,"" he added, while cautioning that expectations for interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve were keeping investor confidence from weakening further.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

5,"Jun 11, 2019 05:44AM ET",Mounting U.S. rate cut bets cap dollar before G20 meeting,nan,"By Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied above a recent two-and-a-half-month low on Tuesday as investors focused on a Group of 20 summit later this month where Beijing and Washington might make some progress on trade talks.A 3.5% rally in the dollar against its rivals in the first five months of 2019 has come to a halt in recent weeks as dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials and weak economic data bolster rate-cut expectations.Though markets are only pricing in about a 20% chance of a rate cut in June, they are fully pricing in a cut by July, and more than three rate hikes by mid-2020. The next policy meeting is scheduled for next week. Rising rate cut bets have also prompted investors to increase holdings of other currencies, with latest positioning data showing the biggest weekly rise in euro positions in nine months.With the dollar having weakened 1% this month against a basket of other major currencies to hit a late-March low of 96.46 last week, investors are firmly focused on a G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, on June 28-29.The dollar was broadly steady at 96.80 on Tuesday. ""That meeting is now becoming the centerpiece for financial markets in the coming days,"" said Simon Derrick, a currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was ready to impose more tariffs if talks at the summit with China's president, Xi Jinping, make no progress.Trump said last week he would decide after the meeting of the leaders of the world's largest economies whether to carry out a threat to impose tariffs on at least $300 billion in Chinese goods.Away from the upcoming G20 summit, investors have become more cautious of betting on further dollar weakness.""Bets of U.S. rate cuts have been rising quickly in recent days and we think the pricing has become too aggressive so the dollar's downside is limited,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.The euro was a touch firmer at $1.1318 though a survey showed investor morale in the euro zone deteriorated sharply in June, falling well short of expectations. Elsewhere, the pound was lower as a leadership contest for the ruling Conservative Party got underway this week. The euro edged to a five-month high against the pound to 89.32 pence before British employment data.Recent data, particularly manufacturing figures, have been weak, fuelling expectations that the next move from the Bank of England will be a rate cut. Policymakers, however, have adopted an unexpectedly hawkish stance.The Bank of England will probably need to raise interest rates sooner than financial markets expect, policymaker Michael Saunders said on Monday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

7,"Jun 05, 2019 04:39AM ET",StockBeat - Markets Extend Relief Rally; Banks Lag on ECB Fears,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- After some hesitation at the opening, Europe’s stock markets rose in early trading Wednesday, extending a relief rally that began on Tuesday when Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell hinted at a possible interest rate cut.Powell had said in a speech on Tuesday that “as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” after voicing concern about the uncertainty created by recent trade- and immigration-related disputes with China and Mexico. There was no mention of the “patient” approach to policy-making that has dominated Powell’s recent communication.At 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.8 points, or 0.2% at 373.74, near its highest in a week. The German Dax and the U.K. FTSE 100 were both up 0.2%.Sentiment was also lifted by a surprising rise in IHS Markit’s service sector surveys around the continent. The Eurozone service purchasing managers index rose to 52.9 in May, better than the unchanged reading of 52.5 that was expected. National indexes weakened in France, Italy and Spain, but rose in Germany.The biggest laggard was Italy’s FTSE MIB, down 0.1%, unsettled by a vote in the lower house of parliament that indirectly endorsed the populist coalition’s vague plans to issue a parallel currency in the form of short-dated government bonds, known as MiniBOTs. Italian press reports have also suggested that the EU has already made up its mind to open an “Excessive Deficit Procedure” against Italy for violating fiscal rules.Banks are among the worst performers again on Wednesday, as the thought of Fed easing turns minds to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. Some analysts expect the ECB to push back the date for its first interest rate hike beyond the end of this year, which would prolong the intense pressure on bank margins from low rates. Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) were all lagging the local benchmark index, as were Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Spain’s Santander (MC:SAN), BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK). In the Netherlands, ING (AS:INGA) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) were at the bottom of the AEX."

That’s the lowest level since 2012.“Volume is unlikely to rebound anytime soon,” said Fang Lei, a Hong Kong-based managing director of Asia Pacific debt origination and advisory at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “Some companies are sitting on the sidelines watching the U.S.-China trade war.”Many instead are turning to domestic funding, taking advantage of policy makers’ moves to bolster credit growth as China’s economy slows. Yields on weaker companies’ bonds have fallen near the lowest in 30 months, luring issuers including developers back home for funding. Local corporate-bond issuance has jumped 33.5% so far, to a record high of 4.4 trillion yuan ($637.3 billion).A weakening exchange rate has also enhanced the appeal of yuan borrowing, and raised the risk of servicing overseas debt. Dollar-bond issuance has also slowed this year, though not by as much as in the loan market. Chinese entities’ dollar-note sales are just 4.9% down on last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, the prolonged trade dispute has reduced the incentive for manufacturing investment, amid fear Chinese products will be subject to additional tariffs. Banks have turned cautious, according to Steve Wang, Hong Kong-based deputy head of research at BOC International Holdings Ltd.“Economic uncertainty has been holding back Chinese companies from significant spending plans and in turn has dampened demand for offshore loans,” said Benjamin Ng, head of Asia Pacific debt syndicate and acquisition finance group at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in Hong Kong.Read here about China’s pledge to continue with targeted stimulus amid trade-war risks.To cap it off, there’s China’s record pace of credit defaults to give lenders pause.“Marginal borrowers with weaker financials would find it more difficult to tap syndicated loans amid increasing worry on defaults,” said Fang at Credit Agricole.(Updates dollar-note sales in the fifth paragraph.)"

13,"May 16, 2019 03:25PM ET","Debt bubbles could burst as economies slow, threatening stability, bankers warn",nan,"By Virginia FurnessSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Heavy reliance on debt financing and slow economic growth are leading to the creation of debt bubbles which risk destabilizing the entire financial system should a major shock occur, bond bankers and investors warned at a conference on Thursday.They were in Stockholm for the annual meeting of the International Capital Markets Association, an industry body.Speakers on the first day warned about an unsustainable build up of debt and that liquidity would dry up in certain asset classes in stress scenarios -- although they did not expect that to happen any time soon.Ultra-low interest rates have prompted companies and governments to load up on debt faster than ever before, often selling bonds with less protection for investors. That has led to concerns that a turn in market sentiment could result in a credit crunch.""Of course there are bubbles building up,"" Hans Stoter, global head of core investments at AXA Investment Managers told the conference.""There is much more debt in the world than there was before ... and most of that growth is coming out of debt financing with interest rates so low.""Leverage in the system has increased some 50%-60% since the financial crisis a decade ago, with debt now worth some 230% of economic output globally according to IMF estimates, said Frank Czichowski, treasurer at KfW.""There is no banking system in the world that can cope with the flood coming out of this,"" he said.Affordability is not an issue while rates remain low but a rise in borrowing costs could create major problems, Axa's Stoter said: ""The question is, with the debt level where it is, can central banks ever afford to let interest rates go back up because it will lead to a major bankruptcy wave.""A key risk for markets is low liquidity -- the ease with which assets can be bought or sold.Alexi Chan, global co-head of capital markets at HSBC, said a reduction of up to 50% in banks' holdings of bonds -- the result of regulation and increased costs -- meant banks are no longer major providers of market liquidity.""The question is, when a serious stress point comes, how this constrained liquidity we are now seeing will impact that,"" he said. ""It is a big question for the system. And I think we are not really tested on that.""Other speakers said investors had to be made aware liquidity in some asset classes would disappear in any credit crunch.Sebastian Domanico, head of debt capital markets at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, said investors and issuers ""need to realize that if something happened to the specific corporate sector or the high yield market ... they will be stuck.""And I'm not sure the end-investors in the fund completely realize that,"" he said, describing it as a systemic risk.Roman Schmidt, divisional board member capital markets at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said a proliferation in electronic trading platforms would exacerbate the problem.""Platforms don't really see crises,"" he said. ""The machines will react exactly like the humans did 10 years ago -- they will withdraw liquidity if something bad does happen.""But that risk may never materialize. Axa's Stoter said that central bank bond-buying, or QE, was here ""permanently"".""We will be in a super-low rate environment for a very long time,"" he said."

Sign up here. Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are among five banks that agreed to pay European Union fines totaling 1.07 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for colluding on foreign-exchange trading strategies.Citigroup was hit hardest with a 310.8 million-euro penalty, followed by fines of 249.2 million euros and 228.8 million euros for RBS and JPMorgan, the European Commission said in a statement on Thursday.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc was fined 210.3 million euros and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. must pay nearly 70 million euros as part of the settlement with the EU’s antitrust regulator.Traders ran two cartels on online chatrooms, swapping sensitive information and trading plans that allowed them make informed decisions to buy or sell currencies, the regulator said. Many of them knew each other, calling one chatroom on the Bloomberg terminal the ""Essex Express n’ the Jimmy"" because all of the traders but one met on a commuter train from Essex to London. Other names for rooms were the ""Three Way Banana Split"" and ""Semi Grumpy Old Men.""""Foreign exchange spot trading activities are one of the largest markets in the world, worth billions of euros every day,"" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. ""These cartel decisions send a clear message that the commission will not tolerate collusive behavior in any sector of the financial markets.""While relatively large, the cartel fines are lower than a 1.3 billion-euro penalty for banks for rigging Euribor rates and below a record 3.8 billion-euro penalty for collusion between truckmakers.UBS Group AG escaped a fine because it was the first to tell regulators about the collusion. The five other banks won reduced penalties by striking a settlement with the commission that won’t allow them to challenge the EU’s findings.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG was separately charged by the EU over FX collusion last year. That case involves another online chatroom and banks may be fined at a later date.Traders’ manipulation of benchmark foreign-exchange rates was exposed in 2013 Bloomberg articles, triggering regulatory probes in the U.S., the U.K. and Switzerland. More than a dozen financial institutions have paid about $11.8 billion in fines and penalties globally, with another $2.3 billion spent to compensate customers and investors. Former U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch in 2015 said the banks engaged in a “brazen display of collusion” to game markets.“Today’s fine is a further reminder of how badly the bank lost its way in the past and we absolutely condemn the behavior of those responsible,” RBS said in an emailed statement. “This kind of behavior has no place at the bank we are today; our culture and controls have changed fundamentally during the past ten years.”JPMorgan said the bank is “pleased to resolve this historical matter, which relates to the conduct of one former employee” and has now “made significant control improvements.”MUFG is “committed to ensuring integrity and compliance with the regulatory authorities in every jurisdiction in which we operate, and have taken a number of measures to prevent this occurring again,” the bank said in a statement. Citigroup and Barclays declined to comment.The fines for Barclays and RBS are covered by the two British banks’ existing provisions and in line with expectations, according to Edward Firth, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London.Traders exchanged information about outstanding customers’ orders, bid-ask spreads, their open-risk positions and details of current or planned trading activities. They would sometimes agree to ""stand down"" or stop a trading activity to avoid interfering with another trader in the group. They traded 11 currencies, including the euro, the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen.While the U.S. has won guilty pleas from JPMorgan, Citigroup, RBS and Barclays, three British traders in a group known as “The Cartel” were acquitted by a U.S. federal court last year of using a chatroom to coordinate trades and manipulate prices on the spot exchange rate for euros and U.S. dollars.The EU is continuing to investigate banks for possible EU antitrust violations. Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), Credit Suisse and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA are targeted by an EU probe into a suspected cartel for trading of U.S. dollar supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds via online chatrooms between 2009 and 2015.Eight banks are the focus of yet another EU probe looking at the trading of eurozone sovereign bonds from 2007 to 2012. UniCredit SpA said it faces a possible fine from the eurozone probe. RBS is also one of the banks being probed, a person said in February.The EU regulator is also looking at ""potential coordination in options trading"" in the FX market,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) said in its annual report in February. HSBC received questions from regulators in October and the investigation is at an early stage, it said.(Updates with RBS response in eighth paragraph.)"

DWS shares were down 3% at 1447 GMT, rebounding slightly from sharper losses after the news of the stalled talks emerged.The idea of merging the businesses mushroomed in recent months as Deutsche Bank discussed a possible merger with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). A deal for Deutsche's DWS unit could have been a way to finance that merger, but with the Commerzbank talks ending in failure, the urgency to do an asset management deal fizzled out.Any deal to merge DWS with a peer and give it additional scale could also be presented as a strategic revamp of Deutsche Bank after the failure of the Commerzbank talks. A GOOD FITA combined UBS asset management unit and DWS would have just more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.58 trillion) in assets under management and was considered a good fit as the two are roughly the same size.DWS chief executive Asoka Woehrmann has said he wants to actively participate in consolidation in asset management and early last year Deutsche Bank listed it as part of a broader overhaul to help Germany's largest bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals.A structure under consideration was for UBS to hive off its asset management business and fold it into DWS, which is 79.5 percent owned by Deutsche Bank.A deal could have led to more than 1,000 job cuts, one banker said. Deutsche Bank had also approached Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Amundi, the French asset manager mostly owned by  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), over a possible deal for DWS, other people close to the matter said.As with the UBS talks, issues over who would be in driving seat of a merged entity led to the failure of the Allianz talks, two people close to the matter said.

18,"May 10, 2019 10:40AM ET",Nordic banks pool resources to fight money laundering,nan,"By Esha VaishSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Nordic region's six major banks are joining forces to set up a customer checking center to crack down on money launderers, part of efforts to recover from a scandal that has shaken confidence in the finance industry.Danske Bank and Swedbank have lost billions from their market value after becoming embroiled in a money laundering scandal involving their businesses in the Baltics.The banks have promised to take steps to rectify shortcomings, such as their planned joint venture with rivals Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and DNB to perform common customer checks.Regulators and banks see these so-called ""know your customer"" (KYC) checks as a safeguard against money laundering as the process of verifying the identity of customers, companies and business associates can help banks to spot or monitor suspicious clients.""Preventing financial crime is a top priority and a strong driver behind this initiative,"" Fredrik Millde, project manager of the venture, known as Nordic KYC Utility, told Reuters.The banks have not worked together previously, but the international nature of money laundering and the difficulties preventing it has persuaded them to join forces.The new body is expected to create a standardized KYC process for large and midsize Nordic corporate customers across the six banks and Millde expects it to start providing services from 2020 and also sell its services to other banks. Five of the six banks first announced the venture in May 2018. Swedbank joined later in the year. The banks have not said how much they are spending on it.The finance industry have been under pressure to take action quickly because of criticism by regulators of their anti-money laundering controls.Last year, Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said lenders had insufficient customer due diligence measures in place from 2016-2017, indicating there was a lack of information about beneficial owners and inadequate documentation.SEB spokesman Laurence Westerlund said people from the founding banks were testing various IT functions and systems for the utility, which is hoping to win European Union antitrust clearance in third quarter.The new body could allow the banks to coordinate identity tracking, reduce KYC failures or misidentification risks due to use of different data sources and cut inhouse compliance costs, accounting firm Deloitte said in a paper on the Nordic project and other KYC measures prepared for UK banks.QUALITATIVE ANALYSISThe concept of these utilities is relatively new and there are only a handful in existence. Banking secrecy laws prevent banks from disclosing suspicious clients to each other and this has hindered the fight against financial crime, a paper published last September by independent consultancy the Tax Justice Network said.But several groups are looking at potential industry-wide initiatives as the regulatory burden to police and report financial crime grows. Clipeum, a French project launched by Societe Generale's employees, with support from the bank, is building a platform where companies and individuals can upload KYC documents and authorize financial institutions to consult the documents.""We thought it was smarter to collaborate on this matter instead of compete,"" said Eric Le Roux, one of the two co-founders of Clipeum, who also works for  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).Societe Generale has so far convinced Allianz (DE:ALVG), Banque Postale, BpiFrance, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Euler Hermes, Natixis, asset manager Tikehau and UniCredit to join Clipeum.The initiative, which will become a joint venture with institutions that are part of it owning stakes, expects to be ready in 2020.But such ventures have had varying success, with Singapore's Monetary Authority having shelved its KYC utility citing unexpectedly high costs.Graham Barrow, an anti-financial crime banking expert, said in the past these utilities have not worked well because banks grade clients differently based on their individual risk appetites and also because the utilities did not often do qualitative analysis on KYC data.But the Nordic banks' venture is looking to go one step further. Millde said it was looking at setting up a common ""onboarding"" process for the six banks. This would allow any of the banks to use the utility to assess whether to take on a customer. ""There is no provider that can do the full scale of what we want to do and there is isn't any provider around that has done this cross border (work) in the way that this project has as its aim,"" Westerlund said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

TD Securities, which sees the lira weakening about 20 percent against the dollar this quarter, has penciled in 600 basis points of rate increases through the end of July.The calls came after authorities ordered a re-run of mayoral elections in Istanbul, raising the risk of political turmoil that threatens to derail efforts to revive economic growth and dash hopes of a possible monetary-policy easing anytime soon. The election commission said the decision was due to violations that marred the vote in March.The outlook will test the central bank’s pledge to raise borrowing costs if needed to curb inflation and stabilize a currency that’s already the worst performer in emerging markets this year after the Argentine peso. While tightening monetary policy could draw fire from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, doubt over the bank’s ability to support the currency through foreign reserves mean that options appear limited.“We all know the Central Bank of Turkey has limited FX ammo to fight a weakening lira,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “So we are back in the scope of them needing to hike rates.”The Monetary Policy Committee, headed by Governor Murat Cetinkaya, will meet next on June 12, less than two weeks before the new election in Istanbul. It last raised its benchmark rate in September, lifting it by 625 basis points to 24 percent.While liquidity in the lira swap market is scarce, it offers a sign of what traders are expecting.The one-month forward implied yield on the lira jumped more than 280 basis points to 27 percent on Tuesday. The move is more pronounced further along the curve, with the one-year cross currency swap surging to almost 30 percent.Dollar SalesMeanwhile, Turkey’s state lenders, which bankers say were selling dollars during the weeks that led up to the March 31 vote, have been active again since the decision to annul the elections, according to three people with direct knowledge of transactions.Government-run banks are estimated to have sold as much as $1 billion over the past 24 hours, the people said, declining to be identified. Since then, the lira declined by around 3 percent to touch 6.1982 against the dollar on Tuesday, its lowest level since October."

The Swedish central bank’s move echoes similar action by global peers -- the Bank of Canada abandoned its tightening bias this week after the European Central Bank, Bank of Korea and Reserve Bank of Australia flagged growth risks earlier this month.Global central banks are pushing back policy-tightening plans amid heightened economic pessimism, which saw the International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for world growth to the lowest since the financial crisis. That is driving down currencies -- the Australian and Canadian dollars fell this week to the weakest levels since early January while the Korean won slid to a two-year low.The krona was the worst performer among Group-of-10 currencies as Swedish policy makers said a hike was now expected “towards the end of the year or at the beginning of next year.” The Riksbank also announced it will purchase government bonds for a nominal value of 45 billion kronor ($4.7 billion) from July this year through to December 2020.“Today’s announcement clearly shows the Riksbank is becoming more concerned about growth conditions outside of Sweden,” said Manuel Oliveri, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “This is more dovish than we anticipated, slightly more dovish than what market expected and in the big scheme of things, a rebound towards 10.60 makes sense,” he said, referring to the euro-krona exchange rate.The krona fell for a seventh straight day against the euro. It tumbled as much as 1.3 percent to 10.6651 per euro, the biggest intraday decline since Feb. 19. That was also the weakest krona level since Aug. 30 versus the shared currency."

EU rules allow for a fine of up to 10 percent of global turnover.The bank's shares were down 1.7 percent in morning trade.Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier declined to comment on the matter as he arrived for the bank's annual shareholder meeting in Milan on Thursday morning.""I have nothing to say,"" he told a reporter who asked if the bank would make financial contingency plans for a potential EU fine.UniCredit said in a statement: ""On the basis of the current information, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine."". It has until April 29 to raise objections to the commission's allegations.The commission revealed in January that the alleged bond cartel had been run by some traders mainly via online chatrooms, saying its charges did not imply that anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the euro zone government bond sector.European banks have already paid out billions of euros in fines, including for rigging interest rate benchmarks used to price home loans.In a separate, earlier case, the commission charged  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and a fourth bank in December with being part of a bond cartel, also citing traders using chatrooms.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

29,"Apr 09, 2019 01:51PM ET",Standard Chartered to pay $1.1 billion for sanctions violations,nan,"By Karen FreifeldWASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc has agreed to pay $1.1 billion to U.S. and British authorities for conducting illegal financial transactions that violated sanctions against Iran and other countries, government authorities announced on Tuesday.The settlement by the London-based bank is among the most severe imposed for sanctions violations, some of which occurred not long after Standard Chartered settled similar charges in 2012.""The circumstances that led to today's resolutions are completely unacceptable"" and ""not representative"" of the bank today, Group Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement.Tuesday's settlement extends by two years a deferred prosecution agreement that Standard Chartered originally entered in 2012.A former Standard Chartered banker in Dubai pleaded guilty in a New York state court to sanctions-related violations, authorities also said, while an Iranian customer was criminally charged by federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C.Standard Chartered ""undermined the integrity of our financial system and harmed our national security by deliberately providing Iranians with coveted access to the U.S. economy,"" Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu said.The agreements resolve an investigation that began into Standard Chartered's banking for Iran-controlled entities in the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The investigation began roughly five years ago. The bank paid U.S. authorities $667 million in 2012 for illegally moving millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of customers in Iran, Sudan, Libya and Myanmar, some of the same countries involved in the latest settlement. In 2014, it paid another $300 million to the New York's Department of Financial Services after a monitor uncovered shortcomings in the bank's surveillance systems.In a statement on Tuesday, Standard Chartered said it accepted responsibility for the violations, which stopped after 2014. The bank also said it had cooperated in the investigations.The latest penalty is a tally of fines and forfeitures imposed by U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA imposed a 102 million pound fine ($134 million) on the bank for its control failures. It noted Standard Chartered's lax controls in opening an account with 3 million UAE Dirham in cash in a suitcase (just over 500,000 pounds), and allowing a customer to export a product with potential military applications to war zones.New York's DFS said the misconduct involved $600 million in illegal dollar transactions between 2008 and 2014 that moved through the state from the bank's London and Dubai offices.Another $20 million in U.S. dollar payments were tied to illegal transactions involving Syrian, Sudanese, Burmese and Cuban entities, the New York regulator said.After bank employees found that dozens of clients used an internet platform to access U.S. dollar accounts from Iran, bank compliance officers failed to take steps to ensure the transactions were blocked, New York’s regulator said.Payments from Iran through a fax in the Dubai branch also were not halted, and a manager told an Iranian front company how to evade detection by changing its name and opening a new account, the regulator said.New York will ensure ""the bank lives up to its word and maintains effective safeguards,"" said Acting New York Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell. As part of its deal, an independent consultant will continue to oversee the bank's remediation efforts, the regulator said.Standard Chartered also agreed to enter into amended deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the Manhattan District Attorney for conspiring to violate sanctions and falsifying New York business records. The agreements now run through April 2021. The bank had been operating under a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities since the 2012 settlement.The agreement has been extended numerous times, most recently for 10 days and set to expire on Wednesday. Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900 million for the potential resolution of violations of U.S. sanctions and foreign exchange trading. That sum also included the FCA penalty. Standard Chartered's penalty is well below the $8.9 billion imposed by U.S. authorities in 2014 on  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) for conspiring to evade sanctions. The 10 banks penalized for similar conduct over the past decade also include France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), which paid $787 million in 2015, and Amsterdam-based ING Bank, $619 million in 2012.Reuters broke the news of the latest settlement on Monday and exclusively reported on the probe in 2014.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

30,"Apr 08, 2019 12:28AM ET",Erdogan's election setback dents hopes for big reforms in Turkey,nan,"By Ali Kucukgocmen and Jonathan SpicerISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's losses in local elections have dented investors' hopes that Turkey will adopt painful reforms they say are needed to stabilize the economy as he moves to shore up his political base.Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), in power nationally since 2002, lost control of the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul in the March 31 polls, initial results showed. The AKP has demanded recounts in both cities.Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law, is expected this week to announce to jittery foreign investors the structural reforms he hopes will revive an economy plagued by high inflation and a fragile currency. State-owned Anadolu news agency said the announcement would be on Wednesday.After a currency crisis last year that saw the lira lose nearly 30 percent of its value, economists say Turkey needs to make long-term commitments to increase exports, relieve debt-laden companies and free up the central bank to do its job.Erdogan, who campaigned hard ahead of the vote, said on election night the AKP would now refocus on the economy.But many analysts are skeptical about the chances for a comprehensive reform plan, especially after the elections, and fear the AKP will opt instead for short-term stimulus measures that fail to tackle, and may even exacerbate, deeper weaknesses.""The AKP base want more pro-growth measures, they want more fiscal measures, they want lower inflation. It is exactly what they (the AKP) did before the elections and it will have to continue if (Erdogan) wants to remain popular,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging markets strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""I would not expect concrete reforms, it will be just words.""BOOM AND BUSTAt the heart of Turkey's economic malaise is years of cheap foreign funding that drove a construction-driven boom. Once the lira collapsed, firms could not pay off debts and that exposed their lenders and employees to default and bankruptcy.As the economy tipped into recession last year, the lira stabilized and inflation dipped a bit from a 15-year high of 25 percent, offering some relief.But a series of ad hoc measures have stoked investors' concerns that Turkey is not fully committed to letting its currency float freely or to allowing the central bank to keep interest rates high - at 24 percent since September - for as long as needed to bring inflation down from 20 percent. To help hard-pressed Turks this year, the government launched discount fruit and vegetable stands and extended tax cuts on some goods. To tackle a lira meltdown last month, it ordered banks to choke off lira funding to a London foreign-exchange market and tapped into central bank reserves. ""It looks like the Erdogan instinct is to survive,"" said Nihat Bulent Gultekin, a former Turkish central bank governor and now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.""I don't think they have any long-term objectives. It would require a constant focus on the economy for an extended period of time.""HARD TO SWALLOWAlbayrak has given few details of the coming reforms, saying only that they would address a wide range of issues.The lira has settled down in recent days after its pre-election volatility and analysts say Albayrak's reforms will help determine whether volatility returns. ""The market expects concrete measures to address economic imbalances accompanied by a specific timetable,"" said Piotr Matys, emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank.Moody's said ""the credibility and effectiveness"" of reforms will be key to Turkey's credit profile, which the ratings agency downgraded in August. ""There is a risk that the government will embark on even more expensive stimulus programs as it begins to recognize the extent of the economic downturn,"" it said. Investors and economists say Ankara needs a plan to recapitalize banks dealing with corporate restructuring and non-performing loans, which could more than double this year. It should also boost competitive export sectors such as auto and textile manufacturing in order to lower its annual current account deficit, which leaves the economy reliant on speculative foreign inflows, they say.""We need to provide the right training and the right subsidies to the right sectors,"" Selva Demiralp, professor at Istanbul's Koc University. The reforms would take time and ""there will be a price to pay because when the production structure is changing some people will be unemployed,"" she said.That may be hard to swallow for Erdogan and Turks in general who would not welcome a recession that lasts beyond the second half of 2019, when economists currently expect a return to growth. Unemployment has already risen above 13 percent. Although an unlikely option for Erdogan, who has repeatedly said Turkey does not need the International Monetary Fund, Matys of Rabobank said the reforms should ideally be overseen by the IMF to restore investor confidence. ""A PowerPoint presentation (by Albayrak) with slides claiming that the economy is rebalancing quickly and a few bullet points may not prove sufficient to restore confidence among investors,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

32,"Apr 04, 2019 05:10AM ET",Risk of Another Ugly U.S. Jobs Report Is Keeping Investors Wary,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors were on edge a year ago for signs the U.S. labor market was overheating. Now they’re primed for the opposite.While Friday’s jobs report is expected to show payrolls rebounded in March following the weakest reading since 2017, economists forecast a 180,000 gain. That would be a moderation from last year’s average as business investment slows and headwinds gather.Bond investors are wary that the falloff could be sharper this year, with markets reflecting bets that a recession is looming and the Federal Reserve will play defense by cutting interest rates.It’s a huge shift from early 2018, when accelerating wage gains spurred financial-market turmoil amid concern the Fed would raise rates more aggressively. With inflation muted and economic growth cooling, those concerns have faded, and the central bank has scrapped expectations for rate hikes this year while it monitors how the U.S. weathers a global slowdown.If payrolls miss expectations, “people are going to say we’ve had two consecutive weak numbers, maybe growth is probably losing some momentum,” said Alex Li, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in New York. That could reignite fears of recession and wipe out this week’s increase in Treasury rates, taking the U.S. 10-year yield back toward its late-March low, Li said.The labor market is set to take a step back this year, as the effects of tax cuts fade, companies find fewer workers and cooling global growth filters into investment decisions. The question now is how quickly and how hard this shift happens, with the March data setting the trend after a February that economists largely discount as an anomaly due to weather and data-collection disruptions.A private report on Wednesday showed U.S. companies in March added the fewest jobs in 18 months, a possible sign of weakening.“The question going into this report more than others in the past is what the underlying pace is: people are talking about a potential recession, concerns and uncertainties, and we haven’t had the normal flow of data so far this year,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, who forecasts a payroll gain of 210,000. “There’s uncertainty about the economy.”What Bloomberg’s Economists SayWhile a confluence of domestic and external factors is depressing the economy’s performance, we expect most of the issues to be temporary and are therefore wary of being overly pessimistic about the overall outlook and job growth.-- Yelena Shulyatyeva, Tim Mahedy and Eliza Winger, economistsClick here for the full weekly preview.Traders and investors will likely treat a weaker-than-forecast payrolls figure as vindication for bets that a recession is closer than thought. Market expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates at least once this year have grown, and in March the gap between 3-month and 10-year rates inverted for the first time since 2007. While such a shift is seen as a harbinger of recession, subsequent moves have since restored the 10-year note’s yield premium.A weak report would also be a major blow to risk appetite, according to Jason Celente, senior fixed income portfolio manager at Insight Investment. It would upend the recent “bad news is good news” sentiment, whereby stocks and credit traders have benefited from weaker data, because it suggested the Fed would ease to maintain overall economic strength. Now, that strength is being questioned.The 10-year rate, which dipped as low as 2.34 percent late last month, is currently 2.51 percent, marginally above the top of the Fed’s target range for overnight cash. Even with the move in Treasuries, stock investors have shown some optimism: the S&P 500 Index has continued to rally this week after capping its best quarterly surge since 2009.One sector seeing mixed prospects is manufacturing. The Institute for Supply Management survey of factories topped estimates in the month, led by a jump in the employment component, but the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute’s report showed the biggest drop in such jobs since 2016. The government’s latest report showed the industry in February added just 4,000 workers, the fewest since 2017.The unemployment rate is expected to remain near a five-decade low Friday as annual wage growth holds at a 3.4 percent pace, which would continue bolstering consumer finances and buoy spending in the second quarter. This time around, such pay gains are unlikely to spur inflation concerns at the Fed, where officials have stressed a message of patience.“What the Fed has said is: ‘We want to see higher wages, so if wages increase, great. We’re going to welcome an increase in wages.’ That’s not going to change their stance of policy, certainly not going to turn them to be more hawkish,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). “The bar has been moved higher for the Fed to react to wages.”"

Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc had been sued by military personnel who survived the attacks, and relatives and estates of those killed.The plaintiffs accused the banks in a 533-page complaint of concealing their work for Iran through such practices as altering wire transfers, and masking the identities of those transferring funds.But the judge found the complaint ""devoid"" of allegations that the banks knew they were enabling attacks in Iraq linked to Hezbollah, al Qaeda and other groups that the U.S. government has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.Swain found no proof, as required under a 2013 decision from the federal appeals court in Manhattan, that the services were a substantial factor in the attacks, and that the plaintiffs' injuries were a reasonably foreseeable consequence.""The complaint does not allege plausibly that the provision of banking services, which are not inherently violent or dangerous, can be considered as acts dangerous to human life,"" Swain wrote.In seeking a dismissal, the banks said attacks on U.S. soldiers, including during the Iraq War, were ""abhorrent,"" but that they committed none of the attacks in question and ""did not support any terrorists.""A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.Iran's Bank Saderat was also named as a defendant. It was declared in default last May because it did not respond to the Nov. 2017 complaint.The case is O'Sullivan et al v Deutsche Bank AG et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 17-08709.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), QNB Capital and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) have been hired to arrange the five- and 10-year notes.The Taiwanese branches of Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are joint bookrunners for the 30-year tranche, which is a Formosa bond - a type of debt security sold in Taiwan by foreign issuers and denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar.Four of the banks leading the deal have Qatari ownership and there was no U.S. or Japanese bank among the bookrunners.International banks with significant business ties to Saudi Arabia have been treading cautiously since the Qatar boycott started in 2017, sidestepping public Qatari deals.A source familiar with the issuance said that the fact that Qatar chose as arrangers the same banks of its previous issuance, in April last year, reflected an extension of existing banking relationships.Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, rated Aa3 by Moody's, and AA-(minus) by S&P and Fitch, does not need to raise financing. It forecasts a budget surplus of 4.3 billion riyals ($1.18 billion) in 2019, partly because of higher oil prices.But improved market conditions, and the recent inclusion of Qatar and other Gulf countries in JPMorgan's emerging-market government bond indexes might have prompted the sovereign to take advantage of global investor demand for Gulf debt.""The timing is right to issue the bond,"" Dergachev said.Also, more than $10 billion in Qatari debt is due next year, so a large debt sale could be used to pre-fund those maturities.""I think it's a little surprising that they are coming to market with a very large issue, given the limited budget financing needs,"" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.""I guess this is in response to GCC index inclusion, and a response to increased demand for the region’s debt.""Last year Qatar raised $12 billion through a similarly structured bond deal, outdoing an $11 billion debt sale by Saudi Arabia.That deal was Qatar's first test of international investor demand after a boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. They severed diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which it denied.Partly thanks to rising energy prices, Qatar has largely overcome the economic impact of the boycott.""Qatar is seen as an improving credit story – they have responded well to the economic blockade, pushing on with structural reforms, diversifying their trade, and improving their resilience,"" Ash said.($1 = 3.6400 Qatar riyals)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sign up here. Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA is drawing up plans to cut jobs at its investment bank and find a partner for its cash-equity business, in a bid to offset increasing cost pressure from regulation, people familiar with the matter said.The bank could cut hundreds or even thousands of jobs at its global banking and investor solutions unit, including roles in support functions such as finance and human resources, one person familiar with the situation said, declining to be identified because the matter is confidential. Management are still weighing up which parts of the business would bear the reductions, they added.Societe Generale declined to comment.SocGen’s GBIS unit has more than 20,000 employees. One of SocGen’s main French labor unions said Feb. 8 that the bank is bracing for “important” cuts to trading jobs. Chief Executive Officer Frederic Oudea has said it’s too soon to comment on any headcount decisions.The Paris-based group is seeking to cut 500 million euros ($567 million) of costs and review less profitable investment-banking activities after a grueling fourth quarter. The organisation said earlier this month that the reductions would focus on some fixed-income and currencies activities.The bank has so far resisted the trend in France to hive off cash equity and research. However, it is now considering options to set up a joint venture, the person said.Finding a partner for the stock brokerage business may take weeks or months, and keeping it within the group would be the default solution, the person said.Several new ventures in equity brokerage could serve as a blueprint. Kepler Cheuvreux SA has partnerships with European banks including  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA to secure distribution of its research. Franco-German banking group Oddo BHF struck a deal with Natixis SA in 2017, which left French equity brokerage and research activities with the former, while the latter took on capital markets.The reshuffles came as the European Union’s MiFID II directive forces brokerages to charge clients separately for research and trading, leaving smaller players under pressure to consolidate."

53,"Jan 16, 2019 06:30AM ET",So Bad It’s Good: Markets See Silver Lining in Brexit Rejection,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story. Prime Minister Theresa May’s record defeat in Parliament over her Brexit divorce deal provoked a curious response from markets: Optimism.The pound edged up on Wednesday and gilts -- a traditional safe-haven investment -- sold off even though the margin of the Prime Minister’s loss was way above the threshold many analysts feared would trigger a panic. The prospect of a no-confidence vote in May later this evening has also failed to disrupt assets amid a general assumption she will prevail.The one soft spot was the FTSE 100 Index of shares -- which tends to fall when the currency performs well.The key to the robust showing from U.K. assets appears to be in the scale of May’s defeat. The deadlock in Parliament is clearer than ever, and a belief is growing among many financial professionals that there’s an increasing chance of a so-called soft-Brexit or even no Brexit at all. Those are outcomes many investors would cheer.“The chances of a no-deal Brexit are so slim now it’s not even really worth considering anymore,” said Greg Gibbs, founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital. “It looks increasingly that the resolution will be an even softer version than May’s proposal and/or a new referendum.”That’s a view shared by a host of analysts polled by Bloomberg, who talked up the pound’s prospects in the wake of the vote. Banks including  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA are among those who expect May to survive the no-confidence vote called by the opposition.Looking deeper into the underbelly of markets offers further evidence of a pickup in confidence among traders. The cost of insuring U.K. banks’ subordinated debt fell, while volatility on pound options has slumped.Mayank Mishra, a global macro and FX currency strategist with Standard Chartered in Singapore, reckons the pound will be broadly supported as the market assigns a high chance the government will survive the confidence vote -- and a low prospect of a disorderly Brexit.There’s another factor in the remarkable resilience of markets to the vote. A lot of bad news has already been priced into U.K. assets, so the bar for a nasty shock is high.“Going into the vote there was a heavy consensus that the government would suffer an even heavier defeat,” said Christopher Jeffery at Legal & General Investment Management. Hence the “market reaction has been relatively muted,” he said.Of course, not everyone sees the glass as half full. One undeniable outcome of the defeat of May’s deal, regardless of the confidence vote later, is further delay to the Brexit process and yet more uncertainty for traders. Dean Turner of UBS Global Wealth Management is among those recommending caution.“U.K. assets will continue to be vulnerable to the political volatility and we don’t expect this will subside until a concrete conclusion emerges,” the economist said. “We do not advocate investors take directional views on sterling, gilts or U.K. stocks while this clarity void remains so large.”Fidelity International Leigh Himsworth is similarly wary. He’s reminding investors that a no-deal Brexit remains the default option, and that the mechanics of any other possibilities are difficult. He recommends investing in liquid assets and hedging against the various outcomes.The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.2858 as of 10:45 a.m. in London. The FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.4 percent, and the yield on 10-year gilts rose eight basis points to 1.334 percent.May lost the vote on approving her Brexit deal by 432 to 202.“This outcome is so dire for Brexit that the chances of a softer Brexit or even a second referendum may have risen,” said Stephen Jen, chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital, who estimates the currency’s fair value is between $1.50 and $1.55. The pound is “so weak and so cheap -- it is so undervalued,” he said."

While May is expected to survive a vote of no confidence called by the opposition party later Wednesday, uncertainty over how she will pull together a new deal has spurred risk aversion.“Tuesday night’s vote may have increased the chances of a second referendum but it also increased the chances of a no deal Brexit –- both tails are now a bit fatter and GBP volatility has risen accordingly,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.The pound has lost around 13 percent against the dollar since the day before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 amid fears that the departure would hurt the country’s economy.

A Reuters survey of up to 53 analysts saw median predictions for the Aussie at $0.7100  on a one-month horizon, from $0.7285 in the previous poll and current levels of $0.7140.Analysts also marginally lowered their projections for 3 and 6 months to $0.7200 from $0.7300 earlier. They see the Aussie at $0.7400 by December, compared with previous expectations of $0.7500.An indication of the uncertainties playing on investors' mind is the broad range of forecasts, from as low as $0.6600 to as high as $0.8200 on a 12-month horizon. The survey comes amid renewed downward pressure on the Australian currency, which shed nearly 10 percent in 2018, and hit a near-decade low of $0.6715 last week, driven by a computer-led ""flash crash"".The trade-exposed currency has been used by investors to wager on, or hedge against, tensions in emerging markets and the risks to the Chinese economy from U.S. tariffs.EYES ON TRACK TALKSAnalysts say a resolution in the trade dispute would boost the Aussie. ""The single most important event risk for all things AUD in coming weeks is the fate of U.S. and China trade talks,"" said Ray Attrill, currency strategist at National Australia Bank. ""These need to yield agreement to a reasonably comprehensive deal as a minimum prerequisite for a recovery in global risk asset sentiment and a stronger AUD,"" he added.""We have lately become much more hopeful of this being realized, given that both sides now have big incentives to strike a deal.""A run of disappointing data and recent falls in stock markets in the United States and China have led some investors to believe the two nations will come to a resolution. Hopes have been boosted by the extension of current trade talks in Beijing into an unscheduled third day on Wednesday.Also, underwhelming economic data at home has led investors to start pricing in a small chance of a rate cut by mid-2020 even though the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has repeatedly stated the next move in rates would be up.Given slowing global growth, financial stress and trade tension, ""it seems unlikely that the A$ should trade much above the midpoint of our fair value range i.e. much above 0.73,"" Westpac strategist Robert Rennie said in a note on Wednesday.Westpac's forecasts of some tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2019, no change in the RBA's policy and weaker commodity prices ""point to the lower end of the fair value range dropping below 0.70 through 2019.""Only a handful of poll participants joined Westpac in forecasting a fall under $0.7000. ANZ sees the Aussie at $0.6800 in three months and $0.6700 in six.

They see the currency stuck at $0.6700 in one, three and six months' time, according to the median of up to 46 forecasts.To be sure, some analysts see substantial downside risks. For six months ahead, forecasts stretch as low as $0.6000.The kiwi stumbled in 2018, shedding more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar, although better-than-expected domestic data has helped cap losses.

While the dollar was relatively stable going into the end of 2018, a flagging equity market boom, waning cash repatriation by U.S. companies, and the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates as many times as it previously signaled now pose challenges for the greenback. In a cautious start to the year, traders punished perceived riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar and the euro, while boosting the yen to a fresh seven-month high versus the dollar.Against the yen, which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation, the dollar was 0.36 percent lower.(GRAPHIC: Japanese yen trade weighted valuations - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RqES8L) China's factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continued to weaken, a private survey showed.The Australian dollar , whose fortunes largely depend on the Chinese economy to which Australia sends a bulk of its commodities, fell 0.8 percent.""The data out of China that contributed to the general concern of slowing global growth and this risk-off tone has been helping the Japanese yen display this outperform today,"" said Viloria.The yen also found support from continued worries about an extended U.S. government shutdown, he said.President Donald Trump said his homeland security officials will make a plea to congressional leaders for a border wall on Wednesday and indicated he would not drop his demand for $5 billion in wall funding that triggered a partial government shutdown now in its 12th day.Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond hit an 11-month low on Wednesday, further supporting the Japanese yen.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deutsche Bank said it has cooperated with the commission and doesn’t expect a fine. Credit Suisse also said it’s assisting the EU’s antitrust arm. Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA and its investment banking arm confirmed in a statement to French radio Europe1 that they received a statement of objections from the commission. The bank also said it will review the EU complaint and reply.While the EU’s powerful antitrust arm often lags far behind financial authorities in the U.S. and the U.K. in punishing collusion between traders, its fines can sting. The EU issued their first penalties initially worth about $2 billion in Libor and Euribor cases as part of a multi-bank settlement in 2016. The commission is also wrapping up a probe into currency-market manipulation.FCA ProbeTraders working at banks including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., Credit Suisse and Nomura Holdings were investigated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority over possible agency-bond manipulation, people said last year. That probe was closed without charges.Nomura said Thursday it wasn’t one of the four banks that received EU statement of objections. Bank of America spokeswoman Victoria Garrod declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Credit Agricole didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Deutsche Bank “proactively cooperated with the European Commission in this matter and does not expect a financial penalty,” it said in an emailed statement. It couldn’t comment further “as this is an ongoing investigation.”Credit Suisse also said it’s cooperating with the EU probe into ""past conduct."" The bank doesn’t believe its employees engaged in anti-competitive conduct and hopes to dispel the EU’s concerns, which relate only to trading by a single former employee who left the bank in early 2016.World BankThe cartel may have distorted competition in secondary market trading in Europe, the EU said. It started looking at agency-bond trading in 2015 following the opening of a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into the market. Deutsche Bank was among five banks sued by a pension fund over claims that traders conspired to manipulate trading agency bonds issued by government entities and institutions like the World Bank, harming investors who bought and sold the securities.The SSA market is generally defined to include international development organizations, government-sponsored entities and some sovereign debt. Depending on the securities that are included, the market could range from $9 trillion to $15 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds generally have high credit ratings because of explicit or implicit guarantees they carry.Companies that blow the whistle on a cartel and hand over valuable evidence to help regulators often receive immunity from fines. Their immunity can be taken away if they disclose detail about the probe. Other firms can get reductions for aiding an investigation.Getting a statement of objections from the EU is usually a precursor to potential fines. Companies can seek to argue their defense in writing or at an oral hearing but it is rare for the EU to drop a case or avoid levying fines for cartel behavior after it sends the formal complaint."

[nL8N1Y607C]Problem loans are normally sold at a loss, which depletes a bank's capital reserves. A source involved the bidding process told Reuters last month Banco BPM's bad loans were being valued at a fifth of their gross book value.Banco BPM's latest efforts to clean up its balance sheet had run into difficulties due to a sharp rise in state borrowing costs under the country's eurosceptic government, which has made foreign investors nervous and hit the value of banks' sovereign bond holdings.Like other Italian banks, Banco BPM had seen its core capital eroded by the falling value of its domestic government bond holdings in the three months through June.This has added to pressure on Banco BPM's shares, which trade at an almost 70 percent discount to its assets.However, the bank managed to bolster its capital levels in the third quarter with an asset sale and accounting changes.[nFWN1XI11M]It gained a further capital benefit by selling part of its ProFamily consumer financing business to the Agos consumer credit joint-venture it has in place with Credit Agricole for 310 million euros ($352.66 million).Created last year from the merger of Banca Popolare di Milano and  Banco Popolare  , Banco BPM has already offloaded 11.5 billion euros in bad loans since the end of 2016.($1 = 0.8790 euros)"

The move comes as JP Morgan shifts dozens of bankers to Paris to adapt to Brexit. Petno's prospect list was two years in the making and built by those responsible for JP Morgan's affairs in each country.While it will take time to win clients and recruit staff, Petno is convinced that JP Morgan can build a sustainable business in Europe similar to its commercial bank in the United States, which last year produced $8.6 billion of revenue.MARKET SHARE Petno declined to reveal his goals, but JP Morgan's expansion comes as corporate lending is a rare bright spot for Europe's banks amid rock-bottom interest rates and weak growth.In the first half of this year, the four top investment banks in continental Europe ranked by the size of the deals they have advised on are U.S. banks, data from Refinitiv shows.A combination of price cuts, product range and additional marketing have won JP Morgan market share in European capital markets, U.S. credit cards, commercial lending, asset management and securities services in recent years.But Francois-Xavier Deucher, Fitch Ratings' director for Financial Institutions in Paris, said it won't be easy for a bank without a dense branch network to make headway in Europe.""The profitable part of the business lies in services like cash management, rates or forex hedging, advisory, insurance or employee savings plans,"" Deucher said.""On export financing and on support on international markets, JP Morgan could have a competitive advantage,"" he said.With $2.6 trillion in assets, about a quarter of which are outside North America, JPMorgan's balance sheet is much larger than Europe's biggest banks.

This will provide a capital boost to offset the hit from the large disposal of bad loans below book value. To reap a further capital benefit, Banco BPM said it was also selling part of its debt recovery unit.The lender said it was continuing negotiations with all three groups of bidders for the bad loans and had given its CEO a mandate to reach a deal.Banco BPM said it had extended its partnership with Credit Agricole for the next 15 years and the two groups will consider a possible stock market leasing of their joint consumer credit business at some point in the next two years.Banco BPM said it had an option to reduce its stake in the joint venture but was unlikely to exercise it.Nomura International advised Banco BPM over the consumer credit deal.

67,"Nov 23, 2018 10:35AM ET",French banks scale back plans for post-Brexit staff moves,nan,"By Inti LandauroPARIS (Reuters) - French banks may end up relocating significantly fewer staff than originally expected from London to mainland Europe after Brexit, banking officials said on Friday.Sector analysts had forecast that France's three biggest banks -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) - might relocate more than 500 staff combined from London to continental Europe, mostly to Paris, because of regulatory changes brought about by Brexit.But even though the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union remain unclear, the final numbers to be moved are likely to be significantly lower. French banks say they have enough staff on the continent to handle operations and won't need to shift so many of them from London. At the same time, the banks say they will keep a strong presence in London since it will remain a major finance center. Credit Agricole's investment banking unit has fine-tuned its projection, saying around 20 personnel will move after originally estimating 10 to 100, a bank official said.The official said the impact on the bank's corporate and investment banking (CIB) activities in London would be ""very limited"" as the bank has a significant CIB presence in the EU through its head office in Montrouge, near Paris. The teams in London would continue to care for the bank's clients in the City and elsewhere outside the European Union. The bank's investment banking operation in London has 735 employees. BNP Paribas, France's largest listed bank, has estimated that fewer than 90 of its UK-based bank staff will be affected. A number of them, mostly dealing with sales, will have to relocate to mainland Europe, a BNP Paribas official said.Sources close to the bank, which employs more than 7,000 people in London, said last year that it might have to transfer as many as 300 jobs.The third largest bank, Societe Generale, has said Brexit might lead to the relocation or hiring of up to 300 people outside London, most of them in Paris.A union representative said that while the bank had not detailed its plans, it does not seem inclined to move whole teams or departments. ""If they were to relocate entire teams they would have started talking to the unions,"" he said.Earlier this year Paris Europlace, a financial lobbying group, estimated 3,000 financial services jobs would relocate to Paris from London due to Brexit. In recent months several non-European banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America (N:BAC), have said they will set up or expand offices in Paris or elsewhere in Europe to go on servicing EU clients. Private equity funds and asset management firms are also relocating staff outside Britain.Not all jobs will be shifted to Paris - several financial companies have chosen Dublin, Frankfurt or Luxembourg as their future operating base in Europe.""There won't be a single city for the whole continent but rather an integrated, polycentric network of financial hubs each focused on specific expertise,"" François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the French central bank, said on Friday.All three major French banks have said they may send some of their relocated staff to French cities other than Paris.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Prime Minister Theresa May will hold a Cabinet meeting Wednesday to discuss a draft Brexit agreement, and a summit with the EU could occur as soon as Nov. 25. Gilts declined as conviction grew that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next year.The currency bounced in response to a “breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations,” said Valentin Marinov, head of FX research at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “What remains to be seen is whether the U.K. Cabinet will agree to the proposed text.”The pound rose as much as 1.5 percent to $1.3047 before paring gains, and reached 86.56 pence per euro, the strongest level since April 18.

In money markets, short-sterling implied yields climbed, a sign traders may be raising bets on rate increases by the central bank, should a Brexit deal be concluded.Even if the Cabinet signs off, the agreement would need approval from parliament, where May faces a stiff challenge.

If that scenario plays out, the pound-dollar rate could near $1.34 in six months and $1.40 in a year, they said.“We see potential for a rally (around 1%) in the pound once a withdrawal deal is finalized by the EU and U.K. and then another, larger, rally (perhaps 2-3%) once that deal is ratified by parliament,” they wrote, referring to that base-case scenario. “The period between the initial deal being reached and the subsequent ratification by parliament will likely be marked by ongoing volatility and uncertainty, which could see the pound retrench.”In the case of a “no-deal” Brexit outcome, Nelson and Kinnaman see the pound falling nearly 8 percent against the dollar and 6 percent against the euro.May doesn’t have a majority in parliament and faces opposition from Labour Party lawmakers. She also has to appease some of the hard line Brexiteers within her Conservative party.Some were quick to criticize the deal. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson said the deal, as reported, would be voted down, and pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Cabinet shouldn’t support the pact. Boris Johnson also said he’d vote against the deal, though acknowledged that neither side wants a no-deal outcome.Earlier Tuesday, Irish broadcaster RTE cited an unidentified senior official as saying that the key part of the Withdrawal Agreement had been agreed. Still, the official said it would be wrong to say that negotiations were concluded. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar declined to comment on the report. The Telegraph newspaper also reported that the two sides had agreed on the text of a divorce deal.(Adds additional comments from Wells Fargo.)"
70,"Nov 12, 2018 08:23AM ET","'King dollar' reigns supreme in world of slowing growth, European risks",nan,"By Sujata RaoLONDON (Reuters) - The dollar surged to nearly 17-month highs on Monday against a basket of major currencies as investors sought out the liquid and high-yielding asset against a backdrop of global growth worries and rising political risk in Italy and Britain.World stocks fell 0.3 percent for a third straight day in the red, receiving no respite from a rise in oil prices, while initial European equity gains fizzled amid growing fears for Italian lender Carige whose shares were suspended after reports of a capital hole. While Shanghai was lifted one percent by regulators' promise to simplify share buybacks, Asian markets broadly weakened following Friday's weak Wall Street close. New York trade will likely be thinned by the Veterans Day holiday and futures indicated the S&P500 and Dow Jones flat to lower but Nasdaq futures are marginally.Investors are fretting about signs of slowing growth worldwide but especially in China where e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) was the latest to raise alarm bells, with the slowest ever annual sales growth during its Singles Day shopping event.Many also reckon that U.S. President Donald Trump could turn up the heat over trade, further damaging China's economy.All that, coupled with European political risks, conspired to push the dollar 0.5 percent higher against a basket of currencies by 1230 GMT. ""King dollar has staged a return,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), said, adding that investors had piled back into the dollar after last week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting confirmed a rate-tightening path.""Euro and pound are both hurt by political risk and that is aggravating underperformance versus the dollar,"" Marinov said.Sterling lost more than one percent at one point, holding near a 10-day low hit earlier, while the euro, comprising more than 50 percent of the dollar index, fell 0.7 percent to its lowest since July 2017.British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy came under attack from all sides, increasing the risk that her plan for leaving the European Union will be voted down by parliament, thrusting the United Kingdom toward a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit.The opposition Labour Party said that if May's Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, it would push for a national election and possibly also another referendum.Latest futures data showed net short sterling positions registered their biggest weekly rise in 1-1/2 months Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts, however, predicted more pain, telling clients: ""not enough risk is priced into sterling given the parliamentary problems ahead"".In the euro zone, Italy faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU, but its refusal so far to cut the draft deficit sets the stage for a collision with Brussels.Markets were also spooked by reports that Banca Carige would need around 400 million euros ($451 million) to plug a hole in its capital base and Italy's deposit protection fund could fill only part of it.That raises the specter of a banking crisis in the euro zone's third-biggest economy, lifting Italy's bond yield spread over Germany - the risk premium attached to Italian assets - back above the psychologically key 300 basis-point mark. Italian bank shares fell 1.2 percent. Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management, predicted the euro would tumble below $1.10 from the current $1.126 ""as renewed eurozone and Brexit angst and a diverging economic outlook with a strong U.S. economy versus a weakening eurozone economy will trigger further euro selling pressure.""All of this has been good news for dollar bulls, who have benefited from safe-haven flows. Speculators' net long dollar positions rose last week to the highest since January 2016, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, show.The other big move was in commodities, where Saudi Arabia's energy minister jolted Brent crude futures around 2 percent higher with comments that Riyadh could reduce supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent.Brent is trading around $71.4 per dollar, off seven-month lows touched last week. But slowing world growth could make supply cuts a temporary solution to falling oil prices. Two of the world's biggest economies - Germany and Japan - are expected to report a contraction in output in coming days.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"Nov 11, 2018 06:50PM ET",Even Dollar Bears Are Wary of Betting Against Greenback Just Yet,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Dollar bears may want to hibernate this winter.Although many currency strategists see the greenback resuming its downtrend in 2019, some are advising investors to keep their powder dry for now. The Bloomberg dollar index climbed as much as 0.4 percent Friday and was close to the more than 17-month high reached at the end of October. The greenback was helped by a decline in U.S. stocks and signals from the Federal Reserve that it doesn’t plan to budge from its tightening path.It suggests the “king dollar” trend may have room to run, Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), said in an interview. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates into 2019, the U.S. currency may remain strong well into the first quarter.“You may see a gradual grind higher, even though it will fall well short of the lofty highs of late 2016, early 2017,” he said about the greenback. He emphasized that it will do best against currencies with more exposure to China, such as Australia’s and New Zealand’s, but warned “the dollar is close to peaking, and the longer-term risks 6 to 12 months out seem to be on the downside.”Kit Juckes, global fixed-income strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), also doubts the dollar’s good vibes are drying up. Between the U.S. economy still running hot, a tightening labor market and a Fed that’s “unlikely to give any hint that they are approaching peak rates for several quarters,” dollar bears have plenty of hurdles to clear, Juckes said in a Nov. 8 note.The currency is overvalued and market is positioned long, which suggests a correction is likely in 2019, Juckes wrote. In the meantime, however, he is “wary of jumping the gun.”Ben Randol, senior director of currency strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), expects the dollar will weaken next year as U.S. economic growth cools, he said in an interview. But it may find support from Brexit difficulties, the threat of deeper Italian fiscal crisis and U.S.-China trade tensions.“Timing is very difficult,” Randol said “Given the risks, it can be a challenge to have conviction high enough to short the dollar.”Turning PointThe turning point may arrive near the end of the first quarter when political risk bubbles up again around U.S. government spending, Credit Agricole’s Marinov said. Plus, the U.S. midterm election results may stymie additional fiscal stimulus measures. A pause in Fed rate hikes some time around the middle of 2019 and the start of rate increases in Europe could also factor in.“We think that growth will moderate, especially given that the prospects for further aggressive fiscal stimulus may wane now that political gridlock has returned to Washington D.C. and the global growth headwinds have intensified,” he said.By the end of next year, the euro could be back above $1.26 from around $1.13 at the end of last week, while the dollar-yen rate, which was close to 114, could be below 104, he said. That could see the dollar index return to levels last seen in late 2017 and early 2018, according to Marinov."

Long-time sterling bull Nomura International Plc switched to a neutral stance Monday, recommending a flat position amid reports of mounting opposition to May from within her own party.While sterling gained Tuesday on optimism the European Union is preparing to offer a solution for the Irish border issue, political risk could yet set the currency back, according to  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA and Nomura. The prospect of a leadership threat has reappeared on traders’ radar since the weekend press reported that the number of lawmakers rallying against May was approaching the number required to officially mount a challenge.“Any indication that political risks are on the rise in Westminster could fuel fears about a ‘no-deal’ Brexit and sink the pound,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Credit Agricole. “While we still hope for a last-minute Brexit deal, we maintain a rather cautious stance on the pound for now.”The pound slid 0.6 percent last week as a key EU summit failed to yield much progress on Brexit.

79,"Oct 09, 2018 03:30PM ET",New South African Finance Minister Faces Same Old Problems,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Nine years after leaving his post as governor of South Africa’s central bank, Tito Mboweni is has been appointed as the nation’s finance minister and faces the unenviable task of reviving an economy that’s mired in recession. He’ll have limited room to maneuver.With government debt at already dangerously high levels and the country at risk of losing its sole remaining investment-grade credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, Mboweni will have little option but to stick to the National Treasury’s expenditure ceilings and deficit-reduction targets. His ability to stimulate growth through increased spending or tax breaks will also be curtailed.Mboweni, 59, succeeds Nhlanhla Nene, who was named finance chief by President Cyril Ramaphosa in February and resigned on Tuesday after lying about his meetings with three businessmen who were implicated in the looting of state funds. Nene’s predecessor, Malusi Gigaba, had raised taxes and cut spending in the February budget, warning that the state’s coffers were bare.“This shouldn’t really have much impact on the market or lead to any detrimental change to policy,” Natalie Rivett, senior emerging-markets analyst at Informa Global Markets, said by phone from London.Mboweni, who went into exile during apartheid, trained as an economist and served for four years as labor minister in former President Nelson Mandela’s cabinet after apartheid ended in 1994. He oversaw the implementation of a raft of new laws to protect worker rights -- a regime that a number of analysts say has fueled a 27 percent unemployment rate.Inflation TargetingDuring his decade-long tenure as central bank governor, Mboweni established a reputation as a monetary-policy conservative -- he was a fierce defender of inflation targeting, which was introduced the year after he took office, and raised the repurchase rate to 13.5 percent in 2002 to control price growth and boost the rand.After leaving the bank in 2009, Mboweni went into business, establishing his own investment company and serving on a number of company boards including as the chairman of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.. He remained active in politics, and was elected to the ruling African National Congress’s decision-making national executive committee at a party congress in December.“Mboweni possesses the necessary integrity, skills set and experience which can generate confidence in the markets, among investors and generally in the business community,” said Raymond Parsons, a professor at the North West University’s School of Business and Governance. His appointment “will help to ensure stability and consistency in policy direction,” especially with the mid-term budget due to be released on Oct. 24, he said.While Mboweni is South Africa’s fifth finance minister less than three years, the financial markets welcomed his appointment and the rand erased losses and advanced as much as 1.4 percent against the dollar on Tuesday. Government bonds and banking stocks also gained.Contradicting StatementsNene’s resignation came the week after he admitted to an anti-graft inquiry that he met members of the Gupta family at their home six times, contradicting statements in a 2016 interview that he only encountered them at public events. The three Gupta brothers, who are allies of former President Jacob Zuma, were implicated by the former anti-graft ombudsman in influencing government appointments and the award of state contracts -- allegations they and Zuma deny.Nene is not the only minister in Ramaphosa’s cabinet over whom a cloud hangs. Gigaba and Bathabile Dlamini, who head the home affairs and women’s affairs portfolios respectively, have been ruled to have perjured themselves in court cases.The ANC forced Zuma to quit as president in February after almost nine years in office, clearing the way for his 65-year-old deputy and party leader Ramaphosa to take over. Ramaphosa has said combating graft is one of his top priorities, and he’s replaced a number of other officials implicated in wrongdoing.While Mboweni has a good reputation, doubts will continue to linger over Ramaphosa’s ability to clean up after Zuma’s scandal-marred tenure, according to Guillaume Tresca, a senior emerging markets strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB from Montrouge, France.“The Nene case shows how it is difficult for Ramaphosa to change the country,” Tresca said. “Foreign investors, after a well-managed political transition, have been disappointed and the links between the Guptas and Nene shows it is difficult to erase the past.”"

82,"Oct 05, 2018 11:24AM ET",America First is hurting China's business,nan,"By Jonathan CableLONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy has pulled ahead this year, extending a lengthy expansion with help from President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda and massive tax cuts, but upcoming data could illuminate the impact of his policies on global peers.Trump is determined to rewrite global trade deals, particularly with China, the world's second-biggest economy behind the United States. He has slapped tariffs on more than half of over $500 billion in Chinese imports, for which China has retaliated.Plans for new trade talks collapsed recently and both sides appear to be digging in for a long fight. That has cast a darker shadow over the outlook for the global economy, already showing signs of strain from a rampant U.S. dollar that has sent emerging market currencies into retreat.All 70 economists who answered an additional question in a Sept. 12-19 Reuters poll said the trade conflict between the world's top two economies is bad for U.S. growth. They were also unanimous in saying the U.S.-China trade war threatened the outlook for the euro zone. [ECILT/US] [ECILT/EU]Economic data in the coming week may give more solid evidence as to how China is faring.""One eye will also be on China next week as markets attempt to assess the latest economic data for signs of any impact from trade disagreements with the U.S.,"" said Ryan Djajasaputra at Investec.The calendar consists of purchasing managers' (PMI) surveys of services firms alongside trade and credit releases.China's economic growth has been slowing and September data due on Oct. 12 is expected to show dollar-denominated exports rose 9.1 percent, slower than August's 9.8 percent increase, according to a preliminary Reuters poll.On the same day, Beijing will publish its trade balance, including the politically sensitive surplus it has with the United States. The number could push Trump to turn up the heat on China if he thinks he is not winning the trade war.""It seems likely that a U.S.–China trade war will result in nearly all Chinese imports into the U.S. facing 25 percent tariffs next year, with U.S. exports to China also subject to higher tariffs,"" economists at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) told clients.That could add to inflationary pressures, particularly in the United States, and so has implications for Federal Reserve policy.The Fed raised interest rates late last month, its third rate hike this year, and is expected to follow that up with another increase before the end of December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to 2.25-2.50 percent.Medians in a Reuters poll showed only two hikes next year compared to three increases based on the Fed's own dot plots, but economists could be swayed into agreeing with the Fed if tariffs drive up inflation.Rather than tightening, China is supporting its own economy with stimulus measures -- including monetary, credit, fiscal and regulatory policy easing.Policymakers have sought to bring financing costs down, boost lending to smaller businesses, cut taxes and fast-tracked more infrastructure projects. The central bank has cut banks' reserve requirement ratios three times this year to pump in liquidity.""We expect fiscal policy to remain supportive. Monetary policy should also remain accommodative,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economists told clients.Growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September as both external and domestic demand weakened, Sept. 30 surveys showed, raising the pressure on policymakers as tariffs appear to be inflicting a heavier toll on the economy.STALEMATE OVER CHEQUERS?It is a quiet week for U.S. data releases but Britain, deeply exposed to the global economy, will publish economic growth figures for August on Wednesday.They are likely to show the pace of expansion slowed to 0.1 percent from July's 0.3 percent as uncertainty over Brexit also weighs.Britain is due to leave the European Union in March next year and divorce talks -- which appeared to be at stalemate -- are expected to step up again ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Oct. 18.Prime Minister Theresa May has so far shown little sign of shifting away from her ""Chequers plan"" -- named after her country residence -- to keep close ties with the EU, amid criticism at home and in Brussels.But the EU's Brexit negotiators see a divorce deal with Britain as ""very close"", diplomatic sources said, a signal that a compromise might be in the making on the most contentious issue of the future Irish border.""We still think a fudge can be found that avoids the 'no deal' scenario, but we're unlikely to know for sure until 2019,"" said ING economists.""This only promises more uncertainty in the short-run."""

86,"Oct 02, 2018 09:20AM ET",Italy Contagion Fears Bubbling Beneath Surface of Apparent Calm,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest collision between Italy’s markets and politics is beginning to fuel concern that shock waves could spread to elsewhere in Europe.As Italian bond yields climbed toward multi-year highs, the euro extended losses and the region’s equities slumped, while haven assets such as German bunds and the Swiss franc rallied.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned that the risk of a wider impact of the Italian turmoil has increased, even as markets in Spain and Portugal -- seen as a key barometer for any debt contagion to Europe’s periphery -- have so far shown little sign of anxiety.Budget official Claudio Borghi’s comments that the common currency is “not sufficient” to solve the country’s fiscal problems have rekindled worries that a breakup of the world’s largest trade bloc is still a possibility. He later denied that the country’s populist government had any plans to leave the euro.“European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Alessio Rizzi wrote in a research note. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen.”Markets were firmly in risk-off mode Tuesday, with demand rising for popular risk hedges. Italy’s two-year bonds took the brunt of the selling pressure, flattening the country’s yield curve. The cost of protection against a potential credit default by the nation rose and traders priced in a greater premium for three-month money-market borrowings over overnight loans.Euro, YieldsThe euro dropped by as much as 0.6 percent Tuesday to $1.1505, a six-week low. Italian 10-year yields climbed 14 basis points to 3.44 percent, re-testing a May 29 peak that was a four-year high. The spread over those on their German peers breached 300 basis points for the second time this year.Still, there’s little sign yet of a contagion effect across peripheral euro-area bonds. Ten-year yields in Spain and Portugal were little changed at 1.53 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively. Similar rates in Greece climbed nine basis points to 4.31 percent.The yield premium investors demand on benchmark Italian bonds over Spain has hit a seven-year high and is climbing toward a record 202 basis points reached in 2011. Strategists at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA including Jaime Costero expect the spread to widen further, as Spanish debt retains its appeal amid little spillover impact from Italy’s market volatility.“Political developments in Italy are still center-stage and will probably continue to remain the most critical driver for the euro for the time being,” analysts at UniCredit SpA wrote in a note. “Still, contained contagion in the bond markets implies that the budget talks are still perceived as a “local” issue. The market behavior suggests to us that the Italian developments are likely to just add “noise” to the common currency at the moment, but are not seen as grave enough to trigger a heavy sell-off.”‘Fade the Pop’Strategists at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA led by Valentin Marinov remain bullish on the euro as they see most of the Italy-related negativity already priced in, and with continued support from the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy normalization. Even as Italy’s bonds and stocks saw increased volatility in recent months as the country’s Five Star Movement-League coalition drew up their deficit targets, the shared currency had been relatively resilient.The Italian economy’s underlying strength may mean it’s time to ease out of risk-off hedges despite political risks, according to Mizuho International Plc.“The protection trades are ramping up,” head of European rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. But “this is a great opportunity for investors to fade the pop in some structures. Most obvious, to us, is to fade the rally in German bonds outright, as we do not think this flare-up between Italy and the EU will drag on the euro-area economy.”‘Sore Point’For others, Italy’s euroskeptic government is just the embodiment of the the populist sentiment taking root across Europe, which could threaten the bloc’s future and weigh on the euro for the months or even years to come.Borghi, head of Italy’s lower house budget committee and a well-known euroskeptic, said in an interview on Radio Anch’io that “Italy, with its own currency, would be able to resolve its problems.”“The comments about Italy having its own currency have touched a sore point,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank International. “While the return of the lira would be almost impossible and hugely inflationary even if it could happen, the fact that the remarks can be read as anti-EMU sentiment are worrisome.”"

The dollar index drifted 0.1 percent (DXY) higher to 94.02 as investors consolidated positions before the weekend, but the greenback was set for its biggest weekly drop since February.A sell-off in the dollar that began in the late European session on Thursday gathered steam overnight as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-rise cycle after an expected increase next week.Market expectations are for approximately two increases to U.S. interest next year and Russell Investments said that medium-term recession risks in the U.S. economy are now elevated, pointing to a number of indicators such as a tightening labor market.""The weakness in the dollar is prompting investors to unwind their short bets against other currencies such as the euro, and this move may have further room to run,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.The dollar's bounce pushed the single currency (EUR=EBS) back into the red at $1.1768, taking its gains for the week to nearly 1.5 percent.Amid a bounce in currencies such as the Turkish lira and South African rand, ravaged earlier in the month by trade friction and domestic factors, MSCI's emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) climbed 0.4 percent to its highest since late August.The Australian dollar, a proxy of China-related trades as well as a gauge of risk sentiment, climbed to a three-week high of $0.7297 .

91,"Sep 21, 2018 12:16AM ET",Japan inflation ticks up but BOJ's target still out of reach,nan,"(Changes 'non-discretionary spending' to discretionary in paragraph 11, corrects typo)By Leika KiharaTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation ticked up slightly in August but remained distant from the central bank's 2 percent target, suggesting that monetary policy will stay ultra-loose for the time being.The proportion of items in the inflation gauge that rose in price last month hit its lowest in nearly five years, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in wiping out the country's entrenched deflationary mindset.Soft inflation could pose a challenge for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to put a sustained end to deflation as he heads into a third term, though he has recently distanced himself from the central bank's elusive target.""Inflation will hover around current levels until early next year but probably won't accelerate well above 1 percent, dashing the BOJ's hopes,"" said Daiwa Securities Chief Market Economist Mari Iwashita.""Abe's recent remarks suggest the government is no longer insisting that the BOJ's price target be met.""The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in August from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast and accelerating slightly from a 0.8 percent gain in July.The so-called core-core index, a more closely watched gauge the BOJ uses to strip away the effect of both energy and fresh food costs, was up 0.4 percent in August after rising 0.3 percent in July, government data showed on Friday.Stubbornly soft inflation has dashed the BOJ's hopes that solid economic growth will translate into higher prices, and could delay the central bank's exit from ultra-easy policy.Of the items composing core CPI, 49.3 percent saw prices rise in August from a year earlier, slipping to the lowest level since November 2013, the data showed.Prices of goods ranging from processed food to medicines were starting to fall again, a government official briefing reporters on the data said, suggesting that weak consumption was sapping firms' pricing power.A spike in the prices of vegetables and other fresh foods, blamed on heavy rain in June and July, may prevent households from boosting discretionary spending, some analysts say.Overall consumer prices, which include fresh food costs, jumped 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier, accelerating from 0.9 percent in July.""Core consumer inflation will probably peak around September or October,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Securities. ""We expect the BOJ to maintain interest rates at current levels until 2020.""Subdued wage and price growth has forced the BOJ to maintain its massive stimulus despite some side effects, notably the hit to bank profits from prolonged near-zero interest rates.The BOJ kept monetary policy steady on Wednesday and its governor stressed that the bank won't pull the plug on monetary easing until inflation hits its elusive target.Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in the first three months of this year thanks to robust business spending.But escalating trade frictions and a series of natural disasters that disrupted supply chains cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in September but business confidence fell to the lowest in nearly two years amid global trade tensions, a private survey showed on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

92,"Sep 20, 2018 09:05AM ET","Seeking to restore confidence, Turkey slashes growth forecasts",nan,"By Ezgi Erkoyun and David DolanANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey sharply cut its growth forecasts for this year and next on Thursday, but disappointed investors who had hoped for a plan to help banks and a deeper reduction in the estimates to reflect the fragile state of the economy.Turkey has seen its lira currency plunge by 40 percent this year on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a bitter diplomatic rift with the United States. The turbulence has shaken global financial markets and raised the prospect of a potential banking crisis at home.Markets had been hoping that Finance Minister Berat Albayrak's medium-term programme announced on Thursday would signal a clear break from the emphasis on credit-fuelled growth that has characterised Turkey's rapid expansion over the last decade and a half under Erdogan's rule.Albayrak said growth would be 3.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019, both revised down from forecasts of 5.5 percent. He also did not deliver the big plans for the banking industry that some analysts had been hoping for, particularly, the creation of a ""bad bank"" vehicle to take over non-performing loans.Following the presentation, the chairman of Turkey's BDDK banking watchdog said there would not be a transfer of problem loans to another institution.""At the moment, the programme is a disappointment. First, when you look at the growth forecast, the current account deficit forecast, they are too ambitious,"" said Guillaume Tresca, a senior EM strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""We don't have anything new, regarding a bad bank, regarding the treatment of (non-performing loans), regarding the foreign-exchange funding of the banking system or the foreign-exchange funding of the corporates. It is lacking details and it is lacking news.""The lira  weakened to 6.3100 by 1219 GMT, from around 6.20 beforehand and a close of 6.2541 on Wednesday. The currency has now erased almost all the gains made since the central bank's mammoth interest rate hike of 6.25 percentage points last week, underscoring the difficulty policymakers face in putting a floor under the lira and restoring confidence.Sources told Reuters on Wednesday there was a debate among top government officials about the extent of the growth revisions, highlighting the delicate balance between Erdogan's long-standing drive for economic expansion and investors' calls for greater austerity.""STRONG AND WEAK POINTS""Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, had previously promised ""realistic macro targets"" and ""right action plans"".""We will see a gradual growth increase from now on. Our main goal is to establish 5 percent growth from 2021 onwards,"" Albayrak told Thursday's presentation in Istanbul. He did not take questions. ""We will realise the necessary policies and measures to ensure economic hardships are overcome,"" he said. ""We are aware of the economy's strong and weak points."" For financial markets, the biggest concerns remain inflation - which Albayrak forecast would hit 20.8 percent this year and 15.9 percent next year - and the banking sector.Turkey's banks face a potential deluge of bad debt as the lira sell-off has driven up the cost for companies to service their foreign currency loans. For years Turkish firms borrowed in dollars and euros, drawn by lower interest rates. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates that the private sector has around $146 billion in external debt maturing in the year to July 2019.Ratings agencies Moody's and Fitch have both sounded the alarm about the outlook for banks. Fitch has estimated that banks' foreign-currency lending stood at around 43 percent of all loans. But the government has repeatedly said it does not expect problems in the banking sector.""The lack of 'burden sharing' signs in the restructuring of the real sector debt in Minister Albayrak's speech seemed to have led to a sharp deterioration in sentiment,"" Gokce Celik of QNB Finansbank said in a note to clients. INVESTMENT PROJECTSAlbayrak said that investment projects for which the tender process has not been finalised will be suspended, a sign that some big-ticket government projects could be put on hold. Turkey's unemployment rate is expected to rise to 11.3 percent in 2018 and 12.1 percent in 2019 before falling to 11.9 in 2020, the presentation showed.Albayrak said Turkey would prioritise investments in pharmaceuticals, energy, and petrochemicals to reduce its current account deficit, which was seen falling to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product by 2021 from 4.7 percent seen in 2018.He also said Turkey would suspend all investment projects for which the tender process has not been finalised. He also said Turkey would revise its social insurance schemes and restructure its incentive scheme for exports.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

93,"Sep 20, 2018 08:30AM ET","Turkey Finance Minister Vows to Back Banks, Though Details Scant",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey announced a plan to monitor banks’ health, while stopping short of laying out measures to alleviate worries about a bad-loan burden.Future policies “will help the banking sector to strengthen, and the real economy to have access to credit at affordable rates, while creating room for credit restructuring if needed,"" Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said in a news conference in Istanbul on Thursday.The situation is still being studied, and policies will take heed of “global examples and Turkish past experience,” he said, as he announced the nation’s economic program for 2019-2021 and a “health assessment” watch for lenders. “Making sure that the banks continue financing businesses is one of the priorities,” he said, without giving more detail.His remarks failed to assuage investors concerned that a crunch is coming from the sinking lira, surging interest rates and struggling borrowers. The lira initially jumped almost 2 percent after Albayrak announced revised economic targets, before erasing those gains. It was down 1.2 percent as of 3 p.m. local time.“The press conference has been a disappointment both on the forecasts and the announcements,” said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Paris. “First, there is nothing really concrete on the foreign-exchange financing of the corporate and banking sectors. Likewise, there is no announcement about a ‘bad bank’ or how they will deal with non-performing loans; nothing about a more independent central bank.""People familiar with the government’s plans said earlier this week that one of the options being considered to clean up banks’ balance sheets, if needed, was the transfer of non-performing loans to a state-designated entity. However, the head of Turkey’s banking regulator, Mehmet Ali Akben, told the Dunya newspaper that such a move isn’t in the plan.Turkish businesses had $331 billion of foreign liabilities at the end of June. When netted against their foreign-exchange assets, the shortfall is $216 billion. Lenders have also been struggling to deal with a rising number of restructurings after the lira dropped 40 percent against the dollar this year, second only to the Argentine peso as the world’s worst-performing currency. The plunge is hurting firms’ ability to repay foreign-currency loans.On Wednesday, the Banks Association of Turkey began implementing a regulator-approved framework of rules on loan restructuring. The new rules may help a large swathe of industries, with the energy sector alone owing $51 billion to local lenders."

The result was predicted by all 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.The decision leaves the BOJ even further behind its global peers, who are moving to return to pre-crisis monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again next week, and the European Central Bank said it planned to phase out its bond-buying by the end of the year.Under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the BOJ is widely expected to stick with the current basic settings until 2020, while monitoring the build-up of side effects, the Bloomberg survey found. Inflation is only about halfway to the central bank’s 2 percent target, while a sales-tax increase scheduled for the second half of 2019 would pose a challenge to consumption and growth.""It’s time now for the BOJ to monitor the effects of the policy adjustments it made in July,"" said Naomi Muguruma, a senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. in Tokyo.The BOJ will face challenges ahead as it tries to sustain Japan’s economic expansion and push inflation closer to 2 percent. Near-term risks include the Hokkaido earthquake, typhoons and a record-breaking heat wave. All are expected to weigh on third-quarter growth.The BOJ’s basic view of the economy and inflation hasn’t changed, but the fact that it maintained language from July’s quarterly outlook report on trade protectionism shows that it also views the escalating trade fight between China and the U.S. as a risk, Muguruma said.There is also the question of side effects. The changes the central bank made in July were aimed at making its stimulus more sustainable, but economists concluded the moves amounted to “stealth tapering” and wouldn’t do much about the side effects.Koji Fujiwara, head of the Japanese Bankers Association, said last week that he wants to step up monitoring of the impact on banks given the central bank’s pledge to keep interest rates extremely low for an ""extended period.""The BOJ may decide to adjust policy again in the middle of next year if it determines the recent changes weren’t enough to offset the side effects on the JGB market, said Kyohei Morita, chief Japan economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Securities Asia.DissentersBoard members Goushi Kataoka and Yutaka Harada again delivered dissenting votes on yield-curve control and forward guidance on Wednesday. Both have previously called for more stimulus, if required.Kataoka on Wednesday disagreed with the board’s view that inflation was likely to rise gradually to 2 percent, saying monetary easing should be strengthened and the central bank should commit to additional measures if it determines that medium- and long-term inflation expectations were weakening.AbenomicsPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, asked about the risks, said last week that the BOJ’s stimulus shouldn’t go on forever, serving as another reminder that it surely must come to an end one day.""We had Abe’s comments recently, and there’s more concern about side effects, so I think it’s becoming more the case that the BOJ wants to normalize policy if it can,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities Co.Yet it appears that day won’t come soon. Abe is expected to win a ruling-party leadership election on Thursday and continue as prime minister for several more years. The BOJ’s stimulus has been a pillar of his ""Abenomics"" growth program, a principal reason he is poised to become Japan’s longest-serving post-war prime minister.(Adds details, economists’ comments, dissenting votes.)"
95,"Sep 13, 2018 11:31AM ET","Turkish central bank raises rates sharply, boosts lira",nan,"By Daren Butler and Ece ToksabayISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank raised its benchmark rate by a hefty 625 basis points on Thursday, the biggest such increase in President Tayyip Erdogan's 15-year rule, boosting the lira and possibly easing investor concern over his influence on monetary policy.The bank's Monetary Policy Committee raised the one-week repo rate  to 24 percent, meaning it has now increased interest rates by 11.25 percentage points since late April in an attempt to put a floor under the tumbling currency.Its decision came despite Erdogan repeating his opposition to high interest rates earlier in the day, saying high inflation was a result of the central bank's wrong steps.All 11 economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the bank would tighten, with the predictions ranging between 225-725 basis points as it balances concerns over the lira's weakness with worries about a sharp economic slowdown.Turkey's currency crisis has been driven by concerns about Erdogan's influence on monetary policy, but also more recently by the country's diplomatic row with the United States. Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", picked his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, as finance minister in July. This boosted investors' fears that the president - who wants to see lower borrowing costs to spur credit growth and construction - sought greater influence over monetary policy.""It is pleasing to see common sense prevail,"" said Aberdeen Standard Investments Head of Emerging Market Debt, Brett Diment, of the rate rise.""Hiking today does get Turkey on the slow road to recovering some monetary policy credibility, and that is critical.""In August, annual consumer price inflation hit 17.9 percent, its highest level since late 2003, prompting the central bank to say it would adjust its monetary stance at the September meeting in the face of ""significant risks"" to price stability. The central bank said there was still an upside risk to Turkey's inflation outlook from what it called a deterioration in pricing behavior, despite weaker domestic demand conditions.""Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability,"" it said.MARKETS RALLYThe lira  rallied 3 percent to 6.18 against the dollar, having traded at 6.4176 beforehand. It has still lost 38 percent of its value against the U.S. currency this year. The main share index (XU100) rose 2.1 percent, with the banking index (XBANK) up 4.8 percent. Dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Turkish government rose across the curve.The central bank said it was returning to funding via one-week repos from Friday, having funded the market at an overnight lending rate of 19.25 percent for the last month. Key rates are now at their highest level since 2004, around a year after Erdogan first came to power.Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said the economy needed to slow down because it was overheating and that an interest rate rise was needed to cap lira depreciation.""Obviously, it will have negative consequences on the economy but, I would say, it is less important if you have a hard landing than big corporate defaults due to a vicious cycle between (lira) depreciation and inflation,"" he said.The lira had weakened earlier on Thursday before the central bank decision as Erdogan's fierce criticism of the central bank and high interest raised doubts in investors' minds about how much the bank might tighten policy.Phoenix Kalen, director of EM strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said the market was both pleased and confused by the bank move.""It almost seems like it's a game of 'good cop, bad cop' being played out between the Turkish authorities - with President Erdogan on the one hand still making statements regarding his dislike of interest rates and ... a very sizeable reaction from the central bank in response to the recent inflationary and geopolitical developments."" Piotr Matys, emerging markets foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, said the central bank had taken a decisive step which should allow it to gradually restore confidence in the lira.He said Turkey also needed to resolve a dispute with the United States, which helped drive the lira to a record low of 7.24 against the dollar a month ago, and rebalance the economy away from big infrastructure projects and consumer spending.Against expectations, the central bank did not raise rates at its last meeting in July. Subsequently, the lira lost about 25 percent of its value while authorities have taken a series of steps to support it, with the bank taking liquidity measures and the banking watchdog limiting derivative transactions.Erdogan has cast the lira crisis as an 'economic war' targeting Turkey, repeatedly urging Turks to sell their dollar savings to shore up the lira.On Thursday he ruled that property sales and rental agreements must be made in lira, putting an end to such deals in foreign currencies.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

96,"Sep 12, 2018 05:12AM ET","Turkey set to raise rates, balancing lira and growth concerns",nan,"By Daren Butler and Ali KucukgocmenISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to calm a currency crisis, but forecasts for the scale of the increase vary widely as the bank balances concerns over lira weakness with worries about an economic slowdown.The lira has slumped 40 percent against the dollar this year, weakened by unease over President Tayyip Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and more recently a bitter row with the United States that has unsettled investors. The central bank confounded expectations for a rate increase at its July meeting, fuelling the belief it is under pressure from Erdogan, who has called interest rates the ""mother and father of all evil"" and frequently urges they be kept low.But after inflation surged in August to its highest in nearly 15 years, the central bank that it would take action against ""significant risks"" to price stability - a rare move to soothe financial markets.It said its monetary stance will be adjusted at Thursday's policy committee meeting. Analysts saw this as pointing to an increase in the benchmark one-week repo rate, now 17.75 percent - less than the annual inflation rate of 17.9 percent.Phoenix Kalen, strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), forecast the repo rate would be raised to 20.75 percent and would be restored as the main policy instrument, after a period during which the effective funding rate has been 19.25 percent.""Although this amount of monetary tightening may disappoint market expectations and spark renewed TRY weakness, the decision would reflect the prioritization of Turkish authorities' concerns regarding a rapidly decelerating economy,"" Kalen said.Turkey's economic growth slowed to 5.2 percent in the second quarter, data showed this week, and the economy is expected to slow again in the second half.In a Reuters poll, all 11 economists predicted the benchmark one-week repo rate would be raised. The average forecast was to 22 percent, but predictions ranged from an increase of 225 basis points to 725 basis points.""The central bank has a complete lack of credibility,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior EM strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), commenting on why the range was so wide.""We know they are not independent and that is it. So, you cannot predict what they will do, what you are trying to do is to predict what President Erdogan will do,"" he said.Muhammet Mercan, ING's chief economist for Turkey, said authorities need to act with credible measures to restore confidence given the economy's large forex debt service requirement.He forecast the one-week repo rate would be raised to 21 percent because of the weakening lira and deteriorating inflation outlook. FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS? Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Ercan Erguzel highlighted financial stability concerns and said he expected the central bank to tighten the repo rate by 425 basis points to 22.0 percent.""On the financial stability front, the biggest risk is the corporate sector's short FX position and its indirect impact on the banking system's asset quality,"" he said.That is likely to have an impact on syndication rollover ratios, with September and October appearing from the monthly repayment schedule to be two critical months for rollovers, he added.However, the ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday that most rated Turkish companies could handle refinancing risks despite the rising uncertainties.The central bank last raised rates in June, lifting the repo rate by 1.25 percentage points. At the end of May it simplified its previously unorthodox policy, returning to using the repo rate as its benchmark.In August, the bank tightened liquidity to counter the lira's slide, shifting funding from repo auctions to the upper band of its interest rate corridor - raising the effective cost of funding by 150 basis points to 19.25 percent. It has also taken other technical measures on reserve- requirement ratios while the banking watchdog has also taken steps to limit swap transactions to underpin the currency.While there was wide expectation that interest rates would rise on Thursday, veteran emerging-markets investor Mark Mobius raised doubts about the benefits of such a move.""I'm not convinced that raising interest rates is going to do anything, it’s all about confidence,"" said Mobius, who recently launched his own emerging market investment trust – Mobius Investment Trust.""OK, they raised interest rates, but what happens? People then say 'you're not confident. You're not confident in your own currency therefore you're offering us some crazy interest rates',"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""That's something that the established banks should be providing.""Wirecard's market value of $26.1 billion, is now double that of Commerzbank and recently eclipsed that of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which itself has just been ejected from the Eurostoxx 50 index of leading European stocks.More payments deals with heavyweight business partners are in the works, said Braun.""We believe that there will be many more such partnerships - not just in the banking sector,"" he told Reuters.""There's insurance, and we are working in the field of technology with other big companies.""These opportunities mean that, even though the global payments market is highly fragmented, Wirecard is focusing on organic growth rather than acquisitions.""We're concentrating on our own strategy - on our own growth story,"" Braun said. Asked whether Wirecard had been approached by strategic investors, he said: ""We are holding talks exclusively about operational partnerships.""($1 = 0.8598 euros)"

Just to drive that back toward levels that afforded the lira some relative stability in June, the central bank would have to raise borrowing costs by another 400 basis points.Central banks around the world have been pushed into action by emerging-market turmoil, with Argentina hiking rates by 1,500 basis points last week alone. Nomura International Plc says Turkey needs to raise its one-week repo rate by at least 575 basis points to 23.5 percent and it’s not clear policy makers will be prepared to deliver such aggressive tightening.“It gives the feeling they are running out of ammunition,” said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Paris. “Market expectations are now running high for a bold rate hike. In our view, they can only disappoint markets,” he said, adding he saw the lira weakening to 8.30 per dollar by December.The lira trimmed Monday’s loss against the dollar to trade around 6.64 on speculation hikes were on the way, after the central bank said it would take “necessary actions to support price stability.” The next policy meeting is on Sept. 13.Considering the pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to keep growth ticking along, it is no surprise that investor skepticism over the adequacy of any policy action is running high. By letting inflation run into the double digits for most of the last two years and relying on liquidity management instead of outright hikes the central bank has remained firmly behind the curve.“I’m not very confident to say the least,” said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura. “If Monday’s statement is a signal of unconventional policies, the market will be underwhelmed by the policy response.”"

103,"Aug 29, 2018 12:30PM ET","Turkey's Albayrak sees no big risk to economy, but Moody's sounds alarm",nan,"By Ali Kucukgocmen and David DolanISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey does not expect a big risk to its economy or financial system, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted on Wednesday as saying, in comments that illustrate a deep divide between Ankara and global investors over a worsening currency crisis.Albayrak, who is President Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law, spoke as ratings agency Moody's sounded more alarm about the outlook for Turkey's banking sector and as data showed economic confidence at its lowest in nearly a decade.The lira has lost around 40 percent of its value this year, driving up the cost of fuel and food and heightening concern about the risk to banks and the broader economy. Initially sparked by worries about Erdogan's influence on the central bank, the crisis has worsened over a rift with Washington.""We do not see a big risk about Turkey's economy or financial system,"" Albayrak told reporters on his flight back from Paris earlier this week, according to the newspaper Hurriyet. He cited low levels of net public and household debt, and the strength of the financial system, as reasons for his confidence, it said. Investors are less sanguine. Albayrak's comments could bolster a perception that there is ""denial within the Turkish government"", said Sebastien Barbe of  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""It is the same when Erdogan said the central bank should lower interest rates... This is the same kind of spirit and fuels the idea among the investor community that there is a difficulty in terms of macro-management for Turkey,"" he said.Moody's downgraded its ratings on 20 financial institutions on Tuesday, citing the increased risk of a deterioration in funding. The operating environment is now worse than previously expected, it said.It cut the ratings for some of Turkey's top banks, including Isbank (IS:ISCTR), the biggest listed lender by assets.The lira  weakened as far as 6.49, its weakest since Aug. 15. It was at 6.43 to the dollar at 1523. Banking stocks (XBANK) fell 1 percent, while Turkish dollar bonds fell and the cost of insuring its debt rose.""DEEP DOWNTURN""""The latest signs show that higher inflation, coupled with a severe tightening of financial conditions, is filtering through into an abrupt slowdown in economic growth,"" said Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics in a note to clients.""There's no getting away from the fact that the Turkish economy is experiencing a deep downturn.""Around $179 billion of Turkey's external debt matures in the year to July 2019, equivalent to almost a quarter of its annual economic output, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates. Most of that - around $146 billion - is owed by the private sector, especially banks, it said.For years Turkish companies have borrowed in dollars and euros, drawn by the lower interest rates. But the decline in the lira has driven up the cost of servicing those loans, and raised the possibility of ballooning bad debt for banks.Official data on Wednesday showed economic confidence fell this month to its lowest since 2009.In separate comments on Wednesday, Albayrak said the government would take more responsibility in the fight against inflation and would support monetary policies with fiscal measures. He said next year would be a ""strong year"" in the battle with inflation.Such optimism has failed to excite investors, who have been more preoccupied with Erdogan's sway over the central bank. The president, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", wants to see borrowing costs lowered to keep credit flowing to the construction industry.MENDING TIESAlbayrak has signaled that Turkey wants to mend its ties with the European Union in the face of U.S. moves that he said threaten the global economy. His trip to Paris this week, where he met France's finance minister, appeared to be part of that effort.Albayrak said he would probably visit Britain next week and Germany the week after.However, Ankara has so far found little help from overseas partners, apart from Qatar, which has pledged $15 billion in support. A German official on Tuesday denied a report that Berlin was considering providing a financial lifeline to help Turkey weather its crisis.The Hurriyet daily also quoted Albayrak as saying that steps would be taken to prevent foreign currencies from being used for real estate and shopping-mall store rents and sales.Retailers in Turkey's malls, which often pay their rent in dollars, have also said their businesses were suffering due to the ailing lira.Separately, the central bank said it would re-impose limits on overnight transactions, but at twice the limit that applied until Aug. 13, when it said it would provide all the liquidity needed.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The slump has led to fears of contagion across emerging markets.Some 3,000 investors and economists have registered for Thursday's call, due at 1300 GMT. Albayrak is not expected to take questions, but investors will be looking for signs he has the strength to act independently of his father-in-law.""The big strike against him is his being Erdogan's son-in-law,"" said Paul McNamara, an investment director at GAM London Limited. ""Even if he was the best man for the job, the optics are Third World.""The lira firmed 3 percent on Thursday ahead of Albayrak's presentation, partly on the back of liquidity measures by the central bank to try to stabilize the currency without resorting to an outright hike of its benchmark interest rate.Albayrak, married to Erdogan's daughter Esra, studied banking and finance in the United States and worked for Turkish conglomerate Calik Holding, seen as close to Erdogan's ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party. He rose to become chief executive officer before entering politics three years ago.Within months he was elevated to the cabinet as energy minister. In July, after Erdogan was re-elected with sweeping new executive powers, the president named him to head the newly established Treasury and Finance Ministry, putting him in charge of a portfolio previously divided between two ministers.Turkish academics and newspaper columnists who attended a briefing with him in July portray Albayrak, 40, as well-equipped for the job of steering the Turkish economy, casting him as hands-on and willing to listen to contrary views.International investors have so far been less convinced.The lira lost nearly 3 percent within minutes of his appointment, with investors worried by the departure of former deputy prime minister Mehmet Simsek and former finance minister Naci Agbal, both seen as market-friendly figures in a country pursuing increasingly unorthodox economic policies. ""The issue here is that he lacks credibility,"" Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank, said of Albayrak. ""The market doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt"".""CLOSER TO THE MARKET""?Investors are likely to want to see more detail from him than he delivered last Friday, when, from a hall in the ornate Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace on the shores of the Bosphorus, he outlined the government's new economic plan in a powerpoint presentation to Turkey-based bankers and business leaders.He promised central bank independence, tighter budget discipline, structural reform and ""sustainable and healthy growth"". But the lack of detail or clear action worried markets.In the presentation ""he was dealing with the right issues"" but was still talking about future action, said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging markets strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""But it's too long. We need something right now,"" Tresca said. Albayrak has echoed Erdogan's assertion that the currency crisis is the result of an ""economic war"".But while he may be little known to foreign investors, he has held a series of meetings in Turkey with business people, academics and civil society groups since becoming finance minister.Kerem Alkin, an economics professor and writer at the pro-government Sabah newspaper, described him as ""energetic and open to all kinds of opinions"", citing a meeting he held with a group of academics in late July.""He only made a short introductory speech and took notes tirelessly for two and a half hours... He welcomed opinions from people not close to the government,"" Alkin said.Under constitutional changes that took effect after the July election, the post of prime minister was scrapped, narrowing the circle of influence around Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years and who has branded interest rates the ""mother and father of all evil"".The last time Turkey's central bank held an emergency meeting to hike rates, in May, it was then-prime minister Binali Yildirim who convinced Erdogan of the need for drastic action, people familiar with the matter said.Whether Albayrak would be willing or able to do the same is an open question for investors.Erdal Saglam, a columnist for Hurriyet newspaper who attended a July briefing with Albayrak, said the minister's thinking was ""closer to the market"" than many people imagine.""But given his situation (as Erdogan's son-in-law), how much room he has to maneuver in implementing what he has in mind is difficult to gauge,"" Saglam told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The currency, stocks and bonds extended their decline.Promising to ""take all necessary measures,"" the central bank in Ankara lowered the amount commercial lenders must park at the regulator and eased rules that govern how they manage their lira and foreign-currency liquidity. While there was no mention of higher interest rates, it said all options were on the table.“The central bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary,” according to the statement released early Monday.It’s all part of an action plan announced by Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak late Sunday to respond to market tumult. He also rejected capital controls as an option to stem outflows of hard currency and vowed to crack down on those he said were spreading damaging rumors that deposits would be seized. Albayrak has visited Kuwait and was expected to visit other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council seeking investment, according to Kuwait’s Al Jarida newspaper.The lira briefly trimmed losses after the central bank statement but weakened about 6.6 percent to 6.8819 to the dollar at 12:02 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield on two-year government bonds jumped 94 basis points to 25.74 percent, the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008. The cost of insuring Turkish debt against default over five years surged more than 100 basis points to 537 basis points, while the benchmark stock index dropped as much as 4.6 percent.U.S. SanctionsThe currency has lost about a quarter of its value against the dollar since the U.S. sanctioned two ministers in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in a spat over the continued detention of an American pastor in Turkey, pushing the economy toward a full-blown financial meltdown.After Albayrak’s comments on Sunday, the banking regulator put restrictions on dollar-lira swaps in an attempt to make it harder for offshore investors to bet against the currency. The use of fringe tools is unlikely to be a “game changer” for the lira, Global Securities analysts including Research Director Sertan Kargin said in an emailed report.“The latest liquidity measures could provide some buffer to cushion the lira against speculative moves,” the report said. But the move “remains insufficient to provide full protection for the lira in times of distress in the absence of an outright orthodox rate hike.”Over the weekend, Erdogan lashed out at the U.S., threatening to find new alliances and new markets for the economy’s vast financing needs. He also took higher interest rates off the table and said Turkey wouldn’t accept an international bailout.For details on the central bank measures, read: Turkey Central Bank Takes Steps to Support Banks as Lira SlidesThe central bank’s initiative was praised by Adnan Bali, chief executive officer of Isbank which is Turkey’s biggest listed bank by assets. He said the regulator’s move was well executed but needed to be supported by “technical decisions.”Speaking to BloombergHT television from Istanbul, Bali said interest-rate increases can sometimes be necessary even though they hurt profits of commercial lenders such as his.“On the subject of interest rates, whatever needs to be done as required by economy science should be done. You may not like it,” Bali said. “When necessary, all instruments should be used. That doesn’t mean you like it or want it.”Talking about need for further monetary tightening is a touchy subject in Turkey because Erdogan has been outspoken in his opposition to higher interest rates, which he said only profit the ""interest-rate lobby."" He also argues that raising them results in faster inflation -- an argument that goes against the orthodox economic thinking.Some investors have called for the benchmark rate of 17.75 to be jacked up by 1000 basis points.“The big question is why they don’t hike properly,” said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in Paris.(Updates with Isbank CEO comments, background throughout.)"
109,"Aug 13, 2018 06:41AM ET","Turkish lira pulls back from record low, markets rattled",nan,"By Daren Butler and Nevzat DevranogluISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's lira pulled back from a record low of 7.24 to the dollar on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks, but its meltdown continued to rattle global markets.The currency has lost more than 40 percent against the dollar this year, largely over worries about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States.On Friday that relentless slide turned into a crash: the lira dropped as much as 18 percent, hitting U.S. and European stocks as investors took fright over banks' exposure to Turkey.The fresh lira collapse on Sunday night hit Asian shares, weakened South Africa's rand and drove demand in global markets for safe currencies including the dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Shares in Europe's major banks also lost ground.The central bank, which surprised markets last month when it left interest rates unchanged despite double-digit inflation and the tumbling lira, announced the moves on liquidity and reserves after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said authorities would start implementing an economic action plan on Monday.Bankers also said the central bank would meet banks' lira liquidity needs at the overnight rate of 19.25 percent -- 150 basis points above the benchmark weekly repo rate -- though it might not use the overnight funding on Monday because lira liquidity needs were low.They said the bank's decision could be the first step toward tightening policy through the use of an interest rate corridor, an instrument used in previous years, rather than an increase in the benchmark rate.The bank said it cut the lira reserve requirement ratio, a cash buffer held by banks, by 250 basis points for all maturity brackets and lowered reserve requirement ratios for non-core FX liabilities by 400 bps for maturities up to three years.The moves will free up 10 billion lira, $6 billion, and $3 billion equivalent of gold liquidity in the financial system, the bank said. It also pledged to provide ""all the liquidity banks need"".While the measures should ease worries over financial stability, they will have no direct impact on the lira because they do not affect banks' foreign exchange positions,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategist Erkin Isik said in a note.Isik said the lira's current levels would add between 4 and 5 percentage points to headline inflation in coming months, pushing it up to around 21 percent in September from nearly 16 percent last month.On Sunday night Turkey's banking watchdog BBDK said it was limiting banks' foreign exchange swap transactions.Turkish lira sell-off since Aug 10: https://reut.rs/2vBSYbmRECORD LOWThe lira <TRYTOM=D3>, which hit a record low of 7.24 against the dollar in Asian trading, pared losses after Albayrak's comments and the central bank announcement, strengthening briefly to 6.4. It was trading at 6.8700 per dollar at 1024 GMT.Turkish bank shares (XBANK) fell to their lowest level in dollar terms since November 2003 and their dollar bonds and Turkey's sovereign dollar debt tumbled. Stocks (XU100) dropped 4 percent, with the BIST index of blue-chip stocks (XU030) down around 50 percent in dollar terms this year.Albayrak said in an interview published on Sunday that Turkey will start implementing an economic plan to ease investor concerns, stressing budget discipline and pledging that fiscal rules would be implemented for targeted indicators if necessary.""We will be taking the necessary steps with our banks and banking watchdog in a speedy manner,"" he said, ruling out any seizure or conversion of dollar-denominated bank deposits into lira.Market analysts broadly welcomed his comments but said investors wanted to see action.""It’s purely technical and Turkey needs a complete rebalancing of its economic business plan, and very sharp rate hikes and a strong commitment that the central bank will be independent,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR)'s senior emerging markets strategist Guillaume Tresca said.But a drastic rate hike was unlikely because of the damage it would do to Turkey's corporate sector, while any capital controls would close off access to foreign exchange for companies already short of dollars, Tresca said.Turkey would also be reluctant to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund after clearing billions of dollars of debt to the fund under Erdogan.In the interview with Hurriyet newspaper, Albayrak described the lira's weakness as ""an attack"" -- echoing Erdogan, who is his father-in-law.Erdogan, a self-styled ""enemy of interest rates,"" wants cheap credit from banks to fuel growth, but investors fear the economy is overheating and could be set for a hard landing.On Sunday Erdogan said the lira's free-fall was the result of a plot and did not reflect economic fundamentals.""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said.The interior ministry said on Monday it was taking legal action against 346 social media accounts that had posted comments about the weakening of the lira ""in a provocative way""."
110,"Aug 12, 2018 10:50PM ET",Lira Extends Slide as Turkey Heads Toward a Financial Crisis,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s lira extended its precipitous slide Monday, with the selloff spreading to other emerging-market currencies, after the nation’s president showed no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S.The lira weakened past 7.23 per dollar amid thin volume before paring losses after the nation’s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency stepped in to limit swap transactions on the battered currency. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the nation will announce steps to calm markets on Monday, Hurriyet newspaper reported.The reported measures “have evidently had some impact in pulling the lira back higher,” said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. Still, “there’s nothing as yet to suggest that the government, or Turkish central bank, is poised to announce the fiscal or monetary policy measures capable of quickly restoring confidence in Turkey.”The Turkish currency has been a casualty of a deepening crisis spurred by the administration’s growth-at-all-costs agenda and a worsening spat with the U.S., which sanctioned Turkey over the detention of an American priest. The lira’s plunge to a new record low and fears of a contagion sparked tremors through global markets on Monday, dragging a gauge for emerging-market currencies to the lowest in more than a year.The dollar climbed as much as 13 percent to 7.2362 against the lira, with some banks said to avoid providing two-way prices amid unprecedented volatility. The South African rand fell to its weakest in more than two years, while the Mexican peso dropped 2 percent against the greenback.EM Volatility“The decline in the lira is multifaceted, caused not only by a weak external position in terms of current account deficit and inadequate currency reserves, but also the challenging political environment which exacerbates the vulnerabilities in the lira,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “This may fuel volatility in EM assets and dampen investor sentiment in the near term, as markets are already skittish.”The extended rout in the lira also weighed on the euro and the Australian dollar, while spurring haven demand. The Aussie fell 0.4 percent against the dollar, while the yen strengthened against every Group-of-10 peer and Treasuries were bought.“It’s still the case that the euro and Australian dollar are most readily in the firing line, given concerns over euro zone exposure to Turkey and the Aussie’s status as the market’s preferred EM/risk proxy,” NAB’s Attrill said of the impact of the falling lira on Group-of-10 currencies.The sell-off also represents a vote of no-confidence in a new system of government that earlier this year handed President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unrivaled authority, essentially paralyzing the bureaucracy in Ankara. In speeches Sunday, Erdogan remained defiant, vowing never to give in on interest-rate hikes. He also ruled out an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.Runaway InflationYears of a growth-at-all-costs policy bias have left Turkey’s companies saddled with hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt, runaway inflation and one of the world’s largest current-account deficits.“Rate hikes would not be enough, with Turkish officials needing to create a credibility shock,” Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, wrote in a Aug. 10 note. “A complete rebalancing of the economy is needed, with a new economic team and a real commitment to the central bank’s independence.”Turkey’s central bank -- which has raised its main policy rate to 17.75 percent -- unexpectedly refrained from a further hike at its last meeting. While investors are pleading for dramatic central bank action to bolster the lira, Turkish officials fear that even a huge increase in borrowing costs could be quickly offset by another round of U.S. sanctions, according to two people familiar with the thinking of the country’s economic administration.A Turkish acknowledgment of the dangers ahead is nevertheless needed to soothe markets and even if the central bank provides only a stop-gap solution, it should still be done, according to Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Bilkent University in Ankara.“It will signal that they are not looking at off-market solutions such as capital controls, conversion of FX deposits"" and other unorthodox policies, he said. “To work, it will have to be large and would have to be accompanied by a ‘whatever it takes’ statement.""Turkey’s government debt plummeted on Friday, driving the yield on 10-year debt to a record close of 22.11 percent.

Indeed, if U.S. President Donald Trump takes a step back from imposing further tariffs, this may help reverse some of the market concerns about USDCNY,"" said Jeff Ng, Asia chief economist at Continuum Economics.""Further, a rebound in domestic economic metrics could also help tilt the PBoC away from accommodation, keeping USDCNY closer to the 6.50-level. The yuan could also be granted a reprieve if markets expect the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of rate increases or start to worry about the U.S.' current account deficit.""The yuan  was expected to gain around 2 percent to 6.70 per dollar in a year, according to the poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists taken August 6-8. It was trading around 6.82 on Wednesday.After largely standing aside in recent weeks while the yuan fell, there are signs that Chinese authorities are now looking to put a floor under the currency and discourage bets on further losses that could trigger capital outflows.On Friday, the central bank said it would require banks to keep reserves equivalent to 20 percent of their clients' foreign exchange forwards positions in a move to stabilize the yuan.Still, the 12-month forecast for the yuan was the most pessimistic median in Reuters polls conducted this year. According to a separate Reuters poll on currency positioning, investors piled bearish bets on the yuan to the highest on record amid the escalating tit-for-tat trade battle between the world's two biggest economies. [ASIA/FXP]Beijing on Friday announced tariffs on an additional $60 billion a year worth of imports from the U.S.China's retaliatory measures come after the latest U.S. proposal to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products.Though data on Wednesday showed China's exports are holding up surprising well so far, it is early days and the trade battle is expected to put further pressure on its already slowing economy. Growth is forecast to slow to 6.6 percent in 2018, and 6.3 percent in 2019, from 6.9 percent last year, a separate Reuters poll found.[ECILT/CN]""The rising likelihood of an economic war with the U.S. presents the biggest threat to China's growth and financial stability since the global financial crisis,"" noted Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB.""We believe Beijing has more to lose in a confrontation and so it is in China's interests to reach a compromise with Washington rather than going down the path of retaliation. While some battles are likely to be fought, a war will probably be avoided, allowing China to limit the growth slowdown fairly easily via relatively modest credit, monetary and fiscal easing.""Still, there are few signs that either side is in the mood for concessions at this point, and a few currency strategists expect the yuan to depreciate further over the coming 12 months.Thirteen of 64 participants said the yuan will weaken below 7.0 per dollar in a year, a closely watched level that has not been breached since the 2008 global financial crisis.""It is an under-statement to say the near-term outlook for the yuan remains highly uncertain. In the event that trade tensions escalate further, 6.95–7.00 could be the ultimate top for USD/CNY,"" noted Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.""Such a move would entail a 10 percent depreciation of the CNY, matching the 10 percent tariff which the U.S. threatens to impose on $200 billion of imports from China.""But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told clients in a note that it believes an eventual ""deal"" still seems to be a reasonable base case assumption. It expected the currency to touch 6.60 in 12 months.(Polling by Khushboo Mittal and Vivek Mishra; Editing by Jonathan Cable and Kim Coghill)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The dollar has weakened since hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the currency. Traders said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in the trade tensions to move higher. ""The Chinese trade data, coupled with the PBOC moves, is helping quieten markets, with range-bound trading,"" said Valentin Marinov, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""The main driver for markets at the moment is dollar buying and selling."" The People's Bank of China announced last week that it would impose a reserve requirement on forex forwards and wanted to see a stable yuan.China's currency has since recovered some of its losses but was 0.2 weaker at 6.8380  in offshore markets, still off last week's 6.9125 lows.The euro initially rose 0.2 percent to $1.1618 (EUR=EBS), against Monday's low of $1.1530 but could not hold its gains.The dollar index fell 0.2 percent to 95.036 (DXY) before trimming its losses.""The USD appears increasingly vulnerable as recent movements in global bond markets erode the USD's fundamental support via narrowing interest rate differentials. Sentiment is likely to remain dominant, however, and markets remain vulnerable to headline risk and President Trump’s twitter feed,"" said Christophe Barraud at Paris-based Market Securities.Traders say market sensitivity to trade war headlines has diminished and investors will want to see evidence the dispute is having real impact before they panic.China's July trade data, the first since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, showed a faster-than-expected rise in China's exports and imports. The country's trade surplus with the United States was little changed.In a reminder the dispute has not disappeared, however, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday that the U.S. would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods later this month.The yen rose half a percent after reports that Bank of Japan board members had disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target. The yen rose to 110.84, a one-week high .The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for China risk, slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7413 .Britain's pound skidded further as worries about Brexit weighed. It slipped below $1.29  and hit a nine-month low of 89.92 pence (EURGBP=D3) against the euro.In emerging markets the weaker dollar offered no respite to Turkey's lira, which dropped another 1.4 percent  on renewed concerns about the government's handling of the economy.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But the United States said the two remained at odds on its core demand that Ankara free American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson.Those tensions have heightened investor concern over Turkey, where investors are most worried by what they see as Erdogan's influence over the central bank, which has not been as aggressive in raising interest rates as investors have hoped. The president, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", wants to see borrowing costs lowered to fuel credit, new construction and growth. The appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister has deepened the concern.""The central bank is behind the curve; it remains behind the curve,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""The lira keeps depreciating and we are seeing that the central bank is not ready to act.""The lira  stood at 5.2925 against the dollar, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington.The currency has fallen some 27 percent this year and plunged as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade. That decline came after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey's exports.The cost of insuring exposure to Turkish bank debt rose on Wednesday, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Yapi Kredi up 1 basis point (bp) from Tuesday's close to 460 bps, according to IHS Markit, a record high. Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained by differences over Syria and by the trial in Turkey of Brunson, the pastor, for supporting a group Ankara blames for a 2016 abortive putsch. Brunson denies the charge. The United States is also seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff.Washington last week imposed sanctions on President Tayyip Erdogan's justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organizations responsible for Brunson's arrest. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the sanctions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

115,"Aug 06, 2018 11:11AM ET",Exclusive: Russia's Gazprom suspends external borrowing amid spat with Naftogaz - sources,nan,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Sandrine BradleyMOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) suspended its external borrowing program earlier this year because of a deepening legal dispute with Ukraine's Naftogaz over gas supplies, three banking sources told Reuters. A London court in June froze the gas giant's assets in Britain at the request of Naftogaz. The Ukrainian company was seeking to enforce an earlier arbitration ruling from Sweden that ordered Gazprom to pay it $2.6 billion. The British verdict is likely to have spooked Western banks that traditionally work with Gazprom because it raises the possibility that any new funds the company might raise via London could also be frozen, one of the sources said. Gazprom is still able to raise funds on the Russian market, recently testing investors' appetite with a 40 billion rouble bond ($630 million), but the situation means it faces higher borrowing costs and prolonged regulatory uncertainty, the bankers say. Gazprom, which is on the hook to repay $15.2 billion in external debt this year, had planned to start meeting investors to test their appetite for a potential sterling Eurobond in the middle of June, a Russian banker involved in that deal said. However, the deal was canceled days before the British court's June 18 announcement, the banker said. He said that the decision was made as the relationship between Moscow and the West grew increasingly tense because of U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and a row over former spy Sergei Skripal's assassination attempt on British soil. Russia has denied any involvement. Two other London-based bankers said the decision to call off the Eurobond issue was also taken as Gazprom adopted a cautious stance ahead of the London ruling. One of the sources, who all declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, said that Gazprom had also planned to sell Eurobonds in euros and Japanese yen in the autumn, but that those plans had stalled too. Meanwhile, one of the banks that works with Gazprom put a loan for the Russian firm on hold until the situation around its finances in the West became clearer, the same source said. Gazprom declined to comment. ""As I understand it, settlements with foreign banks done via London are affected,"" another banker said. A third source, citing a banker who works with Gazprom, said Gazprom had stopped making any payments through banks in Britain. However, the London court's ruling does not prevent the company from servicing outstanding debt, a lawyer familiar with the process said. CHANGING TACK Gazprom's original plan had been to borrow 417 billion roubles ($6.57 billion) externally this year. It is currently building two new pipelines to southern Europe and China, and preparing to start construction of the Nord Stream 2 to Western Europe under a projected investment program of 1.3 trillion roubles this year. Gazprom has a sufficient cash cushion to deal with its costs but western financing is a cheaper alternative for the company, the bankers said. In March, prior to the London court ruling, Gazprom raised 750 million Swiss francs via a 5-year Eurobond where UBS (S:UBSG) was the only Western bank involved, and another 750 million euros in an 8-year Eurobond arranged by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) along with three Russian banks. In May, Gazprom raised 600 million euros via a loan from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan declined to comment on Gazprom's external borrowing operations. Other banks that have worked on Gazprom's external financing programmes, such as Société Générale (PA:SOGN), Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), UniCredit (MI:CRDI), UBS,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, also declined to comment. Credit Agricole could not immediately comment. Nomura and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) did not reply to Reuters requests. Naftogaz said that Gazprom's failure to comply with the original decision of the Stockholm court was creating problems and it was better for Gazprom to pay the $2.6 billion it owed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

With the Bank of Japan ending a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve concluding its meeting on Wednesday and the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates on Thursday, investors are preparing for a busy week that could set the near-term course for currencies.The European Central Bank's reaffirmation last week that rates would remain low through the summer of 2019 hurt the euro and the currency remained stuck around $1.1649 (EUR=) against the dollar in early European trading.Euro zone inflation data due later on Monday and on Tuesday could help shake the currency out of its recent narrow range, analysts said, although investors appear reluctant to make large bets for now.""It will be an active week, there is a lot of event risk,"" said Manuel Oliveri, analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""Markets are pretty much range-bound and it doesn't look like there is much motivation to enter big positions.""Oliveri said that positioning data showed dollar net long positions remained at their largest for several months, and the greenback's recent strength was vulnerable to a reversal of those positions.The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 94.717 after dipping slightly on Friday. Upbeat second quarter U.S. gross domestic product data failed to lift the greenback, as markets had mostly priced in strong figures.More important will be data that incorporates July, which is when tariffs against Chinese goods were activated.The U.S. currency was 0.1 percent higher at 111.10 yen , with markets preparing to see whether the BOJ is considering taking steps to make its massive stimulus program more sustainable.Talk about what the BOJ might do includes the central bank possibly adjusting its yield-curve control and exchange-traded fund (ETF) buying schemes. The dollar has eased back from a six-month high above 113.00 yen scaled on July 19 after such speculation.""While various speculations are being made over the BOJ, we believe they will stand pat on monetary policy. The focal point for us is whether the BOJ hints at future policy change,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.""Opinion about potential actions on Tuesday varies greatly, and the meeting could trigger a market reaction, no matter what the outcome is.""The Chinese yuan continued to weaken. In offshore markets it fell to as low as 6.85 yuan per dollar , close to its one-year low reached last week, before settling around 6.833.The yuan has been under relentless pressure in recent months because of nervousness about what a dispute over trade with the United States will mean for the Chinese economy.The Australian dollar declined 0.1 percent to $0.7397 , while the Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent to C$1.3065 .

120,"Jul 29, 2018 09:20PM ET",Pound Optimism Ebbs as Brexit Gloom Overwhelms BOE Hike Prospect,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Pound bulls just lost some of their swagger.Long-standing optimists  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA, BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV all cut their sterling calls in recent days with still no sign of a resolution to Brexit uncertainty. While the French and Spanish banks still see the U.K. currency strengthening from current levels, the Dutch one now forecasts it will fall to as low as $1.27 -- a level not seen in more than a year -- in the coming months.“Our bullish outlook at the start of the year was predicated on lower Brexit uncertainty and issues like the Irish backstop having been resolved,” said ING analyst Viraj Patel. “The fact that we’re still debating that and still questioning whether a transition may or may not go ahead is a huge disappointment.”The pound fell 0.7 percent against the dollar this month even as markets priced in an interest-rate increase this week by the Bank of England. With just 12 weeks to go until the U.K.’s and European Union’s target date to have a Brexit deal in place, negotiations suffered yet another setback Friday as the bloc rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest customs plan.ING now expects the pound in the $1.27-$1.28 area in the third quarter, compared with a previous forecast for $1.34-$1.35. Credit Agricole sees it at $1.37 in the fourth quarter, from $1.38 previously. BBVA cut its third- and fourth-quarter estimates to $1.32 and $1.38, from $1.37 and $1.44 respectively.One-and-DonePositioning data shows it’s not just the strategists who are struggling to be positive on sterling. Even amid elevated expectations for an imminent rate increase, the market is close to its most bearish in almost a year on the pound-dollar exchange rate.This can partly be put down to the fact investors aren’t anticipating a rate hike this week to be followed by more monetary tightening in the coming months. Money-market prices show only 40 basis points of further increases priced over the next three years beyond the expected Aug. 2 move.But for now, politics is outweighing the economics. Credit Agricole cut its pound forecasts on the view that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was growing and that an agreement between the U.K. and the EU will come “only after a period of heightened political uncertainty and growing fears about a no-deal Brexit,” the bank’s head of Group-of-10 currency research Valentin Marinov wrote in a note.It would take either a positive surprise from U.K. economic data or a drop in domestic political risks to make ING go bullish on sterling again, Patel said. With both the U.K. Parliament and Brussels in recess, the uncertainty on Britain’s future path is likely to continue into October, he said."
121,"Jul 27, 2018 12:44PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/WHAT'S THE JAPLAN?The Bank of Japan meets on Tuesday and might be doing some 'jinarashi' i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. Sources have told Reuters that having failed to raise Japan's inflation to anywhere near its 2 percent target despite some intense effort, it is now considering changing its targets or its bond-buying program.Five years of the qualitative and quantitative easing policy, which was last tweaked in 2016 to keep rates negative and cap the 10-year bond yield at zero, have had mixed results at best. Unemployment has dropped and the economy is no longer mired in deep deflation, but the yen hasn’t weakened enough to create noticeable inflation or ramp up economic growth.And with a global trade war now threatening trouble for its big exporters and zero interest rates hurting its banks, the BOJ seems to have recognized that something needs to give. (For a graphic on 'Japan stirs talk of change to yield curve control policy' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2JYsmFZ)2/FED HOT It might be holiday season but U.S markets won't be taking much of a break next week.Closely-scrutinized non-farm jobs data is due on Friday, two days before that the Federal Reserve will probably lay the groundwork for its third rate hike of the year in September. The Fed's mandate is to promote maximum employment along with price stability. The unemployment rate rose to 4.0 percent in June from 3.8 in May, when it matched the lowest since 2000. Analysts are expecting Friday's figure for July to be 3.9 percent and for 190,000 jobs to have been added nationwide.Given a severe labor shortage, is the economy up against maximum employment? And what does the Fed think about it all? Wednesday's statement will get parsed, as always, for any worry about overheating in the economy or in inflation. Even tiny changes to its language can raise the temperature in markets.(For a graphic on 'Long-dollar bets at highest in more than 1-1/2 months' click https://reut.rs/2JVRbSG)3/MR RELIABLE The Bank of England's Mark Carney is looking to throw off his ""unreliable boyfriend"" tag on Thursday and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 percent. It would be symbolic as it would get BoE rates above the emergency lows of the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown for the first time, but with a potentially messy Brexit nearing the bank may sound cautious about further moves. Market pricing doesn't anticipate another hike for at least a year. That has been flattening the UK gilt bond curve and suppressing the pound, so unless Carney reverts to teasing about hikes again that is likely to continue. (For a graphic on 'UK markets since BoE's November rate hike' click https://reut.rs/2K05Ps8)4/LONG IN THE FAANGThe spectacular dive by Facebook’s shares this week has unnerved those crowded into the tech sector. The $120 billion rout was the biggest one-day wipeout in value terms in U.S. stock market history and having seen fellow-FAANG Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tumble, and Twitter slump on Friday, there have been some painful memories of the early 2000s dot.com bubble. The final FAANG, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), reports next week and any disappointments in its numbers could cause more pain for U.S. and world stocks – as Wall Street has rallied 6 percent this year, its tech sub-set is up 16 percent.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) who keep a close eye on where investors are putting their money are warning too that the FAANGs - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are the other two in the quintet - are the most overcrowded trade in the world and to get out.

It is a particularly big week for the region's banks, which have underperformed the broader index with a 10 percent fall so far this year. The big guns on the list include BNP Paribas,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Lloyds (LON:LLOY), ING,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), SocGen, RBS (LON:RBS),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI).

122,"Jul 25, 2018 03:40AM ET","Trump Says U.S., EU Must Cut All Tariffs Ahead of Key Talks",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said that the U.S. and the European Union should drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies, just hours before the bloc’s trade chiefs present him with proposals going a long way toward that outcome in a crunch meeting at the White House.“I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!” Trump said in a Tuesday night tweet. “That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!”July 25, 2018European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom are due to meet with Trump in Washington on Wednesday. They plan to signal the bloc’s willingness to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement on manufactured goods, or a so-called plurilateral sectoral agreement between all major car exporters which would cut or eliminate tariffs on automobiles globally.The overtures are a last-ditch attempt to persuade him from imposing tariffs on European car exports to the U.S., in what could deal a serious blow to the 28-nation bloc’s economy.“We are here to explain and find out how to prevent a trade war,” Juncker said in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF before the meeting, adding that he’s not overly optimistic. The EU is prepared to retaliate “immediately” if talks fail, he warned.July 24, 2018The commission, which manages trade relations on behalf of all 28 nations in the EU, is preparing a list of retaliatory measures on American goods worth $20 billion should the U.S. impose car tariffs, Malmstrom said. “It would be more general, like farming goods, machines, high-technology products and others,” she said in an interview with Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter.Highlighting the complexity of Wednesday’s talks, hours before Trump called for the elimination of all tariffs, he had tweeted that “tariffs are the greatest.” He has also singled out the EU as a “foe” of the U.S. because of its trade surplus, and hinted that America’s commitment to the continent’s security is contingent on resolving the spat over tariffs.The euro and shares in European auto exporters could drop if the Washington talks result in “further escalation of the U.S.-EU trade tensions, with President Trump sticking to his threat of additional tariffs on EU car exports and the EC President Junker threatening to retaliate,”  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) analysts led by Valentin Marinov said in a note.Analysts caution that worse may be yet to come. Trump’s announcement of plans to provide $12 billion in aid for U.S. farmers suffering from tariffs suggest that “Trump is preparing for the long haul,” said Martin van Vliet and Benjamin Schroeder of ING Bank in Amsterdam.“With Trump having called the EU a ‘foe’ recently and his assertion that he was ‘playing with the bank’s money,’ any quick resolution in this high stakes stand-off would come as a surprise,” they said.(Updates with analyst comment in last two paragraphs.)"

124,"Jul 13, 2018 05:36AM ET",French banks score capital victory against ECB,nan,"By Francesco CanepaFRANKFURT (Reuters) - French banks won a landmark court victory against the European Central Bank on Friday, giving them an exemption from holding capital against customer deposits parked with a state-owned fund.The European Union's top court annulled an ECB decision demanding that the six banks set aside capital against special deposits they have with state investment institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC).The ruling marks the first high-profile success for banks in a case brought against the ECB since the central bank became the industry's main supervisor in 2014 under the lead of France's own former chief regulator, Daniele Nouy.""The ECB has erred in law and committed manifest errors of assessment,"" the court saidThe ruling will lower capital requirements for  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Credit Mutuel, Groupe BPCE and La Banque Postale by billions of euros in total.French tax-free savings accounts, such as the Livret A, were worth some 386 billion euro at the end of May but their popularity is waning due to the low interest rate they pay.Banks can deposit up to 60 percent of that cash with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignation, which uses the funds to invest in public housing and other projects.La Banque Postale and BPCE, which long had a monopoly on French regulated savings accounts, were likely the main beneficiaries of the verdict. Under EU rules, banks must hold capital worth at least 3 percent of their total assets. By stripping out the deposits with the CDC, banks would get a higher leverage ratio for a given amount of capital.La Banque Postale said in its annual report it had capital worth 4.5 percent of its assets at the end of 2017 but that ratio would come in at even healthier 5.3 percent if its deposits with the CDC had been excluded.As the bank's assets were worth 205 billion at the end of last year, according to its annual report, that 0.8 percent difference is worth 1.64 billion euros ($1.91 billion).BPCE and Credit Agricole SA knocked 30 and 15 basis points respectively off their leverage ratios in 2016 to take account of their deposits with the CDC. The court accepted that these deposits qualify for an exemption because they are ""deposits that the institution is legally obliged to transfer to (a) public sector entity ... for the purposes of funding general interest investments"". In 2013, before moving to the ECB, Daniele Nouy herself said that French banks would be ""strongly impacted"" by new liquidity rules due to their exposure to regulated savings accounts, among other reasons. The ECB is facing a number of lawsuits from banks that disagree with its decisions, including BNP Paribas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

All that enthusiasm sent the peso up more than 4 percent in the first hour of trading Friday, before a reality check kicked in -- sinking the currency to an all-time low. The yield on Argentina’s 100-year bond jumped to a record 9 percent.Traders have been desperate for policy makers to lay out a strategy to curb the peso volatility, complaining that all they got in response was disjointed and unpredictable policy. Investors had expected that a $50 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund last week would return calm to the market. Instead, the peso collapse has added to the woes of a country already under siege from double-digit inflation and a ballooning current-account deficit.The policy outlook for the Argentine peso remains challenging and the shakeup in central bank leadership doesn’t change that, said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. “We would still expect Argentine peso weakness over time, but the question for us is how significant that weakness will be and whether the currency can eventually stabilize or recover,"" he said.The peso dropped 1.4 percent to 28.10 per dollar Friday, leading losses among the world’s major currencies. The Merval gauge of stocks extended a four-day slide.In May, officials sought to arrest the peso decline by jacking up interest rates to the highest in the world at 40 percent, intervening directly in the market and using a $5 billion offer at 25 pesos per dollar to contain the currency while the government negotiated the deal with the IMF. The day of the announcement, Sturzenegger said that the bank would only intervene in the market in ""disruptive situations."" Still, the central bank spent $794 million over two days to curb losses as volume plummeted.The changes at the helm of the central bank, which included the departure of several high ranking officers, capped a dramatic day in local markets Thursday, with the peso plummeting and the monetary authority refraining from an intervention.It’s ""rushed and sloppy"" to change the president of the central bank who signed an agreement with the IMF that hasn’t even started, according to a note by Perspectiv@s Economicas, a research firm led by Luis Secco, former cabinet chief at state-run Banco de la Nacion.""In the next few days, we will know what the market reaction is and to what extent the problem was due to management by the central bank’s trading desk or if it’s a deeper problem that goes beyond individuals,"" the note said.Caputo took the helm of the Finance Ministry in December 2016 after serving as a key figure in securing an agreement with investors holding debt the country defaulted on in 2001, a truce that allowed the country to return to global capital markets.“The one person on Macri’s team they have confidence in is Toto Caputo,” said Walter Stoeppelwerth, the chief investment officer at Balanz Capital Valores in Buenos Aires. “Toto is a trader by nature.

135,"Jun 01, 2018 01:00PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/ A TRUMP, TRADE AND DOLLAR COLLISION?The U.S. dollar has risen almost 7 percent from three-plus year lows hit in February and is up about 2 percent for the year. But the rally looks awkwardly timed, with the U.S. trade deficit near its biggest in a decade and President Donald Trump risking a trade war, with import tariffs on some of his country's closest allies.That should put markets' focus squarely on Wednesday's report on April's international trade balance. If the deficit widens to the expected $51.3 billion, it would be close to February's $57.7 billion - the biggest gap since October 2008.Much of the dollar's recent move came after May 3 data showing the March trade deficit had shrunk 15 percent to $49 billion. On the surface a rally seems intuitive. But these are unusual times, with the President going after steel, aluminum and even auto exports from Canada, Mexico and the EU, not to mention China. If the dollar recovery continues it could - counterproductively - make U.S. exports costlier.Canada and Mexico hit back Friday with levies on U.S. goods, from orange juice to pork, while the EU was set to tax bourbon whiskey and Harley Davison motorcycles.It might not be too big a leap from tit-for-tat protectionism to competitive, or market-influenced currency depreciation against the dollar - perhaps an unintended consequence of the White House shouting 'unfair' at its partners and kicking off the negative spiral.U.S. allies hit back at Washington's steel, aluminum tariffsDollar strengthens against loonie, peso after U.S. sets tariffsU.S. trade deficit narrows on exports; jobs market tighteningTo view a graphic on Yawning dollar recover ill timed for trade, click: https://reut.rs/2L9XF1t2/ ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROMEItaly appears to have averted early elections and its bond yields, that surged to multi-year highs in recent days, have retreated. But with developments in Rome still in the spotlight, a sustained recovery is unlikely.A coalition comprising the 5-Star Movement and the League is being installed after the anti-establishment parties agreed to substitute a eurosceptic initially proposed as economy minister.But the parties have big spending plans that will challenge EU fiscal rules; among other issues, they have spooked markets by mooting the issuance of securities to clear state payment arrears -- many see the plan as a way to introduce a parallel currency to the euro.How Italy's mini-BOT ""parallel currency"" would workRome alone: five key questions for the euroTo view a graphic on Italy's turmoil hits bonds but contagion limited, click: https://reut.rs/2JiwjZD3/BANKING ON THE EUROZONEEurope's bank shares (SX7P), hard hit by Italy's bond selloff and euro break-up fears, enjoyed a rally as Rome averted snap elections. But the turbulent times have revealed some cracks.If Italy's new government proceeds with big spending or plans for mini-BOTs, effectively a parallel currency, its debt rout may resume, alongside selling of shares and bonds of banks with Italian exposure. French lenders stand out here:  BNP Paribas 's exposure to the Italian sovereign is a quarter of its core capital buffer while  Credit Agricole 's is 14.3 percent.Second, money markets are hinting at signs of funding stress; 3-month Euribor -- the rate at which eurozone banks lend to each other -- has risen to nearly six-month highs. But French banks may be driving Euribor rises too, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) report said, noting that French lenders, which raise a lot of U.S. dollar funding, may have been driven into euro markets by the recent rises in LIBOR-OIS spreads.Meanwhile, credit default swaps for European banks have soared, with Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) and BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP) trading at one-year highs.Finally, there are concerns about  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). The lender's shares have slumped and bonds and CDS have jumped after reports the Fed considers the bank's U.S. operations as ""troubled"".Deutsche Bank gets ECB, key investor support as S&P questions strategyItaly and other euro zone sovereign and bank CDS surgeTo view a graphic on European Banks - Credit Default Swaps, click: https://reut.rs/2JlDRuB4/ NEW FRAMEWORK, NEW LUCKAnother nail-biting week lies ahead for Turkey: Monday brings an inflation print that may show that the recent currency rout has exacerbated stubbornly high, double-digit price growth.Then the central bank meets on Thursday to decide on interest rates after administering a 300 basis-point emergency rate hike in May and launching a simplified interest rate framework on June 1.The bank is caught between President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-styled enemy of interest rates who also faces elections on June 24 - and markets that want higher rates in order to combat inflation.The lira has risen off record lows plumbed in May but remains 18 percent below end-2017 levels.

137,"May 30, 2018 11:20PM ET",China's Factory Gauge Beats Estimates on Global Trade Resilience,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s official factory gauge rose more than estimated as export orders accelerated, signaling trade continues to drive expansion as the global economy powers through risks.The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.9 in May, exceeding all forecasts in Bloomberg’s survey of economists, who projected the gauge to remain unchanged at 51.4. The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, rose for a third straight month to 54.9, the statistics bureau said Thursday, from 54.8 in April. Levels above 50 indicate improvement.The PMI for new export orders increased to 51.2 from 50.7, readings of input and output prices climbed and inventories and backlogs of work declined.Activity is holding up even as debt curbs, trade tensions with the U.S. and political strife from Turkey to Italy cloud the overall outlook. A temporary truce between the two biggest economies on trade is in danger of breaking down after President Donald Trump said this week that the U.S. will pursue tariffs on Chinese goods, a potential headwind for domestic manufacturing.The PMI strength “highlights resilience of the economy at a time of external threats such as trade tensions with the U.S.,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Hong Kong. “Improved sentiment bodes well for activity in coming months across industries.”The economy is stable with improvement and the trend is sustainable, China National Radio reported Thursday, citing Premier Li Keqiang’s comments at a May 29 meeting.Still, the proportion of companies with tight funding conditions went up for a third month to 40.1 percent in May, underscoring the need to further strengthen financial support for the real economy, the statistics bureau said in a statement on its website.Short-Lived?The rebound “might be short lived, as growth of end demand such as infrastructure and property investment slumped in the past several months due partially to the government’s deleveraging efforts,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “We’re going to see strong headwinds in the second half.”More than 40 percent of businesses complained about labor and input prices, showing higher costs remain a major difficulty, the bureau said. An input prices sub-index rose to 56.7 from 53 a month earlier.“On the back of the concern about a slowing economy and the need to prioritize expanding domestic demand, the government has also been taking measures to boost infrastructure spending and front-load budgeted projects since a few weeks ago,” Chang Jian, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.The World Bank said in a report released Thursday that external risks for China have become more prominent and high corporate debt is the main domestic challenge. Bank economists maintained their forecast for the expansion to decelerate to 6.5 percent this year.The strong PMI reading should offer some relief for those concerned about an economic slowdown, according to Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong.“An outperforming first half can offer a buffer for China to deal with global uncertainties including a potential softening of European demand and Trump’s ad hoc measures,” he said."

142,"May 16, 2018 03:07AM ET","Japan's GDP ends best growth run in decades as spending, trade fade",nan,"By Stanley White and Leika KiharaTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year, suggesting growth has peaked after the best run of expansion in decades, unwelcome news for a government struggling to get traction for its reflationary policies.The world's third largest economy shrank by 0.6 percent on an annualized basis, a much more severe contraction than the median estimate for an annualized 0.2 percent decline.The contraction, which was driven by declines in investment and consumption and weaker export growth, comes as Japan Inc frets over the possible effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies on exports.It also highlights the central bank's vulnerability to an economic or financial shock after five years of heavy monetary stimulus has left it with little ammunition to defend growth.Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said there was no change to the government's view that the economy was recovering moderately, predicting a resumption in growth to be driven mainly by private consumption and capital expenditure.""But we need to be mindful of the impact of overseas economic uncertainty and market volatility,"" he added. External demand - or exports minus imports - added just 0.1 percentage point to first-quarter GDP as imports slowed more than exports.However, a breakdown of the data shows export growth is losing momentum, expanding just 0.6 percent in the first quarter after growth of 2.2 percent October-December last year. Slower export growth reflected a decline in shipments of mobile phone parts and factory equipment in the quarter, a government official said. This is a concern for Japanese manufacturers because many of these machines and electronic components are sent to China, where they are used to produce goods for export, but this trade is at risk if the Trump administration's threatened tariffs on Chinese exports go ahead. ""Globally, IT-related items have been in an adjustment phase, which weighed down Japan's exports and factory output,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.Economists say Japan's first-quarter contraction is temporary, but the rebound will not be nearly as strong as previous quarters.""The economy is not headed for a recession,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. ""However, it is clear that in the long term the pace of growth is slowing.""Wednesday's data marked the end to eight straight quarters of economic expansion, which was the longest stretch of growth since a 12-quarter run between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989. Fourth quarter growth was revised to an annualized 0.6 percent, down from the 1.6 percent estimated earlier.Capital expenditure fell 0.1 percent, down for the first time in six quarters, suggesting corporate investment is not as strong as many economists had expected. The median estimate was for a 0.4 percent increase.The capital spending figures may presage data due on Thursday that is forecast to show core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell in March for the first time in three months.Consumer spending fell marginally, registering a decline of less than one percentage point in the first quarter. The median estimate was for consumer spending to remain unchanged.""The economy is unlikely to continue to contract further. The global economy is performing well and the yen is trading beyond 110 yen against the dollar, so once exports start to grow again, the economy will return to a moderate growth path,"" said Maruyama of SMBC Nikko Securities.The first-quarter contraction could make Japanese politicians more reluctant to implement a hike in sales tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent scheduled for next year.A sales tax hike to 5 percent from 3 percent in 2014 caused a large fall in consumer spending and tipped the economy into recession.""The revised GDP data 2017 showed the economy had already started to slow down from the beginning of last year. And the economic contraction for January-March may support some ruling officials' call for a delay in a planned sales tax hike,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Securities.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The parties were adversaries as recently as March but now look likely to form Italy's next government.The euro (EUR=) was 0.3 percent higher at $1.1972, having fallen last week to $1.1823, its weakest since Dec. 22.""Italian politics aren't a major moving factor in the euro zone yet. It's not an existential threat and isn't driving a lot of positioning or putting the euro's bounce at risk,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.""I expect inflation will rebound in the euro zone and that will keep the European Central Bank's stimulus unwinding on track.""The dollar retreated further from a 2018 peak hit last week as traders booked gains on its recent run-up, spurred by the widening interest rate gaps in favor of the United States. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was down 0.1 percent at 92.515.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said the main catalyst for the dollar's surge was the lack of improvement in euro zone economic data, prompting investors to unwind record short-dollar bets, particularly against emerging market currencies.A loss of economic momentum in Europe has made policymakers in Europe and Britain more cautious about ending financial crisis-era policies.On Friday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone needed a new ""fiscal instrument"" to help weaker member nations if they were being overly penalized by investors during a debt crisis.Traders pushed out expectations of a rate hike in Britain to end-2018, and the European Central Bank boosting interest rates to the second half of 2019.Analysts at ACLS said they expected a reduction in trade tensions between the U.S. and China this week to fuel risk-on sentiment that would be positive for the Australian dollar and negative for the yen, considered a safe-haven currency.The Australian dollar was 0.2 percent higher at $0.7558  after rallying back from an 11-month low of $0.7413 plumbed on Wednesday.Investors this week are focused on speeches by Fed and ECB officials, as well as German GDP data due out on Tuesday and expected to show some slowdown in growth.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

145,"May 09, 2018 10:30PM ET",China Factory Inflation Pauses Slide as Consumer Prices Ease,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation gained pace, snapping a five-month streak of declines, while the consumer price index eased.The producer price index rose 3.4 percent in April from a year earlier, in line with the estimate in a Bloomberg survey and up from 3.1 percent in March. The consumer price index climbed 1.8 percent, the statistics bureau said Thursday, versus a forecast 1.9 percent gain and prior reading of 2.1 percent.Producer inflation pressures remain broadly on an easing trend since reaching an eight-year high in February 2017. In recent months solid external demand has helped underpin the economic expansion even as the trade tensions with the U.S. add uncertainty to the outlook.“Inflation remains well-behaved,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in a Bloomberg Television interview. “This means that monetary policy will remain steady. Benchmark rates will not be changed this year and rates used in open-market operations will be moved only marginally higher in lockstep with the Fed in terms of timing but by much smaller increments.”Despite a PPI acceleration from a year earlier influenced by a low base, factory prices fell from a month earlier, signaling that a turning point for the moderation in the headline index may not have been reached just yet.“Inflation pressure will pick up in coming months, but won’t rise to the level that would affect monetary policy,” said Zhu Qibing, chief macro-economy analyst at BOC International China Ltd. in Beijing. “PPI may continue to rebound on supply-side reforms and pollution curbs.”A gauge of raw materials producer prices picked up to 5.7 percent from 5.1 percent, while indexes for manufacturing and mining also gained.

146,"May 07, 2018 02:16AM ET",Dollar surge bringing emerging market rate cut cycle to a halt,nan,"By Marc Jones and Karin StroheckerLONDON (Reuters) - A resurgent dollar and higher borrowing costs are smashing through Argentina and Turkey's currencies like a wrecking ball and raising the likelihood more broadly that emerging markets' three-year long interest rate cutting cycle is at an end.Emerging markets came into the year flying, riding on the back of a healthy global economy and rising commodity prices alongside tame inflation and a weak dollar. It looked more than likely that a wave of rate cuts would keep rolling, allowing a bond rally to continue.From Brazil and Russia to Armenia and Zambia, developing countries, big and small, have been on a rate cutting spree. With hundreds of rate cuts since Jan. 2015, the average emerging market borrowing cost fell under 6 percent earlier this year from over 7 percent  at the time.Fund managers' profits too have soared in this time, with emerging local currency debt among the best performing asset classes, with dollar-based returns of 14 percent last year. Even in the first quarter of 2018, returns were a buoyant 4.3 percent Now though, almost exactly five years since the so-called taper tantrum shook an emerging market rally, these gains appear to be on the cusp of reversal.Argentina has jacked up its interest rates to 40 percent in response to a rout in its peso currency, while Turkey was also forced into a rate rise as its lira hit record lows against the dollar. Indonesia, after heavy interventions to stem rupiah bleeding, has also said it could resort to policy tightening.As emerging currencies slide almost everywhere, yields on bonds denominated in emerging market currencies are back up near 6.2 percent and returns are now negative for 2018 ""The rate cut trade has unwound,"" Naveen Kunam, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors said, citing the increased uncertainty on monetary policy.For decades, a rising dollar has spelt bad news for emerging markets and despite all the progress in the developing world in recent years, latest price moves show not that much has changed.With the dollar on the rise, emerging currencies have weakened some 3 percent in the past two weeks, as measured by a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) index .Figures from the Institute of International Finance this week showed that the result has been a faster exodus from EM debt than at a similar stage of the 2013 taper tantrum. At $5.5 billion in two weeks the IIF described it as the ""ghost of tantrums past"". RATE EXPECTATIONSIt has looked as though emerging economies had the upper hand over their old enemy -- inflation. Inflation has fallen below target to record lows in Russia, slipped to five-month lows in India and is projected at a below-target 3.8 percent in Brazil this year. Indonesian inflation in April was a 100 bps off year ago levels, data last week showed.But the shifts of recent weeks have prompted some analysts to reassess whether interest rate cuts can continue. In Russia for instance, analysts have reduced their bets on rate cuts after the central bank held rates in late April and now predict only one or two moves this year versus earlier calls for deeper cuts.Sberbank CIB analysts said they did not now expect a Russian rate cut to come before September. India, like all energy-importing emerging economies, is being hit also by the oil price rise -- each $10 rise in oil prices adds 0.8 percent to inflation there, analysts at TS Lombard calculate.In the past week, expectations for an interest rate hike in India over the coming 12 months have jumped -- markets now price more than two rate hikes compared to just over one, a week ago. Last year it was cutting rates.The question emerging market policymakers may ask themselves has changed, said Sebastien Barbe, global head of EM research and strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""Now the question for many central banks is: should they increase (rates) more quickly?"" he said.It is not only those that are normally vulnerable either. Even in the relatively calm backwaters of eastern Europe, the Czech central bank has warned it may have to raise rates again following a sudden slump in the crown.All that is a huge blow to fund managers who have piled into the EM asset class in anticipation the returns would continue. It may be especially painful for newcomers -- a raft of new funds have launched this year, including one from Franklin Templeton's high-profile portfolio manager Michael Hasenstab.Countries such as Indonesia where foreigners own a large share of their local bond markets have consequently been among the worst hit as investors jostle to sell.""If there are worries, this money will get out,"" Credit Agricole's Barbe said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

151,"Apr 19, 2018 09:20AM ET",Banks assess Rusal options as secondary prices fall,nan,"By Sandrine BradleyLONDON (LPC) - Lenders to Rusal are exploring how to get rid of their exposure to Russian aluminum company before a May deadline set by the US, as the fallout from fresh sanctions pulls Russian loan pricing lower in Europe’s secondary market.  In addition to a ban on lending to sanctioned entities, the US Treasury has given banks until May 7 to divest or transfer debt, equity, or other holdings in Rusal, energy firm EN+, and vehicle maker GAZ.The sanctions are more severe than those imposed in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of the Crimea, as the first forced disposal of now illiquid Russian debt will bring losses for lenders. ""How much worse can it be? If you're a forced seller you've lost already and will take a big hit. If people know that your risk is looking for a new home, that has a significant and severe price tag,"" a loan syndicate head said. Banks' main exposure is to Rusal, as EN+ and GAZ do not have any international syndicated loans. Rusal raised a US$1.7bn five-year pre-export finance term loan which was signed last May and pays 300bp over three-month Libor.Rusal warned that new sanctions could result in technical defaults in a stock exchange filing on April 9. It is one of the world's biggest aluminum producers and the price of aluminum and alumina has soared after its inclusion. The company's loan was last quoted at 98% of face value on April 11, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, and has not been quoted since.""All lenders to Rusal have been calling external cousel for advice - no-one is actually trying to sell the paper yet,"" a banker said.Banks including lead arrangers Bank of China, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Corporate & Investment Bank, ING Bank, Natixis, Nordea Bank,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), UniCredit and VTB Bank have transferred Rusal's loan into their bad loans or restructuring units, bankers said.Banks face write downs or writing off Rusal debt if buyers cannot be found. Lenders are also exploring options including freezing Rusal's loans and putting them in an escrow account if they are unable to sell.Even if buyers are found, funds from a sale could still be placed into escrow as it is unlikely that institutions will be willing or able to settle US dollar trades linked to Rusal, bankers said. “If we sell in US dollars no one will clear the settlement. One way around might be to settle in a different currency if possible,” a second banker said.Chinese banks have been named as possible buyers of Russian loans, but most Chinese banks will be unwilling to jeopardize their US operations, which could leave them unable to buy the debt. The Russian government and the country's state-owned banks are the most obvious buyers of Rusal paper, but most of these banks, including VTB and Sberbank, are also sanctioned.Unsanctioned Promsvayzbank could take on Rusal's debt with a guarantee from the Russian government, bankers said. A temporary nationalization of Rusal is another option, a Kremlin spokesman said on Thursday. PULLED LOWER The secondary pricing of some of Russia's top unsanctioned companies has also been pulled lower to around 98% of face value in Europe's secondary loan market since sanctions were announced on April 6. The loans are effectively illiquid, however, as banks monitor their exposure and whether or not they will be forced to divest more Russian assets. A US$2bn tranche of metal and mining company Norilsk Nickel’s US$2.5bn, five-year term loan was 1.25% lower at 98% on April 18, the data shows. Norilsk, which is also known as Nornickel, is the world's second biggest nickel producer and is part-owned by Rusal and sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska is the owner of EN+, which is the co-owner of Rusal and Norilsk Nickel.The price of nickel surged to its highest level since late 2014 on Thursday, on fears that US sanctions on Rusal could be broadened and hit the company. Several loans for the potash group Uralkali have fallen including a US$850m 2017 revolving credit facility which was 1% lower at 98%. Uralkali’s US$1.2bn term loan maturing in April 2021 has fallen 0.5% to 99% and a US$530m term loan which matures in April 2019 has fallen 0.12% to 99.625%.Fertilizer producer Eurochem’s US$800m, five-year term loan was 0.5% lower at 98.5%. Oil producer Gazpromneft’s US$2.15bn five year loan which matures in November is 0.5% lower at 99%.Metals miner Polymetal’s US$350m four year pre-export finance facility maturing in September 2019 has fallen 0.7% to 99% of face value and a US$125m loan due in August 2023 for shipping company Sovcomflot has fallen 1% to 96% of face value.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Qatar denies this, and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty.Qatar issued $12 billion of bonds last week, its first international debt sale since the dispute erupted.The gas-rich Gulf state had appointed eight banks including Mizuho, part of Japan's Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), to lead a series of investor meetings ahead of the issue. But when the bond was marketed on Thursday, Mizuho was no longer in the group.""Mizuho can confirm it was a bookrunner to the State of Qatar’s U.S. Dollar denominated bond sale, and has since withdrawn from the transaction,"" the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.""Due to client confidentiality, we are not able to provide further comment on the matter.""International banks with business in the Gulf have been treading carefully since the regional dispute flared up, seeking to maintain relationships on both sides.HSBC (L:HSBA), one of the most active banks in the Gulf, turned down a role in Qatar's bond sale as it had decided not to take high-profile roles in major Qatari debt transactions, sources told Reuters earlier this year. The bank, however, retains a branch in Qatar and has not disengaged from the country.Last week, while Qatari representatives were meeting global investors ahead of the bond deal, Saudi Arabia surprised markets with a jumbo bond transaction, which raised $11 billion. The move was seen by many market players as an attempt to absorb demand from investors and force Qatar to offer higher yields to attract interest in its deal.One Qatari source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday that Mizuho was ""pressured to withdraw from the transaction,"" especially as ""another country"" was going to the market at the same time.When asked if the Qatari deal was a consideration in the timing of the Saudi bond, the head of Saudi Arabia's debt management office told Reuters last week the decision was determined by market conditions.The banks hired as bookrunners for the Saudi bond deal included Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs International (N:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).No bank on that deal also worked on the Qatari bond, which was arranged by Al Khaliji,  Barclays  (L:BARC), Crédit Agricole CIB (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), QNB Capital (QA:QNBK) and  Standard Chartered  Bank (L:STAN).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from last week of a weaker dollar and favorable conditions for risk taking,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Manuel Oliveri.Against a broad basket of its rivals (DXY), the dollar was flat at 89.75.

In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position valued at $27.21 billion, its biggest since August 2011.Other major currencies also remain trapped in trading ranges, with the euro starting the week around $1.23, a level around which it had traded all last week.The U.S. Treasury semi-annual report didn't jolt the currency markets, with the Trump administration again refraining from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators as it pursues potential tariffs and negotiations to try to cut a massive trade deficit with China. Although the Japanese yen usually draws demand in times of political tension and market turmoil due to its perceived safe-haven status, the dollar's losses against it were small.""The reaction in currencies has been limited as President Trump had provided advance notice about a possible strike on Syria, giving speculators ample time to brace for the actual event,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.""Many speculators are showing less of a response to yen-supportive factors lately, after the Bank of Japan made clear it was not going to normalize policy soon. This goes for domestic factors as well, like falling support ratings for (Japan Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe.""Support for Abe, plagued by accusations of cronyism and cover-ups, fell to 26.7 percent in a survey by private broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday, the lowest since he took office in December 2012.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It will also place $3 billion of 10-year bonds at a spread of 170 basis points and $6 billion of 30-year securities at 205 basis points, said the person, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public.The sale comes as the Middle East’s security risk eased after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that military action in Syria may not be imminent and Russia toned down its rhetoric. A strike against Syria seemed imminent on Wednesday and hurt investor sentiment.Qatar, in the midst of a diplomatic and trade standoff with a group of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia, plans to bridge its budget deficit of $7.6 billion with debt offerings. Initial price indications on the bonds were about 50 to 70 basis points wider than where the country’s existing bonds traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Qatar has managed the regional boycott very well,” said Hakki Kalsen, a portfolio manager for emerging-market debt at Union Investment Privatfonds in Frankfurt, said before the sale. “At current energy prices, they should have a fiscal surplus.”Qatar is the world’s richest country per capita on a purchasing power parity basis, and the country is rated three notches higher than Saudi Arabia by S&P Global Ratings. The direct economic and financial impact of the diplomatic rift is now fading, the International Monetary Fund said last month.The nation’s economic growth is expected to accelerate to 2.8 percent this year, almost double the pace forecast for Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

While firms in the country have been laboring under sanctions in one form or another since 2014, the latest penalties are much tougher as they include a ban on publicly-traded Russian companies, such as United Co. Rusal.Some analysts and traders are comparing this week’s market volatility to jitters last seen in 2014, when the ruble fell to a record low during the height of the Ukraine conflict and an almost 50 percent drop in the price of oil. This time around, however, economic fundamentals and oil trading at around $70 a barrel play in Russia’s favor, according to Barbe.“There’s a big difference between now and 2014, because at that time the main trigger, the main negative factor, was the collapse of oil prices,” Barbe said. “Now that oil is calm, Russia is out of the recession, Putin was just re-elected, people will look at the asset prices, at the economic fundamentals and some will be tempted to buy amid expectations of stabilization.”Brave FacesRussian officials are putting on brave faces, saying the sanctions pose no threat to financial stability and don’t require any response from authorities. The ruble’s floating exchange rate helps the economy adapt to shocks, and the central bank can use interest rates to offset any increase in inflation caused by currency weakness, central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday.Still, an air of unpredictability about who or what might be the next target is spooking foreign investors. One trend Barbe sees as exacerbating the ruble weakness is a sell-off in Russia’s local debt, known as OFZs, by foreigners, who hold a record-high 34 percent.The pressure may ease once these investors have had a chance to assess the impact of the latest U.S. moves, Barbe said. “People need some time to figure out what the new sanctions mean,” he said."

Just last month, the consensus was for the central bank to hold fire until at least the second half of 2019.""The forecast for inflation suggests that after a temporary decline, which we have already seen, inflation will move slightly higher and this will force a hike,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist for ex-Japan Asia at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB.After hitting a low of 1.46 percent in June 2017, consumer price inflation steadily rose to a 17-month high in December. However, February's inflation print showed inflation at 4.4 percent, giving the RBI a breather. According to the central bank's own projections, inflation is likely to average 5.1-5.6 percent for the first half of the 2018-19 fiscal year, before hovering around 4.5 percent for the remainder of the year.While the median consensus of economists predicts a rate hike early next year, almost a third of respondents forecast the RBI will lift rates by the end of September.Several of them also expect another rate hike before end-2018.Against a backdrop of government fiscal slippage, the RBI would focus on ""price stability"", higher bond yields and sticky inflation near the upper band of its target, according to Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank.""The fact that evidence of underlying inflation is picking up...should tilt them toward one rate hike to calibrate policy,"" Mizuho's Varathan said. ""The growth story is also going to align nicely with the RBI's position because we are coming off a soft base after the demonetization and GST impact ... the policy decision becomes less of a dilemma and the clarity with which they need to act solidifies in the second half of this year.""If the RBI does raise rates when expected, it would follow other major central banks which are already tightening policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates in March and is expected to follow it up with three more hikes this year, according to a separate Reuters poll.(Polling by Shaloo Shrivastava and Anisha Sheth; Editing by Kim Coghill)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Global markets were shaken last week after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, edging the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war, but latest reports indicated a slightly more selective stance.The United States asked China in a letter last week to cut the tariff on U.S. autos, buy more U.S.-made semiconductors and give U.S. firms greater access to the Chinese financial sector, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources.U.S. stock futures (ESc1) were up 1.4 percent in London trade after major U.S indices fell sharply on Friday. (N)""Risk sentiment remains cautious and we remain bearish on the dollar's outlook in the absence of any fundamental changes despite the rate differential factor supporting the greenback,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.Against a broad basket of its rivals, the dollar (DXY) edged 0.3 percent lower after last week's 0.8 percent fall.The dollar's strength against the yen was also due to Japanese factors such as growing views that a political scandal in Tokyo could deepen, with a figure in a cronyism controversy surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe due to testify in parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister's ""Abenomics"" economic measures have been a factor in pulling the yen down over the past few years to the benefit of Japanese exporters. Any event that leads to a decline in his support ratings is seen weakening his ability to keep Abenomics in place.""With worries about the United States and China locking horns on trade issues and Japan's parliamentary testimony coming up on Tuesday, few participants are willing to buy the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.According to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators' net short positioning on the yen shrank rapidly to roughly 22,000 contracts in the latest week, the smallest since November 2016, from a net short position of about 79,500 contracts.The Australian dollar added 0.6 percent to $0.7749  and the New Zealand dollar  gained nearly 1 percent to $0.7297, in a further sign that risk aversion was fading from the markets for now.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

159,"Mar 18, 2018 08:30AM ET",Investors eye currencies for those most at risk in a trade war,nan,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange markets appear convinced that a global trade war is unlikely to break out anytime soon, although with long bets on some currencies at record highs, investors fear complacency may be setting in.While the Trump administration's threat to slap tariffs on Chinese imports has heightened fears of retaliation from Beijing, it has only mildly rattled markets enjoying a multi-year rally as global economic growth picks up.The finance ministers of the 20 big world powers meet for a key G20 summit on Monday. Currency managers are keen to see whether diplomacy breaks out or disagreements deepen between the U.S. and others in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Currencies don't like trade spats. President Obama's relatively narrow tariffs on Chinese steel in May 2016 saw the dollar index (DXY) fall more than 2 percent over a month. Against the yuan, it rose 2 percent . Similarly, within three months of President George Bush's March 2002 tariffs on EU steel imports, the dollar declined 6 percent.The latest trade skirmishes come as global currency volatility slips back after a February spike off multi-year lows. It remains below levels seen in recent months, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) volatility gauge. That leaves investors looking for early warning signs in currency markets that a broader shake-up of prices is coming.Some currencies have moved as one would expect when smooth trade is under threat: The Canadian dollar has weakened and the Japanese yen has firmed, but the moves have for the most part been limited.""The talk of trade wars at the moment is just that, talk. It's such a difficult thing to quantify it appears as if the market is just ignoring it,"" said Russell Silberston, a currencies manager at Investec Asset Management, which manages about $140 billion in assets.""But don't get me wrong, we've got it (the prospect of a trade war) down as a key event risk.""Currency repercussions should a trade war materialize would be significant because low volatility levels have driven investors to embrace higher-risk strategies. Speculative positions in emerging market currencies, for instance, stand at multi-year highs.""I'm still amazed by the lack of a reaction in Asian currencies. They must be waiting for the Chinese retaliation,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global, a currency investment manager in London.""There would be quite meaningful moves. We are talking about Asian currencies that are at their strongest for years. There is zero of this (the risk of protectionism) priced in,"" he said.(Graphic: FX volatility - http://reut.rs/2pfHuaa) Benson believes big Asian exporters are most at risk, including the South Korean won  and the Taiwanese dollar  as well as the Australian dollar  - a proxy for Asian economic growth.The won and the Singapore dollar , another currency exposed to global trade flows, are trading near their strongest levels against the dollar in more than three years.Among developed world currencies, Sweden's crown (EURSEK=) is tipped by some for a tough time - ING strategists point out Sweden is the second-most open economy in the G10 group of rich countries based on a ratio of trade and economic output. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) sees the Canadian dollar  most at risk, while the U.S. and New Zealand dollars also look vulnerable. The Swiss franc and euro would emerge stronger, they said.DOLLAR DILEMMAMuch of the confidence that the world will ride out Trump-inspired tariffs is because a sustained rebound in trade has buoyed growth, with the global economy set to expand at its fastest pace in six years.While governments often move to protect local industry when growth is struggling, any Trump tariffs will come at a time when the world's biggest economic engines - the United States, Europe and China - are booming.Another explanation for the currency calm is that many market watchers do not believe Trump will follow through on his threats. David Bloom, head of global currency research at HSBC, is convinced U.S. officials may find a weaker dollar an easier solution in their bid to slash the huge U.S. trade deficit.So what does rising protectionism mean for the dollar? In the short-term, the dollar is likely to weaken, especially against the euro and yen. But should global growth tank or markets sink into a broader sell-off, the dollar should benefit from its status as a global reserve currency.RISING YENInvestors are at least convinced about one winner: the yen, backed by a huge current account surplus and its reputation as a safe-haven thanks to the trillions of dollars that Japanese investors have poured into overseas assets.""If there is a trade war, the yen is the safe-haven currency of choice,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).The yen has gained 6 percent so far this year and is near a 1-1/2 year high versus the dollar thanks in part to bets that the Bank of Japan will pull the plug on its massive bond-buying program.(Graphic: Current account balance, % of GDP - http://reut.rs/2HERLUk)BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, has studied immediate market reactions around six major trade risk events in the last 15 years and concludes that gold and the yen tend to outperform.In a note, they called a trade war ""arguably the most disruptive"" market risk for 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

160,"Mar 16, 2018 05:01PM ET",Popular Nafta Arbitrage Trade Sours as Trump Aims Fury North,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- With Nafta negotiations coming to a head, one of the most popular trades to profit from the talks is souring as U.S. President Donald Trump and his proxies redirect many of their sharpest barbs away from Mexico toward America’s neighbor to the north.The Canadian dollar’s four-month, 12 percent surge versus the Mexican peso to end 2017 seems like ancient history now, replaced by a slide of almost 9 percent this year. For strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce who timed it right, calls to buy the loonie and sell the peso on the notion Mexico faced higher hurdles to an accord and more risk should talks fail proved a boon. Yet others late to the rally, including  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA, had to abandon the call as U.S.-Canada tensions flared.Trump’s discontent with Canada comes with the loonie hardly in need of more bad news. The currency has broken through C$1.30 per U.S. dollar as the Bank of Canada strikes a dovish tone after a run of soft economic data and growing concerns over household indebtedness. The loonie-peso exchange rate may be set for more turbulence in the aftermath of Trump’s recent steel and aluminum tariffs which, while exempting the nations for now, introduced another wrinkle to a fraught trading outlook for the two currencies.“The fact that there’s some uncertainty as to whether the tariffs are tied with the negotiations indicates that the peso and specifically the Canadian dollar will be more sensitive to Nafta-related headlines going forward,” said Bipan Rai, CIBC’s North America head of foreign-exchange strategy. The bank initiated the trade recommendation at 14 pesos per loonie in August, and closed it at a 7.4 percent profit in November.Canada and the U.S. are at odds in roughly five core North American Free Trade Agreement disputes, with Trudeau and Trump speaking about the pact as recently as this week. Trump said in a March 10 speech that Canada has been “brutal” in trade with the U.S., about a month after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his nation is prepared to walk away from Nafta discussions rather than accept “any old deal.”The tensions have eased somewhat over the past few days, with Trudeau expressing confidence Wednesday that an agreement will ultimately be reached. Incoming White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has been a staunch proponent of accord, giving it a high-profile backer within Trump’s inner circle.“There’s been some very specific U.S.-Canada trade issues, and Canadians pushed back against some of the U.S. policy in those areas,” said Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Agricole. Combined with the Bank of Canada’s recent wariness over escalating trade tensions, “that could be something that restrains the Canadian dollar.”In addition to the loonie’s slump against the peso, it’s fallen about 3.5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, making it the worst performing Group-of-10 currency. Both CIBC and Credit Agricole say the loonie’s slide versus the peso will soon slow, given the speed of its recent selloff.Rai doesn’t expect the loonie-peso exchange rate to move below 14.25, from roughly 14.3160 as of 11:23 a.m. Thursday New York time. Serebriakov sees the cross rebounding in the Canadian dollar’s favor in the coming weeks.(Updates with Kudlow support for Nafta in sixth paragraph.)"

At the same time, pricing on the dollars tightened to 300bp over Libor, at 99.875 OID from launch guidance of 325bp over Libor at 99.5 OID.The increase in dollar loans pushed senior leverage slightly higher to 4.98 times from 4.89 times, while total leverage on the deal remained the same at 6.23 times, the sources said.BIG TESTWith around 80 investors taking varying size tickets in the loans, Flora captured a vast amount of liquidity from both CLOs and managed accounts, the sources said.While the US market is significantly bigger, this deal is likely to fuel confidence in bankers and borrowers that a large amount of liquidity can be raised in euros and sterling from European investors.“Raising €2.8bn-equivalent is probably about as big as it gets in the European market. In order to get that amount done, more was raised so a borrower could most probably raise a bit more with generous pricing but would top out at around €3bn-€3.5bn,” a senior banker said.Pricing on the euros and sterling is set to close in line with initial guidance of 350bp over Euribor and 400bp over Libor, respectively. There is also a €475m-equivalent zloty tranche that is slightly smaller than the €500m-equivalent initially guided but it closed in line with initial pricing guidance of 350bp over Wibor.The senior unsecured bonds, which now total €994m from €1.050bn, are yet to launch.POWER OF KKRKKR agreed to buy the unit, which includes the brands Becel, Flora, Country Crock and Blue Band, for €6.83bn, it was announced in December.A large number of investors bought the loan thanks to KKR's track record in carve outs and turnarounds. It led investors to buy into the private equity firm’s growth story for the unit.“Investors either believed KKR’s vision or they didn’t. It is a big business and there are inevitable carve out risks but in terms of sponsors they have good experience,” a senior investor said.The unit is also highly cash generative, so whether investors believe in the equity story or not, many felt comfortable investing on a senior debt basis.“It is not completely straight forward as a credit and there are things you have to get comfortable with. To a large extent investors are buying into KKR and their ability to improve the business in a reasonably tough market. But it is good for investors as it is cash generative so the senior debt looks pretty solid,” a second senior investor said.A number of other investors took tickets on the basis that the loan is big and their portfolios needed diversity and exposure to the paper, which is expected to be highly liquid and one of the main flow names in the secondary loan market.DECLINED TO PLAYA few investors took issue with the loan and decided not to play, either because they didn’t believe in the business case or because they didn’t agree with aggressive documentation features such as the ability to repay the sub-debt first.“It is over-levered with not enough equity from KKR, and the term sheet was terrible. One clause they wanted [enables] the repayment of the junior debt before the senior, which just totally goes against the principle of senior-junior lending,” a third senior investor said.A fourth investor added: “Developed markets are declining, people are cooking less and eating less bread. We don’t expect a hockey stick recovery and it runs totally contrary to the macro-trend of eating less animal-based products. They talked a lot about improving the image of product, and mentioned how annoying it is that butter is thought of as much healthier.”While documentation was seen as aggressive, the ability to repay the junior debt -- that has also featured on other loans recently -- is unlikely to be used in this instance, given the expensive call-protection that will offered on the bonds, one of the sources said.ALLOCATIONThe covenant-lite term loans are all offered with a 0% floor and are set to allocate on Wednesday at 99.875 OID on the dollars and 99.5 OID on the euros, sterling and zloty. They are all offered with 101 soft-call protection for six months.The loans pay a ticking fee of 50% of the interest margin between 45-90 days and the full margin thereafter. They pay nothing up to 45 days.The financing also includes a €700m 6.5-year revolving credit facility, paying 300bp over Euribor with a 0% floor. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and KKR Capital Markets led the debt financing, along with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on the dollar tranche. BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, ING, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), Mizuho, RBC,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UniCredit were bookrunners.Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Mbank, Mediobanca, Rabobank, Raiffeisen were mandated lead arrangers.The loans were issued through Sigma Bidco BV and Sigma US Corp.The company is holding off the bond launch for now, despite the fact that often bonds will launch towards the end of a loan syndication process in order that both instruments allocate at the same time.“The bond info is not ready yet. Because it is a carve out they are waiting for the right audited numbers. The deal is also not closing until the close of Q2 so there is no rush to issue the bonds into escrow and pay them,” the senior banker said."
165,"Mar 05, 2018 04:31AM ET","BOJ Has Tools When Needed to Exit in Stable Manner, Amamiya Says",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan has the tools to eventually exit its record monetary easing without disrupting markets, according to Masayoshi Amamiya, a nominee for one of the two deputy governor positions at the central bank.The BOJ can adjust bond yields in a stable manner when the time comes for it to start normalizing its policy, Amamiya said at a confirmation hearing in parliament on Monday. The comments came after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that during the fiscal year starting in April 2019 the BOJ would probably be considering the details of any exit.Amamiya’s position on exit and a comment that monetary policy is not all powerful contrast starkly with the views of Masazumi Wakatabe, the nominee for the other deputy governor post. Wakatabe, also speaking in parliament, said there were theoretically no limits to what the BOJ can do to achieve the 2 percent inflation target, and it should mull boosting stimulus if it became hard for prices to hit that level.“Amamiya and Wakatabe played it safe at the hearing” said Kyohei Morita, chief Japan economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), noting that Kuroda’s comments had stirred up markets last week. “They indicated that it’s very unlikely for the BOJ to change policy anytime soon.”The two men are likely to be approved by parliament, and will join the policy board for the April meeting. Along with Kuroda, who was nominated for another term, they will continue to face questions and doubts about the sustainability and future of the BOJ’s policies. Even after five years of stimulus under Kuroda, inflation is still less than half the bank’s target and it’s bought so many assets over that period that its balance sheet is almost the same size as Japan’s annual output.Read more on Kuroda’s search for an exit from stimulusThe two men had the same take on the overall effects of BOJ policy - the positives outweigh the side-effects, including the impact that the negative rate is having on financial institutions. However, while Amamiya cautioned that the position of Japan’s banks were getting worse and that was partly due to the BOJ’s low-interest rate policy, Wakatabe said that the negative side-effects of BOJ stimulus hadn’t manifested much yet.The yen fluctuated as the two nominees spoke. It was trading at 105.55 per dollar as of 6:03 p.m. in Tokyo after hitting a high of 105.25 against the greenback on March 2, the highest in more than a year.Amamiya on ExitAmamiya said the BOJ has tools to normalize its balance sheet and raise interest rates, saying that the bank won’t need to sell lots of JGBs to raise rates. Instead it could use maturing debt to cut its balance sheet, undertake operations to absorb short-term funds, or raise the interest rate it charges banks on part of the money that they have to keep at the central bank.“When that situation arrives, I think it’s technically possible to adjust rates gradually while maintaining the market’s stability,” Amamiya said. “In what order and how we use policy options will depend on economic conditions at that time. That’s why we’ve been saying it’s too early.”Morita said it was interesting to see Amamiya admitting limits and costs of monetary policy while Wakatabe said there was no limit. Amamiya pledged to be watchful about costs and benefits of current easing, while Wakatabe offered the expected dovish tone with his comments on the importance of hitting 2 percent inflation target before any exit, according to Morita.For Wakatabe, just reaching 2 percent inflation isn’t enough - prices in Japan need to continue at that level for some time before it’s safe to start cutting back on stimulus, he said. “The BOJ must especially avoid the risk of slipping back into deflation as a result of changing its policy too early.”“From an academic economic perspective, there is no limit to monetary policy,” Wakatabe said. “We must think deeply about the sustainability of monetary policy, and what would be most sustainable, but I think there are no problems concerning sustainability.”(Adds economist’s comment, more comments from Wakatabe, Amamiya.)"

Against the euro (EURJPY=EBS) and sterling (GBPJPY=EBS), the yen was 0.3 and 0.5 percent higher respectively. Speculation about when the BOJ, which has significantly lagged its peers in moving toward policy normalization, would explore an exit from easy policy has been one of the key themes impacting the yen.DOLLAR WEAKENSThe dollar was on the back foot even before Kuroda spoke, having pulled sharply back from six-week highs after U.S. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum took the wind out of the greenback's week-long recovery.The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) fell 0.1 percent to 90.194.Trump announced on Thursday that he would impose large tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners such as China, Europe and Canada.But investors were wary of kicking the dollar much lower, particularly against the euro and sterling, due to looming political developments.The focus for the euro was on Sunday's Italian parliamentary election and the level of support for populist agendas that could have a wider impact on the European Union.Also on Sunday, Germany's Social Democrats announce the result of a binding members' vote on a coalition deal that would secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.The single currency (EUR=EBS) was flat around $1.2271.British Prime Minister Theresa May will lay out her views on how to keep trade open between all of the United Kingdom and the European Union in a key speech at around 1330 GMT on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

167,"Mar 01, 2018 09:31PM ET",China GDP Target to Set Tone for Xi's Two-Week Power Summit,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- A momentous fortnight for China’s economy begins next week when leaders set policies for the year and detail plans to curb financial risk, air pollution, and excess industrial capacity.Things kick off Monday morning in Beijing with Premier Li Keqiang’s work report outlining 2018 goals for economic growth, money supply, credit growth, inflation and the fiscal deficit.Senior appointments, including those for central bank governor and, potentially, chief of a merged financial regulator, will also be announced or discussed at the meeting, providing more fodder for analysts and economists to shape the outlook for the coming year. It all wraps up around two weeks later with Li’s annual press briefing on policy goals.Click here: Here’s what we know about when a new PBOC chief gets namedThe pow-wow comes as concern is creeping into analysts’ views on the economic outlook. Though 2017 outperformed and economists have been upgrading forecasts for this year, Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). have all warned of a slowdown.Key to watch will be policy targets and economic policy appointments. The report itself is long and detailed: last year’s -- read it here -- ran more than 15,000 words in English.President Xi Jinping didn’t specify a longer-term growth target at the twice-a-decade Party Congress in October, and policy emphasis has shifted toward quality of growth over quantity. That’s led some to say China should ditch its long-standing practice of setting a numerical growth target in favor of a forecast. But Yang Weimin, an official from the Communist Party committee overseeing economic policy, says targets won’t be abandoned before 2020.The annual target remains a crucial barometer of official thinking because it shows how policy makers seek to balance competing aims of growth, reform and financial deleveraging, says Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney.While markets anticipate a target of about 6.5 percent again this year, a wider goal of 6 percent to 7 percent would signal seriousness in reducing financial risk, cutting pollution, and reining in local government finance and excess capacity, says David Loevinger, a former China specialist at the U.S. Treasury.Market JittersThere’s a chance markets, which are now sanguine about the growth outlook, may be roiled if the target looks “softer” than usual with greater tolerance for slower growth, Oliver says.""The growth target will remain extremely important for them because they’re still bound by the 10-year objective of doubling GDP by 2020"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. ""The good thing is this objective requires growth to average only 6.3 percent in the coming three years, so they can afford a weaker growth target.""Li will also unveil objectives for inflation, money supply, aggregate finance and the fiscal balance, and may signal more tightening of debt controls. China plans to reduce its annual budget-deficit target to just under 3 percent of total economic output, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA sees the inflation ceiling remaining at 3 percent. China International Capital Corp. sees the aggregate finance target staying at about 12 percent.Li may downplay the M2 money supply target, which is becoming less important because it’s less controllable and relevant to the economy as markets and financial products become more complicated, CICC says. January M2 growth of 8.6 percent was far below the target.Personnel ChangesThe new economic policy team is another must watch area, specifically the role for Xi confidant Liu He and Zhou Xiaochuan’s replacement as central bank governor.Liu is widely expected to become vice premier in charge of the economy, replacing Ma Kai, and lead the Financial Stability and Development Committee overseeing financial regulation. Research firm Trivium China says he also has the inside track to be central bank governor and that banking regulator Guo Shuqing will likely be the PBOC’s party secretary.A Liu-Guo combination at the central bank would be “a dream team for foreign investors and a nightmare for shadow bankers,” says Loevinger, now an analyst at fund manager TCW Group Inc. in Los Angeles. Hubei provincial party chief Jiang Chaoliang is another contender.China also is considering a merger of its banking and insurance regulators, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Trivium says it likely will be headed by People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang.(Updates to add strategist comment in 10th paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Kevin Hamlin in Beijing at khamlin@bloomberg.net.To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Jeff Kearns©2018 Bloomberg L.P."

The security of a deposit is by essence costly,"" Frederic Oudea, chief executive of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said earlier this year.Established banks, such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Societe Generale and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are facing increased competition from the likes of new online low-cost banks such as N26 or Orange bank.Consultancy firm EY estimated that the new low-cost online banks now have a five percent share of the French market which totals 120 million accounts.Analysts had predicted that this could spark a price war as happened in France's telecoms sector, while the established banks have invested a lot to retain clients with their own low-cost offers, such as BNP Paribas' Hello Bank!, Boursorama for SocGen or EKO for cooperative group Credit Agricole.""We are very far from the situation which was observed in the French telecom industry in 2012 when telecom operators had to face a period of several months of declines in average revenue per user,"" said Axel Duplan, a senior manager at EY. That is partly because French retail banking clients have so far tended not to leave their established lender, instead open new accounts at lower cost online banks for daily use.""Customers don't yet change banks frequently, not seeing them as easily replaceable as digital providers, but we believe this shift could occur in the medium term as the new legal framework eases banking mobility,"" analysts at ratings agency S&P said in a note.French bank clients like not only having an account but also savings products, life, auto, property, and health insurance that online banks are so far not able to provide, S&P said.BNP Paribas' chief financial officer Lars Machenil said in February it was yet to see the impact of the arrival of Orange bank and a step-up in competition.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

170,"Feb 23, 2018 07:48AM ET",Euro set for second biggest weekly drop in four months as hedges in focus,nan,"By Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Friday and is set to post its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months as investors focused on adding hedges to their portfolios before a big week for foreign exchange markets from a European politics perspective.The outcome of the Italian general election is due on March 4 and the German Social Democrats poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets which may trigger fresh market volatility. Hedging-related strategies were popular as investors rushed to the currency derivative markets in short tenors to buy option contracts to cover the period over those two events.In a market where long euro bets are at their largest on record, according to CFTC positioning data, any less than optimal results from either of these two major political events may prompt some hedge funds to sell the single currency.One trader at a European bank said demand for currency options for euro/dollar around the 1.21 and 1.25 levels over one-week and two-week tenors were seeing ""decent demand"".Thomson Reuters data showed a buildup in large option bets around those levels. Implied volatility on the euro for two-week maturities , a gauge of expected currency swings, was at its highest levels since the outcome of the French elections last April, indicating that some investors were taking no chances.Risk reversals for two-week maturities, a measure of the extent of positioning in currency derivatives, showed a distinct pick up in the preference for buying euro/dollar puts rather than calls, suggesting investors were protecting against downside risks.However, market analysts cautioned against reading too much into the derivative markets as the overall perception of political risk in Europe has reduced considerably.""Political risk is not as much of a factor for the euro as it was last year as risk perception has moderated considerably and for good reason, with Eurosceptic parties moderating their stance to appeal to a wider base,"" said Lefteris Farmakis, a macro strategist at UBS in London.CONSTRUCTIVE OUTLOOK However, with recent surveys and the European Central Bank's minutes of its January policy showing some signs of caution among policymakers about the bloc's economic prospects with the backdrop of a strong euro, investors are searching for fresh catalysts to drive the currency higher.""Apart from some political concerns, the dollar's outlook also appears to be more constructive in the short term thanks to the rising yields,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.Markets are assuming from opinion polls that there will be no clear winner to the Italian polls, with either some loose coalition or a minority government likely to emerge.Indicating the growing caution among European policymakers, ECB officials rejected even a token change in the bank's policy message, arguing that it was premature to signal policy normalization given weak inflation, the minutes of its January meeting showed on Thursday.That caution is also reverberating in the bond markets. While German government debt yields have risen by 38 basis points since early December, the rise has been slower than in the United States, where yields are up more than 50 bps.Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields (US10YT=RR) rose to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday before falling back to 2.904 percent on Thursday. The prospect of the U.S. government boosting debt issuance to fund expanded stimulus and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates steadily this year are some of the factors that have contributed to the rise in yields.The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.2 percent to 89.873 (DXY).The index reached a 10-day high of 90.235 on Thursday, from a three-year trough of 88.253 late last week, before its rally lost a bit of steam. It was on still on track to gain 0.9 percent on the week. The yen showed little reaction to data which showed Japan's annual core consumer inflation rate was unchanged in January from the previous month, reinforcing views that the Bank of Japan remains far from exiting its super loose monetary policy.Japan's nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in January. The pace remained far from the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 106.850 yen .  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

171,"Feb 15, 2018 07:30PM ET","Reuters poll: ECB rate rise? You have a very long wait, say economists",nan,"By Shrutee SarkarBENGALURU (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will end its asset purchase program by the end of the year and then wait six months before raising interest rates, according to economists polled by Reuters, who again upgraded their growth outlook for this year.While the euro zone economy is booming now, it is expected to lose some of that momentum. And inflation is not due to reach the central bank's target of just under 2 percent until at least 2020, according to the poll of around 80 economists.The ECB is due to stop buying 30 billion euros' worth of bonds each month after September. A debate is now raging over whether to end it sooner, even though inflation remains well below target and growth momentum is forecast to slow.But not a single economist polled by Reuters from Feb 11 to 15 thought the ECB would halt its asset-buying before September, and just under half of them, 25 of 57, said it would stop them by then. All but one of the remaining respondents said the asset purchase program (APP) would end in December.""The ECB is likely to add a tapering on top of the current announced program. That means that it will continue its APP beyond September 2018,"" wrote Louis Harreau, euro zone economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB. ""A three-months tapering seems to be enough for the doves and short enough for most of the hawks."" Whether to tighten policy when inflation remains weak is a dilemma faced by other major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise rates three times this year, despite U.S. policymakers also worried about relatively weak wage growth and inflation pressure. [ECILT/US]But the ECB is still at the stage of unwinding its extraordinarily aggressive stimulus left over from fighting the euro zone debt crisis and the ensuing deflationary threat.That risk is now long gone but inflation is still very tame, forecast to average 1.5 percent this year, unchanged from the previous poll, with a median ranging between 1.4 and 1.6 percent in each quarter through to the end of June next year.The highest inflation forecast in the entire series is 2.3 percent, in the third quarter of this year, while the low is 0.9 percent, well below the current rate and a percentage point below the central bank's target.CONVICTION FIRMINGECB President Mario Draghi last month pledged to keep rates steady until well after the quantitative easing program had concluded, saying asset purchases would continue until there was a sustained rebound in inflation.About 85 percent of more than 40 respondents in the latest Reuters poll who answered a separate question said their conviction about when the ECB will end its asset purchases had either increased or stayed the same.When asked how many months the ECB meant when it said ""well past"" the end of QE to raise rates, the consensus was six months, according to the poll of over 50 economists, with forecasts in the range of three to 18 months.The ECB is forecast to raise the deposit rate by 15 basis points to -0.25 percent by the end of the second quarter next year and to zero by the end of 2019, according to the poll.It is expected to raise the refinancing rate for the first time since 2011 in the second half of next year, taking it to 0.25 percent by the end of 2019 from zero percent now.The euro zone's exceptional economic performance is underpinning the optimism. It is easily outstripping growth in Britain, which is grappling with the terms on which it will leave the European Union next year after its 2016 Brexit vote.The 2018 growth outlook was once again revised up in the latest poll. That latest consensus is the best since polling began for the period in March 2016.Full year growth was expected to average 2.3 percent this year and 1.9 percent next, compared to 2.2 percent and 1.8 percent respectively in the previous poll. But economists say that optimism could fade if the euro (EUR=) keeps rising, a concern voiced by ECB policymakers. They don't want a stronger currency as it depresses import prices, getting in the way of meeting its inflation target.The single currency, which had its best run since 2003 last year, gaining over 14 percent against the dollar, is up more than 4 percent this year after recording its best monthly performance in January since its inception.A separate Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists showed any further spike in the euro could discomfort the ECB, with the $1.30 level likely to cause real concern.

178,"Jan 26, 2018 04:08AM ET",Euro gains as dollar bounce runs out of steam,nan,"By Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - The euro jumped more than half a percent higher on Friday as comments by senior U.S. officials this week advocating their support for a weak dollar reverberated through currency markets.Though U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Thursday that he wanted a ""strong dollar"" contradicted earlier comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, investors suspect a protracted decline in the greenback may be likely.""While President Trump has since said that he expects the dollar to get 'stronger and stronger', it will be hard for Washington to put the 'weak dollar' genie back in the bottle,"" Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London said in a note.In keeping with the rising theme of expecting more dollar weakness, UBS Wealth Management upgraded its six-month forecasts for the euro and sterling on Friday to $1.28 and $1.45 respectively.After Trump said on Thursday he ultimately wanted the dollar to be strong, the dollar pared losses against major currencies.But against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar last traded on Friday at 88.87, after hitting a three-year low of roughly around 88.43. The dollar index has slid more than three percent so far in January and is set for its biggest monthly drop since March 2016.Some market participants are also concerned that Trump may encourage more protectionist policies at a speech in Davos around 1300 GMT and at a State of the Union speech next week, policies that may ultimately end up pushing the dollar lower.Against the euro, the dollar's weakness was the most apparent, with the single currency up half a percent at $1.2465 and not far away from a December 2014 high of above $1.25 hit on Thursday.With European Central Bank President Mario Draghi declining to lean against the recent euro rally and instead signaling that economic data pointed to ""solid and broad"" growth, investors were encouraged to push the currency higher.Draghi also warned that the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the ECB might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on the benefits of a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions.""Draghi's reluctance to offer any resistance to the euro means that euro/dollar is only set to rise more in the coming months,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.4191, but remained well below its peak on Thursday of $1.4346, which was the pound's highest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016 as some investors turned bullish on the currency's outlook.Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.42 yen, staying above a four-month low of 108.50 yen struck on Thursday.Asked about the comments on the dollar by Trump and Mnuchin, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that major economies have agreed to avoid targeting currencies for the purpose of trade competitiveness.For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

179,"Jan 24, 2018 12:30AM ET",2018 global growth to roll to highs not seen in eight years: Reuters poll,nan,"By Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul KarunakarBENGALURU (Reuters) - The global economy is expected to grow at a robust pace this year and reach an altitude not seen since 2010, as momentum builds in developed economies and inflation revives, Reuters polls of over 500 economists showed.Major central banks are expected to move away from ultra-easy monetary policy this year, but borrowing costs are still accommodative and should underpin growth.The latest Reuters polls taken this month, covering more than 45 countries, not only underscored optimism on growth but also showed inflation forecasts were either upgraded or left unchanged in nearly 70 percent of those economies.""For the first time in a long while, global growth is speeding up away from its average rather than recovering back towards it,"" said James Sweeney, chief economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).The global economy is predicted to grow 3.7 percent this year, the fastest since the 4.3 percent in 2010.That was an upgrade from the 3.6 percent predicted in October's poll but lower than the International Monetary Fund's outlook of 3.9 percent growth this year.Nearly 70 percent of over 140 respondents who answered an extra question said the global economic boom was more likely to gain momentum this year and push inflation higher than currently predicted.Those expectations were largely driven by growth in developed economies, particularly the euro zone and the United States - which may not be firing on all cylinders yet but enough to keep things rolling.Surging business and consumer confidence and steady job creation have left economists repeatedly raising growth estimates for the euro zone and its major economies. The rising euro poses a threat in Europe and could challenge the European Central Bank as it moves to end its money printing by the end of the year.""All the conditions for the classic macroeconomic sequencing of a growth phase have now come together. All the countries in the EU have not only seen a return to positive growth but are showing a marked acceleration in activity,"" wrote Michael Carey, chief U.S. economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, in a note.""The ECB has again signaled that, despite the improved growth prospects, the process of monetary normalization will be slow, and it has managed to lock market expectations into its timetable.""But for Britain, above-target inflation and a buoyant job market won't push the Bank of England to tighten policy until at least November as it waits to see how divorce talks with the EU develop.The U.S. economy was predicted to grow at its fastest pace in three years in 2018, fueled by the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s, but economists said the expected boost will be short-lived and will keep the Federal Reserve on track with its current guidance of three interest rate increases this year.One conclusion from the latest surveys was inflation expectations, which showed the risk is now skewed more to the upside with last year's pessimism somewhat tempered.TRADE PROTECTIONISM THREAT LIMITEDWhile economists previously had repeatedly warned about ""deep uncertainty"" to the global economy from protectionist policies, particularly on U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policies, the latest polls showed that was slowly fading.Indeed, over 80 percent of nearly 140 economists who answered a separate question said any significant barriers to global trade in 2018 were unlikely.""Global trade barriers are definitely a downside risk to our forecasts this year, but is not our baseline case. No country will benefit from erecting trade barriers, so we see such an outcome as still unlikely,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.But the remaining 24 respondents said some barriers were likely to emerge. A few hurdles mentioned were the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks, Brexit negotiations and rising risks of a U.S. trade war with China.A majority of economists in a separate Reuters poll last week said NAFTA will probably be renegotiated successfully with no significant changes, despite the Trump administration's saber-rattling.""I still suspect that adults will prevail and NAFTA will not be allowed to collapse,"" said William Dickens, head of the economics department at Northeastern University in Boston.But concerns over U.S. protectionism and a nationalist presidential candidate have weighed on the peso, stoking fears of faster inflation in Mexico.Barring that country, the latest poll showed economists' confidence in Latin America's growth prospects strengthening ahead of major elections in the region. Expectations of solid economic growth though was not widespread to other emerging market economies, with Turkey, India and China forecast to slow this year.

Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2 percent on Monday (DXY), its lowest since early 2015.Its recent weakness against the euro has been marked, as the growing economic recovery in the euro zone spurs more investors to rebalance their portfolios towards the region.Speculators boosted net long positions in the euro to a record high for the week ending Jan. 12, according to the latest futures data. Against a basket of currencies, the euro is at its highest level since late 2014. ""We remain bullish on the euro in coming months because we expect that the political risks in the euro zone will finally start abating on a more sustained basis after the March election in Italy,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said.""In addition, we expect the ECB to continue to taper its asset purchases and, ultimately, stop expanding its balance sheet ... . "" The euro  was up 0.1 percent at $1.2218, adding to the gains it made last week after the ECB said it could revisit its communication stance in early 2018. That heightened expectations policymakers were preparing to reduce their stimulus program.Still, with the euro at three-year highs, some analysts cautioned that its strength would soon worry the ECB, encouraging it to talk down the currency.Against the yen, the dollar slipped to its lowest levels since mid-September, as comments from the head of the Bank of Japan highlighted Japan's economic recovery.Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its stimulus program until 2 percent inflation was achieved and maintained. But he also said the country's economy was expected to continue moderately expanding. Core consumer prices are rising around 1 percent, Kuroda said in a speech to BoJ regional branch managers. That was a slight change from his previous speech to branch managers, when he said core consumer prices were around zero.""We continue to see dollar/yen sellers, to be honest,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.""Let's see if we start to see some rumblings from Japanese officials, about yen strength,"" he said.

187,"Jan 04, 2018 07:30AM ET",Dollar Drop Could Force Global Central Banks Into Rates Rethink,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- A weaker dollar could be doing the work of global central banks.The greenback begins 2018 after its worst year since 2003, and analysts at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp. and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA say further declines could mean central banks don’t have to tighten monetary policy as much as they may now be planning.The argument goes that by forcing up rival exchange rates, a decline in the U.S. currency could slow economic growth and inflation elsewhere, creating room for interest rates to stay lower than they otherwise would be.“A weaker dollar can potentially have an impact on other central banks,” said Mohit Kumar, Credit Agricole’s London-based head of interest-rates strategy. “From a broader perspective, a stronger currency is akin to tightening of monetary policy. At BNY Mellon, senior currency strategist Neil Mellor told clients this week in a report that “marked currency appreciation has the potential to eviscerate forecasts for reviving inflation, which points to the possibility of any tentative plans for policy changes being placed on ice.”With the euro already close to a three-year high against the dollar, a further slide in the U.S. currency may have implications for the European Central Bank’s path away from its stimulus plan. President Mario Draghi has previously stepped in to curb the surge in the euro, warning in September that currency volatility could have detrimental impact on price stability.“It is hard to see the ECB accelerating the pace of tapering if the euro goes on rising,” said Kit Juckes, a global fixed-income strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. “The risk is that we never get escape velocity.”Asian OutperformersThe Chinese yuan had its best performance last year since 2008, the yen gained the most against the dollar since 2011, South Korea’s won had its biggest gain since 2004 and India’s rupee had its best year since 2010.Stronger currencies in Asia are already “doing monetary policy tightening that Asian policy makers would be comfortable with,” said Rob Subbaraman, head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.The gains should contain inflation by making exports costlier and imports cheaper. If prices don’t pick up, the risk for central banks is that their easy policies end up creating bubbles in asset markets and leave them without ammunition to fight the next crisis.“If you get dollar weakness that implies strength of emerging market currencies and it means emerging market central banks don’t need to be as aggressive themselves in putting their foot on the brake,” said Dwyfor Evans, head of Asia Pacific macro strategy with State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. Still, the softer U.S. dollar could be a reason for the Federal Reserve to push rates up faster than it now anticipates, pressuring Asia’s central banks to respond, said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia-Pacific economist at IHS Markit in Singapore.“Despite the current weakness of the dollar, Asian central banks are likely to remain concerned about upside risks to inflation and of faster-than-expected tightening by the Fed,” he said."
188,"Jan 02, 2018 10:00AM ET","For 2018's Best Carry Trades, Wall Street Looks to Latin America",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are targeting Latin America for the most profitable carry trades in 2018, betting a region that lagged behind peers last year is poised for a comeback.Wall Street firms including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA cite the region’s high interest rates and forecasts for faster economic growth. In Argentina, for example, a monetary policy rate of 28.75 percent is the highest in the world.The banks are expecting a reversal from last year, when currency appreciation was the primary driver for the most profitable currency trades -- long positions in the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna funded by dollars. This time around, they’re anticipating that Latin American interest rates will provide the biggest returns even as forecasts call for most of the region’s currencies to slip.“Latin America stands out,” said Eric Viloria, a strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. “Even after rate cuts in Brazil, the interest rates are still relatively high.”Brazil’s real offered the top carry return in 2016, when interest rates were above 14 percent most of the year, handing investors gains of 37 percent. Last year, the central bank slashed borrowing costs to a record 7 percent, resulting in a carry return of just 5.5 percent. Still, the benchmark rate is higher than in peers like South Africa, India or Indonesia.Viloria also highlights Mexico, where interest rates were lifted to 7.25 percent in December to fight surging inflation and surpassed Brazil’s rate for the first time ever. Traders are wagering Mexico’s rate will climb to 8.5 percent by the end of 2018.Alejandro Cuadrado, the global head of foreign exchange at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in New York, has the Argentine peso as his top carry pick for 2018, even as he forecasts a small depreciation. The country offered the best carry trade return in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015, but last year fell to 31rd place in the ranking as the peso’s 15 percent slide trimmed carry gains to 3.4 percent.“This is backed by the persistent hawkish bias of the central bank,” he said.Credit Agricole SA strategists led by Sebastien Barbe wrote in a Dec. 22 report that emerging-market currencies are likely to appreciate slightly versus the dollar this year. As interest rates remain relatively high, they see capital flows continuing to head toward developing nations.“This is not the end of the EM carry trade yet,” the strategists wrote."

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index dipped 0.3 percent in early deals, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) fell 0.4 percent.Autos stocks (SXAP) sank 2 percent, set for their biggest daily fall since July last year, dented by weaker car registrations data. New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.A trader also pointed to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales. Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were all among top fallers, down 2.4 to 2.8 percent.Basic resources stocks also fell back, with the sector index (SXPP) down 0.8 percent. The mining sector had surged to a five-year high at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices, but Tuesday's dip suggested investors were taking profits after a strong run. Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude.  Statoil  (OL:STL) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) were among the strongest gainers. Financials also rose, led by Santander (MC:SAN), Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) among top banking stocks.In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) slipped 6.3 percent after British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) agreed to buy Air Berlin's insolvent Austrian airline Niki.The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki's assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.""The circa 20 planes not acquired through Niki are a loss but not significant for the Lufthansa investment case from our point of view,"" said Bernstein analysts.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) surged 12 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to ""buy"" from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) up 2.4 percent after the company secured several new orders. The Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

192,"Dec 21, 2017 04:56AM ET",Catalan vote tests Europe,nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - World markets offered a muted reception on Thursday to the passage of U.S. tax cuts as potential benefits to company bottom lines were already priced in, while bonds were spooked by the blowout in government debt needed to fund the giveaways.An election in Catalonia, which has become a de facto referendum on its independence movement, was another test for European assets late in the year, though there was only modest stress in Spain's markets and none on the euro., ""It (the Catalan election) cannot be ignored going into year-end,"" said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""But the secession movement has been significantly diminished and would need a decisive move to revive it.""Madrid's IBEX (IBEX) was down 0.6 percent, compared to falls of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for the euro zone's other major bourses <0#.INDEXE> which were showing the effects of subdued sentiment in Asia and Wall Street overnight. [.N][.T][.SS]In U.S. President Donald Trump's first major policy win, Republicans steamrollered opposition from Democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary relief to middle-class Americans.Having spent more than a year anticipating the bill, its actual passage proved something of an anticlimax for Wall Street. The Dow (DJI) fell 0.11 percent, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 0.04 percent.Most of the action was in bond markets where yields on U.S. 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) jumped to the highest since March at 2.50 percent, in the process making a bearish break of a key chart level at 2.47 percent.Benchmark German and euro zone yields were camped near one-month highs too and the swing higher in long-term yields for once outpaced the move in the short-end and steepened the yield curve a little. [GVD/EUR]On the U.S. tax cuts, bond investors are concerned that adding fiscal stimulus at a time of full employment will only reinforce the Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates, thus pushing up short term yields.At the same time, many assume the unfunded tax cuts will lead to an explosion in government borrowing, increasing the supply of new bonds and pressuring prices across the curve.The impact is all the greater as the Fed has begun to unwind its massive bond holdings, as have central banks elsewhere.Sweden's Riksbank on Wednesday took its first baby steps toward reversing ultra-loose policy by ending net new bond purchases.""An appreciation that central banks are going to be buying fewer bonds next year at a time when many governments will be selling more of them, plus profit-taking on the curve-flattening theme that has been a winning trade for large parts of 2017, are playing a part,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.BOJ NOT FOR TURNINGOne institution that has long been committed to aggressive stimulus is the Bank of Japan, and it showed no inclination to re-think the policy at its board meeting on Thursday.Currency investors are assuming the BOJ will keep Japanese bond yields super-low for a long time to come and have been nudging the yen lower in response.""Our most important goal is to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible,"" BOJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda told a news conference. ""We won't raise interest rates just because the economy is improving."" That kept the euro up at its highest since late 2015 at 134.84 (EURJPY=). The dollar stood 0.15 percent higher at 113.51 yen , after also rising 0.4 percent on Wednesday.The euro outperformed broadly, reaching $1.1877  per dollar after starting the week down at $1.1752. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at 93.346 (DXY).But the common currency still faces the Catalonia hurdle. The election is expected to produce no clear majority for either the separatist or unionist parties, leading to weeks of political wrangling.""It looks likely that it ends up being something of a long-running saga,"" said one of rating agency Fitch's top European sovereign analysts, Tony Stringer. He said the Catalan situation would be a key factor in whether Spain gets a rating upgrade next year. ""It is feasible that it is just a prolonged standoff that doesn't affect the Spanish economy and public finances.""In commodity markets, gold  was underpinned by the softer dollar to stand at $1,265 an ounce.Oil prices steadied after rising on a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and the continued outage of the North Sea Forties pipeline system.

193,"Dec 19, 2017 08:30PM ET",The Party's Not Over Yet for Emerging Markets' Dream Rally,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Bulls will retain the upper hand in emerging markets in 2018, but some assets could be in for a reality check.Bonds and equities in developing countries will continue to streak ahead, outpacing their developed-nation peers into next year, according to a Bloomberg survey of 20 investors, traders and strategists. Currencies, however, may struggle to stay in front. The survey was conducted Dec. 5-14.And while the Federal Reserve’s actions will remain key in determining the fate of what has been the strongest equity rally for emerging-market stocks in eight years, geopolitical risks will be less of a focus as investors zero in on Donald Trump and the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy: China.“The environment for emerging markets was great in 2017 with the Goldilocks factors of economic growth and low inflation in industrialized countries,” said Hideo Shimomura, chief fund manager in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $114 billion. “The EM rally we saw this year will probably extend into 2018, but after a period of strong growth and low inflation, some adjustment will be inevitable.” Investor darlings in 2017 thanks to their high yields and buoyant growth prospects, emerging markets have weathered Trump’s protectionist rhetoric and a swathe of geopolitical brush fires -- from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula.But while stocks and currencies in developing nations are on track for their best year since 2009, investors may become more selective in 2018 as headwinds like Fed tightening weaken the appeal of emerging markets.Consistent with a survey in October, market watchers continue to see the Fed and President Trump’s policy moves to be key for developing-country assets in the new year.What happens with China -- where authorities are waging a battle against debt and President Xi Jinping is cementing his power -- has edged up in the rankings.Check out the October survey results here.Going forward, Mexico’s peso and bond market as well as Brazilian equities are among the most-favored emerging-market assets, while Turkey’s lira and stocks ranked low given the country’s persistent political uncertainty.The lira, on track to become one of the worst emerging-market currency performers this year, will remain in the doldrums in 2018. The currency plunged to a record low as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the central bank in November, saying it was on the “wrong path” in tackling soaring inflation.But in general, the stars will continue to align from a macroeconomic perspective, with global growth expected to be steady and inflation subdued, said Colin Harte, a London-based fund manager and strategist for multi-asset solutions at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, which oversaw the equivalent of $673 billion at the end of September.“This Goldilocks environment will be one where central banks will continue to pursue accommodative monetary policy and follow their existing reaction functions,” he said.Survey respondents were also asked about the inflation and general economic outlooks for 11 developing nations.NOTE: Respondents in the survey were from Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., BNP Paribas Asset Management,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc., Daiwa SB Investments Ltd.,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Wealth Management, DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) Capital Management, FPG Securities Co., Invesco Ltd., Kasikornbank Pcl, Krung Thai Bank Pcl, Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co., Mizuho Bank Ltd., NBC Financial Markets Asia Ltd., Neuberger Berman, Nomura Asset Management Co.,  Old Mutual  Plc (LON:OML), SBI Securities Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Yumi Teso in Bangkok at yteso1@bloomberg.net, Hannah Dormido in Hong Kong at hdormido@bloomberg.net, Lilian Karunungan in Singapore at lkarunungan@bloomberg.net, Aline Oyamada in Sao Paulo at aoyamada3@bloomberg.net, Selcuk Gokoluk in London at sgokoluk@bloomberg.net.To contact the editors responsible for this story: Tomoko Yamazaki at tyamazaki@bloomberg.net, Justin Carrigan at jcarrigan@bloomberg.net, Emma O'Brien©2017 Bloomberg L.P."

198,"Nov 22, 2017 04:05AM ET",Buoyant risk appetite pushes euro up for a second day,nan,"By Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - The euro edged higher for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, recouping more than half of its losses sustained after the German coalition collapse as investors bought the single currency on expectations of strong economic growth.With risk appetite firmly on the front foot, with world stocks perched at a record high and market gauges of volatility heading back towards record lows, even commodity-linked currencies, such as the New Zealand dollar , which have suffered a recent beating found some support. [MKTS/GLOB]""Regardless of what the German political outcome will be, the implementation of the economic policies will continue and investors are using this opportunity in the euro weakness to adjust some positions,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.The euro  rose 0.25 percent on Wednesday to $1.1769 against the dollar and not far away from a one-month high of $1.1862 hit last Wednesday.The euro's gains were also bolstered by the general trend of dollar weakness across the board due to softening U.S. yields.Spreads between ten and two-year U.S. Treasury bonds narrowed to 57.4 basis points in the previous session, its flattest level since late 2007 and was trading roughly half a basis point higher at around 58 basis points. (US)The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was down 0.2 percent at 93.77.The index fell back from a one-week high of 94.165 overnight after a rally triggered earlier this week by a sagging euro stalled as long-term U.S. Treasury yields continued inching lower.With outgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen not offering any firm clues on where monetary policy in the world's biggest economy is headed, the dollar's near-term outlook remained uncertain.Yellen stuck by her prediction that U.S. inflation will soon rebound but offered on Tuesday an unusually strong caveat: she is ""very uncertain"" about this and is open to the possibility that prices could remain low for years to come. ""The monetary policy side of things is unlikely to provide any momentum for the dollar exchange rates until year-end,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists said in a note.

199,"Nov 20, 2017 11:58AM ET",Exclusive: Saudi prince detention holds up loan to investment firm - sources,nan,"By Davide Barbuscia and Tom ArnoldDUBAI (Reuters) -  Kingdom  Holding's plan to borrow money to fund new investments has stalled because owner Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has been detained in Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption crackdown, according to four banking sources familiar with the matter.Kingdom (SE:4280) had approached banks to obtain the loan, but the financing plan has been held up because the lenders are worried about potential repercussions if they lend to the prince's company, the sources said. One of the sources, who was approached for the loan, said it would have been worth roughly 5 billion riyals ($1.3 billion).A financing hold-up for Kingdom - a leading Saudi investment firm with stakes in prime real estate including New York's Plaza Hotel and London's Savoy Hotel - would suggest the crackdown this month is slowing new Saudi business activity.Asked for comment, Kingdom's Chief Financial Officer Mohammed Fahmy said his company had not asked any bank for a formal loan commitment. He said that terms of any financing deal were never finalised.More than 200 people were questioned and dozens of princes, officials and top businessmen detained in the anti-corruption purge. Over 2,000 bank accounts have been frozen by investigators, commercial bankers told Reuters. The Riyadh government has said the economy will not suffer because investigators are targeting only individuals, not their companies, which can continue to operate as normal.In a statement issued soon after Prince Alwaleed was detained two weeks ago, Kingdom also said it was continuing to operate normally, and that it had the support of the government. But a loan hold-up would suggest some damage to the economy may be inevitable as banks, uncertain of the fate of majority owners of companies and unsure how far the crackdown will extend, become reluctant to extend new financing. PRINCE ALLEGATIONSKingdom completed the acquisition of a 16.2 percent stake in local lender Banque Saudi Fransi (BSF) (SE:1050) in September, buying about half of France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) stake in BSF for 5.76 billion riyals.The company approached banks to obtain a loan that would have been secured by its BSF stake, as the company wanted to leverage the newly acquired shares in order to make new investments, according to the sources. Kingdom's share price has plunged 19 percent in the past two weeks, erasing about $1.9 billion of market value. The allegations against Prince Alwaleed, who owns 95 percent of Kingdom, include money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official has previously told Reuters. The allegations could not be independently verified.One of the four sources, a senior banker at a Saudi financial institution, said the loan deal would not go ahead until the situation facing the prince was resolved.Eight Saudi and international bankers, including the four sources, said in addition to the Kingdom loan, a range of other transactions involving clients who are directly or indirectly involved in the detentions had also been put on hold.Banks have not reached the point of recalling existing loans, but they have increased the level of scrutiny for some new financing, the bankers said.In a report last week, debt rating agency Moody's said a prolonged freeze of bank accounts in Saudi Arabia could damage corporate credit quality in the kingdom because large depositors were often large borrowers and business owners. ""Saudi Arabia's corporate sector remains dominated by unlisted family-owned businesses with uneven governance and disclosures and frequent intermingling of individual and corporate activities, which ultimately could expose corporates to these individuals’ frozen accounts,"" Moody's said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

With share prices rebounding across Asia and Europe and Wall Street also set to open higher, the dollar climbed around a third of a percent to 113.17 yen , up from lows of 112.47 yen on Wednesday plumbed as a risk-off mood took hold. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was 0.2 percent higher (DXY), having fallen to its lowest in almost four weeks on Wednesday - a severe correction from the uptrend that began in early September on hopes of a tax cut deal. Investors say they do not expect any risk-off moves to be lasting, because of a robust growth backdrop. ""We do not currently expect risk-aversion to rise sustainably because global growth expectations are strong enough to compensate for adverse developments’ dampening impact on sentiment,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Manuel Oliveri, in London. Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, also in London, said hawkish comments late on Wednesday from Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren, who said the Fed should continue to raise interest rates and should do so next month, had also helped the dollar.But concerns over U.S. tax reform plans were keeping a lid on any dollar gains. The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress was approaching a major test on Thursday of its ability to overhaul the federal tax code, as lawmakers prepared for their first full-scale vote on sweeping tax legislation.""For the moment, the U.S. tax cuts will be the main theme of the markets. I would expect negotiation to drag on beyond the year-end but by the first quarter of next year, there will be a deal,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. With the dollar recovering, the euro slipped quarter of a percent to $1.1764 , having reached as high as $1.1862 on Wednesday, its best level in over one month.The Australian dollar bounced from near five-month lows as a mostly upbeat local employment report triggered a round of short-covering.The Aussie traded flat percent at $0.7584, having plumbed a low of $0.7567 , a trough last seen in late June.Bitcoin was up 2 percent at $7,435 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange (BTC=BTSP), having recovered more than a third of its value after a sell-off at the end of last week.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It came two months after a higher court sent a landmark case against U.S. chipmaker Intel (O:INTC) back to the lower tribunal for review.The EU competition authority penalized ICAP in February 2015 for rigging the yen Libor financial benchmark in several cartels with Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), UBS (S:UBSG),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Citigroup  (N:C) at various periods.The banks admitted taking part in the cartels in return for a cut in the penalties in December 2013 except for ICAP, which denied wrongdoing. But judges said the Commission's decision against the interdealer broker was flawed in several aspects.""The Court takes the view that the Commission has not succeeded in proving that ICAP participated in one of the cartels, that the duration found by the Commission of ICAP's participation in three cartels was excessive and that it failed to provide sufficient reasons as regards the methodology for calculating the fine,"" they said. The court annulled the part of the decision setting the fines because it was insufficiently reasoned. Judges also told the Commission to respect the presumption of innocence for companies which decline to settle with regulators.The EU executive said it would analyze the judgment. In previous cases, it had re-issued decisions keeping the fines or reducing the figures.ICAP welcomed the ruling and said it would consider its options together with British financial trading technology company NEX (L:NXGN) which was known as ICAP before it sold its voice broking business to TP ICAP last year. Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), HSBC (L:HSBA) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) have also appealed against their fines in another cartel involving the euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), saying they have done nothing wrong.The regulatory crackdown on cartels in various financial benchmarks on both sides of the Atlantic has resulted in billions of dollars in sanctions. The Commission is currently looking into possible wrongdoing involving foreign exchange and the government sponsored bond market.($1 = 0.8593 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

207,"Nov 05, 2017 04:00PM ET","Alwaleed, Caught in Saudi Purge, Has Assets Across Globe",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- When Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was arrested as part of an anti-corruption probe in Saudi Arabia, it was the latest twist in the story of a billionaire who has courted international attention -- while cloaking his investments in secrecy.Alwaleed is among the 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of current or former senior officials arrested on orders from a newly established anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said a senior Saudi official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The wealthiest of the arrestees, Alwaleed was picked up from his desert camp, the official said. Authorities didn’t disclose the allegations that prompted the action.Despite his being the 50th-richest person in the world, with a $19 billion fortune according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, details on the source of Alwaleed’s wealth must be gleaned from his public statements, the website of his holding company and company filings. Often his transactions and assets are disguised by investing through funds that obscure the ultimate beneficiary.Known internationally for investments in companies including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alwaleed, 62, hasn’t hesitated to flaunt his wealth. He bought his own A380 superjumbo jet in 2007, planning to kit it out as a “flying palace.” He also launched legal action against Forbes magazine for undervaluing his worth in 2013, before settling the case in 2015. He was a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the U.S. presidential election last year. He later sold the A380 before taking ownership of it, and sought to reconcile with Trump after he was elected president.“A suspect’s position or status does not influence the firm and fair application of justice,” Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, attorney general of Saudi Arabia, said in a statement announcing the investigations, without naming names.Alwaleed’s 95 percent-owned investment vehicle, Kingdom Holding Co., is listed on the Saudi stock exchange and has a market value of about $35 billion -- down 8 percent on Sunday. Still, details on the investments he has made or the returns they generate are scarce. Kingdom Holding’s latest annual report barely refers to its stake in Citigroup, for example, even though the prince has said he is one of the biggest single investors in the bank. Kingdom Holding is continuing its usual commercial operations and has assurances of support from the government, the company said in a statement.Some of his highest-profile stakes may take a beating in trading Monday unless more is heard from them or Alwaleed, said Joice Mathew, head of equity research at United Securities in Muscat. Here’s what’s known about Alwaleed’s investments.FinanceCitigroupKingdom Holding has held Citigroup shares since 1991, according to its website, increasing its stake during the bank’s 98 percent plunge during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Citigroup’s latest proxy filing doesn’t include Alwaleed or Kingdom Holding among the two investors that own more than 5 percent of the company. The prince was a vocal backer of Vikram Pandit, the chief executive officer brought in to help turn Citigroup around, although he also told Fox News in a 2010 interview that the “honeymoon is over” for Pandit and that investors wanted to see results.Alwaleed long has been a vocal shareholder, encouraging the lender to rebuild its Saudi Arabian business more than a decade after it lost a key banking license there. Citigroup will reopen in the kingdom later this year after a 13-year absence. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat met the prince in Riyadh in March to discuss the bank’s future plans. The company declined to comment.Technology and Entertainment Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).Alwaleed invested $300 million in Twitter in 2011 for what Kingdom Holding’s website says was a “substantial position” in one of social media’s most powerful platforms. He currently owns 4.9 percent of Twitter, according to a regulatory filing by the San Francisco-based company in February. In an interview on CNBC Arabia in October, he said Twitter may face some difficulties, though his investment was close to breaking even and he was optimistic about the outlook. Alwaleed has pared his investment from 5.1 percent in December 2015. The company declined to comment.AppleAlwaleed bought 6.23 million shares, or 5 percent, of the computer and mobile-device maker for $115.4 million in 1997. He made these purchases between mid-March and April of that year while the company was still struggling to turn itself around. He has since continued to hold the stake while Apple’s valuation has soared to as high as $900 billion. The company didn’t immediately respond to comment.LyftIn 2015, Kingdom Holding was among a group of investors that bought a 5.3 percent stake in the California-based ride-hailing company, valued at $247.7 million. Lyft’s major investors, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, also sold a portion of their shares in the company to Alwaleed last year. The company didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.21st Century Fox As of Dec. 31, 2015, the prince held 39.7 million shares, or a 4.98 percent stake, in Rupert Murdoch’s media and entertainment company. That’s lower than the 6.6 percent holding he had in the company as of the end of 2013, according to regulatory filings. Kingdom press releases as recent as last month mentioned that it still owns a stake in Fox, though it no longer appears in Bloomberg data as a reporting holder. Fox declined to comment.In 2011, while a leading stockholder at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., he called for the departure of top executive Rebekah Brooks amid a phone hacking scandal in the U.K. Three years later, he voted with the Murdochs as shareholders tried to dilute family control over the business. He sold most of his stake in 2015.JD.comAlwaleed has been investing in e-commerce and technology companies for a number of years as demand for technology and Internet services increases. In 2013, Kingdom Holding led a group of investors in buying a stake in a Chinese online retailer, now called JD.com, that was valued at $400 million. JD.com said it had raised a total of $700 million from investors, also including a Canadian pension fund and some major shareholders, in addition to Kingdom Holding. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.HotelsThrough Kingdom Holding and its Kingdom Hotel Investments unit, Alwaleed has made substantial investments in some of the world’s grandest hotels and biggest operators. Kingdom’s portfolio of luxury hotels includes a controlling interest in the The Plaza in New York, the Savoy Hotel in London and the George V in Paris, according to its website. Kingdom Hotels has a 5.7 percent stake in  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, Europe’s biggest hotel operator, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Accor declined to comment.DomesticAlwaleed owns significant stakes in Saudi companies across the real estate, retail and petrochemical industries. Most recently, Kingdom Holding acquired a 16.2 percent of Banque Saudi Fransi from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in September. The $1.5 billion deal makes Kingdom Holding the biggest shareholder in Saudi Arabia’s fifth-largest bank. Saudi Fransi didn’t respond to requests for comment.It is the latest addition to a domestic portfolio that also includes a 33 percent stake in Jeddah Economic Company, which is developing a real estate project in Jeddah that is set to include the world’s tallest building. Other assets include the Kingdom Tower in Riyadh, which includes one of the tallest towers in Riyadh and a Four Seasons hotel. Other investments include a 34 percent stake in Flynas, a budget airline that was considering an initial public offering this year, and a stake in food-producer Savola.(Updates with response from Fox.)"

210,"Oct 31, 2017 12:26PM ET",Exclusive - Orange is the new bank? Telecoms giant ventures into lending,nan,"By Maya Nikolaeva, Sophie Sassard and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Telecoms giant Orange (PA:ORAN) launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25 percent of France's online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal share from established lenders with inferior technology. The launch is part of a push by the French firm to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector. It is also a test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank. ""We are targeting 2 million clients in ten years. That would represent 25 percent of the (online banking) market, but I hope we will not stop there ... and we will be the market leader in several years,"" Andre Coisne, chief executive of Orange Bank, told Reuters in an interview.Coisne has previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.Orange is starting from a small base - Coisne says it has 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch, a tiny fraction of the company's 21 million mobile clients. But the timing of its entry gives some room for optimism. In France, 793.4 million online banking e-payments were made last year according to the European Central Bank, up from 586.2 million in 2014. Consultancy Ernst & Young predicts the number of customers going online to open an account in France will surge nearly six-fold to 17 million in the next ten years. The regulatory environment is also becoming more favorable - next year new European Union rules will start to force banks to allow customer data to be made available to other companies, if the customers agree. That will help the likes of Orange to identify potential customers and offer them better deals than their current lenders. ""This is a good start,"" said Coisne, who will also face competition from telecoms rival Altice, which launches its bank in 2019. ORANGE IS THE NEW BANKOrange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past ten years under several brands, such as Orange Money and Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.It targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.Africa is the world leader in mobile banking. Around 12 percent of adults there have a mobile money account against 2 percent globally, according to a 2014 World Bank survey.Telecoms operators have long hoped to repeat their banking success in Africa and other developing markets in advanced economies, but until now have only done so by relying on partnerships with existing banks, with little success. So far most telecoms operators have sought to retain customers by offering media content such as free access to music streaming apps like Spotify or movie streaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as well as exclusive sports broadcasts.But a minority investor in Orange told Reuters that diversification through banking could prove smarter because these services are essential and sticky.""To me, it is smarter than spending millions on sport rights that expire every two or three years"", the investor said.There is no clearly successful precedent in major Western markets, which makes Orange's move so brave, said Tom Levine, global head of telecoms practice at Allen & Overy.""I hope their ambition goes beyond retaining customers through bundles because there is a real opportunity for telcos in banking to be a platform, thanks to the trust they inspire, their strong brand, and large customer base"".Orange is betting on a wide range of services - mobile, internet, TV, videos and music, and now banking - to help generate enough revenue to offset costs on infrastructure investments.""Our ambition is to offer everything, we are a complete bank,"" Coisne said.From Nov. 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings accounts. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android wallets.Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year.BANKS COUNTER ATTACKOrange is not the only new entrant. Established banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are competing with new online low-cost banks such as N26, and retailers such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Some French banking executives have expressed concern about the entry of Orange Bank into the market and the impact on profit margins.Orange is ""potentially a very important competitor"", Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Credit Agricole, said in May.Banks are making investments to increase the appeal of their services to smartphone users, while also cutting branches to keep costs down.France's BNP Paribas upgraded its mobile app this year and hired a former marketing and digital executive at  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom to head its online Hello Bank! in France, while Credit Agricole is set to announce a new online banking offer in November.If Orange meets its target of 2 million customers in the next 6 to 10 years, it would likely be at the expense of these rival online businesses. But for Orange, banking would remain a small business relative to its overall size, says Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), CEO of telecoms consulting firm Northstream.""This would only bring a very small stream of additional revenue relative to the scale of Orange,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

211,"Oct 29, 2017 09:31AM ET",Bond Traders Face Their Fears in Week That May Change Everything,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- This week is fraught with peril for Treasuries traders, no matter if they’re bulls or bears.The next five trading days will bring a torrent of market-moving information: President Donald Trump is poised to finally announce his nominee to lead the Federal Reserve; U.S. central bankers have an interest-rate decision to make; a House committee is set to release a tax bill; and Treasury will unveil plans to issue more debt to make up for lost funding from the Fed. Oh, and investors will also get the latest reading on the nation’s job market and the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge.It’s a lot to digest. What’s more, it all comes at a pivotal time, with 10 year yields breaking above the crucial 2.4 percent level and touching a seven-month high of 2.48 percent. With yields entering a new, elevated range, traders are bracing for turbulence as they ponder the direction of the world’s biggest bond market for the remainder of 2017.“I would definitely expect those ranges to be tested in a big way,” said Michael Lorizio, a senior trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $370 billion. “The information we get in the next week should allow people to feel more confident in their longer-term views, and more aggressively position for those views going into the end of the year.”Signs are emerging that volatility is returning to fixed income, after it fell to a record low in August. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s MOVE Index, which tracks swings in Treasury options, jumped last week to the highest in five months.Commentary around higher yields may have added to the volatility.DoubleLine Capital LP’s Jeffrey Gundlach called it “the moment of truth” for the bond market’s three-decade bull run after yields broke through 2.4 percent. Bill Gross at Janus Henderson Group said this month that a sustained move through that level would signal the end of the 30-year rally.Enthusiasm CurbedThe full slate of events ahead and the prospect of market turmoil could scare away buyers until the dust settles, Lorizio said. Even investors who consider Treasuries oversold might prefer to wait, either for confirmation that yields will drop or for an even more attractive entry point.“Given the big move in Treasuries, it would warrant some caution coming into the week,” said Alex Li, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA.The latest read on positioning in futures markets indicates that restraint. Hedge funds and other large speculators cut back on bets against two- and five-year Treasury maturities in the week through Oct. 24, after their net shorts reached record highs, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. On the flip side, asset managers’ net duration across the Treasury curve dropped.It’s a frightening week to take a big bet one way or the other.What to Watch"
212,"Oct 26, 2017 01:46AM ET", Draghi Expected to Detail ECB’s Tapering Choices,nan,"Investing.com – The European Central Bank is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates when it announces its monetary policy decision at 7:45AM ET (11:45GMT) Thursday, with markets concentrating on plans for winding down, or tapering, its asset purchase program which is currently set to expire in December.Most of the focus will be on ECB president Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for further details on when and how the central bank could start unwinding its monthly quantitative easing program.Draghi indicated last July that discussions regarding a change in monetary policy stance will begin in the fall and promised in September that the bulk of the decisions regarding the asset purchase program are likely to be made in October. The ECB has the necessary ingredients to start moving ahead with policy accommodation as the euro zone economy is performing well, there are some indications that inflation pressure is beginning to build and credit conditions are showing improvement. Markets look for details on tapering amount and extensionMarket experts believe the ECB will announce that it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to €40 billion ($47 billion) from the current €60 billion ($70.6 billion) beginning in January. They were mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.Sources close to the ECB's pre-meeting discussions say a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between €25 billion and €40 billion ($29.4 billion to $47 billion) a month.The two most persistent views among analysts seem to be a coin toss between a six-month extension of €40 billion or a nine-month one at a lower €30 billion ($35.3 billion), both resulting in a similar total increase to the purchase program, although some experts have also suggested a 12-month extension at around €25 billion a month. But the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.The focus will be on Draghi’s introductory statement with particular attention to the wording back in September that “we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary”. Experts agree that both the amount and the end date will change, but there is some debate over whether the ECB will opt to keep the “or beyond, if necessary” in order to maintain wiggle room. Timing details may bring forward market expectations for 1st hikeRemoving that portion of the statement would imply a fixed end to the asset program, implying a more hawkish stance, with the capacity to bring forward market expectations for the first rate hike. Markets are pricing in a first hike of 10 basis points to the deposit facility rate during the first quarter of 2019. This rate defines the interest banks receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight and, currently at -0.40%, has been negative since June 2014. Odds for the timing of rate hikes may be adjusted in the case that the ECB decides to place a specific end date to its quantitative easing program (QE) instead of leaving the door open to additional purchases.Risk to the euroAs  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) indicated in a recent note to clients, “Parallels with December 2016 - the last time around when the (ECB) Governing Council extended its QE program and sent the euro tumbling - seem inevitable.”“That said we note the differences, which could help the euro regain ground after the ECB meeting,” they said.They noted that euro zone fundamentals and FX valuations are “still quite favorable” and concluded that “we believe that the longer-term risks for the currency are still to the upside”.Credit Agricole repeated its call for long positions in EUR/USD and EUR/CHF.Some strategists point to the fact that the ECB’s announcement for tapering will mark a move away from its dovish stance when compared to the last policy meeting and highlight that the euro-dollar has already fallen 2% since then.In that light, some analysts suggested that the near-term reaction in the euro could actually be to the upside. Experts at Fullerton Markets pointed this week to the fact that the dollar index rebounded since early last month. “One of the main reasons was (that) ECB president Mario Draghi showed no rush to tighten monetary policy,” they explained, but noted that many traders took profit on their EUR/USD long positions when the pair reached the key level of 1.20. “However, risk of ‘ECB to tighten soon’ cannot be ignored this week. If that happens, dollar could end its recent uptrend as early as this week,” these strategists concluded."

214,"Oct 21, 2017 09:08AM ET",Fed-Chair Mania Possesses Bond Traders Looking for Next Big Move,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond traders better not be tired of handicapping who President Donald Trump will nominate to be the next Federal Reserve chair, because it could be a major driver of profits or losses in coming days.The choice between Stanford University economist John Taylor and Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell has the potential to jolt the bond market in a year defined by low volatility and a tug-of-war between bulls and bears that’s kept yields in a tight range. Powell, considered the Republican Party’s alternative to renominating Janet Yellen, leads on betting website PredictIt. In a twist on Friday, traders were left to ponder a partnership atop the world’s most influential central bank: Trump told Fox Business News that pairing them at the Fed is a possibility.For the 10-year Treasury yield, Powell could spark a five basis point drop, while Taylor would cause a 10 basis point leap, according to Priya Misra at TD Securities. The yield curve from two to 10 years may flatten by 20 basis points in short order with a Taylor nomination, said Michael Schumacher at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. Currency traders are on edge too: The dollar could gain as much as 3 percent with a Taylor pick, while sinking 0.5 percent under Powell, said Steven Englander at Rafiki Capital Management.Altogether, bond and currency traders are scratching their heads as they prepare for the decision between the candidates that Trump’s advisers are reportedly steering him toward. An announcement is expected within two weeks. Some are already adding options positions referred to as “Taylor puts” to hedge against the prospect of a sharp rise in short-term rates.Listening to Wall Street strategists, it’s clear that the markets are poised to move in very different directions depending on the pick. And that matters with the 10-year yield near 2.4 percent, which Bill Gross at Janus Henderson Group has said would signal the start of a bear market.Analysts expect Powell to maintain many of the policies the Fed has pursued under Yellen’s leadership. By contrast, Taylor’s eponymous rule calls for a fed funds rate above the current 1.16 percent effective rate.Complicating things further, the Senate’s narrow approval of a budget vehicle for tax cuts, Trump’s top legislative priority, drove 10-year yields to their highest close since July. The yield curve from two to 10 years steepened, the opposite of what’s expected with a Taylor win.There’s a lot riding on the pick, including for Trump. He has consistently pointed to U.S. stocks reaching record highs under his administration. With higher rates, Taylor could bring that to a halt. An Evercore ISI survey of investors tags him as the worst candidate for equities. On the other hand, some conservatives have concerns about Powell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.That’s not to say traders are ready to completely rule out Yellen. A report that she was back at the White House on Friday sent 10-year Treasury yields briefly lower, before market participants realized it was for a routine meeting.Trump told Fox that he likes Yellen “a lot,” and said he has “three people that I’m looking at.”To hammer home just how conflicted the bond market is, consider that two longtime titans of bond trading are on opposite sidelines.What to Watch"

222,"Oct 09, 2017 09:00AM ET","Pound Snaps Losing Streak as Labor Costs Climb, May Holds Ground",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound strengthened for the first time in seven days versus the euro as U.K. employment data signaled that the Bank of England might have to tighten policy at a faster pace than previously thought.Sterling snapped two days of losses against the dollar and climbed against all of its major peers as the Office of National Statistics corrected second-quarter unit labor costs to 2.4 percent year-on-year, up from the 1.6 percent it announced on Friday. The currency was also helped by talk that Prime Minister Theresa May could demote her rebellious Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to thwart attempts to oust her.The jump in sterling on the ONS news was likely a “knee-jerk response” said Stuart Bennett, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Banco Santander (MC:SAN) SA. While a November BOE rate hike is already priced in by markets, the news was “probably enough to convince U.K.-based traders to buy.” May’s survival as PM also helped the pound “as FX markets loathe political uncertainty over almost everything else,” Bennett said.The pound gained 0.4 percent to 89.47 pence per euro as of 9:12 a.m. in London, having fallen around 2.4 percent in the past six days. Sterling also rose 0.4 percent to $1.3112, recovering from a drop on Friday to a one-month low. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was little changed at 1.36 percent.Pound VolatilityVolatility in sterling showed the BOE is increasingly in traders’ focus amid Brexit uncertainty. The implied probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the BOE in its November meeting was 85 percent, according to MPC-dated SONIA.“Given that the markets are anticipating a rate hike already, it remains to be seen whether this could be a game changer for sterling,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency research at Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) SA’s corporate and investment-banking unit in London, referring to the ONS error. “Our expectation is that sterling will remain close to recent lows against the dollar and the euro and recover on a more sustained basis only over the long-term.”"
223,"Oct 09, 2017 05:18AM ET",French bankers weighing Brexit face Paris pressure to come home,nan,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan, Anjuli Davies and Maya NikolaevaLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - While most London-based bankers are brushing up on their German to prepare for a move to Frankfurt post-Brexit, senior staff at French investment banks expect to say ""Oui"" to government pressure to bring jobs home to Paris.Most international banks in London have declared where they will move their European business in the event of a ""hard"" Brexit, in which the UK would give up access to the single market, including financial passporting rights. Frankfurt is by far the favorite. European giant Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), for example, said in April up to 4,000 UK jobs could move to Germany. Although French banks have been wavering about their plans, the bankers who work for them in London believe pressure from the government of Emmanuel Macron, himself a former investment banker, makes a Paris move almost certain.""The Macron administration is really pushing for the French banks to move some of us to Paris, setting up international schools there and talking tax breaks,"" said a senior London-based banker at one of the three main French investment banks.""Personally, I am preparing for life in Paris. Unless we get a (soft) Brexit deal, it's almost inevitable,"" he said, asking not to be named because, like others interviewed for this story, he was not authorized to speak to the media. That sentiment was echoed by a second London-based source from another top bank.""Most of the Americans are moving to Frankfurt and a lot of them are very advanced in their plans, so there's a lot of pressure for us,"" he said. A source at France's finance ministry maintained there was no undue pressure on the banks, but acknowledged the government was keen for domestic lenders to base more jobs in France. ""This government is doing a lot in terms of attractiveness like getting rid of the wealth tax. We want the banks to live up to promises they have made, we want them to make a concrete gesture,"" one ministry source told Reuters.French banks feel they can afford to wait until the details around Brexit become clearer because they already have EU licenses through their Paris headquarters, unlike their U.S. counterparts which conduct nearly all of their European investment banking business out of London.France's two biggest investment banks in London, BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP) and Societe Generale (PA:SOGN), have not set out firm plans, though SocGen CEO Frederic Oudea told Reuters in June it could move 300-400 out of the 2,000 investment banking jobs to Paris.Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR), the third biggest, has moved its 10-person European government bonds trading platform to Paris, but a source at the bank said the move was not related to Brexit.All three declined to comment. ENEMIES NO MOREFrench authorities want to convince the financial community that the sector is no longer seen as the ""enemy"", as former socialist President Francois Hollande once called it.""The previous government was an ideological one; this one is pragmatic,"" a senior French banker at one of the top three told Reuters in Paris.Banks moving to Germany aim to take advantage of the country's AAA credit rating, relatively attractive tax regime and strong economic track record. For its part, France has introduced measures to cut labor costs and lower taxation, and has pledged to build more international schools targeted at expatriates' children.Former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer, tasked by the government to lobby foreign finance firms, has made more than 400 pitches to banks in New York and London in the months since Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.One big win has been British bank HSBC, which said it would move up to 1,000 traders to its Paris entity in the case of a hard Brexit. That is the only major international bank so far to say France will be its new EU headquarters, however. Wall Street bank Citigroup (NYSE:C) said last week it was applying for a license to conduct sales and trading activities in France, but its legal EU headquarters will be in Germany.Noyer has said that even if banks say they are seeking a banking license in Frankfurt, that does not mean most of the jobs will be there. ""I know of some people who say 'I'm setting up my base in Frankfurt but I'm putting my trading rooms in Paris in a subsidiary. I'll create a few jobs in Frankfurt but the bulk is in Paris',"" Noyer told Reuters in June.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Following four consecutive weeks of gains, the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2 percent while the DAX was up 0.3 percent at an all-time peak of 12,997 points.The IBEX rebounded 0.7 percent with Caixabank gaining 2 percent after its board agreed to move its registered office to Valencia. Banco de Sabadell, which already announced the same move, was the top gainer, up 2 percent. Other firms including Gas Natural, Albertis, Inmobiliara Colonial, are also considering joining a corporate exodus out of the affluent northeastern province, which is putting pressure on Catalonia's separatist leaders to back down. ""There is hope in the markets that independence will not be declared and the worst case will be avoided,"" Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management told Reuters.He said he thought things were likely to get worse before they got better, however, as Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region's parliament on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.""I would urge caution going through tomorrow,"" Batra said, noting that volatility, which has been extremely low in the last months, could suddenly rise again.A slight rebound for the pound, which has been hit by British Prime Minister Theresa May's struggle to maintain authority over her cabinet, weighed on the FTSE, which was down 0.1 percent. On the corporate front, Airbus was the top loser in France, down 2.4 percent after its CEO warned a corruption investigation could lead to large corporate penalties. Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) fell 1.1 percent after its CEO indicated it would join the queue of potential suitors for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) should the German government want to sell its 15 percent stake. Commerzbank rose 0.2 percent. Also on the German market, shares in potash miner K+S fall 3.5 pct after a strategy update. Air France KLM fell 1.4 percent after it reported September traffic data. Germany's B.Z. newspaper reported that talks between insolvent carrier Air Berlin and easyJet (LON:EZJ) over the sale of up to 30 planes were at risk of falling apart. The British low-cost carrier, for which HSBC cut its target price from 1550p to 1500p, lost 1 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

227,"Sep 29, 2017 10:03AM ET",Citi applies for Paris broker-dealer license post-Brexit,nan,"By Anjuli DaviesLONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street bank  Citigroup  (N:C) is applying for a license to conduct sales and trading activities in France, James Cowles, Citi's Chief Executive Officer for Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) told a French newspaper on Friday. Citi said in July that it would headquarter its EU trading operations in Frankfurt and may need to create 150 new jobs in the EU in order to continue doing business across the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019. The bank also planned to build up its private banking, treasury and trade and investment banking businesses across the EU, while London would remain its EMEA headquarters.""The most obvious option was to convert our German branch into an investment company. It was already sufficiently capitalized and we have more than 300 people there. But we have also started applying for a broker-dealer license in France,"" Cowles said in an interview with Les Echos. International banks are planning to build up outposts in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate across the bloc.There is fierce competition between Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities to woo international banks’ City of London operations as they consider where to shift EU-related business. Frankfurt, along with Dublin, is emerging on top in the battle to draw highly-paid banking jobs with many other large lenders deterred by a perception of France as a country of high taxes and strict labor laws, according to executives. However, the new French government has stepped up efforts to attract London banks to Paris after the election of President Emmanuel Macron, who vowed to overhaul the labor market and simplify tax and pensions.Reuters reported this week that Bank of America (N:BAC) is looking to lease more office space in Paris as the bank prepares to expand its operations in the French capital, according to two sources familiar with the matter. HSBC, and French banks such as  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), are among those planning to move staff to Paris.Citi already has around 160 people based in Paris where it conducts investment banking activity such as mergers and acquisitions and capital markets transactions in the country. Cowles said the French elections had given new economic prospects to the country and to the bank's corporate customers. ""We will increase our presence in several activities in Paris, as well as in other countries in Europe.""Cowles also said Brexit would impact no more than 100 to 200 positions and that these would be transferred between one of its seven core locations across Europe including Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Luxembourg.""We've announced that Frank‎furt will be Citi's EU broker-dealer headquarters and we'll increase our presence across 6 other EU cities"" a spokeswoman for Citi in London said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

228,"Sep 28, 2017 12:15AM ET","Japan parliament dissolved, snap October 22 election expected",nan,"By Linda Sieg and Elaine LiesTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday called a snap election, as fresh opinion polls showed a fledgling conservative party led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike was gaining momentum ahead of the expected Oct. 22 vote.Abe, a conservative who returned to power in 2012, is hoping a boost in his voter support in recent months will help his Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition maintain a simple majority. It currently holds a two-thirds ""super"" majority.Koike's new Party of Hope -- only formally launched on Wednesday -- has upended the election outlook after the former LDP member announced she would lead the group herself.""This will be a tough battle, but it's all about how we will protect Japan, and the lives and peaceful existence of the Japanese people,"" Abe told a group of lawmakers. The cabinet will formally decide the date of the poll later on Thursday.A number of opposition lawmakers boycotted a session at which the lower house was dissolved to protest Abe's calling the election and creating a potential political vacuum at a time when tensions are high with North Korea.Koike, a media-savvy former defense minister often floated as a candidate to become Japan's first female prime minister, said on Wednesday she would not run for a seat herself, but speculation that she will persists.A survey by the Mainichi newspaper showed 18 percent of voters plan to vote for Koike's Party of Hope compared to 29 percent for Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).An Asahi newspaper poll showed 13 percent planned to vote for Koike's party versus 32 percent for the LDP. Both surveys asked voters their preference for proportional representation districts where ballots are cast for parties rather than specific candidates.""It is unavoidable that Abe is going to lose some seats to the Party of Hope, and while the most likely scenario is that he will retain a majority, if he loses too many his ability to implement policy will be diminished,"" said Yuji Saito, director of the foreign exchange division at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Bank in Tokyo.Abe's personal ratings have risen to around 50 percent from around 30 percent in July, partly on the back of his leadership during the current North Korea crisis.But opposition parties charge he called the election to escape questioning in parliament about suspected cronyism scandals that sliced his support to below 30 percent in July.OPPOSITION TURMOILThe emergence of Koike's party - which she describes as pro-reform and conservative - has thrown the main opposition Democratic Party into turmoil. The Democrats are struggling with defections and single-digit ratings and now appear in danger of being absorbed by the Party of Hope.Democratic Party leader Seiji Maehara will propose that the party allow its members to run under the Party of Hope flag, domestic media reports said.The proposal could end up splitting the party, an often fractious mix of conservatives and liberals whose rocky 2009-2012 reign tainted its image with many voters.Koike, 65, defied the LDP to run successfully for Tokyo governor last year and her novice local party then crushed the LDP in a metropolitan assembly election in July.Her Party of Hope shares policy space with the business-friendly LDP, but Koike has staked out different stances on two issues likely to appeal to voters.She wants to freeze a planned rise in the national sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in 2019. Abe says he will raise the tax but spend more revenue on child care and education instead of paying back public debt.Koike is also calling for Japan to abandon nuclear power, while Abe's government plans to keep atomic power as a key part of the energy mix despite public worries about safety after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.Koike has also criticized Abe for risking a political vacuum by calling the snap poll at a time of rising regional tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.Recent reforms will reduce the number of lower house seats to 465 from 475 in the coming election."

It is in the bank's interest to promote non-cash transactions since the cost of holding and operating with cash in Africa amounts to 10 percent of overall costs - much more than in Europe. SocGen expects YUP to break even in three years, Maymat said.SocGen will detail its ambitions in Africa when it releases an overall group strategy plan in November, and Maymat said revenue growth trends would remain at double digits in sub-Saharan Africa.Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to pick up this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, from a more than two-decade low in 2016 when commodity exporters faced lower prices.However, in non-oil producing countries such as Ivory Coast and Kenya - where SocGen is present - growth is expected to remain solid at over 5 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

234,"Sep 09, 2017 10:00PM ET",Inflation targets still proving elusive,nan,"By Jonathan CableLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England rate setters won't shock markets with any policy moves when they meet next week as a struggling economy and Brexit fears offset any concerns over inflation sailing well above target.Britain's economy initially withstood the shock of last year's decision to quit the European Union but slowed sharply in early 2017 and is expected to grow by just 0.3 percent this quarter, half the rate of the euro zone. [ECILT/GB]That poses a challenge for the central bank as, rather than targeting growth, its main remit is to keep inflation -- currently running at 2.6 percent -- at 2 percent.""We expect the Bank of England to leave monetary policy unchanged, given the subdued growth story and ongoing Brexit uncertainty,"" said James Knightley at ING.""Nonetheless, there are going to be members who continue to vote for a rate hike, given that consumer price inflation is likely to move higher once again.""At the last meeting two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase rock-bottom interest rates, but none of their seven colleagues are expected to join them on Thursday in calling for higher borrowing costs.""Our own view is that rates won't rise this year or next. But that doesn't mean the rollercoaster ride for expectations is over,"" said Liz Martins at HSBC.""An unexpectedly hawkish tilt from the MPC in September could mean a kneejerk reaction which pushes sterling and rates higher -- if only temporarily.""The risk of a ""bumpy Brexit"" does not mean the Bank should keep interest rates at their record low, MPC member Michael Saunders said last week, as the central bank risked being rushed into sharper rate hikes in future, potentially hurting growth.Inflation broke through target earlier this year, largely because sterling's plunge in value since Britons voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 has pushed up import prices.Policymakers at the European Central Bank are facing the opposite problem -- they are struggling to get inflation up to their 2 percent target ceiling as a strengthening euro has kept price rises in check.They left their own ultra-easy monetary policy alone on Thursday but will decide next month how to proceed with the Bank's massive stimulus program in 2018.ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro's exchange rate is ""very important"" and needs careful monitoring.His cautious comments raise the chances the ECB will opt to phase out its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme only very slowly next year, despite solid economic growth.""The current economic conditions warrant a slightly less accommodative monetary policy in the near future, provided the euro or any other disturbing element do not derail the euro zone's recovery,"" said Louis Harreau at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).In the United States, the Federal Reserve has already started on a tightening cycle but appears to be getting more dovish in the face of weak economic data.Recent comments from Fed policymakers show a split on the outlook for inflation and how that will play out for future interest rate increases so August price data due on Thursday should give markets more of a steer.The Swiss National Bank also meets on Thursday but is unlikely to move, with political tensions and low inflation keeping their hands tied.Switzerland's franc is susceptible to appreciation during periods of increased geopolitical tension and the potential for conflict in the Korean peninsula will weigh on minds.North Korea has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions and tested several missiles this year, including one that flew over Japan. Pyongyang conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3.A survey on Friday showed most South Koreans doubt North Korea will start a war, although President Donald Trump again highlighted the possibility of a U.S. military response."
235,"Sep 05, 2017 03:22PM ET","Dollar falls on concern about North Korea, Fed rate outlook",nan,"By Sam ForgioneNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on course for its biggest daily percentage decline against the safe-haven yen in more than three months on Tuesday on concern about North Korea's largest nuclear test and a Federal Reserve official's comments about low U.S. inflation.The dollar fell as much as 1 percent against the Japanese currency to 108.65 yen, its lowest since Aug. 29 after North Korea conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test two days ago. The dollar was last set for its biggest daily drop against the yen since mid-May. A top North Korean diplomat warned that his country was ready to send ""more gift packages"" to the United States as world powers struggled for a response to Pyongyang's latest nuclear weapons test.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell as much as 0.5 percent to a session low of 92.183 (DXY) and was set for its biggest daily percentage decline in eight days.The dollar fell as much as 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, on the risks surrounding North Korea to a session low of 0.9545 franc . ""It’s a more risk-averse picture,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York. ""North Korea accounts for most of it."" Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said inflation was ""well short"" of target, so the Fed should be cautious about raising U.S. interest rates.Analysts said the comments cast more doubt over the likelihood of another rate hike this year. Brainard, a permanent voting member on the Fed's monetary policy committee, has in the past convinced colleagues to delay tightening.""Brainard sounded fairly dovish, and talked about inflation tracking lower,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut. ""That does not sound like someone inclined to vote for a rate hike in December.""The Fed has raised rates twice this year. Investors have since grown skeptical and now give a December rate hike a 27 percent probability, down from 30 percent before Brainard spoke. The euro gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1.1939 <EUR=> ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting. That was still below a more than 2-1/2-year high of $1.2069 touched last week. The euro gained even as analysts expect ECB policymakers might voice some concerns at the meeting about the euro's strength.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

237,"Sep 04, 2017 06:00AM ET","Bank of Canada to hike rates in October, September risk fairly low: Reuters poll",nan,"By Leah Schnurr and Anu BarariaOTTAWA/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is likely to leave interest rates unchanged at its Sept. 6 meeting and wait until October to raise them, allowing time for more data to show whether still-tame inflation pressure is picking up, a Reuters poll released on Friday showed.While 24 of 33 economists surveyed in the past few days said an October rate hike was most likely, six forecast rates would rise on Wednesday to 1.0 percent, with several changing their view after a very strong second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) report.Another three said the next rate hike would be in January.The BoC in July raised rates for the first time in seven years, surprising some who thought the central bank lacked inflationary evidence to do so. But the latest poll suggests the decision at this meeting would be more clear-cut.Roughly two years after Canada's economy was hit hard by a sharp drop in the price of crude, a rebound in the major oil producer has made it the fastest grower among the Group of Seven most industrialized nations.Second-quarter GDP growth clocked its best rate in nearly six years at an annualized 4.5 percent, topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll.While that is welcome news, the BoC has a better opportunity to explain its policy in October when it updates its economic forecasts and holds a press conference, said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.BoC officials have also refrained from making any public speeches since the July rate hike, which was preceded by several hawkish comments.""With this bank you can't rule anything out. But after the pains they went through to signal July ... and then you get nothing, it just makes it difficult to believe they want to go again,"" said Reitzes.While financial market pricing suggests a nearly 50 percent probability of a hike next week from around 20 percent ahead of the GDP figures on Thursday, traders have almost completely priced in a hike by October. The Reuters poll pegged the odds of a Sept. 6 hike much lower, at 25 percent, and October at 75 percent. ""We expect the September meeting is too soon and the BoC would like to be more gradual,"" noted  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB economists Evan Carmean and Michael Carey, who on Friday added an Oct. 25 rate rise to their call. Any further appreciation in the Canadian dollar, which is up about 9 percent since the start of the year, could also give the central bank reason for pause as that could hurt exports, a sector the bank has long looked to for stronger growth.Still, analysts at CIBC, Scotiabank and 4CAST brought forward their rate hike forecasts to September after the second-quarter GDP data were published. National Bank, which still expects the BoC to wait until October to move, has penciled in an additional rate hike in December.The U.S. Federal Reserve is also forecast to raise the federal funds rate again in the fourth quarter. [ECILT/US]RISKS AHEADSeveral risks may still stand in the way of further BoC policy tightening, most notably a possible correction in a hot housing market and persistently muted consumer price inflation. Tighter mortgage rules adopted by the government last year, as well as measures including a foreign buyers tax implemented by Ontario earlier this year, have led to a sharp slowdown in Canada's financial capital Toronto.While chances of the slump spreading nationally are low, another rate hike could depress activity by hurting consumer demand, economists said.An average Canadian household owed a near-record C$1.67 ($1.35) for every dollar of disposable income in the first quarter, mainly because of mortgage debt.Inflation, by contrast, has remained lackluster. Although it ticked higher in July, it was still well below the bank's 2 percent target.Something else that could also disturb the bank's anticipated rate hike path is if the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) turns ugly.Having implemented anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to terminate NAFTA altogether.That would likely hurt Canada's economy given the country sends over 75 percent of its exports south of the border.On an extra question in the survey, 15 out of 25 analysts said they were very or somewhat concerned that Trump would make good on his threat to terminate the trade pact.(Polling by Anu Bararia; Editing by Ross Finley and Richard Chang)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

While the dollar was last higher on the day as investors consolidated positions, it was not far from its lowest in more than a year against major rivals as uncertainty was expected to continue weighing on the greenback following President Donald Trump's ouster of White House communications chief Anthony Scaramucci on Monday.Concerns also persisted about whether the Fed would raise interest rates again this year.

251,"Jul 26, 2017 06:05AM ET",Another note of caution on European stocks as Credit Suisse says euro strength could bite,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's global strategists slightly rolled back their ""overweight"" stance on euro zone stocks on Wednesday as a surging euro and the potential for the brisk pace of inflows to ease forces a rethink on one of the year's most popular trades. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is the latest big broker to sound a note of caution on European stocks. Europe remains an ""overweight"" at the firm and is their most preferred region globally after emerging markets.However, the euro's 10.5 percent rally this year has raised worries about the impact on profits for exporters, such as Europe's auto makers, who have long benefited from a weaker currency and account for a large portion of the region's profit pool.Those concerns come just as a brighter macroeconomic backdrop, easing political concerns and robust earnings have seen foreign investors, particularly from the U.S., return in numbers to European stocks and take valuations back above long-term averages.Credit Suisse estimated that a 10 percent rise in the euro would take around 6 percentage points off earnings growth. Economists at the firm see the euro rising to $1.22 against the dollar over the next year.Roughly half of continental European corporate profits are generated outside the euro zone, according to Credit Suisse, and the impact of the currency is an area of focus in the ongoing second-quarter earnings season. Credit Suisse pointed out that while Europe may be a consensus trade on a three or 12-month view, long-term investors are still skeptical as only 9 percent have chosen Europe as their ""top long"" on a five-year time horizon.The pan-European STOXX 600 index has gained around 6 percent so for this year, as has the blue chip euro zone-focused index, for which Credit Suisse cut its year-end target to 3,650 from 3,800.They also reduced their rating on French equities back to benchmark on concerns around euro strength, valuations and the economy, and also trimmed their ""overweight"" in Spanish equities.The broker remains ""underweight"" Italian stocks.Credit Suisse said it favored European stocks most geared to the domestic recovery and named ""outperform"" rated Deutsche Wohnen, Telenet, Aena, Cellnex,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Enel  (MI:ENEI),  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) among their picks.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

254,"Jul 20, 2017 03:31AM ET",Fintech charmed by Macron but reluctant to leave London for Paris,nan,"By Jemima KellyPARIS (Reuters) - France's fast-growing fintech sector is optimistic the country's dynamic new president will push it up the global rankings. But startups based in London do not yet seem ready to swap that key hub for Paris, even if they have French roots.The nascent industry, ranging from mobile payment apps to ""cryptocurrencies"" like bitcoin, is seen by governments and business alike as crucial to the future of financial services and of vital importance, therefore, to economic growth. Britain says fintech contributes $9 billion to the economy, provides 60,000 jobs and will continue to be a priority. But since last June's vote to leave the European Union, other countries have been jostling to replace London as the sector's main European hub.Paris, with its huge financial sector, famous universities, and history of inventions such as world-wide-web precursor Minitel, might seem like an obvious contender. Of the top 10 European banks by global assets, four are French, and its fund management industry is also one of the biggest in the world. Yet a recent Deloitte study ranked Paris 29th among global fintech hubs, and only seventh in Europe, thanks to a lack of investment, rigid labor laws and a reputation for being less international than other cities. London was top. President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker voted in two months ago, wants to change all that. He has pledged 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) to an innovation fund to help turn France into a ""startup nation"". Last month the 39-year-old president attended the launch of ""F Station"" in Paris, the world's biggest startup campus. Alain Falys, CEO of mobile payments startup YoYo Wallet, is based in a fintech co-working space in London's Canary Wharf but is originally from northern France. For him, London was the ""obvious choice"" when he was choosing a base in 2013 and he will stay put, although he said he might consider Paris if starting out now.""If Macron pursues his globalist, internationalist agenda - if he continues to visit incubators, speak in English, if he shows he’s really understood the force of labor reform in terms of job creation of this sector, he will draw in young people from all over Europe,"" Falys said.""(British Prime Minister) Theresa May will attract no one.""BREXIT OPPORTUNITY Paris sees Britain's expected departure from the EU, now being negotiated, as an opportunity to lure back some of the people it has lost to London.But no one interviewed for this article, including lobbying group Paris Europlace and trade organization FranceFintech, knew of a company that was either moving from London to Paris or opening an additional office there since the vote for Brexit.Some startups like Transferwise, started by an Estonian and one of Britain's biggest success stories, have said they will open offices somewhere in the EU.But many say London's prowess in both finance and technology, as well as its internationalism and light-touch regulation, will make it hard to knock off the top spot, at least for now. The French fintech sector raised less than a tenth of the venture capital raised by Britain in 2016 - $68 million compared with $783 million, according to Deloitte. ""We have the world’s greatest financial center and one of the biggest tech hubs in one global city – factors that cannot be replicated in Paris or anywhere else in Europe,"" London's deputy mayor for business and enterprise, Rajesh Agrawal, told Reuters.""FRIENDLY TO ENTREPRENEURS""London says that dynamic will not change, but Brexit is already affecting the city's image elsewhere.""We were envious, a bit scared of London,"" said Andre Meyams, co-founder of BeeAm, an online asset management marketplace, at the sidelines of the ""Fin & Tech Community"" conference in Paris last month. ""Brexit made people realize that Paris could be the future."" The fact that Macron used to work as an investment banker, and was then economics minister, also comforts the fintech sector, which works alongside banks and other traditional financial institutions as often as it seeks to displace them. Many banks have set up ""accelerator"" spaces, where they mentor startups and sometimes invest in them.  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) has one such space in Paris's central business district called ""Le Village"", where Bruno Van Haetsdaele, the founder of personal finance and budgeting app Linxo, works alongside 99 other startups.""Macron will bring trust. He's very transparent, he's very friendly to entrepreneurs, and he has a vision that's very international,"" said Van Haetsdaele. Others say Paris's focus on the domestic market make cities such as Dublin or Amsterdam more likely successors to London. ""What I love about London is it's so international,"" said Nikolay Storonsky, the Russian CEO of London-based foreign payments app Revolut. ""Paris is not international at all.""Many start-ups say the most crucial change that Macron can make is to shake up France's labor laws, which they say have made it difficult to hire and fire employees. ""You need to be flexible when you're a startup,"" said ING's head of fintech, Benoit Legrand, a Belgian who is based in Paris. ""You need to be able to test different things out."" Britain's regulators have led the way in allowing startups to test out ideas in the real market, under supervision, with a so-called ""regulatory sandbox"". It is a system that many countries have copied, though France is yet to put in place. ($1 = 0.8818 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The data boosted the Australian dollar given the country's trade relationship with China, analysts said. The Aussie shot to a more than two-year high of $0.7840 , with bulls targeting the 200-week moving average around $0.8018 , but was last down slightly against the dollar at $0.7819. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, touched its lowest since last September of 95.018 (DXY). While it was last mostly flat on the day, it was not far from that 10-month trough at 95.157.Against the Mexican peso, the dollar hit 17.5340 pesos , putting it near Friday's more than one-year low of 17.530. ""The better-than-expected China data has been supportive for emerging markets"" and the Australian dollar, said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.Expectations for another Fed rate hike this year have been pared to less than a 50-percent probability after the latest U.S. inflation print on Friday.With no top-tier data this week, markets have plenty of time to mull the repeated disappointment on prices, which has cast a question mark over the Fed's confidence that inflation would soon rebound.""The markets are not convinced the Fed is going to be tightening rates anytime soon,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York. ""In that kind of an environment, the dollar is struggling.""The euro was last mostly flat against the dollar at $1.1465 , while the dollar recovered from Friday's nearly two-week low against the yen of 112.24 yen  to last trade 0.3 percent higher against the Japanese currency at 112.83 yen.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

258,"Jul 07, 2017 12:29PM ET",ECB taper fears leave euro zone bonds battered and bruised,nan,"By Dhara RanasingheLONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields edged higher on Friday, adding to heavy losses earlier in the week as investors reassess the outlook for fixed income on perceptions that an era of ultra-cheap money is gradually ending.Euro zone growth is picking up but underlying inflation is still weak, so the European Central Bank should adjust its policy carefully and flexibly to avoid abrupt market moves, ECB board member Benoit Coeure told two European newspapers.The Bank of Japan meanwhile said it would purchase an unlimited amount of bonds as it seeks to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds.Euro zone bond yields, which jumped as much as 12 basis points on Thursday as minutes from the ECB's latest meeting showed policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing monetary stimulus, rose 1-2 basis points on Friday. They were thrust higher after data showed the U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labor market strength.Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield edged up to 0.58 percent , a fresh 18-month high. Low-rated Italian, Spanish and Portuguese government bond yields, seen as particularly vulnerable to unwinding of extraordinary stimulus, were particularly hard hit, rising 5-8 bps.   ""The market is unlikely to keep selling off without fresh information...But sentiment remains bearish,"" said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). In just over a week, Bund yields have doubled, with German bonds bearing the brunt of selling in euro zone debt markets.""If the market is going to conclude that monetary policy makers are making an effort to tighten, we should have spreads widening, so that could be the next shoe to drop as the sell-off starts to impact credit and equities,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho.Jitters about tighter monetary policies from major central banks have rippled throughout global markets, hurting stocks and supporting the euro.U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) rose on Thursday on the back of the employment data and concern that rising oil prices could spur inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, 10-year Japanese government bond yields  hit five-month highs on Friday before the BOJ said it would buy JGBs.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

259,"Jul 07, 2017 02:10AM ET",Dollar bulls stumble as euro's outlook brightens: Reuters poll,nan,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari KishanBENGALURU (Reuters) - The multi-year rising trend for the U.S. dollar appears to have hit a wall, with a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters less bullish on the greenback than at the start of the year and more optimistic about the euro.The dollar has taken a beating in 2017 as economic growth and inflation in the United States has not taken off as previously thought, and President Donald Trump's reflationary policies have hit a series of political obstacles.""The outlook for the dollar is less bullish than at the beginning of the year...given that the fiscal stimulus has not yet materialized and that the likelihood of any announcement in the second half of the year looks limited,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, has lost nearly 6 percent this year, marking its weakest performance for the first half of a year in well over a decade.While Reuters foreign exchange polls this year have predicted the dollar to strengthen slightly, the latest poll of around 70 strategists taken over the past week showed the outlook has broadly dimmed.A majority of strategists, 43 of 71, who answered an extra question said their dollar outlook was less bullish now compared with the beginning of the year. Seventeen said they were more bearish, only five said they were more bullish, and the remaining six strategists said they were less bearish.Speculators have also cut bets in favor of the dollar. Net long positions fell to their lowest in a year, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters.POLICY DIVERGING LESS?Improving economic growth in Europe and Canada has opened the door for a shift in monetary policy. Hints from both the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada that may happen soon have ramped up those expectations.Pushing in the opposite direction, Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises.""The policy divergence trade, which created a significantly stronger dollar, is looking less and less well-grounded,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""We could see less policy divergence going forward between the Fed and other central banks and that should encourage further reversal of dollar strength.""But some strategists struck a more positive note. Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, argued that the shift in central banks' focus away from inflation and instead towards growth should help the dollar.""Several G10 central banks have dropped their easing bias of late while the Fed has remained committed to its tightening cycle. This has given rise to the FX convergence trade where investors buy currencies with an improving growth outlook and ignore their challenging inflation outlook.""""(The dollar) remains a reliable long - the 'cash cow' of the convergence trade – and it should benefit from an improving U.S. growth outlook"" in the second half of this year,"" added Marinov in a note to clients.EURO FLAVOR FAVOREDThe euro has gained around 8 percent against the dollar in 2017 so far. It is predicted to hold onto those gains over the coming 12 months, trading at around $1.13, roughly where it is now, and in one and 12 months' time.That 12-month view is the strongest euro bet since a January 2015 Reuters foreign exchange poll, the month when the ECB announced that it would start buying bonds on a monthly basis.A little over half the common contributors compared with the previous month have upgraded their 12-month euro view.At the beginning of 2017, there were several forecasters calling for the euro to crash below parity to the dollar, but not a single strategist in the latest poll expects that to happen over the coming year.That is mostly thanks to ECB President Mario Draghi's more upbeat assessment on the euro zone economy. However, Reuters polls over several years have been clear that a fall below parity wasn't likely.""There is further scope for recent EUR trends to extend, but this is contingent on how ongoing ECB rhetoric unfolds from here,"" noted Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan.""While EUR/USD is already very close to our year-end target of 1.15, this is not necessarily a hurdle, given that the strength in the pair is as much a manifestation of broad USD weakness, given the extreme subdued pricing for the Fed.""(Polling by Sujith Pai and Krishna Eluri; Editing by Ross Finley and Hugh Lawson)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Draghi also hinted at a willingness to look through some of the factors holding down price growth, which Martin Arnold, currency strategist with ETF Securities in London, said was what the market was reacting to. ""However, he's got a track record of keeping the stimulus in place so when you've got a market that's positioned ... for euro longs, we're just concerned that there's more downside risk to the euro than upside because it could unwind pretty quick if action doesn't follow the rhetoric,"" Arnold said.The single currency's strength pulled the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, to an eight-day low of 96.846, more than half a percent lower on the day.

Banks  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) underpinned gains on the index. ""Markets are celebrating the fact the Macron government has been strengthened by this outcome,"" said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.""Planned reforms could enhance the growth potential of the country and reduce the structural deficit, something whichwould lift French GDP going forward,"" he added.Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding said France could become the strongest major economy in Europe in a decade.He said this would outclass ""a Germany that is resting on its laurels and a UK that is impairing its long-term growth prospects by losing (some of) its preferential access to its major market, the EU,"" Schmieding said. Britain began negotiations on Monday on leaving the European Union. Euro zone blue-chips (STOXX50E) rose 1 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.8 percent.The retail sector, particularly grocers, which were sent into a tailspin on Friday after Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods, bounced back, partly on hopes of more deal activity in the sector.The regional retail index (SXRP), which suffered its worst week in 16 months last week, rose 0.8 percent. Britain's Ocado (L:OCDO) was up more than 6 percent, the top performing major stock across the region.Exane upgraded Ocado to ""outperform"" on hopes that partnerships, if not a takeout, were more likely.

""Ocado might not be a target but the probability of a partnership just increased materially.""Dutch healthcare technology firm Philips (AS:PHG) jumped to a 15-year high after The Times reported activist hedge fund Third Point was building a stake in the company.Also, in notable broker activity,  Credit Suisse  found favor among analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).Citi named Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) its preferred Swiss bank, while Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage on the stock with an ""outperform.""

270,"May 22, 2017 01:25PM ET","Hackers hit Russian bank customers, planned international cyber raids",nan,"By Jack StubbsMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian cyber criminals used malware planted on Android mobile devices to steal from domestic bank customers and were planning to target European lenders before their arrest, investigators and sources with knowledge of the case told Reuters.Their campaign raised a relatively small sum by cyber-crime standards - more than 50 million roubles ($892,000) - but they had also obtained more sophisticated malicious software for a modest monthly fee to go after the clients of banks in France and possibly a range of other western nations.Russia's relationship to cyber crime is under intense scrutiny after U.S. intelligence officials alleged that Russian hackers had tried to help Republican Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency by hacking Democratic Party servers. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegation. The gang members tricked the Russian banks' customers into downloading malware via fake mobile banking applications, as well as via pornography and e-commerce programs, according to a report compiled by cyber security firm Group-IB which investigated the attack with the Russian Interior Ministry.The criminals - 16 suspects were arrested by Russian law enforcement authorities in November last year - infected more than a million smartphones in Russia, on average compromising 3,500 devices a day, Group-IB said.The hackers targeted customers of state lender Sberbank (MM:SBER), and also stole money from accounts at Alfa Bank and online payments company Qiwi (O:QIWI), exploiting weaknesses in the companies' SMS text message transfer services, said two people with direct knowledge of the case.Although operating only in Russia before their arrest, they had developed plans to target large European banks including French lenders  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), Group-IB said. A BNP Paribas spokeswoman said the bank could not confirm this information, but added that it ""has a significant set of measures in place aimed at fighting cyber attacks on a daily basis"". Societe Generale and Credit Agricole declined comment.The gang, which was called ""Cron"" after the malware it used, did not steal any funds from customers of the three French banks. However, it exploited the bank service in Russia that allows users to transfer small sums to other accounts by sending an SMS message. Having infected the users' phones, the gang sent SMS messages from those devices instructing the banks to transfer money to the hackers' own accounts.The findings illustrate the dangers of using SMS messages for mobile banking, a method favored in emerging countries with less advanced internet infrastructure, said Lukas Stefanko, a malware researcher at cyber security firm ESET in Slovakia.""It's becoming popular among developing nations or in the countryside where access to conventional banking is difficult for people,"" he said. ""For them it is quick, easy and they don't need to visit a bank... But security always has to outweigh consumer convenience.""CYBER CRIMINALSThe Russian Interior Ministry said a number of people had been arrested, including what it described as the gang leader. This was a 30-year-old man living in Ivanovo, an industrial city 300 km (185 miles) northeast of Moscow, from where he had commanded a team of 20 people across six different regions.Four people remain in detention while the others are under house arrest, the ministry said in a statement. ""In the course of 20 searches across six regions, police seized computers, hundreds of bank cards and SIM cards registered under fake names,"" it said. Group-IB said the existence of the Cron malware was first detected in mid-2015, and by the time of the arrests the hackers had been using it for under a year.The core members of the group were detained on Nov. 22 last year in Ivanovo. Photographs of the operation released by Group-IB showed one suspect face down in the snow as police in ski masks handcuffed him.The ""Cron"" hackers were arrested before they could mount attacks outside Russia, but plans to do that were at an advanced stage, said the investigators. Group-IB said that in June 2016 they had rented a piece of malware designed to attack mobile banking systems, called ""Tiny.z"" for $2,000 a month. The creators of the ""Tiny.z"" malware had adapted it to attack banks in Britain, Germany, France, the United States and Turkey, among other countries.The ""Cron"" gang developed software designed to attack lenders including the three French groups, it said, adding it had notified these and other European banks at risk. A spokeswoman for Sberbank said she had no information about the group involved. However, she said: ""Several groups of cyber criminals are working against Sberbank. The number of groups and the methods they use to attack us change constantly.""""It isn't clear which specific group is being referred to here because the fraudulent scheme involving Android OS (operating system) viruses is widespread in Russia and Sberbank has effectively combated it for an extensive period of time.""Alfa Bank did not provide a comment. Qiwi did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Google (O:GOOGL), the maker of Android, has taken steps in recent years to protect users from downloading malicious code and by blocking apps which are insecure, impersonate legitimate companies or engage in deceptive behaviors. A Google spokesman said: ""We've tracked this malware family for several years and will continue to take action on its variants to protect our users.""FAKE MOBILE APPSThe Russian authorities, bombarded with allegations of state-sponsored hacking, are keen to show Russia too is a frequent victim of cyber crime and that they are working hard to combat it. The interior and emergencies ministries, as well as Sberbank, said they were targeted in a global cyberattack earlier this month.Since the allegations about the U.S. election hacking, further evidence has emerged of what some Western officials say is a symbiotic relationship between cyber criminals and Russian authorities, with hackers allowed to attack foreign targets with impunity in return for cooperating with the security services while Moscow clamps down on those operating at home.The success of the Cron gang was facilitated by the popularity of SMS-banking services in Russia, said Dmitry Volkov, head of investigations at Group-IB.The gang got their malware on to victims' devices by setting up applications designed to mimic banks' genuine apps. When users searched online, the results would suggest the fake app, which they would then download. The hackers also inserted malware into fake mobile apps for well-known pornography sites.After infecting a customer's phone, the hackers were able to send a text message to the bank initiating a transfer of up to $120 to one of 6,000 bank accounts set up to receive the fraudulent payments.The malware would then intercept a confirmation code sent by the bank and block the victim from receiving a message notifying them about the transaction.""Cron's success was due to two main factors,"" Volkov said. ""First, the large-scale use of partner programs to distribute the malware in different ways. Second, the automation of many (mobile) functions which allowed them to carry out the thefts without direct involvement.""

272,"May 17, 2017 10:05PM ET",Japan's economy expands at fastest pace in a year in Jan-March,nan,"By Leika Kihara and Minami FunakoshiTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade, heightening prospects that robust overseas demand will underpin a steady recovery.The data offers some relief to Bank of Japan policymakers, who are hoping that the economy gathers enough momentum to drive up wage growth and inflation, which remain low on soft household spending.Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, grew an annualized 2.2 percent in January-March, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday, exceeding a median market forecast for a 1.7 percent rise to post the fastest growth rate since January-March 2016.It marked the fifth straight quarter of expansion, the longest growth run since a six-quarter streak through 2006, when the Bank of Japan was exiting from its previous quantitative easing program on signs of strength in the economy.""The economy is enjoying comfortable growth driven by both domestic and external demand,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""Consumer spending remains relatively soft and it has a room to improve. But the economy passed the grade both in terms of the pace of growth and the quality of the expansion.""Japan's economy has shown signs of life with exports and factory output benefiting from a pick-up in overseas demand.But consumer prices are barely rising as companies remain wary of increasing wages, keeping the BOJ under pressure to maintain its massive stimulus despite signs of strength in the economy.Nominal GDP, or GDP at current market prices, fell 0.1 percent in the first quarter after flat growth in October-December as weak demand prevented many firms from passing on rising import costs to households, underscoring the challenges of eradicating Japan's sticky deflationary mindset.Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), increased 0.4 percent in the first quarter, matching market forecasts and posting its fifth straight quarter of increases.Capital expenditure gained 0.2 percent in the first quarter, confounding market expectations for a 0.4 percent fall.Offshore demand, or exports minus imports, added 0.1 percentage point to growth, a sign that improvements in overseas economies underpinned Japan's recovery.Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara said there was no change to the government's view that the economy continued to recover moderately, backed by a tightening job market.""But we need to be mindful of overseas economic uncertainties and the effect of market volatility,"" he said."

274,"May 05, 2017 10:50AM ET",Moment of truth for the euro as France votes,nan,"By Jonathan CableLONDON (Reuters) - The fate of the European Union and the euro could hang on the outcome of Sunday's French presidential election.The expected victory of centrist, pro-EU candidate Emmanuel Macron would be taken by markets as a sign that political risk in Europe is receding; a surprise win for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen would raise the risk that the euro zone's number two economy could abandon the single currency and even leave the EU.Surveys on Friday showed Macron ahead by 62 percent to 38, but investors are wary of opinion polls after recent political shocks such as Donald Trump's election to the White House and Britain's decision last year to leave the EU.Le Pen has lately played down her plans to quit the EU and the euro, saying this may not be her top priority. But if she wins, the euro will fall around 5 percent in the immediate aftermath, a Reuters poll found this week. No major survey sees her becoming president, but a victory would increase volatility in financial markets, particularly in European equities, bonds, and currencies. A vote for Macron would retain the status quo.""We expect Macron to win the second round of the French presidential election on Sunday. This outcome should usher in a period of subsiding political risk in the euro zone,"" said Valentin Marinov at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).Economic growth in the bloc will be steady but modest over the coming year, but that will depend partly on Macron getting the keys to the Elysee Palace, a Reuters poll of economists showed last month. There is no major data due from the currency bloc in the coming week to shed light on how the economy has fared at the start of the second quarter, but numbers on Friday will show how industry rounded out the first quarter.Purchasing manager surveys earlier this week showed euro zone businesses raced into the second quarter, increasing activity at the fastest rate in six years in April, suggesting the bloc's economic recovery is broad-based and sustainable. STEADY AS SHE GOESAcross the Channel in Britain, whose economy has performed surprisingly well since the Brexit vote, the Bank of England meets to decide monetary policy but no surprises are expected.None of 62 economists polled by Reuters expects the bank rate to be adjusted from its record low of 0.25 percent on Thursday. A recent Reuters survey found there would be no change until 2019 at least as the central bank waits to see how EU divorce negotiations pan out. Fractious talks are the biggest risk to the British economy while a smooth running of negotiations would be the most beneficial factor for growth, polls have shown.Having called a snap election for June 8, Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party has a runaway lead over the opposition so will likely decide Britain's stance in the talks.If opinion polls are right, May will win a strong new mandate endorsing her vision for Brexit, which sees the country leaving the EU's single market - a potential negative for growth - in order to win more freedom to set its own laws, control immigration and seek its own trade deals.""Politics is also likely to be a major focus with less than five weeks until the UK's General Election on 8 June. One potential date to look out for is Monday, where there are tentative reports that the Conservative Party will release its manifesto,"" noted Investec economists.Adding to the central bank's deliberations, inflation is above its 2 percent target and will outpace wage growth this year, hitting the shoppers who have been shoring up the economy.The Bank will also publish its Quarterly Inflation Report, while sector detail in the form of industrial production and construction output will be revealed by the Office for National Statistics, as well as the RICS housing survey and March trade figures.Other central banks meeting in the coming week include those from New Zealand, Malaysia, Peru and the Philippines. None of them are expected to change tack either.China will draw some attention with the start of the usual monthly run of data. Chinese authorities are addressing financial stability risks and looking closely at credit, so April's figures will be of interestThere is little hard data expected from the United States, but retail sales and core inflation data on Friday could cement expectations for a June tightening by the Federal Reserve.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

275,"Apr 27, 2017 08:58AM ET",Atlantia taps pool of banks to finance Abertis' takeover bid: sources,nan,"By Pamela BarbagliaLONDON (Reuters) - Italian toll-road operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) has tapped banks to finance an upcoming cash-and-share bid for Spanish rival  Abertis  (MC:ABE), sources told Reuters, as it seeks to create an industry giant with a market value of more than 35 billion euros ($38 billion).Atlantia said last week it was interested in reaching an agreement to acquire Abertis, but the Spanish infrastructure group's Chief Financial Officer Jose Aljaro said on Wednesday that it had not yet received any concrete bids.Atlantia's advisers  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) and Abertis' adviser Citi (N:C) have committed to provide financing for the transaction with a formal bid expected to be announced as soon as next week, the sources said.The pool of financing banks will also include Italian lenders UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) MI> and France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), the sources said.The overall financing package is estimated to be worth more than 10 billion euros, two of the sources said, with one adding it could involve a consortium of about ten banks.Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are also expected to take part in the financing, the sources said. Atlantia, which operates Rome's two airports and around 5,000 kms of toll motorways, is set to hold a board meeting on Thursday and may give the green light to a formal bid for Abertis, another source said, cautioning no deal was certain.Spokesmen at Abertis, Mediobanca, UniCredit, Intesa, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Santander declined to comment while Atlantia, Citi and Credit Agricole were not immediately available.EUROPEAN CHAMPIONA tie-up between Abertis and Atlantia, which is 30-percent controlled by the Benetton family, would create one of the biggest infrastructure groups in Europe, generating around 60 percent of its core profits outside Italy.Atlantia has long been trying to lure its Spanish rival to the negotiating table, the sources said, in a bid to diversify away from Italy. But Barcelona-based Abertis, a crown jewel of Catalonia, has only recently started contemplating the possibility of a sale to enable the business to cope with domestic challenges including a series of concessions that will soon expire, the sources said.By 2021 Abertis will lose up to 1,000 kilometers of its toll roads in Spain, which run along the Mediterranean coast and around Seville, representing around 10 percent of the group's business. The Spanish government has promised that these highways will be toll free when the concessions end between 2019 and 2021. As a consequence, Abertis has increased its portfolio of foreign concessions over the past 12 months and reduced the weight of the Spanish business to around 20 per cent of its revenues and core earnings.Atlantia's boss Giovanni Castellucci recently told a shareholder meeting in Rome that the deal would unlock ""substantial growth"" for the two companies, adding he was only interested in a friendly deal.Rome-based Atlantia will also use the proceeds from a planned 15 percent stake sale in its Italian motorway business Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI) [AUTSA.UL] to finance the Abertis deal, the sources said. Analysts said it could pocket around 2 billion euros from the ASPI stake sale.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

U.S. President Donald Trump's plan would cut the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent and reduce the top tax rate assessed on pass-through businesses, including small partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent.The dollar hit its highest level of the month against the yen of 111.77 yen  just before the plan's unveiling, but pared gains after the announcement and last stood little changed against the Japanese currency at 111.15.

The same polls showed Macron defeating Le Pen by as much as 30 percentage points in two weeks' time, suggesting players can buy back into the currency. The euro's session high briefly put the currency up about 2 percent against the greenback.Sunday's outcome reduced the prospect of an anti-establishment shock on the scale of Britain's vote last June to quit the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.The euro's dip from its session high likely indicated profit-taking rather than doubts about a Macron victory over Le Pen in the second round, said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York.""The news of Macron winning is now priced in,"" he said. ""The risks of a disintegration of the euro have been removed.""Strategists at French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said their positioning measures showed the euro had been bought for most of the last week, suggesting that many players had already closed previous short bets against the currency.

282,"Apr 06, 2017 09:31AM ET",Sterling's fate hangs on tone of Brexit negotiations: Reuters poll,nan,"By Jonathan CableLONDON (Reuters) - How Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union progress will decide whether sterling sinks possibly as low as $1.10 or bounces as high as $1.50 in the coming year, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists found.The pound  is down well over 10 percent since the surprise referendum vote on June 23 to leave the EU, following a short-term move in the currency that was correctly predicted by Reuters polls. It was trading around $1.248 earlier on Thursday.If the divorce negotiations turn fractious, sterling will fall to $1.17, according to the median view. Several analysts said it would sink to $1.10 -- a level not seen since 1985, just before the United States devalued the dollar. Conversely if talks run smoothly, the median forecast was for it to bounce to $1.30 -- still below where it was trading at ahead of the June 23 referendum -- although one respondent said it would soar to $1.50.""Sterling is not very closely linked to interest rate expectations at the moment -- it's really whether there is a soft or a hard Brexit driving sterling, and that is going to continue for a year or so,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 last week, starting a two-year countdown to Britain's departure from the EU, which it joined in 1973.So far there is little clarity on what tone the talks will take, but concern over immigration from other EU member states was a major reason behind the leave vote and May has said she will respect those fears by halting freedom of movement.Such a move would probably lead to denial of access to Europe's single market, hurting trade. May has said ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" and that she is prepared to walk away from the talks. But a parliamentary committee said earlier this week May must prove that by offering an assessment of the economic impact of leaving the EU with no agreement.RANGE-BOUND FOR NOWAccording to the regular poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken in the past week, sterling will trade between $1.22 and $1.24 in the next 12 months. Those medians were little changed from a March poll.""While we believe headline risk will keep the market's bearish sterling bias intact this year, a stronger structural position supports our view of some sterling recovery in 2018,"" said Vassili Serebriakov at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).Sterling is likely to come under pressure from interest rate hikes in the United States. The Federal Reserve is expected to follow up on a March increase with two more rises later this year while the Bank of England is not expected to move until 2019 at least. [FED/R] [BOE/INT]Across the channel, the European Central Bank will also be maintaining its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for the foreseeable future and the euro faces its own headwinds in the coming months.Elections in Germany and possibly Italy could harm the euro project while a win for the far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen in the French presidential race could precipitate an eventual end to the common currency altogether. With French opinion polls suggesting Le Pen is unlikely to take up residence in the Elysee Palace, the Reuters poll found a shock victory for her would trigger an immediate 5 percent fall in the euro  against the dollar. [EUR/POLL] Medians show one euro (EURGBP=) will be worth 86.0 pence in a month and 88.0p in six months and a year, slightly more than predicted in the March poll.

Despite increasing activity at the fastest rate in nearly six years, factories across the euro zone struggled to keep up with demand last month, according to a survey that showed them again hiking prices.France will vote in a two-round presidential election at the end this month and at the start of May, with investors worried by the risk that the far-right anti-EU Marine Le Pen could stage a surprise victory. Polls show Le Pen seeing off her rivals in the upcoming first round of the French presidential elections, but being beaten in the run-off vote. ""Investors are still realizing that the risks going into the French elections are still quite considerable, so there's no real opportunity to express any bullish view on the euro at this stage,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.The dollar index (DXY) - which measures the greenback against six major rivals - inched up to 100.64, just below a three-week high, leaving it up 0.1 percent on the day. Data on Friday showed investors reduced bets on dollar strength for the first time in four weeks in the week up to last Tuesday. [IMM/FX]Markets were eyeing the U.S. non-farm payrolls report due on Friday for clues on the likely pace of interest rate rises from the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""The real focus is going to be in the week ahead given how much data we have coming out ... which of course is absolutely key in trying to assess whether we will see another hike from the Fed in June,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Christian Lawrence in London.A spate of mixed U.S. economic data on Friday reinforced the Fed's view that the economy is growing at a steady but not rapid pace.Investors also parsed comments from Fed officials on Friday, some of which pressured the greenback. Markets are currently pricing in more than a 50 percent chance that the central bank will hike interest rates at its June meeting, the second of the three increases expected this calendar year.

288,"Mar 06, 2017 05:13AM ET",Dollar retreats from Fed-inspired rally,nan,"By Ritvik CarvalhoLONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped in European trading on Monday, as investors took profits after the currency's boost last week on the expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month.News earlier in the day of North Korea firing four ballistic missiles, three of which landed in Japanese waters, also pressured the greenback as investors bought into the perceived safe-haven yen . Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday said the U.S. central bank was set to lift its benchmark interest rate this month, provided jobs and inflation data hold up, which markets saw as cementing a hike at the bank's next meeting.The comments, on the back of a string of hawkish commentary by Federal Reserve officials, saw the dollar slip on Friday as investors took profits from its fourth straight weekly gain against a basket of major currencies (DXY), and it slipped another 0.3 percent on Monday to a one-week low of 101.22. ""It's a continuation of the price action we had on Friday in the wake of Yellen's speech,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Valentin Marinov in London, adding that he saw a positive outlook for the dollar over the long term.""There is some concern in the market that the hike won't be accompanied by more hawkish forward guidance (that would suggest) the Fed would hike three or even four times this year.""Fed funds futures pricing shows traders see around an 80 percent chance of a rate increase this month, up from just a one-in-three chance early last week, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool.Still, speculators reduced bullish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week ending Feb. 28, pushing net longs to their lowest since early October, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday and calculations by Reuters.

Trump on Saturday accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping him during the 2016 election campaign, an accusation rejected by Obama and a top former intelligence official.The euro rose to a two-week high of $1.0640 , as investors continued to monitor France's presidential race. Scandal-hit conservative candidate Francois Fillon said on Sunday he was staying in the race but left the door open to talks with senior members of his party who are increasingly anxious about his bid.Latest polls show Alain Juppe, who is more centrist than Fillon, would reach the second round should he replace him as the Republicans candidate.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

289,"Mar 02, 2017 08:00AM ET",Poll: Czech crown could firm as central bank is seen removing cap,nan,"By Sandor PetoBUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Czech crown (EURCZK=) could firm up more than 4 percent against the euro in the next 12 months as the central bank is expected to remove its cap on the currency, a Reuters survey showed.According to a Feb 27-March 1 poll of 47 participants, the crown could become Central Europe's best-performing currency.As inflation is rising, the Czech central bank could become the first in the region to start to reverse years of loose policy by removing its cap at 27 crowns per euro which it imposed in late 2013 to fend off deflation.It has pledged to keep that regime in place until the end of March and has said it could remove the cap in mid-2017 as inflation has risen to levels around its 2 percent target.In the poll, only one out of 21 analysts projected a firmer crown rate than 27 for the end of March.The bank, which has almost trebled its forex reserves since 2013 by defending the cap, would probably like to get rid of the cap soon, but breaching its commitment would hurt its credibility, analysts said.For the end of May, 8 out of 21 analysts forecast a firmer than 27 exchange rate.That may not be the full number of those who expect the cap to disappear by then as the crown, heavily bought in recent months, may not strengthen right after the cap is abandoned.The most likely date for scrapping the cap is the bank's May 4 meeting when it will also discuss its latest inflation report, said Komercni banka chief economist Jan Vejmelek.""The risk scenario is for an earlier exit, i.e. in April,"" he said, adding that a rise in core inflation made a later exit unlikely.For the end of August, almost all poll participants projected a firmer rate than the cap, with a median 26.45 versus the euro.The consensus projection for the end of February 2018 was 25.9, compared with 25.84 in a poll a month ago. That would represent a 4.3 percent firming compared with Wednesday's close. Romania's leu (EURRON=) is expected to gain 1.1 percent and the zloty 0.4 percent on the same horizon, while the forint (EURHUF=) could ease 0.7 percent and the dinar (EURRSD=) 1.1 percent.Analysts said a likely pick-up in economic growth could help currencies in the region but elections in key euro zone states including France and Germany this year could weigh, while investors watch out for reflation risks in the region.""We expect that local central banks will start to tighten monetary policy either in 2017 (Czechs and Romania) or in 2018 (Poland and Hungary),"" said Krystian Jaworski, analyst of  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""This, combined with expected announcement of QE (asset buying) tapering by the ECB in Sept 2017 should contribute to a strengthening (of the region's currencies),"" he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It would be a big surprise if Trump were to complain about dollar/yen.""Trump's tax promise on Thursday, made during a White House meeting with airline executives, continued to calm some of the nerves that have dominated currency markets for weeks and put the focus back on Trump's efforts to boost economic growth. That reinvigorated dollar bulls.""This was seen as a pivot back to the economic agenda,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York, in reference to Trump's statement on tax reform.

Its front page trumpeted that even larger sums - over 1 million euros - were siphoned her way than it had previously reported.Fillon, 62, has decried the reports as a slur on himself and his wife meant to torpedo his campaign. He has said his wife was paid for genuine work and that he will step down as the mainstream conservative candidate should preliminary judicial inquiries lead to a full-blown investigation.Sable-sur-Sarthe, a riverside farming community of 13,000 people, has been shaken to the core by the scandalous allegations about their most famous local family.Fillon has been Sable's pre-eminent figure since launching himself on a 30-year career in public life that led to a five-year spell as prime minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy until 2012. Solesmes is dominated by an 11th-century Benedictine abbey where the Fillons regularly attend Mass. Local newspaper reporters say the abbey's monks turned out to vote for Fillon at his Republicans party primaries in November.Now the scandal is on everyone's minds. ""Francois Fillon was always someone who you could say hello to. If it's true, it's very troubling,"" said Michel Touchard, 74, a retired stonemason in the nearby village of Solesmes, close to the Fillons' 14th-century manor house.""It is going to give the Right a very hard knock if he pulls out (of the election race). I hope he can get out of this. We need him. We need someone who can run France properly.""A woman called Agnes who would not give her surname said as she emerged from a Solesmes boulangerie with two baguette loaves that she had long been a staunch Fillon backer.""I don't know what to think now. At the beginning we were all for Fillon. Now we don't really know ... Maybe I'll abstain. I'm just a bit disgusted. I'm afraid for his campaign. I'm going to talk it all through with my husband."" Fillon won the primary for the centre-right Republicans after campaigning as a rare honest politician who could coast to victory over a Left divided and deeply unpopular after five years in power, and against an anti-immigrant far right that most French voters would want to keep out of the Elysee.CAR RACING FAN, DEVOUT CATHOLICThe ex-premier, an amateur racing driver with a passion for the famed 24-hour race in nearby Le Mans that his brother runs, had been in pole position for the presidency since November. But opinion polls since the scandal exploded suggest he can no longer count on being the frontrunner. nP6N1E3000]A devout Catholic with five children from his marriage in 1980 to British-born Penelope, Fillon presented solid family values that won him powerful support from France's affluent bourgeoisie - a class much in evidence in Sarthe.""I have known them for 35 years,"" said Louise, a smartly-dressed Sable-sur-Sarthe woman in her 60s. ""I don't know all the details but he wouldn't cheat and he wouldn't lie.""As a parliamentary deputy, Fillon had stepped in and won a reduction in the period of military service her son had to serve, allowing him to go to the United States for his studies, she said. ""It was a gesture that helped my son."" Jean-Claude Ragaru, who worked as an aide to Fillon for 20 years in the local municipality, defended the couple's conduct. Whenever professionally he had to reach Fillon it was nearly always Penelope who took the call, he said.""I don't know how many hours she worked for him. But it is certain she worked for her husband,"" he said, describing them as an ""irreproachable couple"". But the scandal, he added, was certain to cost Fillon ""several thousand votes"".  But Gerard Fretelliere, who as a left-wing local councillor actively opposed Fillon for 12 years, said Fillon's mistake had been not to explain the situation clearly from the start.""When Fillon launched his campaign, he said: 'I am someone who is honest, I am clean, I am pure. Then suddenly there is a doubt about his honesty and it's shocking, shocking.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The bank is the latest to have given up primary dealer roles in Europe, a trend that threatens to increase liquidity constraints and could eventually make it more expensive for some countries to borrow.The bank reviewed its government bond business to take account of the impact of new regulations on banks' balance sheets and profitability, a spokeswoman for the bank said in an emailed statement to Reuters. "" Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB remains committed to the Government Bonds business. This activity remains a core business of the bank and is part of its fixed income franchise,"" she said. Of the other investment banks to have taken similar decisions, the most notable was  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which in 2015 pulled out of making markets for most European countries.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) withdrew from the UK later the same year, ING quit Ireland, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) left Italy, and Belgium did not re-appoint  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) as a primary dealer and dropped Nordea as a recognized dealer.COST/BENEFIT CALCULATION""It is another mid-sized player leaving this sector,"" said a rival banker who manages government bond transactions. ""Shrinking balance sheets are forcing many banks to re-examine whether or not they can stay in this space. The competition is diminishing."" Primary dealers are charged with buying government bonds directly from a country's debt management office and selling them on to investors in the market. They are typically also entrusted with maintaining secondary trading activity, which entails holding a portion of the government bonds on their balance sheets for a period. With regulators keen for banks to reduce the size of their balance sheets, many are having to reconsider whether this activity is worth the cost. Government debt officials have taken note and some have had to adapt to address the issue. Belgium's head of debt, Anne Leclercq, said in November that the country was selling more to hedge funds in bond syndications to allow them to fill the role of providing secondary trading activity.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

COMCO began its investigation in December 2012, after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc became the first bank to settle allegations it had attempted to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), paying a $450 million fine to U.S. and UK authorities.The COMCO penalties announced on Wednesday, the largest of which was a 33.9 million franc fine for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), are relatively small compared to other sanctions doled out in rate-rigging cases. But they are a further sign of the collusion which took place in the setting of interest rate derivatives, used by banks and companies to manage the risk of interest rates fluctuations. COMCO said several banks had participated in cartels over Swiss franc LIBOR, the bid-ask spread on Swiss franc interest rate derivatives, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and EURIBOR. The JPMorgan fine came after COMCO concluded it operated a bilateral cartel with Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) with the aim of influencing the Swiss franc LIBOR benchmark between March 2008 and July 2009, COMCO said in a statement. RBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to the COMCO. Barclays was fined 29.8 million francs for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives, COMCO said. Proceeding are ongoing against  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), HSBC, JPMorgan and Rabobank over the euro interest rate cartel, COMCO said.

311,"Dec 20, 2016 07:50AM ET",Exclusive: Top French banks sue ECB to reduce capital demands,nan,"By Francesco Canepa and Maya NikolaevaFRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - France's top lenders are suing the European Central Bank to get an exemption from holding capital against deposits parked with a state-owned fund, the most high-profile challenge to supervision from Frankfurt to date.As well as providing euro zone banks with funding, the ECB has been their main regulator for the past two years, tasked with ending cozy relationships between the industry and national authorities that contributed to the financial crisis. The Frankfurt-based institution has been sued repeatedly over its bond-buying programs and by smaller banks seeking to escape its supervision.But this is the first case brought by major banks in the euro zone and is a rare confrontation between France's financial elite and the ECB's supervisory board, led by the former head of France's own banking regulator, Daniele Nouy.The lawsuits have been brought by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Credit Mutuel, Groupe BPCE and La Banque Postale over the past few weeks, filings with the European Court of Justice show.Sources with direct knowledge of the cases told Reuters the banks are protesting the ECB's demand that they set aside capital against special deposits they have with state investment institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC). The legal action comes amid heightened tension between banks and the ECB, which is inundating the financial sector with excess cash to try to stimulate growth while charging banks for depositing it with the central bank overnight. ""You are seeing banks more and more go to court to challenge the supervisor,"" a senior legal source said. ""Years ago that was unthinkable.""The ECB and the banks declined to comment.400 BILLIONTax-free savings accounts in France, such as the Livret A, are widely used by smaller retail savers and they were worth some 400 billion euros ($417 billion) at the end of last year.Slightly more than half that money was then placed by the banks with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignation, which uses the funds to invest in public housing and other projects.Banks argue that this exposure to the CDC should not count towards the calculation of their leverage ratio, which is a measure of a lender's capital as a proportion of total assets.They cite a European Commission act saying regulators may grant an exemption for, ""deposits that the institution is legally obliged to transfer to (a) public sector entity ... for the purposes of funding general interest investments"".Under EU rules due to come into full force in 2018, banks must hold capital worth at least 3 percent of their total assets. By stripping out the deposits with the CDC, banks would get a higher leverage ratio for a given amount of capital.For example, La Banque Postale said its capital was worth 5 percent of assets at the end of June but if its deposits with the CDC were included in the calculation, its leverage ratio would fall to 3.4 percent.A source close to the ECJ said a decision on the suits may take about two years, meaning it was unlikely to come before the leverage ratio rule is phased in.La Banque Postale and BPCE, which long had a monopoly on French regulated savings accounts, would be worst hit.""It's obviously important for Banque Postale,"" Olivia Perney Guillot, who rates the bank for Fitch said. ""The ratings already take into account the potential lifting of the national exemption.""BPCE and Credit Agricole SA knocked 30 and 15 basis points respectively off their leverage ratios earlier this year to take account of their deposits with the CDC.Their complaints should be familiar to Daniele Nouy, who worked at the French central bank before becoming the head of France's prudential authority in 2010.In 2013, before moving to the ECB, she warned that French banks would be ""strongly impacted"" by new liquidity rules due to their exposure to regulated savings accounts, among other reasons.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

314,"Dec 07, 2016 08:24AM ET","EU fines Agricole, JPMorgan and HSBC $520 million over Euribor",nan,"By Philip BlenkinsopBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has fined  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), HSBC (L:HSBA) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) a total of 485 million euros ($520 million) for their alleged participation in a cartel to manipulate the price of the Euribor financial benchmark.The Commission said on Wednesday they were part of a seven-bank cartel that colluded between September 2005 and May 2008 to distort the Euribor interest rate which was set using quotes submitted by a panel of banks and is widely used in international money markets.JPMorgan Chase was fined 337.2 million euros and Credit Agricole 114.7 million euros for five-month involvements in the cartel. HSBC was set to pay 33.6 million euros for participating in the cartel for just one month.All three insisted they had not engaged in any wrongdoing.""We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts,"" JPMorgan said.HSBC said it would consider its legal options. Credit Agricole said it would appeal against the Commission's decision, adding the fine would have no impact on its 2016 results given it had already taken provisions. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), RBS (L:RBS) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) admitted guilt in December 2013 and were fined 824.6 million euros, the sixth largest collective cartel fine ever handed down by the European Commission.  Barclays  (L:BARC) avoided a penalty because it alerted the Commission.The Commission found a series of chatroom messages between the traders at the banks congratulating each other on their actions.""On days when traders received money calculated on the basis of Euribor, (they) had an interest in a high Euribor rate. On days when a trader needed to pay ... he would want to have a low Euribor rate,"" EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.""The participation in such schemes was very lucrative for the banks ... tiny, tiny movements in the Euribor rate can have a huge impact because of the volumes of trading,"" she added.The Bank for International Settlements put the market value of over-the-counter interest (OTC) rate derivative contracts in euros at $6.4 trillion in the first half of 2016, 31 percent of all OTC derivatives. Such trades would typically be based on financial benchmark rates such as Euribor.U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down large fines to more than 10 banks and brokerages for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor), used for various currencies including the yen, and its euro cousin Euribor. Prosecutors have also charged more than a dozen men with fraud-related offences.The Commission is still looking into foreign exchange trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Italian banks buoyed by bailout hopesShares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) (MI:BMPS), the oldest and most troubled of the Italian banks, soared more than 7% on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Rome could take a €2 billion ($2.15 billion) stake in the lender that would increase the government’s stake to 40%.Italy’s La Stampa also reported that Rome was considering taking a €15 billion ($16.1 billion) loan from European authorities to shore up its financial sector, though the Italian Treasury later denied the report.Italian banks led the advancers on the FTSE MIB, with the top three gaining more than 5%.2. Global stocks breathe sigh of relief over Italian bank bailout reportEuropean stocks traded sharply higher on Wednesday on relief over the reports that Italian banks would receive state aid, while investors also looked ahead to the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy decision. Markets widely expect the ECB to extend its asset purchase program by around six months in its attempt to support the economy and drive inflation higher.U.S. futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wednesday as market participants eyed the euphoria in Europe and waited for the publication of the job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) for October at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT) and consumer credit for the same month at 3:00PM ET (20:00GMT).At 5:58AM ET (10:58GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures gained 23 points, or 0.12%, S&P 500 futures inched up 1 point, or 0.03%, and the Nasdaq 100 futures edged forward 2 points, or 0.04%.Earlier, Asian stocks closed mostly higher on Wednesday with the Nikkei bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that Japan's  Softbank Corp.  (T:9984) would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and aim to create 50,000 jobs in the next four years.3.  Pfizer  hit with record $106 million fineThe U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) fined Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) with a record £84.2 million ($106.3 million) fine for its part in driving up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600%.“Extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS (National Health Service) and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds,” the CMA said in its decision.Pfizer used to market Epanutin itself but sold distribution rights to privately-held Flynn in September 2012.The blue chip drugs giant rejected any wrongdoing and said it would appeal all aspects of the decision.4. Oil holds steady ahead of inventories, producer meetingOPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are scheduled to meet this Saturday in Vienna to agree details of the output cut, designed to reduce the global supply glut.Nerves over whether the agreement will be effective held back larger gains after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported late Tuesday a draw of 2.2 million barrels on crude stocks.The Energy Information Administration will report official inventory data at 10:30AM ET (15:30GMT) amid expectations for a fall of 1.032 million barrels.U.S. crude oil futures inched up 0.10% to $50.98 at 5:59AM ET (10:59GMT), while Brent oil edged forward 0.06% to $53.96.5.

Other major currency pairs traded in a tight range after a rollercoaster ride following Sunday’s Italian constitutional referendum 'No' vote, which saw the euro dip to a 21-month low before rebounding more than 1.5 percent.

""I have a really hard time staying bullish on the dollar even though we have Italian government uncertainty on top of it all,"" Indosuez's Geneva-based head of FX and precious metals trading, Davis Hall, said.""The range is probably still $1.0850 to $1.0250."" One-week implied volatility  has retreated from highs of almost 18 percent reached before Italy's vote, but at 13 percent is still almost double recent months' normal levels. ECB chief Mario Draghi is expected to lay out his plans for quantitative easing after next March at a news conference on Thursday.At least a six-month extension of the program is now expected but many bank and fund analysts speculate that the bank might announce some sort of reduction or tapering of the monthly bond-buying amounts as part of that move.Any such change in the direction of the ECB's policymaking would broadly be seen as a euro positive after almost two years of money-printing.London's City Index Direct chief analyst, Kathleen Brooks, said the euro remained in a strong position within the G10 FX space, even after the Italian vote.""As Italy’s banking sector can scrape together some foreign investment, mixed with a sweetened nationalized deal for Monte dei Paschi, then we can’t see how Italy’s political woes can have anything other than a temporary impact,"" Brooks said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The dollar has ground its way higher this week after jumping in the days following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last Tuesday, fuelled by expectations a Trump White House would drive up inflation. But with two months until his inauguration and a rise in Fed interest rates now fully priced in for next month, several banks say the currency could drift. Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London, said that Fed speakers this week had sounded divided on their view on the effective tightening of monetary conditions since Trump's election.""All eyes are on Yellen today,"" he said. ""She may not share markets' enthusiasm about the future impact of Trump's policies. And she could express concern about the dollar's rapid gains and the tightening of conditions through higher bond yields. That could spur some profit-taking on the bullish dollar positions.""

321,"Nov 10, 2016 10:50AM ET",EU banks not ready for tough new rule on loan provisions: watchdog,nan,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Banks in the European Union are not fully prepared for a sweeping change in accounting rules from 2018 which will force them to increase by nearly a third the amount of money they set aside for bad loans, Europe's banking watchdog said.The new rules require banks to put aside some money for loan defaults upfront when a loan is first approved. The aim of this is to strengthen banks and prevent the taxpayer bailouts that took place during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.It will force banks to begin building defenses even before a loan turns sour. Under current book-keeping rules, banks do not account for bad loans until they have effectively defaulted. But the new accounting system, known as IFRS9, will also impact the banks' capital reserves.The European Banking Authority (EBA) said on Thursday: ""On the qualitative side, the report highlights that as of December 2015, when the exercise was launched, banks were, overall, still at an early stage of preparation for the implementation of IFRS 9, although larger banks seemed more advanced,"" the EBA said.Many banks plan so-called parallel runs, where they apply the old and new accounting rules at the same time, but this testing may, in some cases, be more limited than originally envisaged, the EBA said.""It should also be noted that at the time the exercise was carried-out, banks still needed to make some key accounting policy decisions.""Banks are under pressure to push ahead with preparations as the new rule, which is mandatory, involves changes to IT and accounting systems.The EBA said its study of 50 lenders showed provisions rose an average 18 percent under the new rule and up to 30 percent for 86 percent of the banks that responded to the EBA's survey.The watchdog said a bank's core capital buffer would decrease by an average of 59 basis points, and up to 75 basis points for nearly 80 percent of respondents.""In limited cases the impact of IFRS 9 could be higher.""This week, French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said switching to IFRS9 would affect its core equity capital ratio by 20 basis points.The watchdog is now launching a second assessment of the impact of the new rule.The Basel Committee of global banking regulators has proposed giving banks time to adjust to the capital hit after the new accounting rule comes into force in 2018.The European Commission has proposed in an unpublished paper seen by Reuters a phase-in period lasting up to December 2023 ""to mitigate the financial impact on institutions"".The EBA said on Thursday it would consider issuing guidance on any transitional arrangements.The International Accounting Standards Board writes accounting rules which are applied in the EU and elsewhere in the world, apart from the United States.The United States also reformed its accounting rule for provisioning, but went much further, forcing banks to provision in full from the day the loan is granted."
322,"Nov 09, 2016 12:40PM ET","Fed worries aside, Trump presidency may bode well for dollar",nan,"By Patrick GrahamLONDON (Reuters) - It took just over eight hours on Wednesday for currency markets to abandon the prevailing logic of the past month - that a Donald Trump presidency would be bad for the dollar against its major peers.As forecast by dozens of bank and fund strategists, the greenback sank against the yen on the first signs, deep in the U.S. night, of a victory that they worry carries huge risks for global growth, security and trade.Trading volumes against the euro reached 10 times the average for what is normally a high point of trading in Japan and Hong Kong, and Tokyo felt the need to caution speculators with the promise of an emergency meeting of officials to consider intervention.But by the time daylight returned in New York, investors had pushed the dollar back to a loss of just half a percent on the day against the Japanese currency, and it was up against the euro and the franc.A number of major banks including HSBC issued notes in London highlighting the immediate risks to the currency, yet none went as far as altering their longer-term forecasts.French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) recommended buying the U.S. currency at 103 yen with a target of 110. Some bigger financial houses including Citi said they should have more to say over the next 24 hours.The reticence spoke to far greater doubt over whether Trump's promised anti-establishment policy mix will do anything other than support the greenback, broadly by drawing capital back into the United States and administering economic pain elsewhere.""Medium to long-term implications are extremely difficult to assess because there is plenty of uncertainty about the extent to which Donald's Trump program and pre-election announcements can be implemented,"" analysts from Unicredit (MI:CRDI) said in a note.""(But) we are currently looking closely at developments and will likely put a number of our forecasts under revision.""FED PREMIUM EVAPORATESPredictions the dollar would fall were based largely on the premise that the shock to global markets of a Trump victory would worry Federal Reserve policymakers next month enough to stay their hand on a long promised rise in interest rates.As stock markets recovered, those thoughts were quickly evaporating, the priced likelihood of a move next month back above 70 percent - a level at which the Fed has been comfortable delivering in the past.""The Fed rate hike is back on, even with Trump in the White House,"" said Kathleen Brooks, head of research with brokers City Index in London.""Perhaps Trump's conciliatory tone in his victory speech has eased concerns, or perhaps markets have no idea how to price in his victory as we have no precedent. Either way, a mere 24 hours ago no one would have predicted such a calm market reaction.""George Saravelos,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s main strategist in London, saw no reason to back off forecasts that have consistently been among the most bullish on the dollar of the big global banks who have dominated currency trading in the past decade.Like a number of others, he points to the potential for repatriation of corporate funds under a new tax holiday and Trump's promises of a boost to U.S. public spending.""On the one hand you've got the positive fiscal story and then the corporate tax reform that might involve substantial repatriation,"" he said. ""(That is) a pretty consistent message that is dollar positive.""UNTAXED OFFSHORE WEALTHBoth the Republican Trump and his Democratic foe Hillary Clinton had pledged before the election to take steps that would spur major U.S. companies to bring home more of the estimated $2.1 trillion in as-yet-untaxed income they hold offshore.The Republican party's retention of majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives elections only makes more likely a repeat of George W. Bush's Homeland Investment Act, which brought in roughly $300 billion in funds a decade ago and drove the dollar higher.There is still an argument over how much impact it would have on the currency now, particularly given that the accounts of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others suggest much of that cash is already held in dollars. But it has continuously popped up in currency market chatter since the summer.""The fact that U.S. corporations hold larger cash piles offshore than ever is a reason why a new repatriation tax holiday could be a bigger boost for the dollar than in 2005,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report in July.""Though we stress the headline number for offshore earnings overstates the unhedged foreign currency amount, which is relevant for FX markets.""Against the yen, however, Deutsche's Saravelos offered a note of caution. If Trump is to impose trade barriers on China and others, he said, then capital currently lodged in those markets may seek the traditional security of Japan.""We just have the yen doing better than everything else on the back of the disruption this is going to cause to Asia. We have the yen at 94 per dollar by the end of the year."""

326,"Oct 21, 2016 02:00PM ET",Banks warn share tax hike threatens Paris' post-Brexit appeal,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - A proposed increase in France's share tax flies in the face of efforts by the government and the financial industry to lure banking jobs from London, financial sector lobbies have warned.In a first reading of next year's budget bill, lawmakers in the lower house of parliament backed an increase in the tax to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent as well as its extension to cover intra-day trading.""This is also a bad signal that we are sending in the context of Brexit as for the attractiveness of the Paris financial center,"" Philippe Brassac, head of the French banking federation and chief executive of France's third-biggest listed lender  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), told Reuters.Although the Socialist-led government had not included the increase in the original bill, it backed lawmakers' amendments to introduce the increase. There is no guarantee that the amendment will enter into law as it must also be backed in the conservative dominated Senate and in a final reading before the lower house.Budget Minister Christian Eckert estimated during the debate that the tax would raise additional tax revenue of 500 million euros ($545 million), but acknowledged that it was unknown how investors might react.The proposals would increase French companies' financing costs, Brassac added.In response the Finance Ministry told Reuters in a statement: ""Tax issues are not a determining factor in companies' decisions about where they set up business, at least not situations when they relocate due to events like Brexit.""The French government aims to attract businesses leaving London following Britain's decision to exit the European Union with plans to fast-track the registering of firms and extending tax benefits expatriates can qualify for.However, France's comparatively high taxes remains an obstacle as does the Socialist government's support for a long-stalled financial transaction tax in 10 EU countries - which would replace France's existing share tax.French financial lobby Paris Europlace hopes there is still a chance to reconsider the decision to hike the share tax.""This is a bad message and it is the opportunity for Paris Europlace to point out the strategic issues,"" Arnaud de Bresson, chief executive, told Reuters.First proposed by the conservative government of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, the share tax was modeled on Britain's stamp duty, which puts a 0.5 percent levy on stock purchases.It applies to share purchases on companies with a capitalization of more than 1 billion euros.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

327,"Oct 21, 2016 04:18AM ET",Dollar heads for third weekly gain as U.S. rate rise bets firm,nan,"By Patrick GrahamLONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was on course for its third consecutive week of gains against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength on Friday, driven by hardening expectations of a rise in interest rates in December. In a year where investors have never really got close to fully pricing in a move, short-term U.S. rates now put a 75 percent probability on the Federal Reserve raising official borrowing costs for only the second time in more than a decade. After a blip in the first half of this week, comments by New York Fed President William Dudley and Donald Trump's failure to register a big win in Wednesday's presidential debate has hardened that view, fueling another surge for the greenback. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's quashing of speculation it was already considering how to wind down bond purchases when the time comes also cooled any signs of recovery for the euro. ""The dollar rally appears to be back on after it struggled at the start of this week,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index in London. By 0700 GMT, the dollar index (DXY) was up 0.1 percent on the day. The euro weakened 0.2 percent, having briefly traded below $1.09 for the first time since March.Some analysts said that investors were again shifting towards ""carry"" trades that use the expanding difference between interest rates on the dollar and those in other currencies to rack up profit. ""The euro was left bruised and battered after the October ECB meeting,"" analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a note to clients. ""We suspect that the euro has also been dragged lower by its appeal as a funding currency at a time when the G10 FX carry trade is staging a return. This is consistent with the single currency having broken to new lows against G10 high-yielding and commodity currencies recently.""Another reason for seeking the security of U.S. assets is the steady depreciation of China's yuan , which dropped to its lowest level in six years against the broadly stronger greenback.Beijing spent almost a trillion of its dollar reserves fighting a fall in the currency to similar levels earlier this year but has moved to targeting a broader basket of currencies, meaning dollar gains globally naturally shift the exchange rate.But with most trade with China still done in dollars that may not ease fears of another deflationary impulse for Western economies as a result. Sterling, whose 20 percent fall has been the biggest story of the past three months among the majors, was also back on the defensive in the face of the dollar's strength. The language from European officials towards Britain at Prime Minister Theresa May's first summit since June's vote for a Brexit from the EU did not augur well for the pound. French President Francois Hollande said if May wanted a ""hard"" Brexit, then negotiations would be very tough.The pound, generally more stable this week, inched down 0.1 percent to $1.2241.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

331,"Oct 05, 2016 04:30AM ET",Sterling falls below $1.27 for first time since 1985,nan,"By Patrick GrahamLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound dipped below $1.27 for the first time since June 1985 on Wednesday, with fears of a 'hard' Brexit also pushing the currency to a five-year trough against a broadly stronger euro.Sterling has been buffeted for a fortnight by worries that Britain will prioritize curbing immigration over promoting trade in its divorce from the bloc, thereby gumming up labor markets, curbing foreign investment and leading to cutbacks by banks and other global companies.That has been the broad takeaway for markets from this week's conference of the ruling Conservative Party, and the pound has fallen past long-term lows set in early July in response, although there were signs of stability in morning trade in London.Sterling hit a 31-year low of $1.2686  after opening before recovering to $1.2720, roughly flat on the day. It fell as much as 0.4 percent to 88.31 pence per euro (EURGBP=D4) before also clawing back some ground against the common currency.""Sterling has finally and belatedly responded to the heightened and prolonged Brexit uncertainty, notwithstanding a resilient UK economy and prospects of significant UK fiscal stimulus,"" said Greg Gibbs, director of independent research house Amplifying Global FX Capital. ""The outlook remains negative, but it is risky to jump on the selling bandwagon.""Better than expected readings of sentiment among construction and manufacturing purchasing managers this week have done little to turn the mood brighter. Services numbers are due at 0830 GMT.Britain's financial industry could lose up to 38 billion pounds ($48.3 billion) in revenue in a 'hard' Brexit that would leave it with restricted access to the European Union's single market, according to a report on Tuesday commissioned by consultancy firm Oliver Wyman. ""UK PMI data is unlikely to be a game changer,"" analysts from French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a morning note.""Any better than expected reading may trigger some position squaring related upside in the pound. However, with rate expectations linked to long-term uncertainty and as fears of a hard Brexit remain intact, it seems unlikely that sentiment is changing for the better.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

332,"Sep 26, 2016 11:30AM ET",'Re-Polonisation' puts banks under government scrutiny,nan,"By Marcin GoclowskiWARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government has set out to buy bank stakes back from foreign investors, a move some bankers and economists say will hamper lenders that prospered through the global financial crisis. Last Wednesday, state-run  Alior Bank  (WA:ALRR) and PKO BP (WA:PKO) confirmed they are in talks to buy Raiffeisen's banking and leasing arms respectively.The government has already bought back GE Money's (N:GE) Polish arm this year and plans to buy the second-largest lender Pekao (WA:PEO) from UniCredit (MI:CRDI).The state owns two other banks outright, controls majority stakes in a further two and has a 30-percent-plus stake in the biggest bank, PKO: http://tmsnrt.rs/2df8gYJPoles played a leading role in the 1980s in ending communist rule in eastern Europe. Some now fear banks owned partly by the government would boost lending to projects such as coal mines or large infrastructure projects that might create jobs but not profits in an economy long viewed as a showcase for democracy.""I'm not a supporter of turning re-Polonisation into nationalisation,"" said Cezary Stypulkowski, the chief executive of Poland's No.4 lender mBank (WA:MBK), advocating ""domestication"" of management instead to ensure credit reaches local companies.""It is very easy to manage the banking sector by political structures. In such cases, a tendency to circumvent the rules typically ends in disaster.""PiS chairman and former Polish prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński told supporters in 2012: ""It must be made clear ... that our goal is a re-Polonisation of Polish banks.""PiS, which came to power last year, pledged to introduce new taxes for banks and supermarkets, cut the retirement age and boost state payments for children. It also wanted to help homeowners who borrowed in foreign currency when exchange rates were favorable by converting the debts into Polish zlotys at the original rate, a promise the state has yet to fully meet.POLITICAL WILLBut its plans for banks could prove most controversial. ""There's a political will to conduct re-Polonisation,"" said one senior official. ""It was decided, politically, that there's too much foreign capital in the banking sector.""If the government succeeds in its strategy, the state and other Polish investors, including one of its richest men, Leszek Czarnecki, will control banks with 54 percent of Poland's banking assets, including mortgages and loans.That will displace foreign investors who now control the majority of such assets.Officials familiar with government thinking told Reuters that it is motivated, in part, by a desire to prevent banks from choking off credit to the economy to preserve large shareholder dividends.""The issue is to make sure no one turns off the tap when a crisis occurs, like in 2009,"" one of those people said.Some managers have publicly supported such a stance.""We prefer to credit the economy than pay out a dividend,"" Zbigniew Jagiello, chief executive of top bank PKO BP (WA:PKO), recently told Poland's PAP state news agency, adding that he hoped to do both. PKO is a state-controlled entity.The government in Warsaw has also played down any risk of political interference. ""After possible re-Polonisation, the government's impact on banks will be rather small,"" said Rafal Bochenek, a spokesman for the government.But others are skeptical. ""I haven't seen any research confirming that international banking groups overestimate the risk in crisis times,"" said Jakub Borowski, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in Warsaw.""We are dealing with an expression of faith that has not been confirmed by empirical studies yet.""Krzysztof Pietraszkiewicz, head of Polish banking lobby group ZBP, said that while he supports some increase in state ownership in the sector, he hoped it would not lead to lending for loss-making projects or generous loan restructuring.""One should ... avoid the situation where public opinion forces politicians to act in a way that poses a threat for the financial sector,"" he said.The Polish government is examining its next steps. It could, via state-owned Alior Bank, buy Raiffeisen's Polish unit, as well as Pekao, via state-run insurer PZU, from UniCredit. Raiffeinsen is worth around 1 billion euros. The value of UniCredit's 40 percent stake in Pekao is worth roughly $3.5 billion.But Credit Agricole's Borowski questions ""what is more beneficial for long-term economic growth and welfare. Can we spend these billions of zlotys more productively than parking them in banks?""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

333,"Sep 23, 2016 07:23AM ET","Dollar on track for weekly losses in wake of Fed, BOJ moves",nan,"By Anirban NagLONDON (Reuters) - The dollar index was a tad lower on Friday, and on track for its worst week for a month after the Federal Reserve trimmed its long-term rate expectations and the Bank of Japan retooled its monetary policy framework.In Europe, data showed eurozone business activity expanding in September at its weakest pace since the start of 2015. But it was little surprise and had limited impact on policy expectations and the single currency.The dollar index was subdued at 95.397 (DXY), while the euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.1215 . The U.S. currency was flat at 100.70 yen , not far from a nearly four-week low of 100.10 struck on Thursday and on course to shed more than 1 percent for the week.""The Fed lowering its medium-term rate guidance path while keeping a rate hike in play at the end of this year has left the dollar very finely balanced,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.The Federal Reserve projected a less aggressive rise in rates next year and in 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent. Traders said the focus was moving to the first televised U.S. presidential debate early next week. Markets are mostly expecting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the presidency and have not factored in the implications of a victory for Donald Trump.""Indeed, we believe that the markets are rather complacent about the outcome of the elections and expect growing uncertainty ahead of the 8 November vote to add to the dollar headwinds,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) analysts said in a note.YEN FIRMERThe yen was on track to finish higher on the week against the dollar and the euro. This was after the BOJ shifted to targeting interest rates on Japanese government bonds as the focus of its massive monetary easing program, dropping its explicit target of increasing base money.The BOJ's announcement initially sent the dollar up more than 1 percent to 102.79 yen, though the gains unraveled as investors realized that the central bank would still have an uphill task to push inflation towards its 2 percent target.The dollar's proximity to the 100-yen level did not escape the attention of Japanese authorities, who do not want the yen to rise sharply.""We're concerned about recent extremely nervous moves in the currency market,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

335,"Sep 19, 2016 01:10PM ET",BOJ may rattle global bond markets as Fed seen on hold,nan,"By Richard LeongNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan may steal the thunder from the U.S. Federal Reserve and its chair Janet Yellen this week if it chooses to give more monetary stimulus in its latest effort to jumpstart its economy and the U.S. central bank decides to stand pat on interest rates.If the BOJ, led by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, decides to shake up its policy stance, one avenue would be to be less aggressive in purchasing longer-dated assets, thereby allowing yields to go up, while cutting short-term rates deeper into negative territory.This would likely result in a rise in yields of U.S. Treasuries and other government bonds, and on the margin push up long-term borrowing costs for consumers and corporations.Japanese investors have poured money into foreign bonds in a scramble for income-generating assets as domestic bond yields have turned negative. This is contributing to holding global yields near historically low levels.""The BOJ is important in part because the Japanese have been buying anything abroad that gives them yields,"" said David Keeble, global head of interest rates strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Corporate & Investment Bank in New York.Last week, the yield on 10-year Japanese government debt rose close to zero percent, a level not seen since March, in a global bond market sell-off triggered by the European Central Bank's decision to refrain from expanding its asset purchase program on Sept. 8. The ECB's move intensified worries that major central banks are running out of tools to aid their economies.    ""Japan has struck a chord in terms of the generalised perception that there isn't that much left in that tank for policymakers from a monetary standpoint. Therefore if you still need to provide stimulus, perhaps monetary policy isn't the way it is going to be forthcoming,"" Charlie Diebel, head of rates at London-based asset manager  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.The U.S. economy is far from robust, posting a sub-par 1.2 percent increase in second quarter gross domestic product. However, Japan, the world's third biggest economy, is struggling even more, eking out just 0.7 percent growth in the same period. The BOJ will undertake a comprehensive review of its current monetary policy at the its Sept. 20-21 meeting, amid speculation it may lower short-term interest rates deeper into negative territory and change its bond purchasing program.Fed Chair Yellen and other U.S. policy-makers, who will convene during the same period as their Japanese counterparts, are widely expected to leave their benchmark policy rate unchanged in a range of 0.25-0.50 percent. They will likely keep the door open for a rate increase by year-end.To be sure, if the Fed stuns investors by raising rates within hours of their Japanese counterparts' decision, that would overshadow anything coming from Tokyo.The consensus is the Fed will keep its powder dry given the recent patch of soft economic data. Also, it may be reluctant to raise rates, and possibly upset financial markets, ahead of a tightening presidential election on Nov. 8.""I don't think there will be anything revolutionary enough to move markets,"" Paresh Upadhyaya, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said of the upcoming Fed meeting.UNCONVENTIONAL OR INEFFECTUAL?Japan's struggle has persisted even as the BOJ adopted unconventional measures of negative interest rates and massive asset purchases aimed at spurring consumption and investments, while also helping exports with a weaker yen.Instead the yen has risen 15 percent against the dollar <JPY=> and 13 percent versus the euro (EURJPY=) so far this year.""They may be caught in a vicious feedback loop with the yen,"" said John DeClue, chief investment officer at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis.In recent days, there have been reports that stoked speculation the BOJ might consider lowering its current -0.10 percent target rate  and scaling back its purchases on longer-dated bonds.Interest rate markets implied traders expect a 17 percent chance the BOJ would lower its target rate to -0.30 percent on Wednesday and a 14 percent chance the Fed would raise the federal funds rate by a quarter point, according to Reuters data.

Risk appetite was kept in check as Brent oil prices fell as low as $43.46 per barrel. They struggled back to $44 as this week's news of a jump in U.S. government stockpiles and record output from Saudi Arabia was offset slightly by the International Energy Agency predicting crude markets would rebalance in the next few months after years of overproduction.Singapore, Asia's bellwether for trade, had also weighed on sentiment as it cut its economic forecast for the year.

Traders said that was too slow relative to expectations with some going into Thursday's meeting expecting a 50 basis point cut.As a result, the New Zealand dollar rose to $0.7351, its highest level since May 2015, before settling back a tad to $0.7275 , up 1.2 percent on the day.The RBNZ cut interest rates a quarter point to a record low of 2.0 percent on Thursday and flagged the need for more as it struggles to head off deflation risks.""The RBNZ has made it clear for a long time that it wants to see the kiwi to depreciate, sometimes less and sometimes more explicitly,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

Chances of a rate hike were below 20 percent less than a month ago.The dollar also was boosted by expectations of upcoming central bank easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of New Zealand.The Australian dollar fell 1.5 percent to an 11-day low of $0.7476, while the New Zealand dollar hit a three-week trough, falling 1.35 percent to 0.7018, as investors ramped up bets that both central banks could ease monetary policy as early as next month.""There are a lot of individual stories,"" Serebriakov said. ""It’s been kind of a combination of idiosyncratic drivers for currencies as well as the broader dollar story.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

352,"Jul 03, 2016 11:10AM ET",Abu Dhabi merger to create $175 billion banking heavyweight,nan,"By David FrenchDUBAI (Reuters) - National Bank of Abu Dhabi (AD:NBAD) and First Gulf Bank (AD:FGB) won board approval on Sunday for a merger to create a banking heavyweight with $175 billion in assets, part of the emirate's plan to revamp its economy hit by lower oil prices.The newly-branded National Bank of Abu Dhabi will become one of the Middle East and Africa's biggest banks when the tie-up is completed in the first quarter of 2017, rivaling Qatar National Bank (QA:QNBK), which has just purchased Turkey's Finansbank.The tie-up comes as the Gulf's oil-rich countries take new steps to diversify their economies after two years of lower oil prices have weighed heavily on state revenues.By creating a national banking champion, Abu Dhabi hopes to better service its own changing economy and those of the region, as well as take on global banking rivals at home and abroad.With a combined market value of $29.1 billion as of June 30, the new bank will overtake the likes of Britain's  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""The proposed merger will create a bank with the financial strength, expertise, and global network to support the UAE’s economic ambitions at home and drive the country’s growing international business relationships,"" the banks said in a joint statement.The deal is one of two significant consolidation efforts currently underway in Abu Dhabi. Last week, the government ordered the merger of state investment funds Mubadala and International Petroleum Investment Company.Abu Dhabi's efforts to reform the economy are considered slow compared with neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has adopted a much more radical approach to restructure the economy through a national transformation plan.Even then, bank mergers are uncommon in the Middle East due to cumbersome regulation and an unwillingness by major shareholders to cede control, indicating significant government support for the deal between NBAD and FGB.State investment funds Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Mubadala will hold 33.2 percent and 3.7 percent respectively of the new entity, which will have assets worth 642 billion dirhams and a return on equity of 14.1 percent based on first-quarter figures. DREAM MERGER?News of the approved tie-up sent shares in NBAD 4 percent higher to 10.05 dirhams on Sunday, while FGB's stock rose 2 percent to 12.85 dirhams. Both have risen sharply since merger talks were confirmed on June 19, with NBAD some 25 percent higher.Arqaam Capital called the deal a ""dream merger"", estimating earnings per share over a three-year timeframe to gain 11.1 percent and 15.9 percent for NBAD and FGB respectively. ""Synergies should be very substantial, making the deal very attractive for shareholders of NBAD and FGB,"" it said in a note.The brokerage also said it expected further merger activity in the sector, including a deal between Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Union National Bank. Their share prices were 3.8 percent and 5.9 percent higher respectively on Sunday.Still, David Tusa, managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal, said despite a compelling rationale for the NBAD/FGB merger, there could be significant practical challenges to overcome.The merger will be completed via a share swap agreement which would result in FGB shareholders receiving 1.254 new NBAD shares for every one FGB share they currently hold. The ratio would give them 52 percent of the combined bank.Abdulhamid M. Saeed, a board member and managing director at FGB, has been named chief executive designate for the combined lender, with NBAD Chief Financial Officer James Burdett to assume the same role.A new board and management will take over once the merger has been completed, while the existing CEOs - Alex Thursby of NBAD and Andre Sayegh of FGB - will continue to run the independent banks until then. There was no reference to their future roles in the combined bank in the statement. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS are acting as financial advisers to NBAD and FGB respectively.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Credit Suisse declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours.In 2013, Singapore's central bank censured a record 20 banks, saying 133 traders had tried to manipulate the rates, including the benchmark bank-to-bank SIBOR rate, the Swap Offered Rate and derivatives. (http://reut.rs/299cRc4)It did not fine the banks involved, but instead directed 19 of them to set aside additional reserves for a year and to adopt measures to address deficiencies.The Monetary Authority of Singapore has since returned all of the around $9 billion it took from the banks as penalties, saying they have taken steps to prevent a recurrence of attempts to rig rates.Authorities in the United States and Europe have also been investigating rate manipulations, most notably Libor, slapping fines of billions of dollars on banks, including Barclays, RBS and UBS.FrontPoint said it engaged in transactions from within the U.S. for SIBOR-based derivatives at ""artificial prices proximately caused by Defendants' unlawful manipulation and restraint of trade.""Sonterra said it engaged in U.S.-based transactions for SIBOR-based derivatives, including Singapore Dollar foreign exchange forwards.""As a consequence of Defendants' manipulative conduct, Sonterra was damaged when it was overcharged and/or underpaid in transactions for Singapore Dollar foreign exchange forwards,"" the filing said.The two investment companies seek compensation for ""treble the damages"" incurred."

Chances of a September hike were placed at 26 percent, while the odds for a November and December rate rise were under 50 percent.""The tone of the statement is absolutely dovish and that was reflected in the fact that the dollar was sold off, not super aggressively, but we did see it move,"" said Joe O'Leary, senior foreign exchange trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.""With what's going on globally, I don't think the Fed will be as aggressive in raising rates as it once was a couple of months ago.""Yellen, in a press briefing after the meeting, said one reason for keeping U.S. rates steady was uncertainty surrounding an upcoming referendum to determine whether Britain would leave the European Union.In afternoon trading, the dollar fell to 105.50 yen , the lowest since mid-October 2014.

But it has since lost about 1 percent, with sceptical investors pricing in only a 20 percent chance of a hike in June, according to CME's FedWatch. The dollar was down half a percent by 0740 GMT at 108.99 yen, having earlier touched 108.825 yen, its lowest for two weeks. That was around 2.5 percent weaker than a one-month high of 111.455 yen set on Monday.In London, BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor said Sato's comments might have lifted the yen a little, but its strength had more to do with doubts over whether Japan would be willing to intervene to weaken the currency. ""It's (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe's worst nightmare,"" said Mellor. ""Despite all the efforts behind Abenomics... It's still an export-oriented economy, much to Abe's chagrin. What he wants is a weaker yen to buoy exports."" Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. manufacturing grew for a third straight month in May, but factories appeared to be taking in fewer deliveries from their suppliers, which could hamper production in the months ahead.""While the U.S. ISM numbers yesterday were pretty good, there's still uncertainty over whether there will be an interest rate hike in June,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. The European Central Bank will at 1145 GMT publish its latest interest rate decision, with no change expected, followed by a press conference with ECB chief Mario Draghi at 1230 GMT.The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1221, its highest in nine days, lifted by market expectations that the ECB will raise growth and inflation forecasts, a rare positive step even as it emphasises persistent negative risks and a readiness to provide more stimulus. ""The immediate response in euro/dollar will depend on the impact of the ECB meeting on market risk sentiment,"" wrote  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) strategists in a research note.

French banks have been thrust to the fore of a controversy over the use of secretive tax havens since an investigative news syndicate exposed the activities of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca.""If we take ... all territories where the Mossack Fonseca worked for us, we have 80 so-called offshore structures, none of which (is) linked to a French resident,"" Philippe Brassac, chief executive officer of Credit Agricole, told the French Senate. Brassac said Credit Agricole no longer planned to deal with offshore structures, even in cases where the bank was sure such dealings were legal.""We want to be present in international private banking only in countries that are engaged in automatic exchange of information,"" he said, referring to nations that routinely share tax information.Deputy Chief Operating Officer of BNP Paribas, Jacques D'Estais, said that since 2013 his bank no longer opened accounts for the offshore structures of French fiscal residents. BNP Paribas has demanded fiscal compliance declarations from all clients who are residents of France, European Union or OECD countries since 2013.Jacques D'Estais also said BNP was closing a branch in the Cayman Islands.

363,"May 20, 2016 03:20PM ET",Banks identify possible replacements for U.S. Libor,nan,"By Richard LeongNEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of global banks and clearing houses, working with U.S. regulators, said on Friday it has identified two possible replacements for Libor, the benchmark interest rate for $160 trillion worth of credit for everything from home mortgages to corporate loans.The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) said that together with the Federal Reserve it has identified the Fed's Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) and the overnight rate on U.S. Treasury securities pledged as collateral in repurchase, or repo, transactions as alternatives.The London Interbank Offered Rate has been in regulators' cross hairs since its credibility was tarnished by a rate-rigging scandal emerging from the 2008 financial crisis. About a dozen global banks collectively have paid tens of billions of dollars in fines to settle the matter.""The case for moving ahead to a new benchmark is very strong. The new benchmark is going be robust with a lot of transactions and will be resistant to manipulation,"" Fed Governor Jerome Powell told Reuters.ARRC said the two rates it identified as replacements represent ""robust"" markets, each with $300 billion worth of daily trades. Bankers and regulators have raised alarms about diminishing daily liquidity in the markets for unsecured loans like Libor, calling into question their reliability as a gauge for U.S. borrowing costs.The stakes are large: Libor's benchmark 3-month rate stands as a reference rate for pricing $160 trillion of loans in the United States and, together with companion rates in Europe and Asia, has some $350 trillion of global credit tied to it.""Having a viable rate alternative is important to financial stability especially if Libor activity were to cease at some point,"" Sandie O'Connor, the committee's chair and chief regulatory affairs officer at JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) said on a call with reporters.The group proposed a framework to phase in the new reference rates to minimize disruptions to financial markets. The plan would allow Libor-linked transactions to exist while the new benchmarks gain acceptance by dealers and investors.""The ARRC envisions a paced transition focusing on new transactions rather than a 'big bang' that would seek to change existing trades,"" it said in a reported released on Friday.ARRC comprises 15 large global banks, which are also interest rate derivatives dealers along with the Fed, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the New York Fed. Clearing houses such as Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), CME and LCH.Clearnet are also part of the group.ARRC's effort began in November 2014 and parallels those by authorities in Britain, Japan, Switzerland and the euro zone.The committee said it picked OBFR and secured general collateral lending rates over four others: monetary policy rates like the fed funds rate; Treasury bill or bond rates; term overnight index swap (OIS) rates and term-unsecured lending rates. These others suffer from smaller market sizes, as well as likely fluctuations in monetary policy framework and issuance.OBFR, developed by the New York Fed, launched in March and reflects $300 billion of daily trades. The interest rate on secured general collateral repurchases, in which banks and dealers use Treasuries as collateral to borrow from investors, is of a comparable size.The Fed and Office of Financial Research are currently considering producing an index on the Treasury repo rate. “The plan is for the committee to pick a rate later this year with the expectation that trading in the new rate could begin as early as next year,” Fed's Powell said. The New York Fed's overnight bank funding rate stood at 0.37 percent on Thursday, unchanged since May 2.In the repo market, the general collateral rate was last quoted at 0.37-0.38 percent, unchanged from Thursday, according to ICAP (LON:IAP).It is unclear how quickly investors would accept a replacement to the 30-year old rate benchmark with its entrenched status around the world.""It's got an uphill battle. I can't see a massive move to the new rate from Libor right now,"" said David Keeble, global head of interest rate strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Corporate & Investment Bank in New York.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Defendants reaped millions of dollar(s) in profits at the expense of plaintiff and members of the class as result of their misconduct.""The proposed class-action lawsuit seeks triple damages, and follows probes by U.S. and European Union antitrust regulators into possible SSA bond price rigging.Those probes are also examining the London-based defendant traders Hiren Gudka of Bank of America, Bhardeep Singh Heer of Nomura, Amandeep Singh Manku of Credit Agricole and Shailen Pau of Credit Suisse, Thomson Reuters' IFR service reported in January.Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Nomura declined to comment on behalf of themselves and the traders who have worked for them. Credit Agricole did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gudka previously worked at Deutsche Bank, Manku at Bank of America, and Pau at Credit Agricole, the complaint said.The lawsuit is one of many in the Manhattan federal court seeking to hold banks liable for alleged price-fixing in bond, commodity, currency, derivatives, interest rate and other financial markets.One such lawsuit, concerning competition in the credit default swaps market, led last September to a $1.86 billion settlement with a dozen banks.SSA bonds are sold in various currencies by issuers such as regional development banks, infrastructure borrowers including highway and bridge authorities, and social security funds.Many carry explicit or implicit backing from governments, and thus enjoy high investment-grade ratings.The case is Boston Retirement System v Bank of America NA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-03711.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Japan's top currency diplomat Masatsugu Asakawa told the Nikkei newspaper that excess volatility may have adverse effects on the economy and that the G7 and G20 countries have repeatedly discussed how to deal with disorderly currency moves.Japan will host a G7 finance ministers and central bankers summit on May 20-21 amid talk that Tokyo has been trying to drum up support for some kind of response to a strong yen.Asakawa, who is vice finance minister for international affairs, also told Reuters that Japan would not be bound by the U.S. Treasury's recent report on currencies, which appeared to warn against unilateral intervention in currency markets.Investors trimmed favorable positions in the yen, with expectations that Japan could ease monetary policy sooner rather than later to bolster inflation and growth reinforcing cautious investor sentiment. The dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 108.75 yen , having struck a two-week high of 109.57 on Friday after upbeat U.S. data. The safe-haven yen had initially gained in Asian trade after Chinese investment, factory output and retail sales all missed forecasts. ""There may be rising scope of the BOJ considering a more aggressive policy stance later on,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).""It must still be kept in mind that inflation expectations as measured by five-year inflation swaps remain close to multi-year lows and that Governor (Haruhiko) Kuroda appears to make a bigger case of additional measures being considered should it prove necessary.""Kuroda said on Friday that the Bank of Japan has ample room for easing, having adopted negative rates earlier this year.Analysts said Japan's first-quarter GDP data on May 18 would be a focus.

""There are likely to be some market swings if the result were to come in much weaker than expected,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mistui Banking Corporation in Singapore. A weak number would knock stocks and bolster demand for the yen, Okagawa added, although the currency may retreat later if the government's responses include delaying next April's sales tax hike or similar.The government denied a weekend media report that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has decided to delay the sales tax hike.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That is language that Tokyo has used in the past to flag intervention, and the yen's run to 17-month highs against the dollar has required investors to believe it would hold fire at least until after next week's G20 meetings in Washington.""Of course there is some fear in the market,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.

375,"Mar 31, 2016 03:40PM ET",U.S. Treasuries post strong quarter but gains not so golden,nan,"By Richard LeongNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury debt market is on track to post its best quarter in 4-1/2 years, but looking under the hood, much of the gain stems from investors demanding more compensation for inflation as commodity prices recovered from multiyear lows.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has fallen 0.48 of a percentage point since the end of 2015 to 1.798 percent as of late Tuesday.Adjusting for investors' 10-year inflation expectations of 1.63 percent as measured by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, the ""real"" yield on a 10-year government note is a measly 0.17 percent, the lowest level since May, according to Tradeweb.Is it worth holding an investment that pays so little when compared with inflation?""In terms of outright value, it's not that cheap,"" said David Keeble, global head of interest rates strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Corporate and Investment Banking in New York.Investors have pulled $2.9 billion from Treasury-focused funds over the past four weeks, reducing their assets to $105.2 billion, the lowest since early February, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.On the other hand, foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries has been brisk because of negative yields in Europe and Japan, analysts said.Where have investors shifted their money to?Much of the funds have gone into TIPS that offer inflation protection, as well as riskier but higher-yielding corporate and emerging market bonds.These sectors had been battered from January into mid-February on signs of faltering Chinese growth and as oil prices tumbled to 12-year lows.Anxious investors piled into safehaven Treasuries in this January to February period, resulting in a 3.7 percent gain. Since then, they have lost 0.7 percent, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) data.BEST QUARTER SINCE 2011Despite its recent deterioration, U.S. government debt has racked up a 3.01 percent return in the first three months of 2016, the strongest gain since 6.36 percent in the third quarter of 2011, according to an index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).Treasuries fared better than the Standard & Poor's 500 index that has earned a 1.59 percent return.However, they lagged TIPS' 4.04 percent return this quarter.Treasuries handily beat corporate and emerging market debt in the earlier part of the first quarter, but they lagged in recent weeks as oil and industrial prices rebounded from their rout due to fears of a U.S. recession.INFLATION HEDGEWhile the U.S. economy is far from robust, domestic inflation seems to be finally firming towards the Federal Reserve's 2 percent annual goal.The core rate on personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, grew at a 1.7 percent year-over-year pace in February after being stuck at a 1.3 percent rate for most of last year.On Tuesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed should proceed ""cautiously"" on raising interest rates, which some traders perceived as the Fed's tolerance for inflation to rise above 2 percent.""Some people are pricing inflation risk on the upside,"" Credit Agricole's Keeble said.Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, has recommended TIPS, gold and other assets that offer inflation protection this week.Gold is on target for a 16 percent gain in the quarter, which would be its biggest quarterly increase in nearly 30 years."

The U.S. currency extended losses from Wednesday to trade at 111.675 yen as trading in European markets gathered pace, down 0.7 percent since trading closed in New York. It fell more than 1 percent to its lowest in more than 8 1/2 months against the Australian dollar  and half a percent to a one-month low against the euro at $1.1294. The yen is now backed by the biggest speculative positioning for further gains since the 2008 financial crisis drove it below 100 to the dollar. Some analysts say it may reach that level again. ""We've only seen long positions like this twice in the last 15 years, and both times we've seen big rallies in the yen,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. ""I do think that monetary policy in Japan has come to its useful end. Rates-wise, there's a vacuum until we hit 109 yen, beyond that it's the 105s. I certainly would not exclude this ends with a fall below 100 yen per dollar.""The Fed said it now expects two quarter-point rate cuts this year, not four. Moderate growth and strong job gains will allow it to raise rates this year, the policymakers said, but the U.S. economy faces risks from an uncertain global outlook.That was enough to dispel any expectations rates would rise in either April or June. The dollar index fell to its lowest in a month in Asian trading, at 95.424. (DXY)None of that disproves the argument that has supported the dollar for two years: that U.S. interest rates will rise more and remain higher than rates in Japan and the euro zone. The market's two biggest euro bears,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), are sticking to forecasts the dollar will reach parity with the single currency this year. Others still expect it to strengthen from here. ""Ultimately... the Fed (should be) in a position to hike rates again,"" analysts from French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said.

379,"Mar 15, 2016 05:35AM ET",Yen gains as BoJ stays neutral on further rate cuts,nan,"By Patrick GrahamLONDON (Reuters) - The yen rose more than half a percent against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by a weakening of oil prices which sent investors in search of traditional safe havens and a neutral message from the Bank of Japan on rates. Six weeks after shocking markets by cutting rates to negative, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would take time to look at the impact, but it could move again before the cut had worked its way fully into the economy.While the yen has gained further since the cut in January, it drew some support from the absence of an explicit threat to reduce rates again. Of as much impact was the fall in oil prices and a resulting downbeat start for European stock markets. ""The bias is just in favor of a stronger yen,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. ""On the days when we are 'risk on', the yen holds strong and on days like today, it gains. Certainly Kuroda was keen to leave open the potential for further moves but it was probably too much to expect him to be explicit at this stage."" The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 113.05 yen , while the euro slipped about 0.6 percent to 125.62 yen (EURJPY=). The dollar rose as high as 121.70 yen on Jan. 29, immediately after the BOJ's announcement, but has since shed more than 6 percent. Next up is the U.S. Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day meeting on Tuesday.A firming of price measures and solid readings from other U.S. data have rekindled market expectations of further tightening this year, and any sign that could still happen in the first half would be liable to aid the dollar, Halpenny said.Retail sales data on Tuesday will provide another indication of the strength of the U.S. economy.""We stay of the view that further improving U.S. growth conditions keep the Fed in a position to tighten monetary policy further this year,"" analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in note. ""From that angle we believe that dollar dips should still be bought, for instance against the Swiss franc."" The euro edged up slightly to $1.1112 , a cent off last week's one-month high of $1.1218.

381,"Feb 23, 2016 01:11AM ET",French banks swim against retreating European tide ,nan,"By Maya Nikolaeva and Julien PonthusPARIS (Reuters) - French banks, unlike their European rivals, are vowing to hang on to a broad array of businesses and even grow market share, a strategy backed by long-term investors but penalized by the market.For while most European banks are battling sluggish economic growth and super low interest rates by cutting costs and retreating to their ""core"", French lenders have decided the time is right to push the frontiers.However, their pursuit of a so-called universal banking model has so far not won stock market approval, with shares in France's three biggest banks,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), all trading at a discount to European peers.Where they do have strong support is from the political establishment who believe France needs to punch above its weight in global financial services to support French companies' overseas business in Francophone countries and beyond. French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said in December ""we have strong banks, based on a universal model, which is envied by many...and they (banks) were less affected by the crisis than others because they are more solid"".This ability to pursue a variety of activities and geographies relies on a relative stability of revenues in the domestic retail network, which traditionally has been a cash cow for French banks, and their focus on large corporate clients.And bonds formed at France's prestigious universities means bank and company executives, central bankers and government officials often have a broadly shared viewpoint. Another proponent of the need for French banking's omnipresence is Societe Generale's Chief Executive Frederic Oudea, who has argued that Europe needs ""major banks"" to finance the economy and to back consolidation of its large corporations.""Of course, it is not a matter of returning to the banks pre-crisis race for balance sheet size...but rather one of ensuring that there will still be some European banking institutions capable of meeting the needs of international clients operating around the world,"" Oudea said in an opinion piece posted on his Linkedin account.So while at the height of the 2010-12 euro zone crisis French banks had to cut their balance sheets by selling assets as investors fretted about their exposure to countries like Greece and their funding models, this cull was short-lived.""French banks are those who have least changed their business models,"" said Yohan Salleron, who owns BNP Paribas shares in his portfolio at Mandarine Gestion.The French Banking Federation has lobbied in Brussels to preserve the ""universal model"", which some say could be at risk from a European Union plan to split banks' trading activities into a separate legal entity.SOLID SHAREHOLDERS Another reason French banks may not have faced more investor pressure to shrink is their solid base of long-term stakeholders, in the form of state participation and cross-shareholdings, which can act as a deterrant to activists. The Belgian government owns 10.25 percent of BNP Paribas, while French state bank Caisse des Depots has 3 percent of voting rights in Societe Generale. Other investors are skeptical because French banks have lower capital ratios than most European peers, although they set more ambitious targets after last year's European Central Bank asset quality review and stress tests.""Every bank has its stack of problems and the problems of the French banks are simpler compared to some others, it's about costs and building up capital,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at investment firm Axiom AI. The French banks argue that they have already done the pruning that others are only now doing, giving them a head start over rivals like  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) or  Credit Suisse  (VX:CSGN) which announced thousands of job cuts and plans to slim down their investment banks last year.Though French lenders have recently announced savings plans to offset regulatory and compliance costs, as well as cutting some investment banking activities, they have not made massive job cuts or sold underperforming assets such as SocGen's loss-making Russian business or BNP Paribas' Italian activities.Rather than cutting, SocGen said in February that its costs could grow by up to 2 percent in 2016, while BNP said that the cost base in its corporate and institutional division would be stable in 2019 versus 2015, despite measures to boost savings.That has put pressure on short-term profitability.""Given the outlook for falling revenues, we instead think costs must be cut in absolute terms,"" analysts at Berenberg said in a note, calling the growth strategy at BNP Paribas and SocGen ""poorly focused and self defeating"".SocGen's share price fell 13 percent on the day it warned about profitability targets. Analysts at Kepler Chevreux said when banks are willing to protect their businesses at the expense of a higher payout or building up capital, it is perceived as ""shareholder unfriendly"".But some shareholders are thinking longer term.""I prefer to bet on stability, even if this is not going to work for French banks in the short term. I think they have a more prudent approach, which can satisfy investors over the longer term,"" Mandarine Gestion's Salleron said.($1 = 0.8988 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

382,"Feb 18, 2016 09:50AM ET","As Commodities Plummet, Banks Edge Towards Undercapitalization",nan,"By Vassil NikolovAnalysts from Bernstein Research state that European investment banks and US brokers are in general still undercapitalized, despite 6 years of spending aimed at remedying the situation.According to the analysts,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s tangible equity is just 2.7% of its tangible assets. This is when we exclude the deferred tax assets. The only bank that has it worse is  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) with 2.3%. A little better is  Credit Suisse  (VX:CSGN) with 3.0%.  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) looks good for now (7.3%) but it's being heavily pushed by the markets that bank with commodity exposure.At the same time we have the French banks like SocGen and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), who are also undercapitalized but seem to be protected by regulatory backing from the French government.It would be very undesirable for banks if credit default swaps, which are the price of insuring against defaults on principal payments, indicate worse performances than before. The last time that something like this happened was during the global financial crisis, when investment banking revenues went down by 40% and more.This increase in spreads usually leads to more risk off signals to earnings and even higher spreads. Markets are generally right about the state of the world economy and thus there is the possibility that investment banking revenues could fall 20-30% in 2016. And as spreads continue to blow, banks will find it even harder to increase their capital ratios, with the de-leveraging and dumping of risk weighted assets. And in this scenario, capital continues to be a problem to deal with.Banking in the eurozone has become something like a fixed cost business, due to all the regulations related to compensation, while at the same time having the most unstable income.If revenues in investment banking really fall by 20-30% in 2016, there will be no choice left except to cut staff which will damage their franchises in the future.Original Source"
383,"Feb 17, 2016 01:30PM ET","Oil deal optimism fuels rally in crude, global stocks ",nan,"By Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Wednesday, buoyed by a jump in oil prices on optimism that top crude producers could reach a deal to freeze production, while the Mexican peso surged after Mexico's central bank hiked its benchmark interest rate. After a surprise agreement deal between non-OPEC Russia and the group's leader Saudi Arabia to freeze output at January levels, Iran stopped short of offering to hold back output as it wants to recoup market share it lost during years of sanctions.Brent (LCOc1) gained 7.6 percent at $34.64 and U.S. crude (CLc1) was up 6.5 percent at $30.92 a barrel.Energy shares (SPNY), up 3.2 percent, and materials (SPLRCM), up 2.2 percent, led Wall Street higher, with nine of the 10 major S&P sectors in positive territory.""Clearly with this news of some potential coordinated pullback in production in global markets, we are beginning to get some visibility on the prospect of a range in crude oil,"" said Peter Kenny, equity market strategist at Kenny & Co LLC in Denver.""Really investors want as much visibility and as few surprises as possible and this delivers on that, this takes the surprise out.""

Financials in Europe were up 3.3 percent (SX7P) and basic resources stocks surged 8.1 percent (SXPP).MSCI's index of world shares (MIWD00000PUS) was up 1.56 percent, extending Tuesday's rise of 2.3 percent, its second-biggest gain in four years.

The dollar's (DXY) strength, combined with the highest 2-year U.S. government bond yields (US2YT=RR) since 2011, showed hopes were high for the jobs numbers. The health of U.S. employment is a key to the Fed's thinking. Economists polled by Reuters expect the data at 0830 ET to show 180,000 jobs were added last month and the overall unemployment rate remained 5.1 percent.Investors in both Europe and Asia used the wait for the data to skim off some of the week's profits in global stock markets.

The bombing killed 17 sailors and injured more than three dozen.The plaintiffs, 15 American sailors injured in the attack and three of their spouses, filed a lawsuit in 2010 against Sudan in Washington, D.C., claiming the country provided material support to al Qaeda that helped facilitate the bombing.In 2012, a federal judge in Washington issued a default judgment of $314.7 million against Sudan, which did not respond to the lawsuit.In an effort to collect some of the money, the plaintiffs secured orders from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in New York requiring the banks to turn over certain assets they held for Sudan.The amount of money held in the accounts is redacted from court filings.The banks themselves were not parties to the appeal and did not contest the orders.In a statement, Mashreqbank said it turned over the funds, which were frozen under U.S. sanctions, in December 2013, pursuant to the court order. Credit Agricole also confirmed it had turned over the money.A representative of BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment.Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not available on Wednesday for comment.Sudan's appeal of the turnover orders was the first time the country made a formal appearance in the case.Sudan argued the original lawsuit was not properly served on its foreign minister and said the lower court failed to follow the appropriate steps in issuing the turnover orders.The appeals court, however, rejected both arguments.Sudan faces other judgments as well. A federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia, ordered the country in March to pay USS Cole victims and their families $48 million, while a judge in Washington ordered Sudan and Iran in March to pay a combined $75 million.The case in Wednesday's ruling is Harrison et al v.

395,"Sep 09, 2015 04:27PM ET",Exclusive: Credit Agricole may pay about $900 million in U.S. sanctions probes,nan,"By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK (Reuters) - France's  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR) is nearing an agreement to pay about $900 million to resolve investigations into whether it illegally moved funds through the United States for blacklisted individuals and countries such as Sudan and Iran, according to a person familiar with the matter.Talks are ongoing and the total penalty, negotiated by multiple U.S. agencies, could change. A second source described the current settlement as in the ""high hundreds of millions"" and suggested it could reach $1 billion.The bank, France's third-largest listed lender, is expected to reach an accord as soon as this month, the two people said. A spokeswoman for Credit Agricole had no immediate comment. Last month, Credit Agricole said it was in ""very advanced talks"" with U.S. authorities over the sanctions probes and it expected to reach a global settlement in autumn. It set aside an additional 350 million euros ($392 million) for a settlement.In total, Credit Agricole has earmarked 1.6 billion euros ($1.79 billion) for litigation, but it is unclear how much of that is dedicated to a deal on sanctions.The resolution focuses on misconduct that occurred between 2003 and 2008, one source said.The sources did not want to be identified because negotiations are still underway.Settlements with U.S. authorities over sanctions typically take longer to complete than anticipated, in part because so many agencies are involved, including the U.S. Department of Justice, Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Manhattan District Attorney's office and New York's Department of Financial Services. All declined to comment on the Credit Agricole negotiations. About a dozen international banks, mostly European, have been stung by U.S. penalties for sanctions-busting totaling nearly $14 billion since 2009.In March,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), Germany's No. 2 lender, agreed to pay $1.45 billion.Italy's UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI), France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), and Germany's  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) are still under investigation, sources have told Reuters. BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), France's largest bank, last year paid a record-breaking $8.9 billion and pleaded guilty to criminal charges over its sanctions-busting. It also was banned from conducting certain U.S. dollar transactions for a year.In most cases, authorities have struck agreements with the banks to defer criminal charges as long as the lender abides by the terms of the deal.But even if such a deal is struck between prosecutors and Credit Agricole, it may not be home free. Standard Chartered  Plc's (L:STAN) 2012 deferred prosecution agreement was extended in December for another three years amid an ongoing probe of Iranian-controlled companies banking in Dubai, sources have told Reuters.($1 = 0.8936 euros)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

397,"Sep 07, 2015 01:15AM ET",China Trims 2014 GDP Growth,nan,"By Avaneesh Pandey -China on Monday revised its 2014 GDP growth figure to 7.3 percent from a previously reported 7.4 percent. The revision comes just a day after China’s Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said that the country’s overall GDP growth would remain at approximately 7 percent.According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, which cited China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the country’s revised GDP for 2014 stood at 63.6 trillion yuan ($10 trillion), down by 32.4 billion yuan from the initial estimate. The figure is subject to further revision, the report added.After the revision, China’s services sector accounted for 48.1 percent of GDP in 2014, down from the previously announced 48.2 percent, while the manufacturing and construction sector accounted for 42.7 percent of GDP, Xinhua reported. The primary sector -- agriculture -- grew 4.1 percent.“China revises growth data every year, but it's usually upwards. In that regard, it is unusual that the revision was downwards,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PARIS:CAGR), told CNBC. “Rationally speaking, a 0.1 percent revision isn’t a big deal -- and it doesn't tell us much about the Chinese economy, but when it comes to sentiment, this is a negative development.”In 2015, China is headed for its slowest economic growth in over two decades, even as the government attempts to revive the economy through a raft of measures, including cutting benchmark interest rates, lowering the amount of deposits banks must hold in reserves and devaluing the yuan -- a move that triggered a rout in the country’s stock markets.However, the announcement did not seem to have affected Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite Index was trading up 0.88 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.22 percent."
398,"Sep 03, 2015 09:40AM ET","ECB sees weaker growth, inflation in euro zone, says ready to act",nan,"By John O'Donnell and Francesco CanepaFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank cut its inflation and growth forecasts for the euro zone on Thursday and its president said things could get worse.The euro fell 1 percent on the moves and comments, hitting a two week low.Mario Draghi, the ECB president, pledged to beef up or prolong the bank's bond-buying program if the picture indeed darkened further, although he said no one on the bank's Governing Council had argued for it now.The ECB, which left interest rates unchanged in a widely predicted decision, said the chances of missing its medium-term inflation target had increased due to lower oil prices, weaker growth in China and other emerging markets and an appreciating euro. Draghi said the bank's 1 trillion euro-plus asset-buying program was working smoothly, if slowly, and the policy-making Governing Council was ready and willing to take further policy action but decided it would premature to do so now.""In particular (the Council) recalls that the asset purchase program provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the program,"" he told a news conference.In one small change to the quantitative easing program, the bank agreed to increase the share of any sovereign bond issue it could buy to 33 percent from 25 percent, provided that did not give it a blocking minority among bondholders. The ECB forecast that inflation would be a mere 0.1 percent this year, 1.1 percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2017, compared with its June projections of 0.3, 1.5 and 1.8 percent respectively.It lowered its forecast for growth in the 19-nation euro area to 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2017, from June projections of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 percent respectively.The forecasts, meanwhile, were compiled based on data taken before Aug. 12 and did not take into account the latest sharp economic deterioration in China, which posed ""downside risks to the projections themselves"", Draghi said. However, he said the council tended to think the weaker inflation outlook was due to ""transitory effects"" but would closely monitor all relevant factors.Draghi confirmed the ECB had cut Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greek banks for the second time in two weeks.The ECB launched its 60 billion euro ($68 billion) per month quantitative easing program in March to boost consumer prices after a short bout of deflation. It is due to run until September 2016 but Draghi clearly hinted it could be extended.The International Monetary Fund argued on Thursday that the ECB should consider extending QE, citing a rise in downside risks to the global economy due to a combination of threats, including China's slowdown and rising market volatility.Oil prices are down 35 percent since May, iron ore is near an all-time low, the euro has unexpectedly firmed and Chinese growth, already a worry for the ECB in July, is slowing sharply. One of the bank's favored gauges of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year euro zone breakeven forward, has fallen below 1.7 percent from 1.85 percent in July.'WILLINGNESS TO ACT'A majority of analysts polled by Reuters expect the ECB eventually to extend or increase its asset purchases. Three quarters said the bank has simply run out of tools and that adjusting QE, scheduled to run until next September, is its only viable option.""Even if it appears too early to expect them to announce additional quantitative easing, central bank President Draghi should consider a more dovish rhetoric in order to prevent inflation expectations from falling further,""  Credit Agricole  (PARIS:CAGR) said in a note to clients. Peter Praet, the bank's chief economist, has said markets should not doubt the ECB's ""willingness and ability"" to act. But comments from other rate setters like Benoit Coeure and Vice President Vitor Constancio suggest the bank will want to take time before taking action and prefers steady policy for now.EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici played down the risks, predicting in an interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa that growth would become more robust. ""We have seen how monetary authorities, above all in China, have reacted well and have the tools to continue to do so,"" he said in the interview, published on Thursday. ""In such a context we can benefit from low energy prices, growth-friendly interest rates, while reform efforts by European governments are bearing fruit and create better conditions for growth."" Draghi highlighted some of the positive impacts of QE, even though inflation has stayed below 2 percent since early 2013. Lending to euro zone firms in July grew at the fastest pace since early 2012, unemployment fell and the composite purchasing manager's index unexpectedly rose, offering a glimmer of hope that growth may be picking up after a lackluster second quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

400,"Aug 13, 2015 10:36AM ET",Germans borrow more as Merkel urges Europe to spend carefully,nan,"By Michelle MartinBERLIN (Reuters) - While Chancellor Angela Merkel's focus on careful spending as a cure for the euro zone's debt problems has made her popular at home, German consumers are borrowing more to finance everything from furniture to cars.Germans, traditionally a nation of debt-averse savers, took out an average of 8,700 euros ($9,650) in loans last year - a rise of around 10 percent compared with 2013, according to Schufa, Germany's main credit bureau.With borrowing expected rise again this year, that marks a significant shift in a country where the thrifty southwestern 'Swabian housewife' has been held up as a model and a strong dislike of borrowing is rooted in the language. 'Schuld', the word for debt, also means guilt.During the euro zone crisis, Merkel and her government have extolled the virtues of budget discipline over loading up on debt to finance stimulus, with her Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble currently playing hardball over Greece's attempts to secure a third bailout in exchange for economic reforms.That stance that has scored points with voters at home but raised hackles in other euro zone states, whose governments have throughout the crisis urged the citizens of Europe's richest country to help kick-start the region's recovery by spending more freely.Emboldened by the strong jobs market, rising wages and a more robust economic backdrop, German consumers are starting to do just that by buying more on credit as rock-bottom interest rates make it cheaper to borrow and reduce the incentive to save.""The economy is stable, steady incomes are giving people planning security and there are plenty of tempting offers at a time when people are very consumption-oriented and interest rates are low,"" said Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, professor of household and consumption economics at the University of Bonn.""All this means that taking on debt is in vogue.""While the number of new loans dropped slightly last year, the average amount people borrowed rose. For the first time, new installment loans worth more than 10,000 euros overtook those worth less than 1,000 euros, Schufa data showed.Germans still have far less outstanding consumer credit per head than peers in Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom, but they have far more left to pay off than the Italians, Spanish and Portuguese, a study by French bank  Credit Agricole  (PARIS:CAGR) found.'SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE'Hans-Werner Scherer, head of financial services firm EOS Group, said installment loans, the overdraft facility on credit cards and current accounts, had become ""socially acceptable"".""Nowadays Germans differentiate between 'good' and 'bad' debt,"" he said. ""Taking out debt to pay for cosmetic surgery, new clothes or jewelry is still frowned upon but taking out a loan to buy a house or pay for health treatment is accepted.""Germans are most likely to borrow money to pay for high-value items like property or cars but less keen on using credit for leisure activities like holidays and games consoles, Scherer said.Market research group GfK's consumer credit index expects consumers to take out even more debt this year, mainly to pay for renovations, furniture, kitchens and used cars.Germans have a strong payment record, with 97.5 percent paying back their debt, according to Schufa. But some evidence suggests attitudes are changing among younger Germans.An increasing number of the Federal Association of German Debt Collection Companies' (BDIU) member firms are reporting that 18- to 24-year-olds are worse at paying bills than those above 25. Online retailers and mail-order firms are young Germans' most common creditors.""This trend is slowly gaining traction and it's really bad when young people start out with a debt pile which builds up to the extent that they could get so overwhelmed they end up insolvent,"" said BDIU head Wolfgang Spitz.The 62-year-old said attitudes had changed since his childhood: ""Back in the day ... you saved up money you got from your grandmother and others and at some point you could buy a bike but that's no longer so common.""If he had his way, schools would give lessons on dealing with money and debt and put piggy banks in classrooms."

404,"Aug 04, 2015 08:20AM ET","Respite for commodities as dollar wilts, China bounces  ",nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Investors got a day off from commodity market turmoil on Tuesday, as oil prices steadied at $50 a barrel after a 5 percent drop and metals and Chinese markets were generally calmer. However, European stocks <0#.INDEXE> reversed some of the previous day's gains, Wall Street was expected to fall for a third day (N) and a preference for safety meant German  government bonds were back in demand.The respite for commodities (TRJCRB) came as a relief though and saw Brent oil , which has slumped more than 20 percent over the last month, climb more than 1 percent. Copper , seen as a bellwether of global growth, rose from a six-year low after Chinese stocks (CSI300) (SSEC) rebounded by more than 3 percent in Asia. A weaker dollar helped, after another bout of weak U.S. data on Monday and before U.S. jobs data due on Friday. The Canadian  and Australian dollars , both linked to raw materials, got lifts alongside emerging market currencies like Russia's rouble , the South African rand  and Brazil's real . [EMRG/FRX]The Aussie dollar was the biggest mover. It rose 1.25 percent to almost a two-week high of $0.7375 after the central bank suggested it was more comfortable with the currency's level following its slide.Investors lengthened the odds of another cut in the 2 percent cash rate. Interbank futures <0#YIB:> now imply a 60 percent chance of a move by December, from 72 percent earlier in the day. ""You have had a key shift from the RBA that they don't need to intervene as strongly, so that has triggered a considerable Aussie bounce,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.""And the (U.S.) dollar view is just flat and we are just waiting for payrolls on Friday. We have had a relatively hawkish set-up from Yellen and co (that interest rates may go up next month) but the rates market just doesn't believe it.""The dollar was down about 0.1 percent on the day to 123.90 yen  as U.S. trading started. The euro was slightly higher at $1.0958 .On European stock markets, French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) were among the worst performers after disappointing results. The recent drop in oil prices weighed on energy stocks. (EU)Shares in Greece (ATG), which had slumped 16 percent on Monday when they reopened after closing for five weeks, also fell a further 4 percent before a partial recovery.DATA DEPENDENT In Asian trading, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) made late gains. Chinese shares rose for a third day, ending up more than 3 percent (CSI300). Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) kept losses to 0.14 percent.Beijing has taken numerous steps to support Chinese share markets after they lost more than 30 percent of their value since peaking in June. It announced a fresh crackdown on speculative trading on Tuesday, but investors were still cautious.""The market is still very volatile ... investors are likely to be quiet and see what the next step of the government will be,"" said Patrick Yiu, a director of CASH Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""The overall market momentum is not likely to pick up anytime soon and the economy in China is still very weak.""Fears of disinflation stemming from the rout in oil prices has led investors to pare bets that the Fed will raise U.S. interest rates as early as September.Durable goods and factory data are due later  and investors are awaiting earnings reports from a batch of companies that includes Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) and Kellogg (N:K).But Friday's employment data is key for markets. They are expected to show the U.S. economy created 225,000 new jobs in July, according to economists polled by Reuters. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 5.3 percent. ""If we get some certainty about the strength of the U.S. economy and the likelihood of policy normalization by the Fed, and if a rate hike seems justifiable, that is positive for sentiment ... because a lot of people have been bracing for this,"" said Stefan Worrall, director of cash equities at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

408,"Jun 11, 2015 01:14AM ET",Rising cost on U.S. rate swaps raises worries ,nan,"By Richard LeongNEW YORK (Reuters) - A widening gap in the costs to hedge interest rate risk between platforms based in London and Chicago is generating losses for Wall Street dealers and creating concern about how well this corner of the bond market will respond when the Federal Reserve raises rates.    In the last month, dealers have frequently been forced to pay a costly premium on London's LCH.Clearnet to offset their risk for facilitating interest rate swaps on smaller rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange on behalf of their clients.     The higher costs may further exacerbate bouts of extreme illiquidity and swings that have recently plagued the bond market, such as the ""flash crash"" in bond yields last October, an event that has alarmed and baffled regulators. It could test the resolve of dealers to provide liquidity in a pinch.      ""Everyone is concerned about it,"" Jonathan Rick, an interest rate derivatives strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PARIS:CAGR) in New York, said about the price disparity.    The rate swaps, in which parties exchange the cash flows from different types of bonds, are an integral part of the fixed-income market, amounting to $381 trillion in notional value. Investors and dealers use swaps as another way to bet for or against bonds as well as to hedge their portfolios.    Due to their importance, regulators required dealers and investors by 2014 to book their interest rate swaps with clearinghouses or centralized counterparties (CCPs) like those operated by the CME Group (O:CME) and its larger rival LCH.Clearnet.    The clearinghouses take on the risk of these trades so they require the swap parties to post margins on them.    There has been a ""basis"" or pricing differential to clear between LCH and CME, the main CCPs for dollar swaps, because of such things as differences on required margins and costs to finance the margins.    Until recently, it hasn't been a problem. The price of a swap cleared at CME or LCH was miniscule, roughly 0.15 basis point more on CME for a 30-year swap.     But since early May, the spread widened nearly 17 fold at one point. It has eased somewhat recently but remains stretched.    It's unclear what has caused the LCH-CME spread to widen so dramatically.    Some analysts reckoned it might be due to the recent surge in corporate bond supply. Others speculated it might stem from a dealer reaching a threshold on its swap exposure.    Either way, it has occurred at a time when bond yields have risen as investors grow more confident that the Fed will raise rates this year for the first time since 2006. That could be enhancing demand among bond managers to swap fixed rates for floating rates, putting the dealers who facilitate those trades largely on the same side of the market.     The price disparity means that on a $25 million 30-year swap trade, for example, a dealer could be on the hook for about a $100,000 loss if he is paying a fixed rate on a CME swap and has arranged to receive an offsetting fixed rate on a LCH swap.    With this potential loss, a dealer might raise how much he charges a fund to receive fixed-rate payments on a CME swap, traders said.     PREFERENCE AT A PRICE    A fund manager who buys interest rate futures or a fixed-rate corporate bond typically offsets the position by entering into an interest rate swap with a bond dealer. And the swap is often cleared through the CME.    Then, the dealer enters into a swap with another dealer, often cleared through, LCH in an effort to lower his interest rate risk.    Asset managers prefer swaps cleared via CME, while dealers do more through LCH so there has been an imbalance.    ""When this imbalance is large enough, hedging flows related to the basis risk can cause the kind of cross-CCP spread we are currently seeing in the market,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a research note last month.    CME said it cleared a third of swaps between investors and dealers. But it has a much smaller share in total swap clearing, which LCH dominates.    For dealers, the jump in swap clearing cost has become a trading loss.     In response, dealers may pass on the higher cost to asset managers and other clients, analysts said. Barring that, they may limit their participation, potentially contributing to a liquidity drought.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The banks settled these charges and received a 10-percent cut in the fines.""The hearing will be from 15 to 17 June,"" the people said.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. HSBC and JPMorgan declined to comment.In these hearings, companies typically take the opportunity to press their case in front of an audience of experts from the EU executive and national regulators.JPMorgan said last year the EU charges were without merit while HSBC said it would defend itself vigorously. Credit Agricole last month got a boost when the European Ombudsman backed its claim of Commission bias during the investigation.The Commission usually takes several months to come to a decision after such a hearing.HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, U.S. bank JP Morgan and French peer Credit Agricole could face fines up to 10 percent of their global revenues if found guilty.Regulators have slapped total fines of around $8.5 billion on some of the world's largest banks for market rigging and collusion in the last seven years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

414,"Apr 24, 2015 08:22AM ET",'Smaller and simpler' mantra rings through banking boardrooms,nan,"By Steve SlaterLONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank 's expected move to sell much of its retail banking business will see it join a growing list of banks choosing to shrink and simplify to survive.The benefits of size and reach, for years considered the holy grail of global banking, are now seen as being outweighed by the cost and complexity of running businesses across dozens of countries.Many bank bosses have given up on trying to offer everything to everyone. But as unwinding years of expansion proves difficult, pressure for action has intensified, from politicians who show little patience with institutions they consider too big and complex and investors wanting more return on equity (RoE).""The underlying economics for banks ... means being all things to all people is too big a burden to sustain,"" said Bill Michael, head of financial services in Europe at consultancy KPMG. He cited low RoEs, high operational risk and hefty potential costs from regulation. After missing financial targets and racking up a raft of regulatory fines and problems, Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) board is expected to agree on Friday to sell retail arm  Postbank  (DE:DPBGn) and take a knife to its investment bank. On the same day, HSBC's (L:HSBA) bosses responded to investor criticism over a string of misconduct scandals and weak profitability by stressing how far they have shrunk and streamlined the bank in the last four years. HSBC has already sold or shut 77 businesses and could yet dispose of big operations in Brazil or Turkey. Credit Suisse 's (VX:CSGN) incoming CEO Tidjane Thiam is expected to slash trading operations and pull back from other areas, while  Barclays  (L:BARC) chairman John McFarlane signaled on his first day on Thursday that he will also wield the knife.The message is clear: bold action is on the cards to create leaner and simpler models, even after big cuts in recent years at Barclays, Credit Suisse,  Citigroup  (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), UBS (VX:UBSG) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS). ""NOT A SCRAP OF EVIDENCE BIGGER IS BETTER""Pressure for banks to be cut down in size has built since the global financial crisis, which was preceded by a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions of the kind that briefly made RBS one of the world's biggest banks.Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said in 2009 ""there is not a scrap of evidence of economies of scale or scope in banking -- of bigger or broader being better"".Politicians worry that large and complex banks can miss problems, struggle to instill a common culture and are just too hard to manage.Efforts by some national regulators to limit capital outflows have also encouraged lenders to quit countries in which they lack scale.Investors, too, are questioning the benefits of size as they lose patience with promises that returns will recover. And valuations reflect their preference for simpler firms. Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), which focuses mainly on U.S. retail and commercial banking, is now the world's biggest bank by market value. Its shares trade at 1.6 times book value, compared to an average for U.S. banks of close to book value.Lloyds (L:LLOY) focus on UK retail and commercial lending has helped its shares trade at a big premium to rivals, while Deutsche Bank trades at just 0.6 times book value, even after a rally since its plans for an overhaul emerged.""SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT""The main challenge for bosses is how far to go. Most banks want to continue offering a range of services -- from personal savings accounts to takeover advice for companies and telling rich clients how to invest -- but to fewer clients.Some bankers argue that simplification reverses two decades of globalization that have benefited trade and finance, and could leave just three truly global banks -- HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup.JPMorgan has rejected calls for its breakup, saying scale has always ""defined the winner"" in banking. It says not having to duplicate audit functions or cybersecurity for the thousands of clients that use more than one part of the bank saves it $18 billion a year. But demands that 30 'systemically important' banks hold more capital, and the more intense regulatory scrutiny they face, also throw into question the benefits of scale.The list of banks and their capital requirements are judged annually on five criteria, including size, international reach and complexity.Lloyds is not on the list and Wells Fargo's capital surcharge is 1 percent of risk-weighted assets, well below the 2.5 percent HSBC and JPMorgan must hoard in case of losses -- in both cases an extra $30 billion or more of capital.One carrot from regulators is that surcharges can be reduced if banks simplify, as happened with UBS and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

419,"Mar 05, 2015 04:19PM ET",Exclusive: Commerzbank nears $1.4 billion-plus settlement with U.S. - sources,nan,"By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) is nearing an agreement to pay U.S. authorities more than $1.4 billion to settle allegations it violated U.S. sanctions and a separate investigation that stemmed from the Olympus Corp (T:7733) accounting scandal, according to two people close to the case. The accord, which would suspend criminal charges in a deferred prosecution, could come as soon as next week, the sources said on Thursday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.One of the sources said the final number was expected to be $1.45 billion. The other source cautioned that the deal was not yet final and details could still change.Margarita Thiel, a spokeswoman for Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest lender, declined to comment.The U.S. Justice Department and other U.S. authorities involved also declined to comment. The other agencies include the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Manhattan District Attorney's office, the U.S. Attorneys in Washington, D.C. and Manhattan, and New York's financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services.Commerzbank told investors on Feb. 12 that negotiations with U.S. authorities had intensified and that it had put aside 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in total for legal costs, related in part to the U.S. probes.A combined tally of more than $1.4 billion would be about double what the bank was set to pay last fall under a previous accord with U.S. authorities over sanctions violations in dealings with Iran and Sudan from about 2002 to 2011. That agreement was put on hold, however, in light of a separate probe sparked by transactions at the German bank in connection with accounting fraud at Japan's Olympus Corp, Reuters previously reported.OLYMPUS The potential $1.4 billion-plus settlement includes the coordinated resolution of the separate Olympus-related investigation, the sources said. Olympus, a camera and medical equipment maker, admitted in 2011 that it had used improper accounting to conceal investment losses over more than a decade, in one of Japan's biggest corporate scandals.Commerzbank handled more than $1 billion in transactions related to the fraud, much of which went through New York, according to a separate person familiar with the matter.The source said an investigation showed the bank did not comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires the monitoring and flagging of suspicious transactions to combat money laundering.Commerzbank in recent years has focused on improving its controls after it entered into an agreement in 2012 with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to improve compliance with BSA/anti-money laundering laws and regulations.The New York branch still failed to maintain adequate controls, the Federal Reserve found in 2013, and issued a cease and desist order. SANCTIONS VIOLATIONSThe bank, which is 17 percent owned by the German government, is expected to pay $718 million in connection with the probe of sanctions-related violations, one source said. Commerzbank was accused of knowingly banking for the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, a state-sponsored shipping line designated for economic sanctions by the U.S. in 2008 for supporting Iran's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Reuters previously reported. The Justice Department would split $342 million with the Manhattan District Attorney's office over the sanctions-related case, the source said, while New York's Department of Financial Services would receive $310 million, and the Federal Reserve $66 million.Penalties imposed by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would be deemed satisfied by the $342 million, the source said.Commerzbank will likely pay another $600 million over the Olympus-related probe of Bank Secrecy Act violations, the source said, split equally between Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the New York banking regulator. The Federal Reserve would get another $134 million from the Olympus-related probe, the source said.With the impending settlement, Commerzbank would join more than a half dozen foreign banks that have already settled with U.S. authorities.French lender  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) agreed to pay a record-breaking $8.9 billion for sanctions violations last year. In 2012, Amsterdam-based ING bank paid $619 million, then the highest penalty, followed by British bank  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN), which paid $667 million.Authorities have said the banks stripped identifying information from incoming wires to avoid red flags that would have helped police the transactions.Italy's UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI), France's  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), and Germany's  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), also are under investigation by U.S. authorities for sanctions-related violations, sources have told Reuters previously. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the bank is cooperating with U.S. authorities. The other banks declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

420,"Feb 27, 2015 09:43AM ET",Ukraine crisis seen softening political ground for foreign farm land sales,nan,"By Chris ArsenaultROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The crisis in Ukraine looks set to trigger major changes in its vast agricultural sector with state-owned farm land and small family plots likely to go up for sale despite concerns over the impact on local farmers, according to development experts.Ukraine, known as Europe's bread basket, has the eighth largest agricultural area in use globally and is the world's third largest exporter of corn and sixth largest grain grower, potentially making it a prime target for foreign investment.But the government has been wary of allowing foreign land sales, fearing rural unrest, and the value of its 32 million hectares (79 million acres) of farmland has been limited by its division into small plots with relatively low productivity. However economic turmoil emanating from the conflict between pro-Russia rebels and government forces in the east has intensified the need for change, said Heinz Strubenhoff, agribusiness investment manager for the World Bank's International Finance Corporation in Ukraine.Opening the farm sector, a key driver of the economy, to outside investors has long been backed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Strubenhoff believes changes will now happen sooner rather than later. ""It's time to think about privatization. They need to prepare everything to allow for farm land sales (to foreign and domestic investors) in three to four years,"" Strubenhoff told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Currently, farm land cannot be bought or sold in Ukraine, but companies can sign onto long-term leases with small holders. LACK OF TRUSTPresident Petro Poroshenko, elected last May after protests ousted previous Russian-backed leader Viktor Yanukovich, had considered lifting restrictions on land sales during ""long discussions"" with World Bank officials, Strubenhoff said.But Kiev backed off the move as it feared a backlash from rural communities, he said.Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture was unable to immediately respond to requests for comment.Agriculture Minister Oleksiy Pavlenko told local media last month that he believes Ukraine can produce 100 million tonnes of grain annually by 2020, up from 62 million tonnes in 2014.To nearly double production, the country aims to attract $25 billion in outside investment for agriculture, Pavlenko said.But enticing new capital in the midst of the conflict that has displaced nearly a million people won't be easy. Jean-Jacques Hervé, counselor to the board for agriculture at France's Credit Agricol (PARIS:CAGR)e Bank in Ukraine, said local people don't have enough money to buy the land.""Speculators with access to foreign currency would be the biggest winners (if the land market was opened),"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Selling land to foreign investors could cause problems and the government should instead help get finance to farmers, search for new export markets and simplify the procedures for land leases, he said.Frédéric Mousseau, policy director of the Oakland Institute, an NGO critical of privatization, said pushing Ukraine to open its land market would end up giving domestic and foreign oligarchs more control over the country's agriculture potential.""About 20 percent of the country's most fertile lands are already controlled by large agribusiness firms (through long-term leases),"" Mousseau told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""The (proposed) reforms would just intensify this concentration.""But despite concerns from some quarters, U.N. officials are backing the World Bank's view on sales. ""In the long term, Ukraine should aim to open its land market to allow optimum resource allocation,"" Dmitry Prikhodko, an economist with the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. With foreign currency reserves low, Kiev needs the World Bank's money - up to $2 billion this year with another $8 billion from the IMF - which potentially gives officials like Strubenhoff greater policy leverage. ""There is a big chance in the crisis for the Ukrainian government,"" Strubenhoff said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

423,"Feb 10, 2015 05:37AM ET",Dollar drifts up as Greek worries weigh on Europe,nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Nerves over Greece's future in the euro and the conflict in Ukraine dragged on European markets on Tuesday, while bets on the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate hike nudged the dollar higher and oil prices held steady after a rebound.European stocks fell 0.3 percent and the euro slipped toward $1.13 ahead of what is set to be a tense, Greece-dominated meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Wednesday.The global disinflation/deflation story was also back on investors' radar as Chinese inflation fell below 1 percent to its lowest in five months, drawing talk of further easing from China's central bank, the PBOC.That had sent shares in Shanghai up more than 1 percent, though other Asian stocks eased on more generalized risk aversion.Commodity price-dependent currencies such as the Australian dollar and Norwegian crown got a lift from the talk of China stimulus, but for many traders the main focus remained the dollar (DXY) as it nudged up again.""We are just wondering what the status is on this dollar move as U.S. rates (bond yields) rise,"" Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy, John Hardy, said.""We had the big move on Friday after the strong jobs numbers but then yesterday everything went quiet so hopefully it will rally today to show that there is something behind it.""On the strains on the euro, Hardy pointed out that markets appear relatively pragmatic about a potential exit of Greece from the 19-member currency bloc.Although Greek markets have been hit hard - benchmark Greek bond yields remain above 10.75 percent - the euro performed relatively well against currencies other than the dollar. There has been limited impact on Spanish and Italian bond markets.Britain's finance minister George Osborne, however, warned on Tuesday that the risk of a ""very bad outcome"" was growing between Greece and the euro area. Britain is not a member but trades heavily with Europe.STIMULUS, OILAsian share markets had ended mostly lower with Japan's Nikkei (N225) down 0.8 percent and shares in Australia and South Korea also off, leaving MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) down 0.25 percent.Chinese inflation data had again shown signs of weakness in the world's No. 2 economy as consumer price inflation hit a five-year low of 0.8 percent year-on-year in January.It adds to a huge global trend which is pressing central banks in many parts of the world to lower interest rates or turn to unconventional policy stimulus again.""This will likely be the low point for CPI inflation given that oil is rebounding. Still, the data will increase rate cut expectations and we see a cut in March,"" Credit Agricole senior economist in Hong Kong, Dariusz Kowalczyk, said.According to a draft communique from leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) countries meeting in Istanbul, they will pledge to act decisively on monetary and fiscal policy, if needed, to combat the risk of persistent stagnation.The United States, however, strongly underlined at the meeting that countries should not to use their currencies to try to boost exports, one U.S. Treasury official said in a thinly veiled reference to what is fast becoming a global currency war.The dollar rose 0.15 percent to 118.78 yen <USD/JPY>, having hit 119.23 on Friday in a rally triggered by robust U.S. non-farm payrolls. It was also up 0.3 percent against the top six world currencies. (DXY)Among commodities, safe-haven gold dipped and crude oil snapped three days of gains after a survey showed that U.S. commercial crude stockpiles hit a record high last week.It jumped on Monday as OPEC forecast greater demand this year than previously thought and projected less supply from countries outside the producer group.U.S. crude was down 1.3 percent at $52.45 a barrel after gaining 2.3 percent overnight. Brent was 0.6 percent lower at 57.97 percent."
424,"Feb 09, 2015 11:15PM ET",China January Inflation Hits Five-Year Low,nan,"By Reuters -(Reuters) - China's annual consumer inflation hit a five-year low in January while factory deflation deepened, underscoring persistent weakness in the economy and heaping more pressures on policymakers to step up their efforts to support growth.The risk of deflation is rising as the world's second-largest economy faces headwinds from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity, and the situation may have been worsened by falling global commodity prices, analysts say.The consumer price index rose 0.8 percent in January from December, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. That was the weakest reading since November 2009, when consumer prices rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual consumer inflation to be 1.0 percent in January, compared with 1.5 percent in December.""This will likely be the low point for CPI inflation given that oil is rebounding. Still, the data will increase rate cut expectations and we see a cut in March,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.Indeed, producer price index for January declined for the 35th consecutive time, highlighting the need for policymakers to bolster stimulus and head off the risk of deflation.The PPI declined 4.3 percent from a year earlier, as sluggish demand curbed the pricing power of companies, and marked the biggest fall since October 2009.The market had expected a 3.8 percent fall in producer prices after a drop of 3.3 percent in December.Data over the weekend showed a surprising plunge in China's imports, suggesting China'seconomy is still losing momentum despite a raft of stimulus measures. Still, the impact of holidays may have distorted the extent of the downturn.The People's Bank of China is widely expected to loosen policy further after cutting bank reserve requirements last week for the first time in over two years, seen as a mostly defensive move against capital outflows.That followed a surprise cut to benchmark interest rates in November, also the first such move in more than two years, to lower borrowing costs to support growth.The government is expected to lower its GDP target to around 7 percent this year, after posting 7.4 percent in 2014 - the slowest pace in 24 years."

426,"Feb 03, 2015 07:33PM ET",Exclusive: Rosneft raising money from Swiss trader as debt payment looms,nan,"By Gleb Gorodyankin and Dmitry ZhdannikovLONDON (Reuters) - Rosneft is raising money from Swiss trader Trafigura days before it must repay a $7 billion debt and squeezed by sanctions, industry sources said, seeking new options after a foray into the bond market fueled a devaluation of the rouble.The Kremlin-controlled firm's ability to raise debt has been severely reduced by sanctions imposed by Western powers which condemn Russia's annexation of Crimea and accuse it of orchestrating a rebellion in eastern Ukraine - a charge denied by Moscow. The squeeze has been compounded by a collapse in oil prices and the rapid devaluation of the rouble - a crisis the central bank said Rosneft contributed to when it borrowed a large sum through the local bond market in the run-up to the repayment of another $7 billion loan to Western banks in December.That added to pressure on the Russian currency due to fears the rubles might be used to buy dollars, the central bank governor said, though Rosneft has denied any link between its bond issue and rouble volatility.Now the Feb. 13 deadline for the repayment of another $7 billion loan to banks is nearing, and Rosneft is exploring alternative options including short-term financing, according to trading and oil industry sources.Sanctions ban long-term financing of Rosneft - a measure that has prompted all Western companies to pull out of any such deals with the oil major - but allow short-term financing for a period of up to 30 days. Under an existing five-year financing agreement with Trafigura which began in mid-2013, Rosneft sells 150,000-200,000 tonnes of oil a month to the trader - a deal which is allowed to continue because it was struck before sanctions were imposed.Now Rosneft has committed to sell around 500,000 tonnes of oil to the Swiss trading house in February to raise money to help repay its debt, three trading sources told Reuters.Rosneft and Trafigura declined to comment.It was unclear how much money the financing deal would involve, or how it would be structured. The delivery of 500,000 tonnes of oil would represent an increase of 300,000-350,000 tonnes - worth about $150 million at current prices - on Rosneft's usual monthly allocation to Trafigura.""It is clearly a new deal,"" said one trader, who does not work for Rosneft or Trafigura, but heard about the details of the agreement. He declined to be named because he works for a rival trading desk to Trafigura.'MASSIVELY DISAPPOINTED'As a result of the deal with Trafigura, other trading houses and companies - which have long-term deals and in some cases have already made a pre-payment to Rosneft for their volumes - will receive lower-than-expected volumes in February or not get crude on the days they expected it to arrive.""Traders (at rivals) are massively disappointed,"" one of the buyers said.Rosneft has pre-payment and long-term supply deals with Vitol, Glencore, Shell, Total, Eni, BP and Trafigura itself.Long-term deals usually define several months upfront how much oil each buyer is due to receive every month, and changing those volumes is a rather unusual move as it could force Rosneft's buyers to look elsewhere for supplies.Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said the company does not need to borrow money as it is able to service its debt from its own cash flows.The oil major raised over 600 billion rubles ($9 billion) on the bond market in December, which central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said added to pressure on the currency because the market was expecting the oil producer to buy dollars with it.Days after issuing its bond, Rosneft said it would not use the funds raised to buy foreign currency.On Dec. 16, the day after Rosneft's disclaimer, the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate by 650 basis points to 17 percent, citing the need to curb increased devaluation and inflationary risks. Hours later the rouble fell to an all-time low.On Jan. 26, Rosneft raised 400 billion rubles in the domestic bond market, also saying it would not use the funds to buy foreign currency.Rosneft's loan maturing in February is part of a larger $11.9 billion, two-year bridge loan that was signed in Feb. 2013 that backed Rosneft's acquisition of oil company TNK-BP.Lenders included BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Credit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank, Natixis, Societe Generale and UniCredit.

And if so, what does that mean for Beijing's attempts to reform its economy?The world's second-largest economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, official data showed on Tuesday, barely missing its official 7.5 percent target but still the slowest since 1990, when it was hit by sanctions in the wake of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. It expanded 7.7 percent in 2013.Fourth-quarter growth held steady at 7.3 percent from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations.Few had expected China to meet its 7.5 percent full-year target, but the performance was better than some had feared after a rough few months raised concerns the economy may be heading for a hard landing.""The country's period of miraculous break-neck growth is over, but let's get over it,"" said a commentary on the official Xinhua news service, referring to a long string of double-digit expansion.""The end of the high-speed growth era does not spell an end for China's economy.""""QUITE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT""Modest support measures from the government over the year helped stave off a more dramatic slowdown, while Beijing's tolerance of somewhat slower growth sent a message that reform remains a priority.""This is the best possible miss you could have from a messaging standpoint,"" said Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing.""The government is saying, 'we're not married to this specific target, we missed it and we're okay.' That seems to me a quite positive development.""Still, a further slowdown in China could hinder the chances of a revival in global growth in 2015, given the major role it plays, in particular for commodities and high-tech. Indeed, Polk said the GDP figure was difficult to square with other negative signs.China's property market - a major driver of demand across a range of industries - has proven stubbornly unresponsive to policy support, and lending data from the banking system shows both enduring weakness and a resurgence in the shadow banking system, which Beijing has been struggling to rein in.Policymakers also are concerned about the potential onset of a deflationary cycle, aggravated by plummeting energy prices, industrial overcapacity and sluggish demand.Systemic deflation, an economically toxic cycle in which investors and consumers hold off on fresh spending on the assumption prices will drop further in the future, could leave China in a similar condition to Japan, and is cited as a major reason why Beijing will need to put more money into the system.At the same time, there may be a looming fiscal crisis among debt-sodden local governments, which depend on land sales for most of their revenue. And more companies, especially small property developers, could flirt with default.Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said slower growth seen for 2015 reflects a welcome decision by the Chinese government to rebalance the economy away from a heavy reliance on investment and exports to a more consumption-based growth model.The IMF predicts China's economy will grow 6.8 percent in 2015, while the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists sees an expansion of around 7 percent. December data posted numerous upside surprises after a weak November. Factory output rose 7.9 percent, while retail sales rose 11.9 percent, both above market expectations.However, growth in fixed asset investment, a key growth driver, eased to 15.7 percent in the whole of 2014 from the previous year, hovering near a 13-year low.Investment growth in real estate slowed to a five-year low and new construction slumped, even as home sales improved at the end of the year.MORE EASING OR LESS?With China's growth seen cooling further this year, more support measures are still expected, though economists are divided over what tools policymakers will use and when.""The overall numbers lower the need for further stimulus, although there remains some room for easing as risks are still skewed to the downside,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.He expected the central bank to cut interest rates again in the first quarter, after a surprise move in November, and slash banks' required reserve ratio (RRR) by 100 basis points in the first half of 2015 in a bid to spur more lending.Others, however, think Beijing may have to get more aggressive, even at risk of reinflating asset bubbles, given the need to reduce debt burdens at Chinese companies which are inhibiting them from fresh investments.""I don't expect monetary policy to accelerate growth, though,"" said Wang of UBS.""Final demand in the economy is very weak and it's unlikely that the corporate sector will take this credit and invest in new projects, so containing financial risk and stabilizing growth is the trend for this year.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The lion's share of German exposure is held by the state-owned development bank KfW, with lending totaling 15 billion euros to the Greek state, the banking industry group BdB said. Commerzbank said it held around 400 million euros in exposure to Greece at the end of September, while Deutsche Bank said it held around 298 million euros in exposure to corporate, bank and public debt. Greek politics has weighed on markets including the euro as speculation intensified that Greece could leave the euro zone after a snap election on Jan. 25. A study by JP Morgan found that the French bank Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) was the most exposed of Europe's commercial banks. Credit Agricole said it had 3.5 billion euros in exposure to Greek debt at the end of 2013, none of it to state entities. France's largest bank, BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP), held around 0.7 billion euros in Greek debt at the end of 2013, according to JP Morgan. BNP declined to comment. Societe Generale (PA:SOGN) held 0.3 billion euros in exposure to Greek corporate debt and had no sovereign exposure as of end-September, a spokeswoman for the bank said. Of the total German exposure, 4.6 billion euros was to other banks, 3.6 billion to companies and private individuals, and 15.2 billion to state entities, the BdB said. ""The credit exposure of German banks in Greece is low,"" BdB head Thomas Kemmer said in a statement. ""That's why, should it come to insolvency for Greece, the direct effects on German banks could be overcome.

The result was only slightly below the 74 reading of the second quarter which was the highest since early 2012. A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive outlook.Indian businesses provided the biggest boost to the index, with companies reporting a maximum score of 100 for the third consecutive quarter as they look to new Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up economic recovery.Corporations in China, where worries about a slowdown in economic growth persist, were among the least positive with a reading of 50, coming in below Japan, which is stuck in recession, at 56.U.S. unemployment fell to a six-year low in November, a signal that the world's biggest economy and a key export destination for Asian companies is healthier and its consumers are growing in confidence.""The U.S.'s economic leadership is influencing expectations across the world, and the U.S. is really becoming stronger,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at INSEAD.""Asia is a region where there is not massive uncertainty related to political risk. This is a region that grows with the world.""The rosier picture in the United States coincided with oil prices falling to five-year lows, boosting Asian economies dependent on imports of crude.Fatas cautioned that uncertainty remained, not least in China where investors and companies are ""sitting and waiting for data"" to indicate how dramatically growth in Asia's largest economy is slowing.Global economic uncertainty remained the biggest concern for Asian businesses during the quarter, the survey showed, as well as rising costs and other risks such as regulatory change.""I am surprised that the U.S. and oil prices seem to have outweighed concerns about China and Europe. The downside risks to China's growth are significant, especially related to real estate and shadow banking,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist at Credit Agricole.Companies participating in the survey included Japanese drugs maker Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd (T:4568), South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd (KS:009540) and Indian real estate developer DLF Ltd (NS:DLF).The poll, by Thomson Reuters in association with INSEAD, a global management and business school, was conducted from Dec. 1-13.Of the 116 companies that responded, 51 percent gave a positive outlook, while 42 percent reported a neutral outlook and 7 percent were negative.AUSTRALIA, TAIWAN UP, JAPAN STAYS WEAKOil prices plunged during the quarter as supplies flooded the market while economic growth and energy demand were limited.Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said the fall was a ""big relief for many Asian manufacturing exporters"" and probably helped outweigh continued worries about the global economy.""There are still lingering risks but the risks are probably manageable. Even though global growth is disappointing, businesses are more optimistic because they see moves toward structural reforms,"" he said, referring to policy changes in India, Indonesia and China.In Australia - this year's chair of the Group of 20 major economies - companies were more positive. The country scored 85, up from 75 in the last quarter, while sentiment in Taiwan turned positive, jumping to 71 from 33.The Philippines suffered the steepest decline in optimism, with a drop to 67 from 83, while Japanese sentiment remained poor as respondents worried about the domestic economy.Positive sentiment among building firms was highest, doubling from last quarter to a one-year high of 100. This was followed by property developers with a score of 87 versus 63, and retail, which jumped to 84 from 63 to its best level since the survey began in 2009.Shipping and financial companies were the least positive.INSEAD's Fatas said the oil price fall was likely still being digested by individual Asian companies and would filter through to more positive outlooks across sectors in coming months.""My expectation is that the next quarter will be better than this one.""(Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

We think there will be 100 basis points of cuts over the next couple of quarters,"" said Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING in Singapore.The closure of many factories in northern China early in November to reduce air pollution as Asia-Pacific leaders met in Beijing likely curbed industrial output, but demand for products such as concrete and steel was also hit by slackening growth in export orders and the cooling housing market.A bright spot in November was retail sales, where growth ticked up to 11.7 percent from 11.5 percent in October, which was the slowest pace since early 2006.Analysts expect further interventions by Beijing in 2015 after top leaders at the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Thursday pledged to make fiscal policy ""more forceful"" while keeping monetary policy ""not too tight or too loose"".Economists who advise the government have recommended that China lower its economic growth target to around 7 percent in 2015.(Writing by Will Waterman; Editing by Kim Coghill)"
436,"Dec 12, 2014 01:32AM ET","China November output, investment data shows further weakness, more stimulus eyed ",nan,"By Xiaoyi Shao and Kevin Yao BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy showed further signs of fatigue in November, with factory growth slowing more than expected and investment expansion hovering near a 13-year low, putting pressure on policymakers to unveil stronger stimulus measures. A deluge of weak data this week has reinforced the view that annual economic growth may weaken further from 7.3 percent in the third quarter - already the lowest since the great financial crisis and further straining the fragile global economy. A surprise interest rate cut by China's central bank last month signaled policymakers' growing concern that the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharper slowdown that could fuel job losses and debt defaults. ""The data bodes ill for GDP growth in the fourth quarter, which is bound to slow further,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.  ""It will put pressure on policymakers to ease monetary stance again and we expect an RRR cut still in December,"" he said, referring to a reduction in banks' required reserve ratios (RRR) which would, in theory, encourage more lending.  Factory output rose 7.2 percent in November from a year earlier, slowing from October's 7.7 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.  The reading missed analysts' forecasts of 7.5 percent and marked the second lowest expansion since the depths of the global crisis in December 2008.  The closure of many factories in northern China early in November to reduce air pollution as Asia-Pacific leaders met in Beijing was no doubt partly to blame for the weaker-than-expected output. But recent surveys have also shown slackening growth in export orders while a cooling housing market is weighing on domestic demand for products from concrete to steel. Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of growth, grew 15.8 percent in the first 11 months from the same year-ago period, in line with market expectations but slowing from a 15.9 percent rise in the first 10 months and hovering near a 13-year low. Other data showed growth in real estate investment slowed to 11.9 percent in the first 11 months of 2014 from 12.4 percent in the January-October period. Highlighting overall economic sluggishness, power generation rose a scant 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the third straight month of deceleration.  Consumption was the only bright spot, with retail sales growth quickening slightly to 11.7 percent from 11.5 percent in October, which was the slowest pace since early 2006. The authorities will try to sustain a reasonable pace of growth in 2015 even though the economy faces relatively big downward pressure, top leaders said after the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Thursday. The property downturn is expected to last well into next year due to a massive inventory of unsold homes, though further price declines could ease if authorities can persuade risk-averse banks to lower mortgage rates. Data earlier this week China's trade performance faltered in November while consumer inflation hit a five-year low, stoking expectations that Beijing may move more aggressively to head off the risk of deflation. Analysts expect the central bank to cut interest rates further and lower banks' reserve requirement ratios. The government also could accept a wider 2015 budget deficit to spur spending. ""We're ready for an RRR cut at any point. We think there will be 100 basis points of cuts over the next couple of quarters,"" said Tim Condon, head of research Asia at ING in Singapore, though he sees no further interest rate cuts. Full-year growth is on track to undershoot the government's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years. Economists who advise the government have recommended that China lower its economic growth target to around 7 percent in 2015.

The departures come as the French investment bank reduces headcount and cuts costs after buying the remaining 50 percent of Newedge, one of the world's top commodities brokerages, from Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) in May. The exit of two longstanding members of Newedge's commodities team were part of broader cuts to the newly merged financial futures desk in the United States and Europe, said two sources familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said four other staff members were let go on Thursday. Societe Generale declined to comment. It was the latest sign of upheaval among commodities futures brokers as stiffer regulation increases costs and profit margins are squeezed by intense competition for business and falling fees. Newedge's smaller rival, ICAP (L:IAP), is exiting base metals broking business at the end of the year. In base metals, transaction fee hikes planned by the London Metal Exchange have also increased the financial burden on brokers, who say they will struggle to pass on the higher surcharges to clients. Turek was senior director of metals in New York, having joined in 2010. He had transferred to Societe Generale's metals desk in October. Flora was associate director of Newedge's OTC energy desk, having joined just over a decade ago, according to her Linkedin profile. Before that, she was at AIG With Newedge's metals team overlapping with SocGen, cutbacks were expected, sources said. In July, the two open outcry teams on the London Metal Exchange merged.

438,"Dec 08, 2014 05:15AM ET",Italy Downgrade Casts Gloom Over Euro Zone,nan,"By Reuters -(Reuters) - European stocks and government bonds dipped on Monday as weak data from Asia, a rating downgrade for Italy and the slump in oil prices stoked concerns about global growth.The U.S. dollar bucked the trend, extending gains after a surprisingly strong U.S. labor data on Friday, and adding further pressure on the Russian ruble which has been hurt as oil prices fall back toward five-year lows.Europe's index of top shares, the FTSEurofirst, opened down 0.4 percent, mirroring a move in Asia after China's trade performance in November was much weaker than expected while Japan's economy in the third quarter shrank even more than initially reported.The Italian bourse started the day as the worst performer before recovering, after S&P downgraded the credit rating of the euro zone's third largest economy to just one notch above junk on Friday, underscoring the limited progress made by Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.Italian government bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, shot higher, pulling up borrowing costs across the bloc.""The euphoria from Friday's U.S. payrolls is dissipating, we're seeing a bit of profit taking,"" said Pierre Martin, a trader at Saxo Bank. ""Italy's downgrade is a good reminder that Europe is far from being out of the woods.""One of ECB's longest standing policymakers said the euro zone economy was ""experiencing a massive weakening,"" a development that has pushed the central to look closer at sovereign bond purchases.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei edged up 0.1 percent with the downward revision to Japan's GDP neutralizing much of the positive impact from a weaker yen.

440,"Dec 07, 2014 11:59PM ET","China faces more pressure as November imports drop unexpectedly, exports slow",nan,"By Kevin Yao BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports shrank unexpectedly in November while export growth slowed, fuelling concerns the world's second-largest economy could be facing a sharper slowdown and adding pressure on policymakers to ramp up stimulus measures. Exports rose 4.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports dropped 6.7 percent, the biggest drop since March, data released by the General Administration of Customs showed on Monday. That left the country with a record trade surplus of $54.5 billion, which analysts say could increase upward pressure on the yuan  even as exporters are struggling.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to grow 8.2 percent, a 3.9 percent rise in imports and a trade surplus of $43.5 billion, all slowing from October. ""Despite another record surplus, the details paint a grim picture with slower export growth and a contraction in commodity imports in volume terms,"" said Andy Ji, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore. Exports have been the lone bright spot for China's economy in the last few months, perhaps helping to offset soft domestic demand, but there are doubts about the accuracy of the official numbers amid signs of a resurgence of speculative currency flows through inflated trade receipts. Dariusz Kowalczyk at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong said over-reporting in exports may have been curbed in November, which contributed to a weaker reading. But he added the import contraction was ""shocking"", reflecting not only lower commodity prices but poor domestic demand. ""This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth,"" he said. ""We expect a reserve requirement ratio cut in December, introduction of reverse repos this week, and another rate cut in the first quarter. The yuan should rise further on the data."" After saying for months that China does not need any big economic stimulus, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) surprised financial markets by lowering rates on Nov. 21 to shore up growth and help firms pay off mountains of debt. The government is due to release data on factory output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales later this week. Analysts see more policy moves in coming months if the economy continues to stumble, with many expecting both more rate cuts and reductions in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR). Sources familiar with China's policy-making said leaders are prepared to lower rates again and loosen lending curbs on concerns that falling prices could cause a spike in bad loans, business failures and job losses. ""We expect at least one more policy rate cut, 2-3 RRR cuts and targeted measures (to inject more liquidity into the banking system) throughout 2015,"" said Haibin Zhu at J.P. Morgan. 2015 GROWTH TARGET COULD BE CUT Annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest since the global financial crisis, weighed down by a sagging housing market and tighter credit conditions. Full-year growth is on track to undershoot the government's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years. China's leaders are reluctant to repeat strong stimulus similar to the one implemented during the height of the global crisis, which resulted in piles of debt, but they are mindful of the risk that a sharper growth slowdown could undermine reforms. The leadership is due to open a key meeting on Tuesday to map out economic and reform plans for 2015, including economic targets which will be unveiled in parliament next March, sources at top government think-tanks said. Government think-tanks, which make policy proposals, have urged Beijing to cut its economic growth target next year, probably to around 7 percent.

We are dealing with very low price pressures, and when that comes with weak growth, like in the euro zone, it raises concerns,"" TD Securities head of global strategy, Richard Kelly, said.Markit's final November manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the bloc was 50.1, its lowest reading since June 2013 and down from a flash reading on Nov. 19 of 50.4, despite price cutting made possible by tumbling input costs.That is barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and, in a sign that there is little prospect of improvement in December, new orders declined for a third month.The growth slowdown comes despite factories cutting prices at the steepest rate since mid-2013 although neither factor will push the ECB into altering its already very loose policy when it meets on Thursday, according to a Reuters poll. [ECB/INT]Annual inflation fell to 0.3 percent in November, firmly in the ECB's deflation ""danger zone"", and as oil sank to its lowest in over five years on Monday with the industrial bellwether copper not far behind, there are few reasons to expect any meaningful pick-up.Both U.S. crude and Brent have now fallen for five straight months, the longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis and the rout has spread to gold and silver while the dollar rose to seven-year peaks against the yen <USD/JPY>.Lower commodity prices are a boon to consumer spending power but have damaging side effects in a world where official interest rates are already at historic lows in many countries.Slowing inflation acts as an unwanted tightening of policy as it pushes up real interest rates, one reason China and Japan surprised with new stimulus measures in recent weeks.After saying for months China does not need any big economic stimulus, the central bank wrongfooted markets by lowering rates in late November.ASIAN CLOUDSMonday's gloomy news began in Asia with China's HSBC/Markit PMI touching a six-month trough of 50.0. The official version was scarcely better, slipping to 50.3 in November from October's 50.8.""This is the lowest reading since March and highlights downward pressure on China's growth in the manufacturing sector,"" Credit Agricole economist, Dariusz Kowalczyk, said.China's troubles were felt broadly across the region, with South Korea reporting exports to Asia's economic powerhouse falling for the first time in three months, while its measure of manufacturing activity stayed stuck in contractionary territory.In Indonesia, the PMI was at its lowest since the survey began in April 2011, while in Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI eased. The economy slipped into recession in the third quarter as the impact of a hike in sales taxes lingered longer than anyone expected.Still, the extent of the contraction may have been overstated, given figures out on Monday showed business investment was stronger than thought.India was a rare bright spot, as it has been for a few months now, with its PMI climbing to a 21-month high last month.British manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up a little speed as domestic demand offset falling exports from Europe and emerging markets.A PMI covering the United States, due later on Monday, is expected to show solid but slowing growth.(Editing by Louise Ireland)"

The FTSE Eurofirst index of leading European shares (FTEU3) was marginally lower, having given back some early gains.The ruble's collapse -- and the broader problems around Ukraine and lower oil prices which it reflects -- are likely to put yet more pressure on exports by European companies already struggling with very poor demand at home.With the currency battered by concerns about the conflict with Ukraine and the tit-for-tat sanctions that have resulted, Russia's central bank scaled back its support for the ruble earlier this week.Expectations the central bank might step strongly back into the market after limiting intervention to $350 million daily helped turn back the bulk of an initial 3-percent fall on Friday.

445,"Aug 03, 2014 07:37PM ET",Portugal in $6.6 billion rescue of Banco Espirito Santo,nan,"By Sergio Goncalves LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal will spend 4.9 billion euros ($6.58 billion) to rescue its largest listed bank, testing the euro zone's resilience to another banking crisis just months after Lisbon exited an international bailout. The rescue of Banco Espirito Santo, which was unveiled after a frenzied weekend of discussions between Portuguese and European Union officials, comes after weeks of increasingly bad news about the financial state of the lender, particularly its exposure to a cascade of companies headed by its founding Espirito Santo family. Under the plan, Banco Espirito Santo, or BES, will be split into a ""good bank"", renamed Novo Banco, and a ""bad bank"", which will house BES's exposures to the troubled Espirito Santo business empire, which last week tipped the bank in to a record 3.6 billion euros loss. The bad bank's losses will be born by the bank's junior bondholders and shareholders, including the Espirito Santo family, which has a 20 percent stake, and French bank Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) which owns 14.6 percent. Novo Banco, or New Bank - will be recapitalized to the tune of 4.9 billion euros by a special bank resolution fund created in 2012. The Portuguese state will lend the fund 4.4 billion euros. All of BES's depositors will be protected as well as all of the bank's senior bondholders. Portugal's central bank, which only days ago said that BES could be recapitalized by private investors, said the plan would involve no cost to the public purse because the loan would be temporary. The Bank of Portugal expects the state to be reimbursed when Novo Banco is eventually sold to private investors. ""The plan carries no risk to public finances or taxpayers,"" Carlos Costa, the central bank governor, told reporters in a late night news conference in Lisbon.  HIDDEN PROBLEMS The bailout is a setback for Portugal just months after the country emerged from a 78 billion euros, three-year bailout financed by the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Portuguese bond yields rose to 3.78 percent on Friday on expectations Lisbon would have to rescue BES. However they were still far below rates of more than 15 percent seen in 2012, when there were serious doubts whether the eurozone would be able to survive a brewing debt crisis. The rescue, which comes a year after Greece spent 28 billion euros to rescue four of its banks, suggests that despite years of efforts to improve the euro zone's financial and economic management, hidden problems still may lurk in the region's banking systems. The Portuguese government loan will use up a large chunk of the 6.4 billion euros left over from a fund earmarked to aid the country's banks as part of its EU/IMF bailout. In a statement, the European Commission said the resolution plan complied with its rules on state aid. BES's shares lost 75 percent of their value last week alone, drying up market appetite in the bank and therefore making state aid inevitable. The spin-off of the healthy parts of BES, a household name in much of Portugal, is an attempt by authorities to shield the bank from the escalating troubles of its founding family. Much of the Espirito Santo group, whose activities include tourism, health and agriculture, have sought bankruptcy protection in past weeks in a remarkable fall from grace of one of Europe's most prominent business clans. By using the bank resolution fund, Portuguese authorities hope to limit the political fallout of using taxpayer money to prop up a bank that until recently was majority owned by the Espirito Santos just as Portugal is emerging from a deep economic downturn. The scramble to save Portugal's largest-listed bank by assets comes after BES last week posted a deeper than expected 3.6 billion euro loss and said it was exposed even more deeply than originally thought to Espirito Santo companies. Notably, the bank's new management — put in place by the central bank as a result of the Espirito Santo turmoil — said it had found new, hidden commitments made by the bank to family companies as late as June. Management said it suspected illegal behavior had taken place at the lender. ($1 = 0.7450 Euros)  (Writing By Andrei Khalip; Editing by Alessandra Galloni and Carmel Crimmins) "

Washington has come down hard on European banks that have evaded their sanctions, imposing a record fine on France's BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP) last week and stoking resentment among bankers and officials at what they see as U.S. imperialism. Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest lender, is 17 percent owned by the German government, and the settlement talks could further strain ties between Berlin and Washington, already at a low ebb due to allegations that a German man had worked as a double agent for U.S. intelligence. Commerzbank is accused by U.S. authorities of transferring money through its U.S. operations on behalf of companies in Iran and Sudan and could pay at least $500 million in penalties, according to the New York Times. The newspaper said a deal could be struck as soon as this summer and could pave the way for an agreement with Deutsche Bank. "

Two other major French banks, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, and Citigroup Inc's Banamex unit in Mexico are among those being investigated for possible money laundering or sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the matter and public disclosures. The Justice Department and other U.S. authorities, including the Manhattan District Attorney, are probing Credit Agricole and Societe Generale for potentially violating U.S. economic sanctions imposed against Iran, Cuba and Sudan, one of the sources said.  Credit Agricole and SocGen have disclosed that they are reviewing whether they violated U.S. sanctions. SocGen said in its latest annual report that it is engaged in discussions with the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control over potential sanctions violations.

At the heart of this effort is a 12-prosecutor Money Laundering and Bank Integrity Unit within the Justice Department that was created in 2010. It handled the investigation into BNP for U.S. sanction law violations, primarily involving Sudan deals, as well as large money laundering and sanctions cases in recent years against HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Bank N.V. and others. Leslie Caldwell, who leads the criminal division at Justice Department, said in an interview that the unit has its sights set on a range of firms potentially involved in illicit money flows. ""I think that we'll probably see other financial institutions, regional banks, maybe some smaller banks, and I think we're also going to be seeing, as we have already started to see, more online activity,"" Caldwell said during an interview on Friday, speaking of cases in the pipeline.  She declined to name specific firms or confirm any particular investigations.   BANK SECRECY ACT Historically, prosecutors have used money laundering laws to go after low-level money mules, said Caldwell, in reference to lower level employees and others who weren't playing critical roles in instigating or allowing the money laundering. The Justice Department about five years ago decided to switch tactics and to more aggressively exploit the Bank Secrecy Act, which dates back to the 1970s, and was expanded to include criminal penalties in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The law, which requires financial institutions to have robust anti-money laundering programs, was little used for criminal prosecutions until the Money Laundering and Bank Integrity Unit - known internally as ""mlbiu"" - was created in 2010 to focus on enforcing it.  ""This is a way to attack that problem in a much bigger and more effective way,"" said Caldwell, a prosecutor for 17 years who was confirmed to her current post in May. ""The old-school way of attacking money laundering ... really didn't get at the problem, which was that many banks did not have adequate controls in place to prevent those transactions from happening.""  The shift has put the financial industry on watch, after prosecutors failed to land high-profile criminal cases stemming from the financial crisis and turned their attention to other types of criminal activity within the financial industry. Banks have responded by hiring thousands of new compliance experts and spending millions of dollars to improve their programs. ""I would put the investigation of financial institutions for laundering proceeds of official corruption pretty high on the list of risks,"" said Michael Dawson, who coordinates the global compliance practice at the consulting firm Promontory Financial Group. ""After you look at the sanctions cases, official corruption looms large as a risk on the horizon.""  MOVING DOWN THE FOOD CHAIN As the unit finishes a series of money-laundering and sanctions cases against some of the world's largest banks, prosecutors fear that criminals have shifted to using mid-level financial institutions and other types of companies who may not have the controls that large institutions now have. Sources said the unit is increasingly investigating actors across the two dozen types of companies covered by the Bank Secrecy Act. Among the sectors covered by the act are broker-dealers, jewelry and auto dealers, casinos, insurance companies, and shipping companies. The Justice Department has already gone after a handful of such institutions, including check cashers in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Los Angeles who assisted healthcare fraudsters by failing to report $50 million in transactions, and money transfer company MoneyGram whose agents were allegedly involved in $100 million in fraud schemes targeting the elderly. MoneyGram agreed to forfeit $100 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement over the conduct in November 2012. It said at that time that it takes compliance seriously and had created a new anti-fraud program.  Virtual currencies have also emerged as a major focus, in the wake of the unit's 2013 indictment of digital currency exchange Liberty Reserve, its founders and other employees who allegedly helped criminals launder more than $6 billion in proceeds.  Attorneys from the Justice Department's asset forfeiture and money laundering section, which oversees the mlbiu unit, have also worked closely with a new FBI unit to help trace the assets of corrupt foreign leaders, traveling to Ukraine to help recover assets allegedly stolen by former president Viktor Yanukovich's government.  Those efforts could also unearth information about which banks may have looked the other way to move proceeds of corruption, or may not have had required procedures in place, sources said.

 (Updates, adds quote and details)	 By Anirban Nag	 LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest in
more than a week versus the dollar on Monday, supported by a
renewed German and French pledge to unveil a comprehensive plan
by the end of the month to rescue the region from a sovereign
debt crisis.	 However, analysts said the rebound could run out of steam if
no concrete euro zone plan emerges in coming weeks, with the
risk of renewed bickering between euro zone policymakers seen as
a threat to quick decision making. 	 The euro climbed 1.6 percent to $1.3593 , pulling away
from a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit last week on trading
platform EBS, as investors unwound some of their short positions
initiated earlier.	 The single currency's rise gained steam after it rose past
stops at $1.3510, $1.3525 and above $1.3550, putting it on track
for its best daily performance since the middle of July.	 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy promised after a meeting at the weekend to present a
plan before a G20 summit early next month to shore up euro zone
banks, settle the Greek debt crisis and help growth in
Europe. 	 That gave a boost to risk sentiment and other perceived
riskier currencies like the Australian dollar. 	 The pledge was short of details, but the fact that they
agreed on a deadline for a common crisis response suggested a
major announcement is likely in the next couple of weeks.	 ""The market has taken these comments at face value but we
are a bit sceptical about interpreting from those remarks they
will be able to come with something before the G20 leaders
summit,"" said Gavin Friend, currency analyst at National
Australia Bank.	 ""The price action is more about the market playing the euro
from the short side. We have brought the rumour and now need to
see something that is tangible."" 	 Currency speculators increased their bets against the euro
last week, with net short positions at 82,697 contracts.
Analysts said readjustments of these bearish positions could
give the euro some short-term relief. 	 Euro/dollar implied volatilities fell as the spot
recovered, but risk reversals still showed the
bias towards euro downside. The three-month risk reversal was
trading at a fairly elevated level of 3.5 in favour or euro
puts.   	  SLOVAKIA VOTE 	 France, Belgium and Luxembourg agreed a rescue plan for
Dexia bank, while other French banks have come under intense
pressure because of their exposure to Greece and other weak euro
zone countries. 	 French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale
 denied a report they would seek to raise a combined 11
billion euros as part of a broader European recapitalisation
plan. 	 Despite their denials the threat of contagion and the risk
of a banking crisis remained.	 Traders will eye voting in Slovakia and Malta to ratify the
changes to the euro zone rescue fund. They are the only two euro
zone countries that still have to approve the changes, and the
vote in Slovakia is finely balanced. Any delay on passing the
legislation could hit sentiment towards the euro.	 Adding to traders' concerns for the euro, the next aid
tranche for Greece is far from being a done deal. The IMF
indicated Greece is at a crossroads and would need to implement
""much stricter structural reforms"" than seen so far.
 	 ""Short positions against the euro have been stopped out
which is why the euro has bounced,"" said Adam Myers, senior
currency strategist at Credit Agricole. ""But there are
significant risks for the euro and I will be surprised if it can
move past $1.3650.""	 The euro rose to a 4-1/2 month high against the Swiss franc
 , advancing to 1.2370 francs on EBS, on lingering
speculation that the Swiss authorities could raise the floor on
the euro/Swiss franc from 1.20 francs currently.	 The Australian dollar was up 1.7 percent at
US$0.9936, while the New Zealand dollar rose 1.6 percent to
US$0.7805 .	 The dollar was flat against the yen at 76.72 yen
while against the Swiss franc it lost 1.8 percent to trade at
0.9099 francs . All of which left the dollar index 
down more than 1 percent on a basket of currencies at 77.804.

521,"Oct 10, 2011 05:44AM ET",PRECIOUS-Gold rises 2 pct in risk rally after EU pledge,nan," * Dollar drops after euro zone plan benefits gold, commods * Gold rallies as riskier asset instead of safe haven * Paulson loses more money in Sept, seen bullish for gold * Coming up: U.S. FOMC Sept meeting minutes Wednesday
 (Recasts, updates prices, adds fresh comments) By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Gold rose 2 percent on
Monday in a risk rally with equities and commodities, as the
dollar tumbled after a renewed Franco-German pledge to
introduce a plan to resolve the euro zone's debilitating debt
crisis. Trading volume of gold futures was extremely thin due to
the U.S. Columbus Day holiday. Bullion notched its biggest one-day gain in a week, as U.S.
stock markets, oil and the euro surged following remarks by
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy to unveil a new comprehensive package to contain the
crisis by the end of October. In the past four sessions, the metal gained 3 percent as
bullion prices have moved up and down in sync with the S&P 500,
while the safe-haven buying that spurred gold's three-year
rally was largely absent. ""Gold is rallying as a commodity instead of a
flight-to-quality asset. Until that trend changes, you can get
your head ripped off trying to play the other side of it,"" said
Adam Klopfenstein, senior market strategist at futures broker
MF Global. ""Right now, the theme for gold is its positive correlation
with equities and the commodity spectrum,"" he said. Spot gold  was up 2.1 percent by $1,672.70 an ounce
by 2:26 p.m. EDT (1826 GMT). Silver  was up 2.8 percent at $32.03 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$35 at $1,670.80 an ounce. Volume was about two-thirds below its 30-day average as
banks, government offices and the bond market are shut for the
U.S. Columbus Day holiday. Even so, Monday's turnover was
sharply lagging the level on last year's Columbus Day. Jonathan Jossen, COMEX gold options floor trader, said
more options dealers are buying volatility following a recent
decline in gold option prices, indicating the price of the
underlying gold futures is due for a rally. Bullion rose about 3 percent as U.S. stocks rallied on
optimism about Europe. The S&P 500 is now more than 10 percent
above a low last Tuesday that took the index briefly into a
bear market. The 25-day log-based correlation between gold and S&P 500
was at a negative 0.05, its weakest link in three months,
Reuters data showed. (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/vuw93s )  The gold-equities correlation is on track to turn positive,
after the two were moving in tandem earlier this year. Other precious metals and commodities benefited from a 2
percent drop of the dollar against the euro, its largest
one-day decline in 15 months. [FRX/] PAULSON LOST MORE IN SEPT, SEEN BULLISH Bullion traders also said news that hedge fund manager John
Paulson lost more money in September showed the correction in
gold may have run its course. Disappointing performance at Paulson & Co suggests the firm
could have liquidated some of its gold investments to meet
margin calls amid losses in other markets back in September,
traders said. Steadier gold prices suggest the heaviest bouts of

522,"Oct 07, 2011 04:20AM ET",REFILE-European shares stay positive ahead of US jobs data,nan," (Corrects first paragraph to read ""monthly"" instead of
""weekly"")	 * FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.7 pct, Euro STOXX 50 up 0.4 pct * Both indexes testing major resistance levels * UK banks drop after Moody's credit downgrade * Valuation ratios at lowest levels since 2009
 By Blaise Robinson	 PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - European share price indexes edged
ahead on Friday, extending the past two days' sharp gains on
hopes of coordinated action in the euro zone to beef up their
banks' balance sheets and as investors bet monthly U.S. jobs
data will signal some improvement in the bigger economic
picture.	 UK banks bucked the trend, with Royal Bank of Scotland
 down 1.1 percent and Lloyds Banking Group down
2.3 percent after Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of the
two banks. 	 At 0751 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares was up 0.7 percent at 947.09 points, a level not
seen in five weeks.	 The benchmark -- which has jumped 7 percent in the past two
sessions and is on track to record a second consecutive weekly
gain -- moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time
since late July and broke above the neckline of an inverse head
and shoulders chart pattern shaped over the past five weeks,
sending a strong bullish signal for chartists. 	 ""European stock indexes as well as shares in a number of
sectors such as banking, insurance, oil, utilities and telecoms
seem to be stabilising. This is the result of extremely low
valuation,"" Cholet Dupont strategist Vincent Guenzi said.	 ""This stabilisation may be a sign of a strong rebound to
come if we get significant progress in the resolution of the
euro zone debt crisis.""  	 The sharp losses suffered by European stocks over the past
2-1/2 months have knocked valuation ratios to levels not seen
since the heat of the financial crisis in early 2009.	 The broad STOXX 600 index trades at 8.8 times
12-month forecast earnings, well below a 10-year average of 13.2
times. Wall Street's S&P 500 trades at 10.7 times
expected earnings, while the MSCI emerging markets index
 trades at 8.7 times.	 Investors brushed aside news that Moody's also downgraded
nine Portuguese banks on Friday.	 ""The downgrade was expected following the downgrade of the
country's rating,"" said Sebastien Barthelemi, credit analyst at
Louis Capital Markets, in Paris.	 ""The fact that the ECB (European Central Bank) is putting in
place unconventional measures to support the banks and provide
liquidity, and with the prospect of a coordinated plan to
recapitalise the banks, the lenders' credit default swaps have
tightened, outperforming sovereign CDS,"" he said.	 Euro zone banks led the gains on Friday, with UniCredit
 up 2.4 percent and Credit Agricole up 1.8
percent. The STOXX euro zone banking sector index has
surged 25 percent since Sept. 23.	 Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.4
percent, Germany's DAX index up 0.5 percent, and
France's CAC 40 up 0.3 percent.	 The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index
was up 0.4 percent at 2,258.74 points, testing a downward
trendline formed by Aug. 17 and Sept. 1 peaks, as well as the
neckline of an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. A clear
break above the two lines would send a short-term bullish
signal.

 By Joanne Frearson	 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday,
snapping three days of losses, after policymakers agreed to
strengthen the struggling banking sector and a
better-than-expected report on the U.S. service sector boosted
optimism about U.S. growth.	 Investor confidence improved after European finance
ministers agreed to safeguard banks as concerns about a Greek
default grew, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the
government was ready to capitalise its banks if needed.
  	 Dexia rose 1.3 percent in volume more than
three-fold its 90-day daily average after France and Belgium
prepared a rescue plan for the bank.    	 The Franco-Belgian bank had dropped as much as 38 percent in
the previous session and hit an all time low on worries about
its exposure to Greece.	 ""The market is getting a little more confident that
policymakers are more serious about tackling the problems,"" said
Richard Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments, which
has $245 billion of assets under management.  	 Other banks to feature in the top movers list were French
banks Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas , which
have exposure to euro zone sovereign debt particularly Italy.
They were up 9.9 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. 	 Credit Agricole had fallen 12.9 percent and BNP Paribas 12.7
percent in the preceding three days on worries that the debt
crisis could spark a funding squeeze.          	 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up
3.3 percent at 916.62 points. It had extended gains in the
afternoon following data which showed the U.S. services sector
expanded slightly more than expected in September.
 	 The index pushed through a key resistance level -- the 23.6
percent Fibonacci Retracement level of its July to September
sell-off at 914.55 points. The next resistance level is seen at
the 38.2 percent Fibonacci Retracement or 952.61.	 But the index is still in bear market territory and has
fallen 23.1 percent since its 2011 high in February on
expectations of slowing global growth and fears of contagion in
the euro zone debt crisis.	  DEBT WORRIES AHEAD	 A downgrade of Italian sovereign debt by ratings agency
Moody's, although no surprise, highlighted the funding risks
facing the euro zone's third biggest economy and vulnerability
of the euro zone. 	 Greece still has to convince inspectors from the IMF, EU and
the European Central Banks it can implement reforms before the
next aid tranche is released and analysts did not see
Wednesday's gains as the start of a long-term bull run.
 	 ""We've been through this (market rebound) before. In the end
this is the problem: if you recapitalise the banks without
addressing the solvency of the sovereign countries, it's a
bottomless pit ... How much money is enough? How much
recapitalisation is enough?,"" a London-based bank analyst said. 	 Batty added although it was ""helpful to see a road map"" that
could give investors a clearer expectation of what might be
ahead, he was sceptical until he saw a ""concrete plan in place""
and remained underweight European equities.

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday,
led by banks after European finance ministers agreed to
safeguard the region's lenders, and  as investors snapped up
bargains following three days of losses.	 Stocks rose across the board, with the STOXX Europe 600
Banking Index up 2.4 percent, though it is still down
more than 35 percent in 2011. Heavyweight risers included BNP
Paribas and Credit Agricole , both up 6.8
percent. 	 At 0829 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 	
European shares was up 1.6 percent at 902.24 points, having gone
as high as 907.74, after falling 2.7 percent on Tuesday. The
index has lost more than 19 percent in 2011.	 ""This rally may not last. Lots of stocks look cheap. We need
a strategy for resolving the sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone. We need s strategy to get on top of the U.S. debt
problem,"" Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley,
said.	 ""Until we get answers, the market can stay cheap. Economic
authorities in Europe have continually failed to come up with a
robust policy. Now they're in the last chance saloon.""	 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to safeguard
their banks as doubts grew about whether a planned second
bailout package for debt-laden Greece would go ahead.	 Hours earlier French-Belgian municipal lender Dexia
 became the first European bank to have to be bailed
out due to the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis. 
 	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX 	
 and France's CAC40 rose between 1.8 and 2.2
percent. 	 Italy's benchmark rose 1.2 percent, despite Moody's
lowering its rating on Italy's bonds by three notches, saying it
saw a ""material increase"" in funding risks for euro zone
countries with high levels of debt and warning that further
downgrades were possible. 	  WEAK ECONOMIC BACKDROP	 The market maintained gains despite some weak economic data.
  	 The euro zone's private sector contracted for the first time
in two years last month, shrinking faster than first reported as
new business dried up, while the debt crisis cut expectations
for the future to two-year lows, surveys showed. 	 ""The data highlights the damage that the mixed messages and
the prevarication are doing to sentiment across the euro zone,
with leaders that can't decide on a co-ordinated response to 
the crisis,""  Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets,
said. 	 The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index rose 3
percent, as copper prices rebounded. 	 Fortunes contrasted for British supermarkets. J Sainsbury
 , Britain's No.3 grocer, rose 4.3 percent after posting
an expected rise in second-quarter underlying sales, as store
extensions and growth in convenience stores, online and non-food
ranges helped it to overcome tough trading conditions.
 	 Tesco however fell 0.2 percent after posting one of
its biggest-ever falls in underlying sales 	
 	 French insurer AXA rose 4.7 percent after saying
it was fully committed to delivering its mid-term earnings
targets and its balance sheet was ""robust"" despite the market
environment. 	 Later, the ADP jobs report in the United States will give
pointers on the strength of the recovery in the world's biggest
economy.

that Greece cannot avoid default and a stronger dollar
pressured Brent to the lowest settlement in 7-1/2 months and
U.S. crude to its lowest close in 12 months. Concerns that Greek's debt crisis would spread to Europe's

than expected in September and construction spending rebounded
in August provided a brief lift. [ID:nN1E7920NX] ""Looks like the negativity from late last week and worries
that global demand for oil will be hit by another recession
outweighed the better-than-expected data,"" said Gene McGillian,

Sunday that it will miss its 2011 deficit target raised new
doubts over a planned second international bailout.

intraday to $100.71, a nearly eight-week low. U.S. November crude  fell $1.59 to settle at $77.61 a
barrel, the lowest settlement since Sept. 28, 2010. It traded
on Monday from $76.85 to $79.64. Intraday lows for both Brent and U.S. crude were the
weakest prices since Aug. 9, when Brent last fell below $100 a
barrel intraday and in the week after ratings agency S&P's
late-Friday downgrade of United States' credit rating. Brent's premium to U.S. crude  was little
changed, trading above $24 a barrel. The spread widened after
support held above $21 as the 2011 third-quarter drew to a
close last week. Trading volumes were just above the 30-day averages for
both Brent and U.S. crude on the first day of the fourth
quarter after both contracts had sharp price third-quarter
price drops. U.S. stocks fell and the S&P 500 dropped to a 13-month low

531,"Sep 30, 2011 04:08AM ET",European shares set for worst quarter since late 2008,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.5 percent * Autos, luxury lead sectoral fallers * Periphery exposed banks continue week-long bounce
 By Simon Jessop	 LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - European shares opened lower on
Friday, on track to record their worst quarterly performance
since late 2008, as markets grapple with slowing global growth
and a long-running euro zone sovereign debt crisis.	 Cyclical stocks, including those in the autos and luxury
sectors, led fallers across the region, weighed by growth
concerns and bearish broker comment, with Swiss watchmaker
Swatch leading fallers, down 4.4 percent.	 At 0740 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
European shares was down 0.5 percent at 928.41 points.	 It remains on course to record its best week in 26 months,
however, helped by a bumper week for the beaten-down financials
sector, on hopes politicians will act to limit the effects of
the debt crisis, even though it has much further still to run.	 While the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index was down 0.7
percent, the euro zone specific index rose 0.4 percent,
after lenders particularly exposed to the periphery -- heavily
sold off in recent weeks -- continued their bounce back,
including Credit Agricole , up 2.4 percent.	 ""Short-term, we still have the same prospects: the timing of
a Greek default, the nature of it, how shared or otherwise; the
uncertainty of whether the (second Greek bailout) package needs
to be revisited,"" said Philip Isherwood, head of equity
strategy, Europe and UK, at Evolution Securities.	 Mining shares , hit hard over the summer and on
course to post their worst month in a seven-month losing streak,
were lower again, as manufacturing data pointed to a gradual
slowdown in demand from top metals consumer China.
 	 Key for equities was the broader macroeconomic environment,
which even though extremely sluggish, should improve in the
fourth quarter, especially as the market had ""pretty fully""
priced in a return to recession, Isherwood said.	 As a result of the quarter's slide, the ""flight to quality""
trade had started to become overdone, suggesting a contrarian
bet on cyclicals was becoming more attractive.	 ""In price terms, high quality versus low quality is actually
getting very stretched; without a recession, I think it's been
done,"" Isherwood said.	 Analysts at UBS cut their year-end target for the
pan-European STOXX Europe 600 to 260 from 280 after
cutting earnings per share growth estimates. The index was down
0.5 percent at 227.67 points in early Friday trade.	  TECHNICALS, GAINERS 	 Chart moves pointed to a more bullish short-term outlook for
the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index,
however, with a minor double-bottom at around 1,995 as support,
said Bill McNamara, technical analyst at Charles Stanley. 	  ""It is also encouraging that the rally off the lows has
lifted the index through its short-term downtrend, and it does
look like further positive news from EU leaders could drive it
back up to its recent intermediate top at around 2,300,"" he
said.	 ""If no resistance is encountered there, then the next area
of possible resistance is at around 2,355 -- the peak on August
17 and a 50 percent retracement of the decline that began in
late July.""	 Norwegian oil major Statoil led gainers across the
region, up 4.2 percent in volume half its 90-day daily average
after less than an hour of trade, after it confirmed significant
upside potential at the Avaldsnes field operated by Lundin
Petroleum , up 23 percent.

532,"Sep 29, 2011 01:00PM ET",U.S. data and German vote lift European shares,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 ends up 0.6 pct; gets U.S. GDP, jobless
boost * German parliament support for bailout fund lifts banks * French lenders extend bounce from low levels
 By Simon Jessop	 LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday
after better-than-expected U.S. economic data eased some market
worries about slowing growth, prompting a reverse of early falls
for a number of cyclical sectors and helping the index pare
heavy third-quarter losses.	 That weak broader trend is likely to remain into year-end
for most markets, however, a Reuters poll showed, weighed by the
headwind of tepid developed market growth and the tail risk of
the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. 	 On that issue there was some brightness after the German
parliament backed plans to boost the size and remit of the euro
zone bailout fund, as agreed in July, providing a fillip for
those keen to see signs of core euro zone political unity.
 	 By the close, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
European shares was up 0.6 percent at 933.26 points. 	 It remains down 3.5 percent in September, ahead of Friday,
the last trading day of the month and quarter, and on course for
its biggest quarterly fall since the last three months of 2008.	 Portfolio rebalancing at quarter-end was also lending some
structural support to the market, a trader at a U.S. investment
bank said, as people shifted some of their allocation to
equities from bonds, after the heavy falls.	 Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims data from the
United States combined with a slight upwards revision for U.S.
second-quarter growth helped buoy the market into the Wall
Street open, although conviction was light and volume low.	 Evidence of nagging concerns over the outlook for growth
could be seen in the STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index
 , which fell 2 percent on Thursday.	 It is on course for a seventh consecutive losing month, and
September promises to be the heaviest fall in that sequence.      Key for Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at
HSBC, was how the two broad macroeconomic themes play into one
another. 	 ""If we get a resolution on the euro zone, it would make me
more confident. However, do I think this would spark a new era
of growth? No. I think that's the big question here. It's a
stop-gap, not a silver bullet to ignite global growth.	 ""A slowdown in growth is on the cards anyway so, if you
remove the euro zone troubles, you remove the most apocalyptic
of scenarios but you don't shift the overall growth outlook
necessarily to the positive side, you merely limit the
downside.""	  SENTIMENT BOOST	 While news of the successful German vote had been expected
by many -- with the euro and German Bund futures 
little moved -- banks and insurers, among the most sold-off over
the course of the debt crisis, got a sentiment boost.	 French lenders, hit hard in recent months but up sharply
this week on hopes for solid action to stem any potential Greek
default contagion to bigger peripheral peers such as Italy,
where many have deep links, were among the biggest gainers.	 Societe Generale , up 5.8 percent, Natixis
 , 6.3 percent higher, and Credit Agricole , up
4.4 percent, featured prominently in a STOXX Europe 600 Banks
index that closed up 2.5 percent.	 Simon Maughan, head of sales at MF Global, said he expected
a strong rally into year-end for financials on cheap valuations,
""slow but positive moves afoot to address what's going on in
Europe"" and an expected sharp reduction in volatility.	 ""That's correlated with a powerful rally in financials every
time it's happened since late 2007,"" he said.	 Volatility, as measured by the Euro STOXX Volatility index
 , ended Thursday down 4.2 percent at 44.44. The lower the
index the greater investor appetite for risk. In spite of the
dip, the index remains at historically high levels.	 Dan Morris, market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management,
said while European equity valuations were cheap, the broader
macroeconomic risks were such that he would not go long without
protection.	 ""I would be underweight a naked long position on European
equities. I don't think you can just buy them and then cross
your fingers. 	 ""You can buy them on a long-enough horizon as long as you
hedge that exposure a in way that, if things don't go well,
you're not going to lose everything.""	 (Editing by David Hulmes)

533,"Sep 27, 2011 06:20AM ET","PRECIOUS-Gold up nearly 1.5 pct, rebound runs out of steam",nan," * Unprecedented price rout tempts buyers back to gold * Bullion ends off highs as rally runs out of steam * Physical demand ""exceptionally strong"", says UBS * Coming up: U.S. durable goods data on Wednesday
 (Recasts, updates with comment, prices) By Frank Tang and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Gold rose almost 1.5
percent on Tuesday on a weak dollar and renewed risk appetite,
but bullion ended off highs as its recovery from the steepest
three-day drop in nearly three decades appeared to falter. Bullion gained as the U.S. stock market rallied 1 percent
and the euro rose against the dollar, fueled by optimism that
European policymakers planned to increase the region's bailout
fund to ease a debt crisis. Sharply higher crude oil and grain prices also underpinned
gold buying. Despite gold's gains, however, the metal has lost 9 percent
in the past four sessions, as a sharp margin increase on Monday
accelerated selling momentum and spurred a heavy bout of
liquidation by commodity funds, traders said. ""Over the last several days, we have gone back to the
traditional dollar positive, gold negative relationship. With
the dollar under significant pressure today, it has driven
buying back into gold,"" said David Meger, director of metals
trading at Vision Financial Markets, a futures brokerage. Spot gold  was up 1.4 percent at $1,650.19 an ounce
at 4:06 p.m. EDT (2006 GMT), sharply off a session high of
$1,676.69. U.S. gold futures  for December delivery settled up
$57.70 an ounce at $1,652.50. Trading volume was lower than in
the previous session, at about 10 percent below its 30-day
average. Silver, which dived to a 10-month low of $26.04 an ounce in
the previous session, rose as much as 9 percent to a high of
$33.48 an ounce. Spot silver  was last up 4.1 percent at $31.93 an
ounce. Bullion drew support from a weaker dollar against the euro
on efforts to boost the European Financial Stability Fund, the
region's bailout fund, even as European officials said no such
plan had been finalized.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> PHYSICAL BUYING EXCEPTIONAL Gold reclaimed its 100-day moving average at around $1,640,
following a surge in buying interest in many key consuming
nations in Asia, which pushed local premiums to their highest
since the start of the year, dealers said. Premiums for physical delivery of gold in Hong Kong and
Singapore, two major bullion trading hubs, rose to their
highest since February and local dealers reported robust demand
from retail and industrial consumers. [GOL/AS] Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar said gold's rare
correction in the last several months allowed better value for
buyers who wanted to get back into the market. ""I think gold's bottomed out here,"" he said. Swiss bank UBS said it had seen strong physical buying in
Asia, particularly No. 1 bullion consumer India, on Monday. ""To be clear, physical demand right now is not just decent,
it is exceptionally strong,"" UBS said. Gold-backed exchange-traded funds showed few signs of a
rout on Monday. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust declined some 5-1/2
tonnes but were still up 1.2 percent so far this month. Most major funds are still in positive territory for
September in percentage terms, with the iShares Gold Trust
 and ETFS' Swiss Gold fund up 0.5 percent. Platinum  was up 0.3 percent at $1,560.49 an ounce,
having fallen to a 21-month low on Monday, while palladium
 rallied 3 percent at $645.75 an ounce.

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - European shares extended a rally
to a fourth day on Friday, on optimism that policymakers may
come up with a unified action plan to tackle the euro zone debt
crisis at a finance ministers' meeting.	 However, shares in French and Italian banks were down
sharply, with some traders having cited expectations that credit
rating agency Moody's Investors Services would cut Italy's debt
rating after the market close. 	 BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole fell 7.6
and 11 percent respectively. UniCredit shed 7 percent.	 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares rose 0.6 percent to 937.85 points, its highest close in
more than a week. Over the week, the index gained 2.4 percent,
after hitting a 26-month low on Tuesday.	 Trading volumes were much higher than normal, at 161 percent
of the index's 90-day average, boosted by triple witching, with
contracts for stock index futures, stock index options and stock
options all expiring on the same day.	 Swiss bank UBS was a standout gainer, up 5.2
percent, in volumes more than three times the 30-day average,
after losing more than 10 percent on Thursday when it said it
had lost $2 billion due to unauthorised trades.	 ""On balance we've had a decent week. And the markets have
been taking the view that something positive might come out of
the meeting in Poland,"" Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head
of research at Brewin Dolphin Securities, in London, said.	 ""The markets have tested the lows, and said they're not
prepared to go beyond them. We could see the market move ahead
further."" 	 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was also attending
the meeting in Poland, and he urged euro zone ministers there to
leverage the 440 billion euro ($609 billion) bailout fund and
free more resources to ease the debt crisis. He also said they
should end ""loose talk"" about a euro zone break-up and work more
closely with the European Central Bank to tackle the debt
crisis. 	 But so far Germany and others have refused to bolster the
fund, and some analysts were sceptical a permanent answer to the
debt crisis could be hatched at the meeting. 	 Greece will likely default on its sovereign debt within a
year after it exhausts the patience of its euro zone partners,
but there is only a one-in-five chance it will leave the
17-nation euro zone as some in Germany have called for, a
Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday. 	 Other stocks on the upside included autos , which
rose 2 percent. European new car registrations increased 7.8
percent in August, data showed on Friday. 	 German heavyweights Daimler  and BMW 
rose 3.4 and 1.2 percent respectively. Daimler extended its
rally over four sessions to 14.5 percent. 	 But autos are down 19.7 percent in 2011. Banks are
down 32.9 percent. The pan-European index is down 16.4 percent.	 Investors have cut their exposure to risky assets such as
stocks following an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis, and
weak data from major economies that have sparked concern they
may go back into recession.	 On Friday, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX rose 1.2 percent and France's CAC40
 fell 0.5 percent. 	 Italy's benchmark fell 0.7 percent.	  RECESSION	 Philip Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution
Securities, said in a note that recession was already priced
into equity markets, adding: ""Many advise a flight to quality as
a way to stay invested in these volatile markets, or as a way to
re-enter these volatile markets.""  	 He said ""quality"" sectors included tobacco and
pharmaceuticals, as well as personal goods, household goods and
food producers, but that these were now looking expensive as the
""flight to quality"" had already taken off.	 Others advised caution even after this week's rally. 	 ""I would not read anything into near-term market movements.
I think they are going to remain extremely volatile and this
will not go away until Germany makes up its mind,"" said Tom
Elliot, global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.	 ""What we are seeing is a lining up of forces in favour of
stronger fiscal union and those against. We have plenty of
issues to keep volatility high and put off equity investors.""

538,"Sep 16, 2011 10:28AM ET","FOREX-Euro down after rally this week, still in downtrend",nan,"  * Geithner urges end of loose talk about euro break-up * Bank of Portugal cites unreported debts at Madeira * Funding strains, euro vols ease after cenbank move
  (Updates prices, adds quote, changes byline, dateline;
previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Friday,
as investors locked in profits after this week's rally sparked
by global central bank action to boost liquidity, and could
stay weak on any negative news coming out of an EU finance
ministers' meeting. Analysts said investors also sold the euro, pushing it to
session lows against the dollar, after the Bank of Portugal
said the Portuguese island of Madeira failed to report
information about debts from previous years that amounted to
0.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2010.
[ID:nLDE78F07C]. ""We had a pretty good run-up in euro/dollar the last couple
of days from $1.37 to $1.39 because of positive news this week.
So we've had a bit of a short squeeze,"" said Ray Attrill,
senior currency strategist, at BNP Paribas in New York. However, he added that market players remained bearish on
the euro and those expecting any new policy initiatives from
the European Union finance minister's meeting will be
disappointed. The euro was last down 0.5 percent at $1.38081 ,
off a one-week peak of $1.39370 hit on Thursday but held above
a seven-month trough below $1.35 plumbed on Monday. The euro
has gained around 1.8 percent so far this week, its best weekly
performance since the week of July 24 on trading platform EBS. It fell to a session low of $1.37530, with traders saying
it extended losses after stop-loss orders were triggered on the
break of $1.37700, with more stops at $1.37500. Overall though investors were reluctant to take large
positions ahead of the outcome of an EU meeting in Poland, at
which Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is a participant. Geithner told EU finance ministers on Friday they should
end loose talk about a euro zone break-up and work more closely
with the European Central Bank to tackle the debt crisis. He
also said Europe would not see similar global financial
coordination as there was in 2009, but that Washington would do
what it could to help. For more, see [ID:nL3E7KG0KC]. Technical charts indicated the euro could find support
around $1.3738, the 23.6 percent retracement of the fall from
$1.45500 on Aug.29 to $1.34949 on Sept.12. The euro had hit a one-week high after a coordinated move
by central banks on Thursday to provide dollars. Funding
strains, evident through the cross currency basis swap market,
which had hit some euro zone banks, including large French
banks and were impacting the euro, had appeared to be easing. The three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap
, or the relative premium for swapping euro
LIBOR for dollar LIBOR tightened to around minus 88 basis
points from on Friday, a day after the action from global
central banks. It narrowed from as wide as minus 115 basis
points on Monday. Wider spreads reflect elevated demand to borrow U.S.
dollars in the currency forward market and often supports the
greenback's spot value against the euro In the options market euro/dollar month implied vols -
measure of investor demand to protect against spot price
volatility - were steady around 14.20 percent and off this
week's high of around 18 percent . FED EASING EYED While investors remain wary of the euro, they are also
reluctance to take long positions in the dollar ahead of a
Federal Reserve meeting next week, where policymakers may flag
another round of quantitative easing to boost the economy. That move should weigh on the dollar and help riskier
assets rally, although analysts said some market players
thought ""Operation Twist"" was the more likely outcome. In such a scenario the Fed would buy longer dated Treasury
bonds and sell shorter dated ones to keep rates at the longer
end lower without expanding the balance sheet. Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London
said the ""Operation Twist"" could be positive for the dollar
because it would stimulate growth. ""It would be seen as
delivering stimulus without printing....dollars."" The ICE Futures' dollar index was last up 0.4 percent at
76.551 . Against the yen, the dollar remained stuck at
76.730 yen , flat on the day. The threat of Japanese
intervention has helped keep dollar/yen in a tight range and
above its all-time low of 75.94 yen.

 By Joanne Frearson	 LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European shares rose on
Wednesday on hopes a plan by European Commission president Jose
Manuel Barroso for the introduction of common euro zone bonds
would help ease the sovereign debt crisis.	 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares closed up 1.4 percent at 913.22 points in choppy trading.	 Barroso said Europe was facing its most serious challenge
for a generation, adding there was no simple solution. A ruling
by Germany's top court last week made it nearly impossible for
the government to pool debt with  partners, unless the European
Union treaty was changed.  	 ""The market might want to have a relief rally every now and
again, but structurally we still have lots of challenges,"" said
Bill Dinning, head of strategy at Kames Capital, which has $77
billion of assets under management.    	 ""Euro bonds makes sense, but implies a level of fiscal unity
in Europe that could be a bit of a challenge, given the ongoing
debate amongst policymakers.""	 The next focus to see if euro zone policymakers are one step
closer to finding a solution to the crisis is a conference call
between French, German and Greek leaders amid growing talk
Greece will default. 	  ""Markets are not really looking at fundamentals any more.
They are just reading the lips of politicians. The markets will
take hints from ongoing debate about an orderly default of
Greece,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief investment officer at Octopus
Investments, which manages $3.9 billion. 	 French banks featured among the worst performers list after
Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of Credit Agricole
 and Societe Generale by one notch, due to
their exposure to Greek debt. 	 Societe Generale ended down 2.9 percent after earlier being
more than 10 percent lower and BNP Paribas lost 3.9
percent, to be the worst performers on the French CAC .	 Finmeccanica topped the best performers list,
jumping 16.9 percent in volume nearly fourfold its 90-day daily
average volume after a media report that General Electric 
was interested in buying its Ansaldo STS unit.	  GROWTH SLOWING	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index is still down 18 percent since
late July amid fears about a slowdown in global growth.	 A Reuters poll found a one in three chance of the United
States, the euro zone and Britain falling into recession.
 	 These regions were also not expected to raise interest rates
until 2013 and there was a 40 percent chance the Bank of England
would restart its bond-buying programme.         The next resistance level for the FTSEurofirst 300 was seen
at 918, the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from its March 2009
low to February 2011 high, while support was seen at 853.69 or
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement.

 By Tricia Wright	 LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 share
index rose on Wednesday after comments from European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso promising new moves to alleviate
the euro zone debt crisis, as investors awaited talks between
Greece, France and Germany.	 Barroso said the Commission will soon present options for
the introduction of euro area bonds, though he warned financial
markets would only trust that the euro zone can resolve the
crisis when it shows that it can deliver on its commitments. 
 	 The index was up 82.97 points, or 1.6 percent, at 5,257.22
by 1127 GMT, having gained 0.9 percent on Tuesday.	 Investors awaited a conference call on Wednesday by Greek
Prime Minister George Papandreou with French President Nicolas
Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, although traders
merely anticipated further rhetoric.	 ""I suspect expectations are riding high that we will see a
rabbit pulled from a hat at the... meeting later today,"" Darren
Sinden, senior sales trader at Silverwind Securities, said.	 China and the United States have urged Europe's leaders to
prevent the euro area debt mess from spreading, underlining the
international alarm over a crisis now threatening Italy, the
zone's third-biggest economy. 	 This came as Citigroup economists argued that a Greek exit
from the euro area should be avoided at all costs, cautioning
that it would result in ""a crisis for the world"".	 Andrew Bell, chief executive of the 1.1 billion pound Witan
Investment Trust, reckoned Europe will in fact ""get a grip on""
the Greek situation.	 ""A combination of ECB buying bonds, unquestioning provision
of liquidity to the banking sector and a weaker euro (all of
which are likely to happen) look to be key ingredients in
restoring confidence,"" he said.	 ""Markets might become impatient at Europe taking another few
weeks to sort out something so urgent but equity markets look
more likely to rally on any positive developments than to fall
significantly simply because of a delay.""	 Banks , normally the most sensitive to the
twists in the euro zone debt story, found favour, led higher by
Royal Bank of Scotland , up 6.4 percent, while Barclays
 added 3.8 percent.	 The sector had initially come under pressure after Moody's
Investors Service downgraded credit ratings on Credit Agricole
 and Societe Generale by one notch, as
expected, citing their exposure to the Greek economy.	 Bargain-hunting was behind much of the buying seen in the
market, with beaten-down energy stocks and miners
 in demand on Wednesday despite weaker crude 
and metals prices.	 BP rose more than 4 percent and was among the top
FTSE 100 gainers after a report fuelled hopes a U.S. probe into
the U.S. Gulf oil spill would spread the blame, thereby limiting
BP's liabilities.	 A London-based trader said a report in the Wall Street
Journal, citing a person who had seen the keenly awaited report
into the probe, was fuelling the gains.	 Analysts have said the report could be a catalyst for BP's
recovery as it would enable investors to assess whether BP will
be found grossly negligent -- something on which tens of
billions of dollars worth of fines and penalties hinge.	 Next grabbed the top spot on the blue-chip leader
board, up 6.8 percent, as Britain's second-biggest fashion
retailer raised its full-year profit guidance after posting an
8.5 percent rise in its first-half profit.  	Sentiment in the sector was aided by the news. Kingfisher
 , ahead of results on Thursday, added 4.5 percent, while
Marks & Spencer firmed 3 percent.	 ""On a valuation basis again we are seeing some buying into
risk with banks and miners (among top risers) and with positive
news from Next this morning we are seeing buying back into
retail given the recent sell-off in that sector,"" director of
Trading Equities & Derivatives at Guardian Stockbrokers, said.	 U.S. stock index futures    pointed to a
mixed opening on Wall Street on Wednesday, ahead of producer
price index, retail sales and business inventories data.

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European shares rose on
Wednesday, as the European Commission said it was presenting
options for euro area bonds, with some investors optimistic that
this was an important step in addressing the euro zone debt
crisis. 	 EC President Jose Manuel Barroso told the European
Parliament that some of these could be implemented within the
terms of the current European treaty, whereas others would
require treaty changes. 	 Common bonds would be likely to lower borrowing costs of the
region's peripheral economies. 	 ""It would help in showing some positive firm action in
addressing the issues, which we've seen a complete lack of,""
said David Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Brothers, which has
15.2 billion pounds under management.	 ""I hold about 20 percent cash in my total return fund -- I
won't be using that cash until I see some decisive action from
the European area. If tomorrow they announced that all bonds
were going to be (common) euro bonds, rather than from
individual countries, I'd change my mind.""	 At 1125 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares was up 1.4 percent at 913.19 points after
falling to a low of 892.01 earlier in a choppy session.	 The index rose 1.1 percent on Tuesday, but is down 18.6
percent in 2011. Investors have cut their exposure to risky
assets such as stocks following an escalation of the euro zone
debt crisis, and weak data from major economies that have
sparked concern they may go back into recession.	 Coombs said common bonds would help boost market confidence
as they would be a key step in a strategy of greater fiscal
union. 	 Greek banks rose 5.1 percent. British banks RBS
 and Lloyds , affected by the euro zone crisis
though Britain does not use the single currency, rose 6.8 and
3.8 percent respectively, 	 However, French banks were mostly lower after Moody's
Investors Service cut the credit ratings of Credit Agricole SA
 and Societe Generale , citing their exposure
to Greece's debt. 	 SocGen fell 3.4 percent, though Credit Agricole rose 3.8
percent. 	 BNP Paribas fell 3.4 percent after it announced
plan to sell 70 billion euros of risk-weighted assets to help
ease mounting investor fears about French bank leverage and
funding.  	 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index is down more than
35 percent in 2011. 	 Other sectors to rise included autos , up 4.3
percent. The sector, which includes German heavyweights such as
BMW , up 5.1 percent, has fallen sharply in the recent
downturn, as economic confidence has waned. 	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.6 percent,
Germany's DAX rose 2.4 percent and France's CAC40
 rose 1.8 percent. 	  BP RISES	 Among individual companies, BP rose 4.5 percent after
a report fuelled hopes a U.S. probe into the Macondo oil spill
will spread the blame for the spill, thereby limiting BP's
liabilities. 	 Economic news was mostly downbeat. The number of British
people without a job on the ILO measure rose by 80,000 in the
three months to July to 2.51 million, the biggest quarterly rise
since August 2009. 	 Analysts said the euro zone debt issues meant investors
should stay cautious.	 The region's debt crisis, which has the potential to derail
global economic recovery, prompted the United States to urge
European leaders to take more effective coordinated fiscal
policy measures, while China said rich economies should show
they are serious about tackling the euro zone debt problem.	 ""A lack of leadership is really a matter of concern for the
market. A lot of worries are now focussed on Germany in terms of
splits there on how to deal with the region's debt crisis,"" said
Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.	 ""Valuations are low, but the problem is that they are
dependent on future earnings . The concern is that if
we have a deteriorating economic backdrop, the earnings outlook
could also deteriorate. Stocks could be cheaper tomorrow.""	 According to Thomson Reuters Datastream, the STOXX Europe
600 index carried a 12-month forward price-to-earnings
ratio of 8.3, against a 10-year average of 13.2.	 Analysts said they were not optimistic that much would come
from a conference call by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou
on Wednesday with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel.

 TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Wednesday,
back towards a seven-month low plumbed this week, with risk
sentiment that was shaky ahead of debt talks between Greece,
France and Germany further knocked by Australian inflation data.	 Alarm over euro zone's debt has reached new highs and on
Tuesday Italy was forced to offer the highest interest on 5-year
paper since it joined the euro in 1999. 	 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3622 , giving up
earlier modest gains which had been made on short-covering by
hedge funds after news of the teleconference between the three
European countries emerged. 	 ""The conference call will at least calm nerves ... and may
provide 24 hours of reprieve. That's about it, though,"" said
Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac. ""There are
plenty of road bumps (ahead).""    	 The euro has dropped more than nine cents, or 6 percent, in
two weeks from a high of around $1.4548 on Aug. 29, hitting a
seven month trough on Monday at $1.3495.	 The Australian dollar tumbled around one cent to $1.0215
 after a downward adjustment to second-quarter inflation
added to the case against higher rates while a break of key
support triggered heavy selling from macro funds.
 	 The move weighed heavily on other riskier assets, with
strong selling also emerging in other Asian currencies such as
the Korean won which tumbled more than two percent, while the 
Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit both fell around one
percent.	 ""People are taking profits from whatever assets they have
profits to take on. If they start to sell Asian stocks, that'll
be pretty nasty,"" said a Japanese bank trader.	 The fall in the Aussie accelerated after it slipped below
major support at $1.0247, the 61.8 percent retracement of its
rally last month, and at one point it dropped to a one month low
of $1.0210.  	 ""It all started from the Aussie, spilled to stocks and in a
typical 'risk-off' fashion weighed on the euro,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking, adding
that with more political events ahead, traders were reluctant to
offload further.	 In a measure of the alarm in Washington, Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner will take the unprecedented step of attending a
meeting of EU finance ministers in Poland on Friday. It will be
his second trip to Europe in a week after he met his main EU
counterparts at a G7 meeting last weekend.	
 FRENCH BANKS' RATINGS CUT 	 With the euro's sharp decline in the past two weeks,
investors have been pricing in the growing prospect of a Greek
default, as well as a likely Italian sovereign rating cut by
Moody's.	 They have already priced in a rating cut to the top French
banks, with the euro holding steady after Moody's downgraded
ratings on Credit Agricole SA and Societe Generale SA by one
notch, citing their exposure to the Greek economy. 	 Comments from China's Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday that
China is willing to invest more in European countries failed to
inspire a new bounce for the euro. This week it rose after a
news report, later denied by Italian officials, that China had
been asked to purchase large chunks of Italian debt.
 	 Some in the market are now hoping for progress on at least
the next tranche of aid for Greece, which would put off a
default, at least for now. 	 Support for the euro is seen at $1.3557 and $1.3495, while
resistance lies at its 100-week moving average at $1.3738. A
break above that could test a key barrier at around $1.3900, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its $1.4550/$1.3494 move.	 The fall in dollar's major crosses, pushed the dollar index
 to 77.28, after a 0.6 percent drop on Tuesday. Against
the yen, the dollar slipped to 76.86 yen , but remained
within the snug 76.40/77.85 range of the last three weeks.	 Investors have been wary of a possible intervention by Japan
to weaken its currency, following Switzerland's lead last month.
The yen has been the primary beneficiary of safe-haven flows
after the Swiss National Bank took aggressive actions to halt
the rise of its currency.	 Figures on U.S. producer prices and retail sales are due
later in the day, along with industrial production data in
Europe.
