1,"May 12, 2019 01:01AM ET",From Pork to Pampers: Where Inflation Is Showing Signs of Life,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- From pork in China to iron ore in Brazil, inflation is flickering in parts of the global economy.While overall price growth remains largely subdued, the emergence of costlier items will encourage those who say it’s only a matter of time before inflation accelerates due to robust economic growth and tight labor markets.For now, higher commodity prices rather than surging demand is a key factor. Upcoming earnings from the world’s biggest retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and from  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) will shed light on how consumers are faring.Here’s a look at some current hot spots.Supersized Inflation?Meat prices are starting to climb. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. is raising its forecast for food costs in the U.S. this year as protein prices start to tick up following the African swine fever in Asia. In the last quarter, restaurant menu prices were up about 2% in the U.S., McDonald’s said last month. Brewhouse chain BJ’s Restaurants Inc. said it’s expecting higher pork prices, while China’s KFC operator Yum China Holdings Inc. said surging poultry costs will weigh down margins for the rest of the year.Pork ShockEvents in China are behind the jump in pork prices. An unprecedented outbreak of African swine fever has hammered the supply of pork. With stocks of pigs back at 2011 levels the government has warned that pork prices may climb 70%. The spillover effects will be noticeable.Iron OreKeep an eye on steel prices. Iron ore has rallied after supplies in Brazil and Australia were hit by disruptions, potentially setting the stage for benchmark prices to extend gains toward $100 a ton.Consumer StaplesProcter & Gamble Co. (purveyor of Pampers), and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB). (the maker of Huggies) have raised prices as have Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. Europe’s consumer-goods giants Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) are also showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies at higher prices. In April  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) forecast higher milk prices this year.OilOil prices have slid since hitting a yearly high in April, but they are still up around a third this year and a volatile geopolitical backdrop means the outlook remains uncertain. Speculation that Saudi Arabia and other producers will pump more to make up for lost Iranian barrels has helped curb the price gains. Still, economists say the cost of crude remains an issue to watch, especially for nations that rely on imported oil.U.S. Jobs MarketU.S. employment costs enjoyed the strongest gains for the start of any year in the past decade. That’s the third consecutive year in which the annual pace of growth in the first quarter accelerated from the previous year, a clear sign labor costs are increasing, according to Bloomberg Economics.Here’s their chart on the Employment Cost Index:Emerging PressuresA suite of emerging economies are all experiencing high inflation. Turkey’s consumer prices rose 19.5% in April from a year earlier, while economists project inflation will average 40% in Argentina in 2019. Iran’s inflation could average 50% this year, the highest since 1980, a senior International Monetary Fund official told Bloomberg News. Topping the list is strife-torn Venezuela, where prices are tipped to rise 8 million percent this year."
2,"Apr 18, 2019 05:00AM ET",Nestle and Unilever Raise Prices Without Stunting Growth,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s consumer-goods giants are showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies, even at higher prices.Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) surprised investors with strong starts to the year, reporting first-quarter sales growth that handily topped analysts’ estimates. The Swiss maker of KitKat bars and the Anglo-Dutch owner of Dove soap each cited a combination of improved pricing and higher volumes.Unilever rose as much as 3.6 percent in Amsterdam as Nestle traded as much as 1.3 percent higher in Zurich.The companies delivered a counterpoint to the cost-cut-driven performance of U.S. rival Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co., which has slumped since a profit warning and asset write-down in February -- about two years after it made an unsuccessful approach to take over Unilever. Instead, the European multinationals joined U.S. peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. in selling more of their products. The companies also successfully passed higher raw-materials costs on to consumers.At Nestle, for example, the pricing gain of 1.2 percent was the biggest in 10 quarters. The businesses most hit by inflation included bottled water, with higher oil prices making plastic and transport more expensive. Unilever also noted higher costs of petrochemicals such as linear alkylbenzene, an ingredient in biodegradable detergents, along with increased prices for raw materials in the food sector.On Wednesday,  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) forecast milk-price inflation in high single digits this year, plus more expensive sugar and fruit. While sugar prices have risen over the past year, other commodities such as cocoa and coffee have fallen.“What companies like ourselves face is the impact of the input-costs increases and commodity-driven gains on the ground,” Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said by phone. PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said earlier this week that the drinks and snacks giant expects commodity inflation to increase over the rest of the year.While Europe and Japan are suffering from stubbornly low price increases or even deflation, higher rates of inflation are popping up in places like Turkey and Argentina. Moroccan consumers have held an informal boycott of Danone products via social media over the past year to protest what consumers see as unfair prices.While managing to raise prices, Nestle and Unilever also benefited by expanding into new areas as their old-line brands stagnate. Sales in Unilever’s home-care division, which grew at about twice the pace of the group figure, were driven in part by more eco-conscious products under the company’s Seventh Generation and Omo laundry brands. Acquisitions the Anglo-Dutch company has made since 2015 collectively grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter.Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has signed $14 billion of deals in 2018. The food giant has also been trying to fix or sell underperformers, with a sale for its Herta lunch-meat unit possibly coming by midyear and its dermatological business by year-end.Beating EstimatesNestle’s revenue climbed 3.4 percent on an organic basis in the first quarter, as Schneider beat the 2.8 percent analyst consensus by the biggest margin since he started leading the world’s largest food company in 2017.At Unilever, underlying sales rose 3.1 percent in the quarter. As with Nestle, analysts had expected 2.8 percent.A smaller consumer-focused company,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) SA, joined in the optimism on Thursday. While it missed sales-growth estimates for its fiscal third quarter, the French distiller raised its forecast for full-year growth in operating profit to about 8 percent from a range of 6 percent to 8 percent.(Updates with shares in third paragraph, inflation examples in fifth paragraph.)"

8,"Jan 18, 2019 07:53AM ET",Elliott-target Pernod pledges to further improve governance,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the family-backed French spirits group under pressure from activist investor Elliott, will continue to improve its governance, it pledged on Friday. The statement to Reuters followed news reports the company was likely to make board changes, a move Jefferies analysts said would be an ""early win"" for Elliott. Pernod is due to hold a board meeting on Jan. 23.Elliott, which has become more active in Europe in recent years, said in December it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) to build a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod. Elliott has called on Pernod to raise profit margins and improve governance.In particular, it believes Pernod's 14-member board needs to be more diverse and have more independent voices, as many directors are linked to the Ricard family. Elliott does not have a board seat.So far, the two camps have described contacts, including one on Jan. 15, as cordial and constructive.A Pernod spokesman said on Friday that while ""we have not needed any external input as regards our continuous drive to seek to improve our governance,... we will continue, at the appropriate moment, to announce further changes, once they have been proposed, discussed and adopted by the board and its committee."" On Thursday, BFM Business reported that Pernod, which owns Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, planned to reshuffle its board in the coming weeks, with vice-chairman and former Pernod CEO Pierre Pringuet among those who could step down.Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard, who has already hired three independent directors and beefed up board expertise, is expected to present his new three-year strategy later this year, though some analysts expect Pernod to give some direction on margins alongside first-half earnings on Feb. 7.There are, however, doubts that Elliott can change much as the Ricard family controls 15 percent of Pernod's shares and 21 percent of voting rights, while long-time investor GBL owns a 7.5 percent stake and has said its supports the firm's strategy.The French state also warned in December it wanted ""big French companies to have stable and long-term shareholders"" and not to be ""subject to pressure from shareholders who want short-term profitability.""One unknown is why Elliott is so far taking a less confrontational approach with Pernod than with some other investments. Sources familiar with the activist's thinking say Elliott could be testing a new template for negotiations with other French companies.France is famous for protecting its companies against foreign takeovers. In 2005, it rushed to the support of food giant  Danone  (PA:DANO) in the face of a rumored bid from PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP), which never actually materialized.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

18,"Oct 18, 2018 08:10AM ET","Price increases underpin sales growth at Nestle, Unilever",nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc), two of the world's biggest consumer goods makers, both reported a pick-up in quarterly sales on Thursday after getting higher prices for their products. The increased cost of oil, as well as a strengthening of the US dollar, in which many commodities are priced, has given makers of food and toiletries greater scope to push through price rises in an inflationary environment.This is a change from earlier this year, when pricing was steady and the likes of Unilever and Nestle had to rely almost entirely on selling more goods to drive revenue growth. Unilever -- the Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap which dropped plans to move to the Netherlands this month after British investors rebelled - said it expects more price rises to come through in the fourth quarter, which could weigh on demand.""We do think that with the higher levels of pricing that are going to be required we will see a rebalancing toward more price and a little less volume going forward,"" Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly told analysts.Consumer goods companies need to carefully balance prices and demand, ensuring that customers remain loyal to their brands and don't defect to cheaper or own-label supermarket products. For the full year, Unilever's sales growth is likely to come towards the bottom end of its 3 to 5 percent target range, Pitkethly said, adding it could be a bit higher than the most pessimistic forecasts.Nestle stood by its full-year forecast for sales up 3 percent, after third-quarter sales accelerated, helped by higher pricing. But its results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, were largely overshadowed by news that Wan Ling Martello, its Asia chief, was leaving. Nestle shares were up 0.3 percent in morning trade, while Unilever shares were down 1.3 percent. Unilever did not give an update on its latest thinking about simplifying its dual-headed structure after it abandoned its plans in the face of an investor backlash. MARKET BY MARKETNestle, the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee, said third-quarter sales rose 2.9 percent in the third quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the second. That included a 0.9 percent boost from pricing increases, up from 0.2 percent in the second and first quarters. Nestle has warned about higher freight and packaging costs, whereas Unilever noted crude oil, chemicals and the impact of the strengthening US dollar.Unilever reported a 3.8 percent rise in third-quarter sales, excluding steep price increases in Argentina to offset soaring inflation there. Including Argentina, sales would have been up 4.5 percent, which was ahead of analysts' forecasts for 4.3 percent. Unilever got a 1.4 percent lift from pricing, up from 0.2 percent in the first half.U.S. rival Procter & Gamble is due to report its latest quarterly figures on Friday. Unilever's Pitkethly said pricing decisions were taken market by market, and that Unilever has products at various price points to satisfy people who need to trade down to cheaper brands as prices rise.Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood said Unilever's growth was higher than Nestle and  Danone  (PA:DANO), which reported on Wednesday.""This more balanced growth was pleasing and the acceleration in pricing may diminish worries from some investors about pricing power,"" he said in a research note.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

20,"Oct 17, 2018 04:59AM ET",European shares seek footing as earnings roll in; autos down,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - European shares inched higher on Wednesday led by technology stocks, as some upbeat earning updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML buoyed sentiment following a turbulent start to the month.Investors however remained cautious after the region's equities hit a 22-month low last week when jitters over rising U.S. bond yields, geopolitical worries and signs of an economic slowdown rattled global markets.After hitting a one-week high in opening deals, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index pared some gains and was up only 0.1 percent by 0827 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) index turned negative, weighed by losses in the trade-exposed auto sector, which fell 1.2 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it viewed the third quarter as a challenging time for the industry. Disappointing results from Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) also weighed.""We still have a lot of uncertainty... The situation is certainly not brilliant but probably not as bad as feared a few days ago,"" said Gerhard Schwarz, Head of Equity & Cross Asset Strategy at Baader Bank in Munich.""We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift,"" he said. ASML (AS:ASML) shares rose 5.9 percent after the Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings, easing worries over a slowdown in the semiconductor market. ING analysts called the results ""a very comforting update"". The company said demand for memory and logic chips remains healthy and it expects further growth in 2019. That helped to lift shares in other tech companies and sent their sectoral index (SX8P) up 1.8 percent.Among top gainers following results were also UK publisher  Pearson  (L:PSON) and paints maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO), both up around 3 percent, while drugs giant Roche (S:ROG) was flat after a modest sales beat in the third quarter. Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) sank 15 percent after the German dialysis specialist cut its 2018 sales and profit targets following a poor performance at its US business. Yoghurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) also disappointed. Its shares fell 3.5 percent after quarterly sales growth slowed sharply, reflecting falling sales of its infant formula products in China and troubles from a consumer boycott in Morocco.In autos, shares in  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) fell between 2.3 and 1 percent.Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES data, as analysts have been downgrading their forecasts. Euro zone earnings growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

23,"Sep 03, 2018 12:30PM ET",Danone CEO to sit on Carrefour's healthy food advisory committee,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Europe's largest retailer, said on Monday that the head of yogurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) will sit on a food advisory committee the supermarket group is setting up as it seeks to boost sales of organic products.Carrefour said in January it would revamp its food range and focus more on organic food as customers demand healthier products, under a global five-year plan to increase group sales and profits.""The group's ambition is to lead the food transition ... This is a big challenge. We absolutely must prove our new positioning to the customer through very strong, precise and coherent actions,"" CEO Alexandre Bompard told journalists on Monday.The new food advisory committee will be led by Carrefour's Group Secretary General Laurent Vallée, who in January was tasked to spearhead food transformation across the Carrefour group.It will include seven people from outside the group including a French chef, a farmer, a cancer researcher, as well as Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber, who has said he wants the world's biggest yogurt maker to play a central role in the revolution sweeping the global food industry.As more consumers, notably the “Millennial” generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, retailers as well as large consumer goods group such as Danone or rival Nestle (S:NESN), have been seeking to adapt.Danone bought U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave in a $12.5 billion deal, bringing the company more into line with healthier eating trends and its boss will part of a committee that shares best practices and ideas with Carrefour.Carrefour's five-year overhaul announced in January also entails cutting costs, boosting E-commerce investment and expansion into convenience stores in the face of fierce competition from more agile rivals like Leclerc, and challenges from online retail giants like Amazon (O:AMZN).Under the plan, Carrefour, which is France's top organic food retailer, targets 5 billion euros in organic food sales by 2022, compared to 1.2 billion generated in 2017.""Changing lifestyle habits, an increasing focus on health and food quality as well as growing distrust of the food industry in the wake of recent health scandals is propelling fresh and organic food sales higher in France, allowing retailers to benefit from higher prices and strengthen their earnings and margins, amidst a fiercely competitive environment,"" Vincent Gusdorf, senior analyst at Moody's said in a recent note.In 2017 organic food sales in France rose 17 percent to 8.4 billion euros from 2016, according to organic food agency Agence Bio.Carrefour also on Monday unveiled Act For Food, a worldwide program to educate customers about its initiatives to tackle issues such as food safety, product origin and relationships with farmers.In July, Carrefour bought So.Bio, specialized in the distribution of organic products, with revenue of nearly 40 million euros. So.Bio currently has eight stores in South West France. Carrefour will open three new So.Bio stores by early 2019, including one in Paris and one in Toulouse.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

24,"Aug 09, 2018 06:50AM ET",Stock investors rediscover defensives before trade war deadlines,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - The risk of trade barriers and slowing global business activity has kept the European equity market in check this year.That, however, has been a boon for shares in companies such as drug-makers and consumer staples that are less dependent on the economic cycle and which investors say could provide a shelter should trade tensions between Washington and Beijing blow up.After over a year of neglect, fund managers began in the second quarter to pour money back into firms such as yoghurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO), food giant Nestle (S:NESN), drugmakers  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and Roche (S:ROG), as well as tobacco giant BAT (L:BATS) and the maker of Durex condoms  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB). In some cases they have turned a blind eye to challenges facing some of these companies because their compelling valuations and resilience to any trade-related economic downturn was an incentive to re-engage.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates a full-blown trade war would wipe 0.8 percentage points off global GDP growth. ""We are slightly more invested in defensive sectors also in relation to the risk of a trade war,"" said Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Prime Partners.He said his firm had bought Danone shares a few months ago and had some drugmakers as strategic assets. He added that they had invested in these companies, betting on their growth potential and not purely because they are defensive. Europe's equity market is barely in the black in 2018 but while sectors such as autos, which are highly dependent on global trade, have been a drag, defensives have filled the gap. The move started when U.S. President Donald Trump said in March he would introduce import tariffs on steel and aluminum, stoking fears of a global trade war. It then continued at the start of the summer in the run-up to a series of key deadlines for the United States to decide on planned protectionist moves.""Investors in European equity have become familiar with the theme of a return of leadership of defensive stocks,"" wrote Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts last week when he upgraded European personal & household sector to overweight.A key date on investors' radars is Sept. 5 when a comment period on Trump's plan to tax $200 billion of Chinese imports expires, paving the way for a decision in the following weeks. Analysts also expect Washington to decide on possible auto import tariffs in October. These deadlines are fuelling expectations there will be no exception this year to August being a traditionally turbulent month for markets. ""The defensive bias should remain apparent through August into September,"" Potts said. Graphic on defensives vs cyclicals: https://reut.rs/2OjVwBQ""HIGH-PROFILE POKER GAME""Defensives have been a very popular trade during the long years of easy monetary policy in Europe that squeezed rates to zero, boosting their appeal as cash flow machines paying steady dividends to their shareholders.But when in the second half of 2016 an economic recovery in Europe gathered pace, defensives started to lose ground to stocks more tied to the business cycle. Their decline continued throughout the ""euroboom"" year of 2017 but the tide appeared to turn once again when Trump kicked off the trade war.Much of how the revival will pan out will depend on whether the United States and China will be able to find an agreement or there is a trade war escalation.""Is Trump just playing this very clever high-profile poker game with the Chinese. Will he back down and reach some sort of compromise?"" said David Hussey, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. He said stocks like Reckitt - which he described as a ""textbook example"" of the fortunes of income paying companies - or tobacco firms were ""interesting"" investments earlier this year because of cheap valuations. ""They've (tobacco firms) been awful performers for a variety of reasons. But when you get to valuations which ... assume the business disappears in 10 to 12 years, that's just not realistic,"" he said.The defensive stocks' rally this year has filled a valuation gap versus cyclicals and fund managers such as Hussey and Schupp but also Federico Trabucco at Kairos Parnters in Milan say they are ready to tweak their holdings in turbulent markets.Some strategists recommend that clients keep some extra cash ready. While defensives have legs to gain further in a less valuation-oriented move, a big rebound in cyclicals cannot be ruled out, depending on the trade talks' outcome.Beyond the tariff noise, however, the global economy continues to tick along well and corporate earnings growth is stellar in the United States and strong in Europe.""I've lifted my exposure to defensives as a tactical move. But if the trade clouds clear in September/October, you must be ready to turn around your portfolio,"" said Trabucco.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Jul 03, 2018 02:59PM ET","Nestle, Hershey at odds with farmers over U.S. GMO labeling",nan,"By Chris PrenticeNEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's top food companies and farmers of crops such as beet sugar are pitted against each other as they lobby the U.S. government over plans to label genetically engineered ingredients.At the heart of the issue is transparency over ingredients used in food. Packaged foods makers are facing flagging consumer trust and stagnating demand for some core products as consumers opt for foods with simpler ingredient lists. Many food companies want the government to require manufacturers to include on labels all ingredients that have been genetically modified, known as GMO. But farmers want the labels to exclude ingredients that have been so refined and processed that they no longer contain any trace of the transformed genes when they are used for food.GMO crops have had their genes altered using biotechnology.Nestle (S:NESN), the world's largest food maker, and rivals including  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) and  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) want the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include on the label ingredients from crops that were genetically modified such as canola and soybean oils and sugar from beets.The USDA has asked for feedback on a proposal for required labeling of genetically engineered ingredients after a battle over the issue in states including Vermont sparked the U.S. Congress to pass legislation. The USDA has proposed a plan for applying the law. The deadline for public comment is July 3.For farmers, facing a GMO backlash from consumers, the fact that the ingredients no longer contain transformed genes by the time they make their way into chocolates, pasta sauce and cereal should mean they are excluded from the labeling.""The law has been very clear that the required disclosure is going to be for those crops or ingredients that contain the genetic material,"" said Luther Markwart, head of the American Sugar Beets Association in Washington. The entire U.S. sugar-beet crops is genetically engineered.""For things like sugar and other refined products that don't contain the genetic material, the law does not apply to us,"" Markwart said.But Nestle, which makes Stouffer's frozen prepared foods and Lean Cuisine frozen entrees, and Hershey, whose confections include Reese's Peanut Butter cups, disagree.""Consumers want to know what is in their food and beverages and we believe that they deserve transparency. It's at the core of our business,"" Nestle spokeswoman Kate Shaw said in an emailed statement, noting the company believes those highly refined ingredients should fall under the requirements.Hershey's global head of scientific and regulatory affairs, Martin Slayne, said labeling these ingredients is both important for consistency as well as for ""meeting consumer expectations on transparency.""The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which helped lead many of the food company efforts to prevent state labeling initiatives, said in prepared comments on Tuesday that excluding refined ingredients would result in 78 percent fewer products being disclosed under the federal law.About 90 percent of U.S. corn, soybean and beet sugar crops are bioengineered, the trade group noted. Unlike other regions, the United States has embraced the technology.For farmers of sugar beet in states such as Michigan, North Dakota and Idaho, the herbicide-tolerant seeds have boosted yields and profits, and curbed some of the uncertainty of farming. But many Americans have said they want to know more about what is in their food, including whether bioengineered seeds have been used.Should the USDA not require those ingredients be labeled as genetically engineered, the onus would be on food companies to decide how to label them. That could heighten tension between the companies and their ingredient suppliers.How a food manufacturer chooses to label bioengineered ingredients that do not fall under the scope of the government requirements could be susceptible to challenge.""We don't have any problem with transparency, but there’s been a lot of misinformation out there,"" Markwart said. ""The challenge is there's not a lot of space"" on a label.GMO labeling has caused rifts between farmers and foodmakers in the past. In late 2016, a coalition of farmers criticized Dannon Co for marketing non-GMO products after the U.S. subsidiary of  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) made moves to overhaul its supply chain to reduce the use of the biotechnology in its yogurt products. The farmers said Dannon's advertising misled consumers.The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, agrees with the farmers that their finished ingredients are no different scientifically from their non-GMO counterparts, but said the products should still require labeling.""USDA should read the statute broadly and provide consumers with as much information as possible, but it should be scientifically accurate,"" said Gregory Jaffe, director of the center's Project on Biotechnology. ""They need a different disclosure for those highly refined ingredients.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said he expects new launches, including yogurt with high protein and less sugar, to boost sales in 2019.As the company's yogurt sales continue to fall, General Mills has relied on cereals and snack business to help prop up its top line. For 2019, the company expects total organic net sales to be in the range of flat to up 1 percent in 2019. Including the impact of it acquisition of pet food snacks maker Blue Buffalo, net sales are expected to rise 9 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier.Net earnings attributable to the company fell 13.4 percent to $354.4 million.Excluding certain items, General Mills earned 79 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2 percent to $3.89 billion, in line with analysts estimate. Gross margins for the quarter rose to 36.5 percent from 34.7 percent a year earlier.""We were pleased to see profit margins improve from a year ago as cost savings and increased sales of products with higher profit margins more than offset headwinds from higher transportation and input costs,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Centrale Danone has about 6,000 people on its payroll.The boycott, launched on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in April, has slashed the company's sales and on Monday it said it expects a loss of 150 million dirhams in the six months ending June 30, down from a profit of 56 million dirhams in the same period a year ago.Last week, Centrale Danone said it would cut by 30 percent the amount of milk it collects from 120,000 farmers and lay off workers on short-term contracts, estimated by a government minister at 1,000 people. Other companies targeted by the boycott have declined to comment.The protest against prices set by large groups linked to a business and political elite, or foreign brands was directed at Centrale Danone, Afriquia fuel stations, owned by the Akwa group of billionaire agriculture minister Aziz Akhanouch, and the Sidi Ali water brand. “Centrale Danone's factories are now running at half their production capacity because of the boycott,” said Hassan Rouicheq of the CDT labor Union. “This augurs ill for the company, the workers and the farmers who supply.”The government has called for the boycott to end, voicing concern that it may discourage foreign investors and undermine the domestic dairy sector.Protests over poverty and corruption this year and in 2017 in impoverished regions of Morocco have been described as the most intense since the 2011 unrest that prompted King Mohammed VI to devolve some of his powers to an elected parliament.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

36,"May 24, 2018 03:40AM ET",Nestle streamlines R&D to speed up product innovation,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Food giant Nestle (S:NESN) plans to combine its scientific research operations into a single unit in an attempt to speed up development of new products at a time when competition from smaller rivals is intensifying.The world's biggest packaged food maker, with brands including Nescafe coffee and Perrier water, has been struggling with slowing sales growth for years. Now it is also under pressure from activist shareholder Daniel Loeb to increase investor returns.To better compete, the Swiss company told Reuters it would merge its Nestle Research Center and Nestle Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS) into one organization called Nestle Research.The new entity, to be announced later on Thursday, will continue to be based in Lausanne, Switzerland and will employ around 800 people.The reorganization, effective July 1, will not involve job cuts or the closure of facilities, a spokesman said.By linking the ""blue-sky"" research done at NIHS with the more commercially focused Research Center, it hopes to accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into marketable products.It also hopes this will help it compete with smaller, nimbler rivals who have been eating away at the market share of Nestle and other big firms like  Danone  (PA:DANO),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) and Kellogg (N:K).Nestle Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer acknowledged earlier this month that his company had to keep pace with rising demand for goods that are organic, gluten-free or vegan.""Big trends are embraced by smaller companies a bit more actively than the big companies,"" Palzer told Reuters before Nestle's streamlining plans had been finalised.""We are adjusting our portfolio, doing many innovations and renovations to make the portfolio more relevant and to address those trends, but smaller companies are more agile.""In the United States - the world's biggest packaged food market - small challenger brands could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time, up from about 5 percent last year, Bernstein Research predicted last year.SPEEDING THINGS UPThe combination of research units is the latest move by Palzer aimed at speeding up development and ensuring research efforts are commercially viable.Palzer, who took over Nestle's innovation and research and development operations in January, is also supplementing long-term research projects with incremental product launches made faster by experimenting with new ideas more quickly.Last month, for example, Palzer and colleagues got the idea for a vegetarian or vegan food product while on a business trip.""Thursday we had an idea, Friday we returned to Switzerland and Monday evening I was able to taste the first prototype,"" Palzer said. ""Wednesday, this prototype was shown to the executive board, and Friday it was in the global pipeline.""He declined to give more details of the product, except to say it is currently being assessed by the operations team to see how long it will take to produce and on what machinery. Other steps include efforts to apply specific developments to more products, such as Nestle's recent designer sugar crystals launched in low-sugar Milkybars in March, which will go into other products in the future.The importance of agility was underlined by Nestle's recent struggle to capitalize on resurgent demand for frozen foods.The company says it reformulates one third of its product portfolio every year.LACK OF IDEAS CAN BE COSTLYNestle spent 1.72 billion Swiss francs ($1.73 billion) on R&D last year, down slightly from 2016 but up 22 percent from 2012. The company's sales fell 2.6 percent over the same period.As a percentage of sales, its expenditure has fluctuated only a little, but demands on the unit have increased. Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst John Baumgartner said that across 10 large publicly traded U.S. food companies, median expenses for R&D and advertising have declined 20 percent over the past five years.""As voids of ideas and marketing have emerged, start-ups have been more responsive to consumer needs, won the culture and created the emotional connections that drive sales,"" he said in a recent note.Palzer said some industry peers had been outsourcing innovation to cut costs, relying on acquisitions of small brands or partnerships with suppliers.But he said it was critical for Nestle to maintain scientific expertise in-house to keep its own portfolio fresh and to be an attractive partner for collaboration with others. Nestle does R&D around the world, involving around 5,000 people.Fundamental scientific research will remain key at Nestle, Palzer said, but he also highlighted the value of external partnerships and acquisitions that can bring in new research or capabilities more easily. Scientific research and innovation itself is not necessarily the reason why big breakthroughs tend to be rare for multinational companies, said Shaun Browne, investment banker at Houlihan Lokey, who advises food companies on deals. ""They often don't have the patience or passion that is really required,"" Browne said. ""Often these things are one individual who is just totally determined and passionate about their product and sees it through."" ($1 = 0.9943 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"Apr 18, 2018 05:14AM ET",European shares advance as earnings season gathers pace,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - European shares firmed on Wednesday, supported by well-received company results as the focus turned from international politics to the first-quarter earnings season. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.2 percent by 0852 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) ticked 0.1 percent higher. A rise among more cyclical sectors, such as materials and financials, contributed the most to gains.Company updates were broadly rewarded with a bounce in shares, as French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) rose 3.4 percent after its first-quarter sales beat forecasts on the back of strong demand for baby food in China.Private healthcare provider Mediclinic (L:MDCM) rose around 5 percent after a full-year update, while Dutch oil and chemical storage company  Vopak  (AS:VOPA) gained 4 percent after saying it has the potential to improve earnings significantly in 2019.Russian precious metals miner  Polymetal  (L:POLYP), whose shares have been hit by concerns over U.S. sanctions, was the biggest gainer after saying that its first-quarter revenue rose 19 percent year-on-year.While the European first-quarter earnings season is not expected to be quite as stellar as the U.S., year-on-year earnings growth for MSCI EMU (European Economic and Monetary Union) is expected to be around 16 percent in dollar terms, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.""(The earnings season) is going pretty well in Europe, just not quite at the same pace as the U.S. ... the U.S. are just a couple of steps ahead in terms of their movement through the economic cycle,"" Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said.""We're looking actually at the next set of few quarters of growth, earnings acceleration probably, whereas in the U.S. ... the growth is probably going in the other direction,"" Lawler added. Aside from earnings, deal-making was not far from the action after British property company  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) withdrew its recommendation that shareholders back a merger with smaller rival  Intu Properties  (L:INTUP).""Retail businesses are already struggling with higher business rates as well as declining footfall so today’s news that Hammerson is pulling out of its ... bid for its rival Intu Properties is quite a sensible move,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.Shares in Hammerson rose 3 percent, while Intu Properties fell more than 4 percent, placing it among the worst-performing stocks on the STOXX 600. Last week France's  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) walked away from a bid for Hammerson, saying that the British firm failed to provide ""meaningful engagement"" over a potential deal.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit comes as Dannon, a White Plains-based unit of France's  Danone  SA (PA:DANO), tries to recapture sales from Chobani, whose Greek yogurt has made it the top-selling brand in a shrinking $8.8 billion U.S. yogurt market.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against using stolen materials.Dannon alleged that Muyshondt began preparing for a possible move in August, after attending a seminar featuring Chobani's chief operating officer.Dannon said he later forwarded details about the company's business plans to a personal email account, downloaded thousands of files, and swapped a SIM card that may have contained contact information for colleagues and customers out of a company-issued iPhone.Dannon said the stolen information included non-compete agreements for some employees and email addresses for all Dannon employees connected with sales teams Muyshondt oversaw.""It is inevitable that he will disclose the misappropriated information to Chobani, his new employer,"" Dannon said.""It would be virtually impossible for Muyshondt to occupy a high-level sales position at a direct competitor of Dannon without relying on the confidential and proprietary information he gained while employed in the same capacity by Dannon,"" it added.The case is Dannon Co v Muyshondt, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01567.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

50,"Jan 24, 2018 09:42AM ET",Unilever and consumer rivals raise bets on Nigeria,nan,"By Alexis AkwagyiramLAGOS (Reuters) - With Africa's most populous country out of recession, and the wider region on the path to growth, the world's consumer goods companies are looking to cash in. Last month,  Unilever  opened a $12 million Blue Band margarine factory in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ogun so that it does not have to import margarine from Ghana, as it has in recent years. It is also in talks with suppliers to switch to a locally-sourced flavoring agent for its toothpaste. These are examples of how the Anglo-Dutch group, like its global rivals, has been forced to adapt its business to cope with a central bank decision to restrict access to foreign currency for the import of certain products since 2015 to boost the economy.Another way Unilever (L:ULVR) is tailoring its operations to the local market is by offering smaller pack sizes of a range of products, from tea to stock cubes, to appeal to more customers in a country and region plagued by poverty and inequality.Shops in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos sell packets containing just two Unilever-produced tea bags or two stock cubes, for example. ""These are all packs that we use to gain penetration and to develop the market,"" said Yaw Nsarkoh, managing director of Unilever Nigeria.But again, the firm is not alone in such tactics; the same shops stock Nestle (S:NESN) cereals ranging in size from 50 grams to 250 grams and 1 kilogram.Britain's PZ Cussons (L:PZC) meanwhile has rolled out a range of small pack sizes over the last three years for products from soap and detergent to milk and vegetable oil. ""They have been popular and the biggest contributor in sales to each brand,"" said Christos Giannopoulos, CEO of the company's Nigerian business.How best to navigate the African consumer market is on the agenda to be discussed by corporate leaders at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos this week.The potential prize is alluring. It helps explains why these companies, plus the likes of Procter & Gamble (N:PG),  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Danone  (PA:DANO), have long operated in Nigeria and are willing to go to some lengths to build brands and market share.The market is huge: Nigeria has about 190 million people, and that is expected to rise to 300 million by 2030 and 400 million by 2050, according to U.N. data, which would make it the world's third most populous country after China and India. Companies are positioning themselves in the expectation that low household spending will rise as the economy grows and people come out of poverty and become consumers of packaged goods.""If you look at the per capita consumption levels and the penetration levels of consumer categories in Nigeria generally, they are below many comparable markets,"" said Nsarkoh, pointing to India as an example. EMERGING FROM DOWNTURNBut Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa has not been the mecca some envisioned. A continent-wide downturn since 2014, tied to low commodity prices, has dampened hopes for companies. Net earnings of 28 consumer companies in nine African countries have grown just 2 percent per year in local currency in the five years to 2016, and even less in dollar terms, according to Exotix, an emerging markets-focused financial services firm. But Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer, last year emerged from its first recession in 25 years which was largely caused by low crude prices. The World Bank sees the country's economy growing from 1 percent in 2017 to 2.5 percent this year.   Sub-Saharan Africa's economy is meanwhile projected to pick up this year, with the World Bank predicting growth of 3.2 percent in 2018 and 3.5 percent in 2019, up from 2.4 percent in 2017, due to firmer commodity prices.In Nigeria, doing business has been particularly tough since 2015, when the foreign exchange curbs and the devaluation of the naira currency meant the cost of importing certain goods, which the government wanted to be grown locally, increased markedly.However Unilever Nigeria's financial results suggest that some of the tactics adopted to counter this may be paying off. Its operating profit almost tripled to 9.2 billion naira ($30.1 million) in the first nine months of 2017, the latest figures available, after growing 25 percent in 2016. Before that, profits were flat in 2015 and fell 40 percent in 2014.Fola Abimbola, an analyst at Nigerian bank FCMB, credited the latest profit rise to price increases, taken to offset the impact of currency devaluation, as well as the use of smaller pack sizes. ""All of these companies have been selling smaller packs because, during the recession, people have less money to spend. People opt for smaller packs,"" said Abimbola.The use of smaller packaging is not new in emerging markets, but industry experts say that in Sub-Saharan Africa, it has not yet been widely adopted beyond the beer industry, and expect it to catch on further in coming years. MAIZE, MILLET, PALM OILUnilever's Nsarkoh said 90 percent of its Nigerian goods were now manufactured locally, up from 80 percent about three years ago, to make its business more resilient. As well as margarine, locally-made products include soap, tea and toothpaste.    In a sprawling manufacturing plant in the bustling Ikeja district of Lagos, for example, Unilever workers clad in white lab coats oversee production lines capable of producing hundreds of tubes of Close-Up toothpaste a minute.     Among rivals, Swiss group Nestle said that 41,600 local farmers suppled maize, soybean, sorghum and millet to its Nigerian factories. It said 82 percent of its inputs were sourced locally and that it aimed to extend to 100 percent where possible. It cited Golden Morn cereal, made from maize farmed in the northwestern state of Kaduna, as a product in which the goal had been achieved.     PZ Cussons meanwhile has a stake in a 26,000-hectare palm oil plantation in the state of Cross River. Half of its vegetable oil is made using local palm oil, said Giannopoulos.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

54,"Nov 24, 2017 10:00AM ET",P&G and Nestle Stand to Gain From China's Lower Import Taxes ,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s new plan to slash import taxes on a wide range of consumer goods promises to boost the prospects of multinationals in the Chinese market, with everything from Procter & Gamble Company’s (NYSE:PG) diapers to  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc’s whiskey becoming more affordable to local consumers.Tariffs for 187 product categories will drop from an average 17.3 percent to 7.7 percent after the cut takes effect on Dec. 1, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Friday, citing the need to help consumers access quality and specialty products that aren’t widely produced locally.The new policy follows President Xi Jinping’s call at the October Communist Party conclave to meet citizens’ demands for improved living standards and better quality products in the world’s largest consumer market. Foreign multinationals stand to benefit as middle-class shoppers seek out goods stamped with foreign brands, while the cuts also encourage consumers to spend at home rather than on trips overseas.“It’s aimed at three things: helping boost consumption in China, reforming the Chinese economy by continuing to open it up, and sending a signal to the world and particularly to the U.S. that it is committed to advancing global trade,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney.Nestle GainsTariffs for some types of baby formula were cut to zero, triggering losses in Chinese dairy stocks. Shares climbed, meanwhile, for European food and beverage companies.The moves will help companies like  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) that compete with local brands in the large market for infant formula. That industry will see sales increase about 15 percent to 123 billion yuan ($18.7 billion) in China by 2020, according to a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). report in October. Chinese parents worried about a series of food-safety scandals often favor foreign brands.“This is very good news for Nestle, and excellent news for its infant milk formula,” said Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG. “It’s a win-win situation for both consumers and high-quality global consumer-goods companies.”Nestle generated some 7.3 percent of revenue in the Greater China region last year, with sales of 6.5 billion francs ($6.6 billion). Nestle is the market leader in China’s $21.5 billion baby-food market with a 17 percent share, followed by Danone with a 9.3 percent share, according to Euromonitor International.Local ProductionStill, big consumer-product companies emphasized that many of the wares they sell to Chinese consumers are made in the country.“We welcome the new measures, although imports only make up a very small portion of our business in China,” Veronica Sze, a Nestle spokeswoman, said by email. “Over 95 percent of all products we sell are made in China.”Nestle shares gained as much as 0.8 percent on Friday, while Danone rose 1.8 percent. More broadly, food and beverage companies climbed the most among industries in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.Among other foreign companies poised to benefit is Procter & Gamble, which gets 8 percent of its sales from Greater China. P&G, the owner of brands such as Crest, Gillette and Tide, may get a lift from cuts to items including diapers and personal-care products. For instance, the tariff on electric toothbrushes will fall from 30 percent to 10 percent.“While P&G products are largely designed for Chinese consumers and manufactured in China, this will allow Chinese consumers even more access to our latest global innovations where there is a strong local consumer demand and need,” P&G’s Rene Co said in an email.Diageo also welcomed the move, which will lead to more Chinese consuming Scotch whiskey, according to spokesman Chen Ye.The CSI 300 Consumer Staples Index fell as much as 2.6 percent on Friday, led by Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd (SS:600887) and food companies Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co Ltd (SZ:000895) and Muyuan Foodstuff Co Ltd (SZ:002714) The gauge has plunged 6.1 percent this week, the most since January 2016.“China is trying to encourage more foreign companies to sell locally and wants to give consumers more choice,” said Matthew Crabbe, Mintel International Group Ltd.’s director of Asia-Pacific research. “What it will do is help foreign products already within the market get more competitive.”Robust consumption is an increasingly important stabilizer for the world’s second largest economy, as it shifts away from an investment- and export-led growth model. Domestic consumption contributed 64.5 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2017, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Items in Friday’s list of tariff cuts are part of broader categories of consumer goods that made up around 30 percent of China’s total imports in 2016, according to Bloomberg calculations. China’s retail sales totaled more than $5 trillion last year.Bolstering ImportsChina has faced criticism for not doing enough to bolster imports, a move that would help balance the trade surpluses that it runs with a raft of other countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has long complained that China engages in unfair trade practices and has pledged to close the trade deficit with China, the U.S.’s largest.Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said this month that a range of measures to open domestic markets will be taken to support demand for imports, a move that could help narrow the $327 billion trade gap with the U.S.“It is unlikely to move the needle much on the trade balance but it is still a small, solid step forward,"" said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen. “China is moving to a consumption economy and with so much cross-border commerce streaming in across these product segments, they are under pressure to lower tariffs.”Taxes for a range of medicines, including various antibiotics and insulin products, were lowered to 2 percent from as much as 6 percent, potentially a big win for multinational drug companies such as  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Novartis  AG (SIX:NOVN) that import many of their drugs into the country. China’s medical imports stood at $22 billion in the first 10 months of 2017, according to latest data from the General Administration of Customs.The biggest reduction came for vermouth or similar alcohol, from 65 percent to 14 percent, according to the statement. Whiskey tariffs were cut to 5 percent from 10 percent.China will host its first-ever import fair in November next year, and will roll out tax, fiscal and administrative initiatives aimed at helping foreign firms sell more into what is becoming a big and sophisticated consumer market, Zhong said earlier this month."

Germany's Social Democrats said that they were ready to hold talks with other parties on breaking the political deadlock. ""The German political crisis is not really looking very crisis-like,"" Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said in a note.""It is all very orderly and, frankly, a little dull.""Though corporate news was sparse, shares in consumer staples firms were in focus after China said that it would cut import tariffs on some consumer products. Shares in  Danone  (PA:DANO) rose 1.1 percent, while  Diageo  (L:DGE) advanced 0.6 percent. Europe's food and beverages index (SX3P) was among the sectoral gainers, up 0.2 percent.Banks (SX7P) were also strong, up 0.9 percent with Italian lenders topping the index.Shares in Banco BPM (MI:BAMI), BPER Banca (MI:EMII) and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) were suspended from trading after rising more than 5 percent, following media reports that two European banking directives were in the works in Brussels looking to introduce looser rules around bad loan disposals.More broadly investors have been focusing on the brightening economic picture in Europe, which is expected to support the bloc's equities going forward.Thursday's Euro zone PMI data showed that business growth gathered pace as the year draws to a close, further buoying sentiment, while growth rates for the bloc have outpaced its peers.Furthermore, German business confidence rose unexpectedly in November to an all-time high.Europe's STOXX 600 has gained 7 percent so far this year, recouping last year's losses while Germany's DAX is up more than 13 percent and France's CAC (FCHI) has risen nearly 11 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The investment in Kona Deep, for an undisclosed sum, is the fifth in a year for Danone Manifesto Ventures, a fund the French food giant set up last year to invest in entrepreneurial companies, which are eating away at the dominance of big brands.Kona Deep sources its water from a deep ocean current off the coast of Hawaii. The two-year-old company says its water has a unique blend of naturally occurring electrolytes and minerals that make it extra-hydrating. Danone (PA:DANO), the world's No. 3 bottled water company, is one of nine food giants to set up such a fund recently.A case of 12 1-litre bottles of Kona Deep can be found online for $33, nearly triple the price of a case of Evian.After being pumped through a pipe that reaches 3,000 feet below the ocean's surface, Kona Deep desalinates the water using reverse osmosis, and bottles it.Danone did not give details about the environmental impact of the process, but said on Tuesday ocean water was a renewable source and that Kona Deep sources it in a ""responsible and sustainable manner."" Kona Deep can benefit from Danone's experience with eco-friendly packaging and community management, it added.Danone is taking a minority stake as part of Kona Deep's $5.5 million capital raising effort, which also includes private equity firm Grand Crossing Capital and local Hawaiian investors. The brand has recently expanded from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland and plans to use the funds to expand distribution and production capacity.($1 = 0.8520 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

59,"Oct 20, 2017 03:40PM ET",Nestle CEO praised by Third Point but hedge fund still wants more,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Svea Herbst-BaylissLONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Nine months into leading the world's biggest packaged food company, Nestle SA (S:NESN) Chief Executive Mark Schneider got a tentative thumbs-up from a prominent investor, who praised his early steps on Friday but said there was more work to be done.Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, whose firm Third Point made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle in June, told his clients that he was pleased but not satisfied in a letter viewed by Reuters.Loeb commended how the new CEO had shifted the tone, saying Schneider ""has set a new course for Nestle"" but ""there is much more opportunity to unlock value.""Nestle declined to comment.The positive review suggested Schneider, a German who moved to Switzerland to become Nestle's first external leader in nearly a century, was for now safe from an activist-inspired challenge. Such showdowns at large U.S. corporations have cost eight CEOs their jobs this year.Third Point was especially complimentary about Schneider's presentation at an investor seminar in London last month, saying it showed ""a new approach of greater investor responsiveness.""Loeb was at the meeting but kept a low profile, without asking questions of the CEO or answering journalists' questions on the sidelines. However, there have been plenty of private conversations, with frequent phone calls between New York and Vevey, a person familiar with them said.By staying in the background, for now, Loeb is giving Schneider time to steer Europe's most valuable company through its weakest growth in more than two decades, as consumers ditch processed foods for fresher, healthier options.That may not last forever. Loeb's sharply worded letters to CEOs are legendary and he has agitated for ousters of leaders at companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and Sotheby's (N:BID). This year alone, CEOs at  General Electric  Co (N:GE), Pandora, Tiffany & Co (N:TIF),  Buffalo Wild Wings Inc  (O:BWLD) and CSX Corp (O:CSX) lost their jobs amid pressure from other activist investors.Third Point spelled out its demands for Nestle months ago and reiterated them in Friday's letter: specific margin targets, a faster pace of share buybacks, a reshaped portfolio and the sale of Nestle's stake in cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Schneider has delivered on some of those goals.Nestle - home to Gerber baby food, Kit Kat bars and Nespresso coffee - set a margin target for the first time last month, following similar moves from rivals  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and  Danone  SA (PA:DANO).Nestle has also been buying back stock nearly every day since the September meeting as part of a $21 billion repurchase plan, and is selling its U.S. confectionery business and buying niche brand Blue Bottle.On Third Point's wish list is a sale of the 23 percent stake Nestle owns in French cosmetics company L'Oreal. When L'Oreal's heiress Liliane Bettencourt died last month, speculation mounted about the companies' future relationship, which dates back 40 years. Separately on Friday, L'Oreal Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said he foresaw no changes in the company's shareholding in the near future.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Oct 19, 2017 03:57AM ET",Nestle accelerates restructuring as sales growth stays tepid,nan,"By Silke Koltrowitz and John RevillZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss food giant Nestle (S:NESN) expects organic sales growth to stay muted in the fourth quarter and is speeding up its restructuring program as it seeks to improve profit margins.Makers of packaged foods are under pressure to review their business models and brand portfolios to satisfy consumers' appetite for fresh, healthy, local foods, while at the same time improving returns to address increasingly vocal activist investors.The maker of KitKat chocolate bars said on Thursday it expected its 2017 operating margin to slip by 0.4 to 0.6 percentage points as restructuring costs could reach 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion), double the initial plan, while maintaining guidance for overall charges of up to 2.5 billion francs until 2020.It said, however, that its underlying trading operating margin, which strips out restructuring costs, was set to improve by at least 0.2 percentage points in constant currency this year.Under pressure from activist investor Third Point to improve near-term returns, Nestle last month set a target for this margin to reach 17.5-18.5 percent by 2020, up from 16.0 percent in 2016.Organic sales growth accelerated to 3.1 percent in the third quarter from 2.3 percent in the first and 2.4 percent in the second, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts, helped by improved trading in Europe and Asia.Nestle, also known for Nescafe instant coffee and Gerber baby food, said it expected organic growth for the full year to be in line with the 2.6 percent seen in the nine-month period, implying a slowdown in the fourth quarter from 2.9 percent in the year-ago period.Chief Finance Officer Francois-Xavier Roger told reporters this was also due to seasonal factors such as the leap year last year and the timing of the Chinese New Year, with expected underlying growth in the final quarter ""closer to 3 percent"".He cautioned that the Europe, Middle East and North Africa zone and Asia might not be able to repeat the good performance over the final three months.Roger confirmed Nestle's goal of returning to mid-single-digit organic growth by 2020, citing a turnaround at its Chinese Yinlu business and a strategic review of its U.S. candy business that would likely be completed by the end of the year.Chief Executive Mark Schneider said last month about 10 percent of the group's more than $90 billion in group sales could be under review. Nestle shares, up almost 15 percent this year, were down 0.5 percent at 0752 GMT, broadly in line with the European sector (SX3P). ""The stock has been strong year to date, but we see nothing in this reporting to push it further,"" Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood wrote. He said the Americas lagged expectations and nutrition disappointed compared to Danone's ""fantastic performance"". Danone  (PA:DANO) reported a 4.7 percent rise in underlying third-quarter sales, helped by strong baby food sales in China. Peer  Unilever  (AS:UNc) (L:ULVR) reported a 2.6 percent rise in underlying quarterly sales, blaming poor weather in Europe and natural disasters in the Americas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Oct 18, 2017 05:50AM ET",Danone board to meet Wednesday over management issues: source,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Danone's (PA:DANO) board will meet on Wednesday afternoon to discuss senior management issues, said a source close to the matter who declined to give further details, amid media reports that its chairman will stand down.French newspaper Le Monde reported on Tuesday that chairman Franck Riboud, 61, would stand down and hand over to chief executive Emmanuel Faber, 53, who will become both chairman and CEO.  Danone  declined to comment on the report. Danone, the world's largest yoghurt maker, is the latest consumer goods company to come under investor pressure to improve results and needs to deliver on profit margins and sales growth targets it recently set.Riboud, who took over from his late father Antoine in 1996, handed the CEO role to Faber in 2014 to prepare his succession at a time when Danone was facing weak sales and criticism from U.S. activist investor Nelson Pelz.Riboud stayed on as chairman and took on some further responsibilities such as focusing on the group's long-term strategy, but those roles were expected to end sometime this year.Le Monde said Riboud would hand full responsibility for Danone to Faber, who is increasingly focusing Danone on health-oriented products.On Tuesday, Danone beat third-quarter sales forecasts, driven by a strong rise in baby milk formula in China.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Oct 17, 2017 04:53PM ET","U.S. dollar up, yield curve flat, on inflation; stocks rise",nan,"By Hilary RussNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday after company earnings reports were better than expected, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaching the 23,000 mark for the first time, while the U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened and the dollar rose to a one-week high on increased inflation expectations.The Dow briefly touched a new high of 23,002.20, powered by earnings from UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The S&P 500 had been negative as traders were left unimpressed by some bank earnings, but it ticked up before the market closed.Gains on world stock markets petered out near record-high levels, in part because a rally in commodities helped underpin one of the most durable bull runs in recent history. Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) topped analysts' expectations with their third-quarter earnings, but shares of Goldman fell because the results were fueled by a volatile unit that has sharp revenue swings, analysts said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 40.48 points, or 0.18 percent, to 22,997.44, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.72 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,559.36 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.35 points, or 0.01 percent, to 6,623.66.European shares lost ground, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) dropping 0.17 percent, though they were underpinned by solid earnings from food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) and education specialist  Pearson  (L:PSON) and talk of a break-up of investment bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN). MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.11 percent.Meanwhile, the yield spread between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to its lowest since November 2007, and 2-year yields (US2YT=RR) rose to their highest in nearly nine years. Spread compression between shorter- and longer-dated maturities was due to increased expectations for interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve and minimal signs of a pick-up in long-term inflation.Speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward nominating Stanford University economist John Taylor to head the Federal Reserve helped drive the expectations for rates and inflation rises.""Taylor is perceived as more hawkish than Ms.(Janet) Yellen so under his potential tutelage, the central bank might lift borrowing rates more aggressively, which would bolster the dollar's allure,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior marker analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.The increased expectations, also pushed by the strongest reading on U.S. import prices in more than a year, helped lift the dollar.The Labor Department said import prices jumped 0.7 percent last month, the biggest gain since June 2016, after an unrevised 0.6 percent rise in August.A fourth day of gains for the dollar index (DXY), which hit a one-week high, was also supported by broad-based weakness for the euro and the pound.Knocked by the stronger dollar, the euro slipped to a one-week low of $1.1734 , having fallen almost 3 percent since hitting a 2-1/2-year high last month. The euro was last down 0.24 percent to $1.1767, and Sterling  last traded at $1.3188, down 0.45 percent on the day, after comments from Bank of England policymakers that were interpreted as dovish.""Comments coming out (from BoE policymakers) uniformly signaled a dovish and cautious stance among policymakers and indicated a growing debate internally on the path for interest rates forward,"" said Neil Jones, Mizuho’s head of currency sales for hedge funds in London. The Mexican peso  gained 1.49 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.75 after NAFTA trade ministers spoke of some progress in talks about the trade deal.Oil prices steadied after losing ground, as expectations of high U.S. production and exports offset concerns that fighting between Iraqi and Kurdish forces could threaten the country's crude output.U.S. crude  rose 0.4 percent to $52.08 per barrel and Brent  was last at $58.24, up 0.73 percent on the day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"Aug 16, 2017 09:24AM ET",Reckitt bets on 'smart' products to renew innovation mojo,nan,"By Martinne GellerSLOUGH, England (Reuters) -  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) is betting on connected consumer products as part of a push to show investors its innovative approach can still drive growth.In an interview at Reckitt's global headquarters outside London, Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor dismissed suggestions that a recent product failure signaled Britain's 12th most valuable company has lost its design mojo. ""Innovation for this company is cultural. It's in our blood, in our DNA,"" said Kapoor, who has a reputation for disciplined cost management, adding that detailed product pipeline reviews were conducted monthly like profit-and-loss assessments.The group's creative prowess is under scrutiny after last year's poor market response to a 60 pound ($77) version of its Scholl electronic hard skin remover, which continued to hurt the company and contributed to its first-ever quarterly sales fall last month.Even without one-time items, which also included a June cyber attack and the collapse of its South Korean business, Reckitt's core health business slowed. Kapoor said the unit, which makes up half its annual sales following the $16.6 billion Mead Johnson purchase, remains strong and will benefit from new products. Reckitt will next month start selling a new brand, Siti, in China and India to help protect against outdoor air pollution, and is also launching a Fever Smart temperature monitor in Australia. Both comprise pricey monitors that can send data to smartphones aimed at prompting the use of company products. For Siti, that means face masks costing about 2 pounds each and fitted with a 20 pound vent that Reckitt says makes them perform better than existing choices. For Fever Smart, it would be a Nurofen tablet to lower a child's fever.Kapoor said these illustrate the new products in prospect at the maker of Durex condoms, Lysol cleaners and Mucinex cold medicine. ""There is a connected innovation pipeline for all of our brands,"" he said. ""Think about air fresheners or pest control solutions or multipurpose cleaning.""REAL PROBLEMSDespite price tags of 99 Australian dollars ($78) for the Fever Smart and 50 pounds for the Siti monitor, Kapoor thinks they will be successful because they are linked to solutions for real problems. Yet Reckitt's foray into smart devices comes as the market for wearable gadgets slows.CCS Insight predicts a 1 percent increase in the number of wearable gadgets shipped this year, versus 10 percent last year. ""It is not a secret that demand for smart wearables has been weaker than we, or anyone else, initially anticipated,"" said George Jijiashvili at the consultancy. He noted other companies also offer pollution monitors but said they will likely have niche appeal. ""Certain individuals who are very concerned about the air quality, especially those living in heavily polluted cities such as Delhi, are likely to seek out such devices"".RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said he had become more skeptical about Reckitt's product pipeline, especially after the failed Scholl skin file.""The wider issue is not about one innovation going wrong, it's that one innovation went wrong and there was nothing else to fill the gap that it left,"" said Jones, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock.He said greater upside may be had elsewhere in the sector, which is being rocked as activist shareholders push Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG) to improve returns,  Unilever  (L:ULVR) aims to boost performance after an aborted takeover proposal from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) is reportedly being targeted by an activist investor.INCREASED PRESSURE ""I still think they (Reckitt) are an exceptionally managed company, but others are starting to do the same sort of thing from a much lower base,"" Jones said. Kapoor acknowledged the increased pressure on the sector as growth has slowed. He says it gives rise to two types of CEO - those who become activist targets and those who play that role themselves. ""The day I stop being the activist CEO in my company I should have an activist from outside."" Reckitt shares have risen by more than 130 percent since Kapoor took over as CEO in September 2011, growing more than three times as much as the FTSE 100, though they are down nearly 6 percent since last month's results. Reckitt is moving deeper into consumer health, a market that Euromonitor International says is worth $217 billion, evidenced by the Mead Johnson deal and a healthcare development center being built in northern England. At 105 million pounds, the site in Hull slated to open in May 2018 is Reckitt's biggest such investment to date. Kapoor said he chose Hull to strengthen Reckitt's British roots, before Britons voted last year to leave the European Union.""I did not support Brexit in a personal capacity,"" said Kapoor. He said he would have weighed Hull harder against other choices in Singapore and India if he had foreseen Brexit and remained concerned about its impact.""Brexit happened, but we are steadfast,"" he said about the facility that should add about 250 employees to a local workforce of more than 800. ""We will continue, and get it done."" ($1 = 0.7771 pounds)($1 = 1.2755 Australian dollars)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Oil prices stabilize after falling to fresh 3-week lowsOil prices stabilized after plumbing fresh three-week lows earlier as a stronger U.S. dollar and concerns over a global supply glut continued to weigh.Concerns over slowing demand from China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer, pressured prices lower.

Pound slumps as UK inflation holds steady in JulySterling slumped to 5-week lows against the U.S. dollar after data showing that Britain’s annual inflation rate unexpectedly held steady in July underlined the case for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold.GBP/USD fell to lows of 1.2899, the weakest since July 13, while EUR/GBP advanced 0.24% to 0.9110.Consumer prices rose 2.6% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly below economists' expectations for a 2.7% annual rise.Falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food, the ONS said.In its latest assessment of the economy released last week, the BoE said it expected inflation to peak at 3% in October.5.

(https://bloom.bg/2vVwxiE)On Monday, Corvex warned of a proxy battle at another company,  Energen Corp  (N:EGN).The maker of Activia yogurt and Evian water has recently been touted as a potential target by suitors or activist shareholders, given that the company’s profits are below many of its peers and its sales have disappointed. Such a move at Danone would closely follow recent engagement by other activist shareholders at larger rivals Nestle SA (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG).Officials for Corvex and Danone declined to comment.Danone has not hired advisers to deal with Corvex as it believes the stake is too small to warrant a defense strategy, Financial Times reported, citing people close to the company. (http://on.ft.com/2vCE1o5)Danone's listed American Depositary Receipts were up nearly 7 percent on Monday. Its Paris-listed shares had earlier closed up more than 2 percent, following a Sunday report from the New York Post citing someone saying Danone could be a takeover target, for the likes of Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) or  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO).That echoed similar assertions made recently by analysts such as those at Exane, who said in a June research note that the election of centrist President Emmanuel Macron could make a takeover more likely in a country that had traditionally resisted foreign takeovers of its companies.In 2005 France dashed to the support of Danone in the face of a rumored bid from PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP), which never actually materialized. (http://reut.rs/2wHZQTw)Danone Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Faber has played down the takeover speculation, telling Reuters in June that the company, which has no large controlling shareholder, was ""no more and no less than usual"" vulnerable to a possible takeover bid.Analysts have been speculating about activists’ next target, following the June revelation that Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund had taken a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle, urging it to more aggressively improve returns, and the campaign by Nelson Peltz at Procter & Gamble, where he is pushing for a board seat.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""If the euro continued to strengthen it could be more significant, but for now there's enough growth going on to offset it,"" she added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

81,"Jul 10, 2017 01:38PM ET",Activist Loeb keeps up performance pressure on Nestle: source,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Maiya KeidanLONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb is keeping up pressure on Nestle (S:NESN) by sharing views with the company as part of a regular dialogue, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food.The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder.But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016.  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent.Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans.""Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,"" Liberum analysts said. Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts.Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group.Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important. Loeb, dubbed a ""constructivist"" for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend.Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency.Aside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business. MAYBELLINE FOR MAGGI Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company. It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up.Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters.Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed.After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside.The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent. That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year.For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source. That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research.Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc  and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (T:6758) and Seven & I Holdings (T:3382).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"Jul 03, 2017 06:25AM ET",France's Danone to sell Stonyfield to Lactalis for $875 million,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) has agreed to sell its U.S dairy business Stonyfield to Lactalis for $875 million, a move designed to address competition concerns stemming from its acquisition of U.S. organic food group WhiteWave.Danone said on Monday that Stonyfield had around $370 million in turnover in 2016, and that the sale price represented a multiple of around 20 times the 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for Stonyfield.Danone shares were up 1 percent in mid-session trading, in line with a similar rise on the CAC-40 index of French blue chips stocks. (FCHI)""The sale price appears reasonable and we expect proceeds would reduce leverage largely offsetting dilution from the disposal,"" Liberum analysts wrote in a research note.""Danone remains on track to deliver 10 percent 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) driven in part by WhiteWave and significant savings from the 1 billion euros Project Protein efficiency program,"" they added.Danone's 'Project Protein' savings program, unveiled earlier this year, aims to cut costs by 1 billion euros over the next three years.Jefferies analysts added that the Stonyfield sale was ""a decent exit and the removal of a potential distraction for Danone.""Earlier this year, Danone had said it would sell Stonyfield as part of an agreement with U.S. authorities to facilitate its takeover of WhiteWave.The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

83,"Jun 26, 2017 01:11PM ET",U.S. activist presses for 'bold action' at Nestle,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Michael FlahertyLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC has targeted Nestle (S:NESN) by taking a $3.5 billion stake in the food maker and urging Europe's most valuable company to boost returns as demand for its products weakens.Nestle shares jumped as much as 4.8 percent on Monday, touching a record high after Third Point disclosed its position late on Sunday in a letter to the hedge fund's investors.In the letter, Third Point said it was urging the Swiss group to improve margins, buy back shares and get rid of non-core businesses, including its $27 billion stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP).Third Point's 40 million shares -- or 1.3 percent of the total -- make it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $10 billion added to Nestle's market value on Monday showed that shareholders hoped the investment would spark change at a company which has a reputation for being slow-moving and insular.""Nestle has arguably been lackadaisical and complacent and underperformed its potential,"" Bernstein analysts said. ""It might now be stirred into action by an external force."" New York-based Third Point is an $18 billion hedge fund run by American billionaire Daniel Loeb. Loeb runs a multi-strategy portfolio though he is known as an aggressive, bare-knuckled shareholder activist who has taken on major companies such as Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc.  and Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758). Loeb and Nestle CEO Mark Schneider met in Switzerland earlier this month to discuss Third Point's ideas, according to a person familiar with the matter.Senior managers at Third Point, which started buying Nestle shares at the end of the first quarter, plan to meet again with Nestle leaders in the next few weeks, said the person, who wished to remain anonymous.Third Point's investment comes as Nestle and its packaged goods rivals grapple with slowing emerging markets, pressure on prices and consumers shifting from traditional brands toward healthier, fresher fare. Nestle has missed its long-term sales target for four straight years, but so far has eschewed radical moves like Danone's (PA:DANO) $12.5 billion purchase of WhiteWave or Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB) $16.6 billion Mead Johnson deal. The company has instead pushed slowly into healthcare, with a series of small investments and acquisitions that blur the boundaries of food and medicine.Nestle, which is based on the shores of Lake Geneva and makes Nescafe coffee, Maggi noodles and Gerber baby food, said it was committed to its strategy under new Chief Executive Schneider, who joined from German healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG).""As always, we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value,"" a Nestle spokesman said. ""Beyond that, we have no specific comment.""One top-40 investor said Nestle has done a good job adapting over the years to a changing industry, selling its stake in eyecare company Alcon and buying pet food business Ralston Purina and Wyeth Nutrition.""The new CEO has been brought in with a mandate for change,"" the investor said, pointing out that Schneider is Nestle's first external CEO hire in nearly a century. ""We would prefer to let Schneider make his own decisions and judge him on the outcome than try to dictate what should happen."" RECURRING PRESSURES The move by Third Point cranks up pressure on Schneider, who arrived in January just before the sector was rocked by Kraft Heinz's (O:KHC) abortive $143 billion approach for  Unilever  (L:ULVR). He has already been looking at ways to reignite growth. He has already scrapped the company's long-standing sales target and said it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Baby Ruth and Butterfinger.Nestle had a market value of $263 billion on Friday, making it the biggest traded company in Europe. The consumer goods sector, home to usually reliable sales and dividends, has seen its share of investor activism in the past with mixed results. Before Nestle, the latest big bet was the $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble (N:PG) disclosed by Trian Partners in February.U.S. activist hedge funds have slowly cast their nets wider as corporate America becomes saturated with dissident shareholders seeking rapid changes to boost share prices. ""We feel strongly that in order to succeed, Dr. Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency toward incrementalism that has typified the company's prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance,"" Third Point said in the letter.It argued that Nestle should sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal. L'Oreal shares rose 4.1 percent on Monday. The letter also said Nestle should set a formal profit margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020 to help improve productivity. Nestle's current margin is 15.3 percent, below Unilever's 16.4 percent but higher than Danone's 13.8 percent.Third Point also recommended Nestle more than double its debt load, as well as sell the L'Oreal stake, in order to generate the capital to buy back stock.Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Third Point's suggestions echoed proposals long made by other shareholders.""Previous management was not too open to listen to critics,"" he said. ""Now with Mr. Schneider, one of his top priorities was to improve shareholder communication and investor relations. I think he's listening carefully to what investors are saying.""Nestle's previous CEO, Paul Bulcke, is now its chairman.Nestle will report half-year results on July 27 and host an investor meeting on Sept. 26. Its next annual meeting is April 12, 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Intesa, as acquiror of the 'good' assets, also looks to be getting a good deal,"" he added.Shares in Intesa, Italy's largest retail bank, rose 3.2 percent while the euro zone bank index (SX7E) rose 1.3 percent. Gains in bank stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and the euro zone blue chip (STOXX50E) indexes rise 0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively, while UK's FTSE (FTSE) added 0.6 percent.Further supporting sentiment was a survey showing that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in June to a record high, a fresh sign that company executives are more upbeat about the growth outlook of Europe's largest economy.The German blue chip index (GDAXI) added 0.6 percent. Nestle (S:NESN) led STOXX gainers, up 4.3 percent. Activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point unveiled a stake of more than 1 percent, urging the group to improve its margins, buy back stock and sell its stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP).

88,"May 24, 2017 06:40AM ET",'Food revolution': megabrands turn to small start-ups for big ideas,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Food and drink megabrands are seeing their sales chewed away by smaller, nimbler, cooler rivals. They can't beat them - so now they're joining them. Nine of the world's biggest industry players, including  Danone  (PA:DANO),  General Mills  (N:GIS),  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) and Kellogg (N:K), have launched venture capital units over the past 18 months, a Reuters analysis of the sector shows. The aim of the strategy, according to interviews with executives, is to buy into - and learn from - the kind of start-up innovation that has become their nemesis, from micro-distilled spirits and cold-pressed juices to kale chips and vegan burgers.Food and drink multinationals spend far less on R&D than their counterparts in many sectors like tech and healthcare. They have been wrongfooted over the past five years by the shifting habits of consumers who are increasingly shunning established brands in favor of small, independent names they regard as healthier, more authentic and original. This is forcing the companies to take a leaf out of Silicon Valley's venture capital playbook - and their success or failure in harnessing promising new trends at a very early stage could help determine how well they adjust to the changing landscape, and whether they ultimately emerge as winners or losers. ""It's difficult for companies to have the persistence and to replicate the energy and the passion that these early-stage entrepreneurs have,"" said John Haugen, head of General Mills' venture capital arm 301 Inc, adding innovation was extremely tough because of how quickly market trends were changing.""We're just a year or a little more than that into these investments,"" he said of 301, where his team of about 15 sits down twice a month to pass around dozens of samples from start-ups. ""For me it's part of a total long-term growth strategy for our company."" In the United States - the world's biggest packaged food market - small ""challenger"" brands could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. The researchers point to successful upstart brands like Chobani Greek Yogurt, which they say has stolen more than half of General Mills' market share in yogurt, and Kind Snack Bars which have taken a big bite out of Kellogg's snack bars. 'IT'S AMAZING, THIS SWITCH'The nine companies to recently launch venture capital arms also include Hain Celestial (O:HAIN),  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP). Typically, their funds range in size from about $100 million to $150 million. While it is still early days for them, the experiences of the handful of food and drink firms that have had funds for several years - Nestle (S:NESN),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Coca-Cola (N:KO), PepsiCo (N:PEP) and  Diageo  (L:DGE) - could offer some guide to the future.Coca-Cola, for example, has had a mixed record; its investment in Honest Tea was a success, but a fermented soda and a Japanese tea failed to take off in the United States. So far none of the companies' venture units has delivered a blockbuster brand, but they say a link to the cutting edge is worth the effort.Diageo, the world's biggest liquor maker, has invested in 14 start-ups through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures, spending about 30 million pounds over the last four years on minority stakes.It points to last year's purchase of a 20 percent stake in Seedlip - a British start-up that says it produces the world's first non-alcoholic distilled spirit - as a prime example of how the strategy is making it more adventurous. ""If we'd had our strategic areas written down four years ago - what does Diageo want to go after - nowhere would we have written down, 'We think there's a big opportunity for a non-alcoholic spirit',"" said James Ashall, who heads its innovation unit Diageo Futures.""By Distill Ventures provoking our thinking about the space it allows us to stretch into an area that wouldn't have been naturally in our gift."" The company also cites learning gained from investments in craft whiskies, as it develops its own brands in that area, which include Roe & Co and Hilhaven Lodge. More broadly, Diageo says the venture arm is changing its culture. The global corporation now makes its marketing managers pitch for their ad budgets, like the entrepreneurs who present at Distill Ventures' laid-back office for 20-30 minutes and get an answer on the spot.""It makes our decision-making faster and more exciting,"" said Diageo's chief marketing officer, Syl Saller.Seedlip founder Ben Branson and other food and drink start-ups are reveling in this surge of investment interest.  ""Big companies are saying, wait a minute, we used to beat these guys down,"" said Branson, a bearded and tattooed ex-marketing executive who grows some Seedlip ingredients - peas and hay - on his farm in eastern England, where he also dabbles in taxidermy and painting. ""Now I think it's amazing that there is this switch to let's not beat them, let's join them."" R&D EXTENSIONThe venture capital divisions are not only for delivering returns or swallowing start-ups, executives say, but also to act as an extension of the companies' research departments. This is of particular importance in an industry that PwC says accounted for just 3 percent of the $680 billion spent globally on R&D last year, well behind the computing and electronics, healthcare and autos sectors, which together spent 62 percent.""This is a form of R&D for us, or access to places where the company isn't currently participating,"" said Simon Burton, who heads Kellogg's new venture capital arm, Eighteen94 Capital.Its first investment, announced in January, was in California-based Kuli Kuli, which makes snack bars from the moringa plant. There are more in the pipeline, he said. As the need for innovation has intensified, the strings that were typically attached to venture capital investments across all sectors - notably the right to buy out the business when it gains scale - have started to disappear in food. Campbell Soup, Kellogg, Unilever and General Mills have largely scrapped such provisions when investing in early-stage brands because they are often a deterrent for start-up entrepreneurs who fear it will cap their fortunes by keeping other bidders away.Campbell's general counsel, Adam Ciongoli, said flexibility was needed to attract the best and brightest. ""Why would they want to sign up from the get-go with the idea that they're not going to be able to maximize their economic leverage and their exit?"" said Ciongoli, who sits on the investment committee of Acre Venture Partners, which Campbell set up last year to contend with the ""revolution going on in food"". 'NEW ROCK STARS'For investors, experimenting with venture capital is worth the relatively small spend, compared with the risk associated with larger M&A deals, which the companies are also pursuing. ""Something really good might come out of it, so I don't have a problem with that,"" said Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management, an investor in Diageo and Unilever.The risk of buying a successful small brand at substantial cost, rather than investing at a very early stage, is that this will rob the target of the very size and independence that made it cool. One oft-cited example is Kashi cereal, an organic food pioneer whose sales tumbled after it was swallowed by Kellogg. Olivier Garel used to run M&A for Unilever and now runs Unilever Ventures. He said the consumer goods sector was relatively late to the venture capital game, but was now being motivated by the need to keep up with new technologies including social media, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer selling models.Unilever Ventures has invested in more than three dozen start-ups and says it is in contact with about 2,500. This month it announced a deal leading a $9.2 million funding round for U.S. organic food delivery service Sun Basket. Augustin Paluel-Marmont, who sold 40 percent of his French cookie company Michel et Augustin to Danone Manifesto Ventures last year, said it was a good time to be a food start-up. ""It is a lot easier today than before to find funds,"" he said. ""Entrepreneurs are the new rock stars.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

105,"Dec 09, 2016 12:50AM ET","Europe, U.S. trade officials lobby China on food safety rule",nan,"By Dominique Patton and Ben BlanchardBEIJING (Reuters) - European and U.S. government and trade officials say they have been lobbying hard against a draft Chinese regulation on food imports, worried it would hamper billions of dollars of shipments to the world's No.2 economy of everything from pasta to coffee and biscuits.The rule, part of a drive by China to boost oversight of its sprawling food supply chain, requires all food imports to carry health certificates from October next year, even if the product is deemed low-risk.That would be far stricter than in Europe and the United States, where certification is typically only needed for perishable goods such as dairy and meat products.The regulation, announced in April, would potentially create a major logistical headache and boost costs for global suppliers that operate in China such as  Hershey Co  (N:HSY), Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC),  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) and  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR).""(The draft rule) could bring large segments of foreign food imports to a grinding halt,"" Germany's ambassador to China, Michael Clauss, told Reuters.""The draft has clearly crossed the line between protecting the consumer toward outright protectionism of the domestic producer.""Chinese products are not required to meet the same standards.China's Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), the agency that oversees the safety of all imports, did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. China is already embroiled in disputes with the United States and Europe over metal and agricultural trade, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has indicated he would take a tougher approach on China, threatening import tariffs on some products.European officials and others have held high-level talks with Chinese officials urging them to modify the rules, with talks intensifying in recent months.Jerome Lepeintre, minister counselor for health and food safety at the European Union delegation in Beijing, said that China's government had already agreed to ""revise"" the proposed food safety rule. But exporting nations have been keeping up pressure on authorities in Beijing as they fret that those touted changes may be little more than cosmetic. A BIG SLICEUnder the proposal, authorities in exporting countries would be required to certify the safety of every product being shipped to China, issuing a certificate designed by AQSIQ to accompany exports.Global confectionery firm Hershey Co (N:HSY) said it had shared comments with the Chinese government regarding the implementation of food safety rules. Mondelez declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), Unilever, Nestle (S:NESN) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) did not respond to requests for comment.China's imports of food and beverages have rapidly increased in recent years, driven by rising disposable incomes, concerns about the safety of domestically made food and the growing taste for foreign foodstuffs. By some estimates, China will be the world's top consumer of imported food by 2018.Of its $45.9 billion in food imports in 2015, the European Union accounted for the largest share, according to AQSIQ's website.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

110,"Oct 20, 2016 09:41AM ET",Unilever's 'Marmitegate' shows strain on consumer industry,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company - and wider consumer brands industry - that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets.The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities.Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket,  Tesco  (L:TSCO), which balked at the demand.The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector.An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too.The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs.The day ""Marmitegate"" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices.It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO), which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales.Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB), which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle (S:NESN) also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing.Procter & Gamble (N:PG) reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment.WHY UNILEVER?Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. ""We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. ""Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be.""Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales.Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now.""If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried,"" GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. ""If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

111,"Oct 20, 2016 07:55AM ET",Nestle cuts sales target as food sales disappoint,nan,"By John RevillVEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) became the latest company to be hit by the global slowdown affecting food manufacturers after posting its weakest underlying sales growth in more than a decade.The Swiss maker of Kitkat bars and Nescafe coffee cut its sales target for the year, saying European markets would continue to be deflationary, while certain developing markets stay weak. It forecast no near-term blanket price increases in Western Europe, charting a different course to rival  Unilever  (L:ULVR), whose push to raise prices in Britain in response to a falling pound landed it in a public spat with retailer  Tesco  (L:TSCO) last week dubbed ""Marmitegate"".""The pound is going south and that is going to have some effect on certain imports and you cannot defy gravity,"" Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said on Thursday.""But I don’t say ... our costs go up 1 percent - bang, we pass that straight on to the consumer – they would punish you.""The company cut its forecast for the year, saying it now expected organic sales to rise by 3.5 percent after posting a 3.3 percent increase for the first nine months.Analysts had on average expected organic growth -- which strips out foreign exchange and acquisitions -- of 3.7 percent, according to a Reuters poll.It would mark the fourth year in a row that Nestle has fallen below its long-term target of 5 to 6 percent growth, raising pressure on incoming chief executive Ulf Mark Schneider, who will take over in January.""Investors can hold out hope that the worse it gets, the more likely Schneider will take aggressive actions,"" Liberum analysts said in a note. ""However it may get worse before it gets better."" Nestle joins Unilever (L:ULVR),  Danone  (PA:DANO) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) in posting disappointing third-quarter results.Bulcke defended Nestle's performance as being at ""the higher end of the industry, especially on volume,"" which measures the amount of goods sold.""That's what matters,"" Bulcke said. ""It's a relative game of winning in the marketplace."" Unilever and Danone both relied entirely on price gains for third-quarter growth, but ""Marmitegate"" shows the difficulty of maintaining that strategy.Nestle said its UK team was looking at all options to deal with the steep decline in the British currency since Britons voted in June to leave the European Union, including stepping up efficiency efforts in the country, which is its fifth-biggest market globally, representing about 3 percent of sales. It said price increases in Western Europe could come later in 2017 if commodity prices continue to rise.""In an environment marked by deflation and low raw material prices, we continued to privilege volume growth,"" Bulcke said. Still, the company's volume growth slowed to 2.5 percent in the nine-month period, from 2.8 percent at the half-year point and 3 percent in the first quarter. Overall, Nestle's nine-month sales rose one percent from a year earlier to 65.51 billion Swiss francs ($66.19 billion). The figure lagged the average analyst estimate of 66 billion francs in a Reuters poll.Its shares were down 0.7 percent at 1125 GMT.($1 = 0.9897 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"Sep 30, 2016 08:11AM ET","Global M&A drops in third quarter, companies wary of overpaying",nan,"By Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - The value of announced mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide fell 27 percent year-on-year to $753 billion in the third quarter of 2016, as apprehension among corporate executives about overpaying prevented a repeat of last year's deal-making frenzy.The preliminary Thomson Reuters M&A data shows the euphoria that drove merger mania in 2015 has subsided. While M&A activity remains robust, dealmakers said companies are being more selective in their decisions to do deals.""With price-to-earnings multiples at historic highs, deals are more likely to happen when there is lower growth in a sector, high potential for synergies, and potential acquirers enjoy a healthy stock price,"" said Paul Parker, chairman of global M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) GS.N.The stock market is hovering at record highs, while the S&P 500 Index's price-to-earnings ratio is at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Combined with uncertainty over the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates, companies have become more cautious when it comes to M&A.""It does get down to high prices. I think most of last year and the two years prior, even if it was priced high it was OK... Now, it had better be for a good growth profile,"" said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of M&A for the Americas at UBS Group AG UBSG.S.This year's largest deal so far was clinched in the third quarter; German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's BAYGn.DE $66 billion takeover of U.S. seeds company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co MON.N is also the biggest all-cash deal on record.Some of the other big deals this quarter included Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO $28 billion acquisition of  Spectra Energy  Corp (NYSE:SE) SE.N to create the largest North American energy infrastructure company, and Softbank Group Corp's 9984.T $32 billion acquisition of British semiconductor maker ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) Plc.""The strategic consolidation activity occurring has resulted in many CEOs and boards across sectors saying 'I don’t want to be left out, I don’t want to be the last mover, because then there will be nothing left to do and I may be disadvantaged',"" said Patrick Ramsey, co-head of global M&A, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) BAC.N.""This will continue to be a driver of both transformative mergers and sizeable bolt-on acquisition activity,"" Ramsey added.Another factor that has weighed on M&A this year, dealmakers said, is the United States and several other countries flexing their antitrust muscles and seeking to crack down on deals that aid tax avoidance or risk harming national security.BIG PREMIUMAn exception to the heightened price awareness is the pharmaceutical sector. Drug companies continue to be willing to pay high premiums to buy new products, rather than devote their resources to risky drug development.In August,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) PFE.N announced a $14 billion deal to acquire cancer drug maker Medivation Inc MDVN.O, at an 118 percent premium to Medivation's undisturbed share price.""Valuations in pharmaceutical companies may not be objectively attractive. You're just dealing with simple reality that many companies need to fill the pipeline of products to supplement what they are able to produce organically,"" said Daniel Wolf, an M&A partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.This quarter, the U.S. had its largest amount of inbound global deals in more than a decade, led by buyers in Europe, Canada and Asia, as the nation's economy continued to be attractive despite its challenges.In July, for example, French yogurt company  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) DANO.PA said it would double the size of its U.S. business by buying organic foods producer WhiteWave Foods Co WWAV.N for $10.4 billion in its largest acquisition since 2007.""Once-cautious executives are now looking for growth outside their home market, partly because there is a certain degree of frustration with the lack of economic growth in the region. That makes it even more pressing to look for growth elsewhere and the U.S. remains a logical destination,” said Dietrich Becker, a partner at investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP.That said, Softbank's deal for ARM shows that some companies have seen the turmoil created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union as a buying opportunity.Outbound M&A from China continues to be a key driver of deals. China has accumulated $159 billion in outbound M&A so far this year, topping 2015's full-year record of $107 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

122,"Jul 15, 2016 12:20AM ET",Yogurt maker Dannon considers ways to cut more sugar,nan,"By Chris PrenticeNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. yogurt maker Dannon, a unit of France's  Danone  (PA:DANO), is looking at ways to make its products less sweet, in the latest industry response to rising concerns about excessive sugar consumption.The company, whose brands include Dannon, Oikos and Activia, is working with the American Heart Association and other health groups to find ways to reduce sugar after having cut the sweetener in most of its products to 23 grams or less per six-ounce serving, executives said at press conference on Thursday.""We're going to look at things like that,"" Philippe Caradec, Dannon's vice president of corporate affairs, said in an interview after the conference.Yogurt manufacturers are taking such steps as government officials and nutritionists heighten their calls to reduce sugar intake in a bid to battle epidemics such as obesity.This year, the U.S. government for the first time recommended Americans limit their sugar intake and decreed that nutrition labels include added sugars.The American Heart Association is even more stringent. The group advises people to eat yogurt with no more than 20 grams of sugar in a six-ounce serving. That would mean a cut of another 3 grams per serving for many of Dannon's products.Yogurt sales have surged in recent years, more than doubling to 2.3 million tonnes since 2001, according to data from Euromonitor Ltd.In January, the U.S. government recommended a diet rich in fat-free or low-fat dairy foods like yogurt. Nutritionists have criticized yogurt makers for what they consider excessive levels of added sweeteners, on top of the natural sugar from milk used to make the product.Increasing choice and transparency are top priorities for Dannon, company Chief Executive Mariano Lozano said at the press conference, as the White Plains, New York-based company rolled out low-sugar Dannon and Oikos products with no genetically engineered ingredients, known as GMOs.The products use evaporated cane juice and non-GMO starch instead of GMO beet sugar and starch. The company has said it plans to overhaul its supply chain to use milk from cows fed with non-GMO animal feed.Facing a consumer backlash, Dannon has joined other food companies in switching to cane sugar instead of sugar from beet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

132,"Jun 21, 2016 03:21AM ET","Wal-Mart rips up China online strategy, starts again with stake in Alibaba rival",nan,"By Lauren Hirsch and Adam JourdanNEW YORK/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) has sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in the country's no. 2 e-commerce firm, ripping up its previous strategy in efforts to cure ailing sales in one of the world's toughest retail markets.The deal will see the U.S. grocery giant swap its Yihaodian platform for a 5 percent stake in JD.com Inc, worth about $1.5 billion by the firm's latest market value. The move also gives Wal-Mart a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. The sell-off, announced on Monday, is a significant shift for Wal-Mart in China, where it operates more than 400 bricks-and-mortar stores. The firm has been shuttering underperforming outlets and grappling with soft online sales in the world's second-biggest economy since it bought full control of Yihaodian in July last year, saying the site would play a leading role in its China strategy.""The reality is that e-commerce is hyper-competitive in China and it is tough for any platform to make money,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal of China Market Research Group. ""Selling up in return for a 5 percent stake in JD.com is a good way of staying in the space while reducing the risk.""The deal echoes a strategy adopted by other international retailers and consumer goods makers - selling a local unit for a stake in a Chinese partner in order to prosper in a cut-throat marketplace. France's  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) sold its Dumex brand last year to raise its stake in local dairy giant China Mengniu Dairy Co Ltd.Wal-Mart's tie-up gives it access to JD.com's nationwide logistics and warehousing networks, as well as its over 150 million users - helping expand the U.S. firm's reach with China's increasingly tech-savvy middle class. For JD.com, the deal could provide a boost in its intensifying competition in the fast-growing online grocery business with Alibaba - a market set to boom to nearly $180 billion by 2020 from $41 billion last year, according to data from food research body IGD.Under the deal, JD.com will issue around 145 million new class A shares to Wal-Mart. JD.com will take ownership of Yihaodian, although the platform will continue to be operated by Wal-Mart.The world's biggest retailer had previously talked up Yihaodian as playing a key role in turning around its China business. Wal-Mart has worked to turn around falling same-store sales in China, where the firm said in May it was facing a ""challenging macroeconomic environment"".Analysts said that while Wal-Mart would give up a large amount of control and potential future profits from the business, the tie-up would allow the U.S. firm to concentrate on turning around its offline stores.""It doesn't mean that (Wal-Mart has) pulled away, but to me it tells me they are trying to make smarter investments,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Wal-Mart's financial adviser on the deal was  Morgan Stanley  & Co LLC (NYSE:MS) and its legal advisor was Morrison & Foerster LLP.

135,"Mar 08, 2016 06:31PM ET",Sponsors back away from Sharapova after failed drug test,nan,"By Emma Thomasson and Ben KlaymanBERLIN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with tennis star Maria Sharapova on Tuesday, the latest sponsor after  Nike  and Porsche to distance itself from the world's highest-paid female athlete following her failed drug test.The swift response on the heels of Sharapova's announcement on Monday signaled a change in attitude among high-profile corporate backers following a series of doping and corruption scandals in world sports.""We're now entering a zero tolerance era for sponsors,"" said Rupert Pratt, co-founder of sports sponsorship agency Generate. ""It is now seen as not acceptable to 'stand by your man' because of the amount of scrutiny corporates are now under.""Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28-year-old Russian. The International Tennis Federation's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test. That ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as if the player shows no significant fault or negligence.Loss of sponsor income would be costly for Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner who earned $29.7 million last year, according to Forbes magazine, most of it from endorsements, appearances and royalties rather than victories on court. Sharapova, who lit up women's tennis when she won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old, is still ranked among the top players. She was the world's highest-paid female athlete last year for the 11th consecutive year, and Forbes put her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.Fellow athletes had mixed reactions to Sharapova's announcement that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium. The substance, recently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), boosts blood flow and can enhance athletic performance. Sharapova, who lives in the United States, is at least the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium. It is widely available in Eastern Europe but not approved for use in the United States.""She's ready to take full responsibility and I think that showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart,"" Serena Williams, the top-ranked player in women's tennis, told reporters at a briefing ahead of a game in New York on Tuesday.Others were not so sympathetic.""I'm extremely angry and disappointed. I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what,"" tweeted former world No. 1 Jennifer Capriati, in a long series of posts attacking Sharapova. Aries Merritt, a U.S. hurdler, said there was no excuse for Sharapova to be unaware that WADA added meldonium to its latest list of banned drugs effective Jan. 1, which it circulated to competitors.""As an athlete it is your responsibility to always know what's being placed on the banned list. Period,"" said Merritt at the U.S. Olympic Committee summit in Los Angeles.Former U.S. Olympic swimmer Aaron Peirsol told Reuters there was some confusion over meldonium. ""It wasn't even anything that was illegal until the beginning of this year,"" he said. ""You have a bunch of people taking stuff that the athletes probably don't even know (is illegal)... it becomes gray.""Sharapova said she had not read an email informing her that meldonium was banned for use in sport.She will be provisionally suspended from playing tennis from March 12 and could be prevented from competing for Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this year.SOME SPONSORS ON THE FENCE Sharapova's deal with Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), expired at the end of 2015, and the company said on Tuesday it had dropped renewal talks in view of her announcement.Nike Inc (N:NKE), the world's biggest sportswear brand, and German luxury car maker Porsche, a unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), have said they are suspending their relationship with Sharapova as they gather more information and wait for a decision on a ban.A person close to Sharapova told Reuters her team was encouraged that none of the sponsors so far have said they were terminating contracts with the player, although they had the right to do so. ""Suspension means to put on hold,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. ""Under the circumstances we're very pleased that everybody is willing to stand by and see what facts come out instead of terminating."" Danone  SA (PA:DANO), the maker of Evian water, a longtime Sharapova sponsor, said on Tuesday it would monitor developments.  Avon Products  Inc (N:AVP), another sponsor, declined to comment on its endorsements.Brian Socolow, an expert in sports law and a partner at Loeb & Loeb LLP, said Nike's quick suspension was no surprise after its long support for now-disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong.But he said Sharapova may yet win back sponsors. ""She has the chance, like other athletes, to redeem herself and regain her leadership position as an endorser,"" said Socolow. ""She will have to demonstrate that it was an honest mistake and there are no other improper reasons she took the drug.""There was some scepticism about the sponsors' motives from tennis fans on social media.Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) tweeted on Tuesday, ""Nike is in the business of making money, not offering moral guidance. If it paid to keep Sharapova on, they'd do it.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

139,"Oct 16, 2015 09:19AM ET",Nestle sees sales growth below long-term target as emerging markets lag,nan,"By Brenna Hughes NeghaiwiVEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) -  Nestle  (VX:NESN), the world's biggest maker of packaged foods, has warned that yearly sales growth would fall short of its long-term target this year due to weak sales in Asia, raising concerns over its position in major emerging markets.Sales in Nestle's Asia, Oceania and Africa (AOA) region fell 3 percent and the company, whose brands range from Nescafe and KitKat to Perrier, cut its sales growth forecast for 2015 to around 4.5 percent, below its broader objective of 5 to 6 percent growth in coming years.Analysts at  Barclays  (L:BARC) said the statement had reignited a debate around Nestle's capacity to fix its emerging market business, adding these operations had been ""a disappointment for several quarters in a row"".Nestle shares, which had risen the previous session to a near two-month high, were down 2.5 percent at 73.25 Swiss francs by 1235 GMT (0835 ET). Many consumer goods companies have been hurt by sluggish global economies and the cooling of once-hot markets like China and Brazil. But Nestle faces specific problems in Asia's largest markets, China and India.In India a recall of its Maggi noodles is hampering sales, while in China, Nestle's second-biggest market after the United States, the group conceded its product plans had yet to bear fruit.""There are things that we need to do better (in China), even if you set aside the macroeconomic situation,"" said Wan Ling Martello, recently named head of the AOA having previously been chief financial officer. ""We are a little behind in terms of innovation.""As an example of its planned product innovations, Martello said Nestle was repositioning Yinlu peanut milk for a relaunch in the first quarter of 2016, having last February discussed updating the brand to satisfy consumers who want fewer additives and alternative ingredients.DRAMATIC IMPACT In India, Nestle is suffering in the aftermath of a recall of its Maggi noodles, a package of which was found to contain an excessive amount of lead. CEO Paul Bulcke said this had had a dramatic impact. ""We had no Maggi noodles on the shelves for five, six months now,"" he said. The recall contributed 30 of the basis points in the Swiss food group's headline 2.1 percent sales drop in the nine months through September. At 64.9 billion Swiss francs ($68 billion), nine-month sales missed analysts' average 65.9 billion forecast.Nestle's Indian unit (NS:NEST) said a court-mandated test on the noodles found them to be safe with the levels of lead present well below permissible limits. Nestle's underlying sales growth, adjusted for currency swings, acquisitions and divestitures, slowed to 4.2 percent in the first nine months, sliding further behind its earlier 5 percent target for 2015.That implies third-quarter growth around 3.5 percent, said Jefferies analysts, down from 4.5 percent in the first half. The results came a day after rival  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) posted third-quarter underlying sales up 5.7 percent. Excluding one-time items, such as last year's squeeze on earnings in China, Unilever said sales growth would have been in the 3.5 to 4 percent range.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The flash Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for the fifth straight month, and faster than economists polled by Reuters had estimated.Euro zone business activity also started the second half on a less secure footing than expected, hit by Greece's near-bankruptcy. Markit's flash PMI fell to 53.7 this month from June's four-year high of 54.2. A Reuters poll had predicted a more modest dip to 54.0.While economies looked weaker in Europe and Asia, better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims kept the Federal Reserve on track for a rate increase in coming months.The U.S. dollar was 0.4 percent higher against a basket of currencies, trading at 97.489 (DXY). U.S. stock futures  pointed to a slightly higher open on the Wall Street.""What a conundrum we face: Commodities are shouting that the global economy is deteriorating, key emerging markets are already seeing major volatility, and yet the world's most important central bank is close to tightening monetary policy,"" Michael Every, head of financial market research for Asia at Rabobank. In a busy day for corporate updates on Friday, BASF (DE:BASFn), the world's largest chemicals firm by sales, slightly missed expectations with a 2 percent rise in operating profit, with profits of French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) also falling short of expectations.British telecom firm  Vodafone  (L:VOD) rose 3.7 percent after results that showed improvements across major markets in Germany and Britain. French defense group  Thales  (PA:TCFP) was up 8 percent, hitting an all-time high after its results.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 (FTEU3) hit a one-week low early in the day , but quickly rebounded to trade 0.2 percent higher at 1582.22. Euro zone bond yields fell. [GVD/EUR]""Historically the ECB (European Central Bank) has said it would do whatever it takes to save the euro, it has launched quantitative easing to support the euro zone and investors have faith that they will continue to be supportive if there are signs of weakness,"" said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG.The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China trades, hit a six-year trough of $0.7269 . Slowing Chinese growth means less demand for commodities such as iron ore, one of Australia's chief exports. The recent decline in a wide range of commodities, including oil, has weighed on currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars.London  and Shanghai nickel  contracts both fell 1.3-1.5 percent. China looks set to further reduce interest rates and the amount of cash its banks must hold as reserves to try to keep its economy growing at 7 percent this year, which would be the slowest pace in a quarter of a century, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.The euro dipped fell 0.3 percent to 1.0944  after the European data, still well above last week's 3-month low of $1.0808.Gold  slid more than 1 percent to its lowest since early 2010 on Friday, on course for its biggest weekly loss in nine months. [GOL/] Oil prices neared four-month lows. Brent crude  was down 35 cents at $54.92 a barrel, having hit an intraday low of $54.80, its lowest since early April. U.S. crude for September delivery  rose 12 cents to $48.57 a barrel. [O/R]Brent has lost nearly 13 percent in July, its largest one-month fall since a near 19 percent loss in January.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The partners each declined to give sales estimates.The coffee chain, which has about 12,000 U.S. shops, will offer smoothies made with its own Evolution Fresh juices and an exclusive-to-Starbucks Dannon Greek yogurt at shops in Washington state, Oregon, Alaska, Northern California and Idaho.Priced at $5.95 for a 16-ounce size, the smoothies will come in three flavors and can be customized by adding ingredients such as protein powder and fresh kale, said Jeff Hansberry, president of Starbucks' Evolution Fresh brand.In early May, Starbucks and Dannon will begin selling Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt parfaits in about half of Starbucks' U.S. stores. Then, this summer, the partners will start selling fruit-on-the-bottom Greek yogurt cups at U.S. supermarkets.Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt is a proprietary blend for Starbucks that includes three yogurt cultures, instead of the traditional two, said Jeffrey Rothman, vice president of marketing for Dannon. Rothman added that it is the mildest, creamiest Greek yogurt Dannon makes. U.S. yogurt sales totaled $8.3 billion in 2014 and were dominated by Dannon, according to research firm Euromonitor International, which does not break out sales in popular Greek yogurt category.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

145,"Mar 19, 2015 07:11AM ET",French retailer Carrefour returning to Algeria - source ,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is preparing to return to Algeria after a six-year absence, as part of a drive to tap booming consumer demand in Africa.The world's second-largest retailer after Wal-Mart (N:WMT) will open a hypermarket in Algiers by the end of June, a source close to the matter told Reuters.The company operating the store is a joint-venture, 70 percent-owned by Carrefour Tunisia and 30 percent by a fund controlled by the Algerian state, the source said.Carrefour declined to comment.Carrefour entered Algeria in 2006, teaming up with local private holding company Arcofina. However, in 2009 the pair ditched the venture after opening only one of a planned 18 stores. Arcofina cited development roadblocks such as difficulties in securing land.Rising incomes and an underdeveloped retail sector have made Africa an important new growth destination for retailers and consumer goods companies, with the likes of  Danone  (PA:DANO), Pernod (PA:PERP) and  Diageo  (L:DGE) boosting investments to counter weak growth in Europe.The World Bank forecasts Algeria's economy will grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2016 -- more than double rates expected for the euro zone.Small independent grocers dominate Algeria's retail sector, where Carrefour would compete with Numidis, the retail unit of agro-food conglomerate Cevital, which had a 1 percent share of the 2014 local retail market by value, according to Euromonitor.LOW RISK Newcomers to Africa face many challenges including legal hurdles, lack of available property and transport infrastructure and setting up a reliable supplier base.Carrefour has thus chosen to expand on the continent through franchise deals with strong local connections to which it brings retailing skills while keeping investment to a minimum.This is because Europe's largest retailer has earmarked the bulk of its tight resources for expansion in its key markets of Europe, Brazil and China. ""Carrefour is unlikely to sustain ambitious expansion plans for the African continent in the short-term as it already has a lot on its plate in its key markets,"" said PlanetRetail analyst Gildas Aitamer.Carrefour has had franchise deals since 2009 with Morocco's Label'Vie (CS:LBV) for 62 stores and in Tunisia with Ulysse Hyper Distribution (UHD) since 1997 with 71 stores.In east Africa, it relies on long-time partner Dubai-based Majid al Futtaim (MAJ), its exclusive franchise holder for the Middle East, which operates Carrefour hypermarkets in Egypt and plans to open stores in Kenya this year. In 2013, Carrefour teamed up with Africa-focused trading firm CFAO (PA:CFAO) to open stores in eight west African countries. CFAO plans to open the first shopping center in Abidjan in the second half of 2015.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The S&P 500's streak of weekly losses was its longest since August 2011, and the index still is off 6.2 percent from its Sept. 18 record high. The drop follows worries over the health of the global economy, the spread of the Ebola virus, as well as factors including lower oil prices and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next steps. However, the broad index this week steered clear of correction territory, a 10-percent drop from its high. Friday's earnings offset some of the concerns about the impact of weak global demand on U.S. corporations. Honeywell (N:HON) shares gained 4.3 percent to $90.06 after results.

For the week, the Dow and S&P were down 1 percent while the Nasdaq was down 0.4 percent. Housing shares were among the day's best performers after a Wall Street Journal report said Fannie Mae (OB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OB:FMCC) are close to an agreement that could boost mortgage lending.

Such a transaction would have allowed Hospira, which has a market value of $9.15 billion, to lower its tax rate and free up its foreign cash.But the discussions have for now been put on hold and it remains unclear if the proposed deal and its structure could be revived, people familiar with the matter said this week, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.It was not immediately clear why the parties paused discussions, but the decision comes as U.S. companies considering tax inversions come under intense pressure from the government and politicians to rethink their plans.When Hospira's interest in the Danone business first emerged in July, a senior U.S. senator wrote to the Lake Forest, Illinois-based company urging it not to move its tax base abroad.Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, represents Illinois and told Chief Executive Michael Ball that Hospira should not ""turn its back on American taxpayers and consumers by taking advantage of a tax loophole called 'inversion'"".Analysts also questioned the strategic fit between Hospira, the maker of injectable drugs, and the Danone unit, which makes feeding tubes, foods and drinks for people with special nutritional needs.When Hospira was spun off from Abbott Laboratories ABT.N in 2004, Abbott retained a sizable and profitable medical nutrition business.Reuters first reported in February that Danone, the world's biggest yogurt maker, was considering selling the business - even though it has a profit margin above the group average.Hospira was among a field of bidders including German healthcare group Fresenius and Swiss food company Nestle that also held talks with Danone over the business.It could not be ascertained if there was another bidder involved in the auction, but one person said the sale process was still ongoing.While talks with Hospira have stalled for now, any potential deal with the U.S. company does not necessarily have to be predicated on a tax inversion, that person added. ""All options are still open. Price, structure and bidder - those are uncertain.""Spokesmen for Danone in Paris and Hospira in Illinois declined to comment.TAX INVERSION MARKET SLOWING?So far in 2014, ten corporate inversion transactions have been struck, the most in any given year. Dealmakers now say the market for inversions is slowing, with U.S. companies looking to buy overseas rivals primarily for tax benefits increasingly dismayed by rising prices, administrative hassles and fears of a U.S. government crackdown.Last month, U.S. retailer Walgreen Co WAG.N bowed to political pressure and ditched attempts to reincorporate in Europe. The largest U.S. pharmacy chain operator was considering using its planned acquisition of European rival Alliance Boots ABN.UL to move its domicile, but has decided to keep its current Illinois tax address.Danone has been grappling with falling earnings due to weak baby food sales in Asia as a result of a health scare and sluggish dairy sales in Europe due to slow consumption and a jump in milk prices.On Tuesday it said that Chairman and Chief Executive Franck Riboud would split his role after 18 years at the helm of the world's largest yoghurt maker.Riboud, 58, who took over from his late father, Antoine Riboud, in 1996, will remain as chairman and focus on the company's long-term strategy while Emmanuel Faber, 50, the chief operating officer, will become CEO, effective Oct. 1.A sale could enable Danone to use the proceeds to fund an expansion of its faster-growing baby food and dairy businesses, targeting acquisitions in Asia and Africa, analysts say.For the $30 billion medical nutrition market as a whole, about three-quarters consists of nutrition products delivered orally or through a feeding tube, according to analysts from Exane BNP Paribas.That portion of the market is led by Abbott Laboratories ABT.N, with a 30 percent share, followed by Nestle NESN.VX with 25 percent and Danone with 16 percent. Smaller players include Fresenius FREG.DE and Mead Johnson Nutrition MJN.N.The remainder is in nutrition delivered intravenously, and is dominated by Baxter International BAX.N, Fresenius, B Braun Melsungen BBRMG.UL and Hospira.People familiar with the process have said Fresenius and Nestle would have almost certainly faced anti-trust problems were they to acquire the whole business. Danone could now attempt to either split the business among potential suitors or lower price expectations, which could entice private equity players.If a deal with one of the strategic players failed, private equity funds would probably be interested in Danone Medical Nutrition, which offers appealing growth prospects and has exposure to emerging markets, said people familiar with the situation.(Editing by Soyoung Kim and Tom Pfeiffer)"
153,"Aug 18, 2014 04:01AM ET",China finds Mercedes-Benz guilty of price fixing: Xinhua,nan,"By Brenda Goh SHANGHAI (Reuters) - German luxury car Mercedes-Benz has been found guilty of manipulating prices for after-sales services in China, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing regulators. The report made no mention of possible penalties, but China's 2008 anti-monopoly law allows the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's anti-trust regulator, to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's China revenues for the previous year. An array of industries, from milk powder makers to electronics firms, have been coming under the spotlight in recent years as China intensifies its efforts to bring companies into compliance with the 2008 legislation. The auto industry has been under particular scrutiny, with a wave of investigations prompting carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi and BMW (DE:BMWG) to slash prices on spare parts in recent weeks. The Jiangsu Province Price Bureau, which launched an investigation last month, found evidence of anti-competitive practices after raiding Mercedes-Benz dealerships in the eastern coastal province and an office in neighboring Shanghai, Xinhua said in its report on Sunday. A Daimler spokesman repeated a statement, first made by Mercedes-Benz on Aug. 5, that it was assisting the authorities with their investigation, adding that it was unable to comment further as it was still an on-going matter. ""It is a typical case of a vertical monopoly in which the carmaker uses its leading position to control the prices of its spare parts, repair and maintenance services in downstream markets,"" Zhou Gao, chief of the anti-trust investigation at the Jiangsu bureau, told Xinhua. Industry experts say automakers have too much leverage over car dealers and auto part suppliers in China, enabling them to control prices, considered as a violation of the country's anti-trust laws. The Xinhua report said the cost of replacing all the spare parts in a Mercedes-Benz C-Class could be 12 times more than buying a new vehicle, citing a report from the China Automotive Maintenance and Repair Trade Association. WORLD'S BIGGEST CAR MARKET Early this month the NDRC said it would punish Audi and Fiat SpA's (MI:FIA) Chrysler for monopoly practices. Chinese media reported last week that Audi, the best selling foreign premium car brand in China, would be fined around 250 million yuan ($40.7 million). Foreign car brands, all of whom operate in China through joint ventures with a local partner, have been fiercely competing to up their share in the world's largest car market. Daimler has said that it wants to boost China sales of Mercedes-Benz cars to more than 300,000 cars a year by 2015, while Audi expects China to make up 40 percent of its sales by 2020. Citi analysts said in an Aug. 11 note that, should a manufacturer be hit with a penalty of even 1 percent of annual revenue, that could erode 10 percent of its joint venture's net profit. China's government has in the past few years stepped up its enforcement of its anti-monopoly law, slapping several multinational companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (N:MJN) and Danone SA (PA:DANO), with fines. The government is conducting an anti-monopoly probe into U.S. tech giant Microsoft Corp (O:MSFT), and regulators also recently said U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. (O:QCOM) had a monopoly.

It targeted multinationals Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone SA, which the regulator slapped with hefty fines, as well as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which faces the prospect of a $1 billion fine.China's anti-trust investigations target monopolistic practices in general and aim to promote fair competition and protect consumer interests, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement posted on the Ministry's website.Both domestic and foreign firms must bear the due liabilities if they break the law, Shen said.Industry experts say automakers have too much leverage over car dealers and auto part suppliers, enabling them to control prices, considered as a violation of China's anti-trust laws.China, the world's biggest auto market, is dominated by foreign brands.(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Pete Sweeney, editing by William Hardy)"
155,"Aug 06, 2014 03:00AM ET","China anti-trust regulator conducts new raids on Microsoft, Accenture",nan,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese anti-trust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft Corp (O:MSFT) and partner in China Accenture PLC (N:ACN), the agency said on its website on Wednesday, after saying last week Microsoft is under investigation for anti-trust violations. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) raided offices in Beijing, Liaoning, Fujian and Hubei, it said. The SAIC also raided the Dalian offices of IT consultancy Accenture, to whom Microsoft outsources financial work, according to the regulator. ""We're serious about complying with China's laws and committed to addressing SAIC's questions and concerns,"" a Beijing-based Microsoft spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. Accenture also said it is involved in investigations. ""We can confirm that, as required by Chinese laws, we are cooperating with investigators of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and are helping provide them with certain information related to one of our clients,"" Accenture Greater China said in an e-mailed statement, declining to elaborate. Last week, the SAIC said it was formally investigating Microsoft for breach of anti-trust rules and had raided four of the software firm's offices in China. Microsoft has been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software, the SAIC said last week. The SAIC declined to provide further comment when contacted by phone on Wednesday. Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp was in Beijing to meet with the SAIC on Monday, where the regulator warned Microsoft to not obstruct the probe. But industry experts have questioned how exactly Microsoft is violating anti-trust regulations in China, where the size of its business is negligible. The U.S. company has taken a public beating in China in recent months. It has been subject to wider scrutiny against U.S. technology firms in China in the wake of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's cyber espionage revelations. It has also seen its OneDrive cloud storage service disrupted in China, and had its latest Windows 8 operating system banned from being installed on the central government's new computers. The Microsoft investigation comes amidst a spate of anti-trust probes against foreign firms in China, including mobile chipset maker Qualcomm Inc (O:QCOM) and German car maker Daimler AG's (DE:DAIGn) luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz. China is intensifying efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having in recent years taken aim at industries as varied as milk powder and jewellery. China on Wednesday said it will punish foreign car makers Audi, owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), and Fiat SpA's (MI:FIA) Chrysler as well as some 10 Japanese spare-part makers for anti-trust violations. A number of multinational companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co (N:MJN) and Danone SA (PA:DANO) have been slapped with substantial fines following similar investigations in the past.

""We confirm that we are assisting the authorities in their investigation,"" Mercedes-Benz said in a statement, issued in response to a query from Reuters on whether the office had received anti-trust officials from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Asked about the nature of the investigation, Beijing-based Mercedes-Benz spokesman Senol Bayrak said the automaker is only confirming that anti-trust officials visited the office as part of an investigation. He declined to elaborate, saying it is ""an on-going matter"". A little-known Shanghai publication known as Jie Mian reported nine officials from the NDRC's anti-trust investigation team sprung a surprise visit at Mercedes-Benz's Shanghai office on Monday morning. The publication said the team interviewed many senior executives and confiscated computers as part of an investigation blitz into Mercedes-Benz. Over the weekend before, Mercedes-Benz said it would lower prices on more than 10,000 spare parts by an average of 15 percent. The cut followed a sweeping reduction of prices for repair and maintenance services Mercedes-Benz announced last month. The automaker is the latest foreign company to be targeted by Chinese regulators, who have ramped up anti-monopoly investigations in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to electronics. Regulators officially named U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (O:QCOM) a monopoly last month and are widely expected to levy a heavy fine. Last week, agency investigators raided Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) offices in four Chinese cities as part of an ongoing probe. China is stepping up efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having in recent years targeted industries as varied as milk powder and jewelery.

157,"Jul 28, 2014 06:50PM ET",China brands beat global rivals with tea toothpaste & pickled plums,nan,"By Adam Jourdan and Clare Baldwin SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - With green-tea flavored toothpaste and pickled plum juice, an army of Chinese retailers is tapping local tastes to whittle away market share from global rivals that are banking their future growth on the world's second-largest consumer market.Senior executives at companies such as The Coca-Cola Co (N:KO), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive Co (N:CL) are being forced to adapt as the challenge posed by local firms intensifies in a slowing economy.Last year, China's 1.15 billion yuan ($185.31 million) consumer goods market grew at 7.4 percent annually, half the rate of three years ago, according to a report this month from Bain & Company and Kantar World Panel.In this tougher market, both local and foreign brands are targeting the same customers, and increasingly, the domestic firms are winning: nearly two-thirds of foreign brands surveyed lost market share in China last year, according to the report.""The good domestic brands are closing the gap really quickly and are able to play off the idea that they know how to develop something that a Chinese person is going to want,"" said Ben Cavender, a principal at China Market Research Group.Understanding the needs of Chinese consumers has given local companies an edge. Privately owned Jiaduobao Group (JDB) makes canned herbal tea which it says can put out internal ""fires"", playing on a concept in traditional Chinese medicine. The firm also sponsors a popular TV talent show, ""The China Voice"".""Our campaign around 'fearing internal fire' has helped JDB herbal tea become the highest selling canned drink in China...,"" said Wang Yuegui, a senior executive at the firm.JDB accounted for 6.1 percent of the soft drinks market in 2013 by value, up from 4.2 in 2009, according to data from consumer consultancy Euromonitor. Coca-Cola had 13.1 percent, while Pepsi had 3.9 percent.GREEN TEA TOOTHPASTEWith a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly expanding middle class, China is the largest consumer goods market after the United States and even with a slowing economy, remains key to the future of global brands.China's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in 24 years this year, but that's still 7.4 percent. The U.S. economy, by comparison, is expected to grow at just 1.7 percent.Many of the Chinese firms taking on the international conglomerates are little-known abroad, but their local know-how is helping them broaden their appeal at home.Hawley & Hazel, a joint venture owned by Colgate-Palmolive and its Hong Kong-based founders, makes Darlie toothpaste which leads the domestic market according to Kantar and Bain, playing to Chinese tastes with green tea and jasmine flavours.Another popular toothpaste brand is made by Yunnan Baiyao Group Co Ltd , which uses its history as one of the biggest and oldest traditional Chinese medicine makers in the country as a selling point.Taiwan-based drinks maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (HK:0322), which bottles and distributes PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP) products in China, also says it makes a point of developing traditional Chinese flavours such as snow pear and pickled plum.""There are a lot of things that Chinese prefer localized,"" said Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive of Global Brands Group and former CEO of global sourcing firm Li & Fung. ""Foreign brands haven't adapted well enough.""In a bid to fend off competition, market leader Coca-Cola launched small-sized products, which helped boost its China sales. It also offered shoppers discounts, like rival PepsiCo.Coca-Cola, however, saw its market share drop more than 3 percentage points to 13.1 percent last year, while PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP) fell 1.8 percentage points to 3.9 percent, according to Euromonitor data.Coca-Cola International president Ahmet Bozer said he was happy with the company's 9 percent sales volume growth in China during the second quarter.""From a competitive standpoint, we are quite pleased,"" he said on a conference call with reporters.Pepsi said in an email to Reuters that its China revenue grew by low double-digits in the second quarter. It also said its relationship with Tingyi and a research and development center in Shanghai helped it develop products geared to the local market.UNDER SIEGEEven traditional strongholds for foreign brands are under attack in China, including the market for infant milk formula. That market is one of largest and fastest growing, expected to be worth $25 billion by 2017, according to Euromonitor data.Global companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co (N:MJN), Nestle SA (VX:NESN), Danone SA (PA:DANO) and Abbott Laboratories (N:ABT) have long dominated the premium formula segment but they have increased tie-ups with Chinese partners and boosted domestic supply chains to protect their position.Chinese milk powder firms including Biostime International Holdings (HK:1112) and Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co Ltd increased their market share last year, helped by a food scare that hit foreign brands as well as government drives to consolidate the sector.In diapers, another area traditionally dominated by foreign brands, local firms are becoming more credible rivals, said a spokesman for Japanese diaper maker Kao (T:4452).""The potential challenge from Chinese domestic manufacturers has grown remarkably,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Ayai Tomisawa in TOKYO, Anjali Athavaley in NEW YORK and James Zhang in HONG KONG; Editing by Miral Fahmy)"

Neither Danone nor Hospira have confirmed the talks.Danone entered the medical nutrition business in 2007 by acquiring Dutch company Numico. The division, which is responsible for baby-food brands such as Nutricia and Cow and Gate, grew more than 7 percent, according to a company statement, in the first half of 2014, and gained ground in markets such as Brazil, Turkey, China and the U.K.In 2013, Danone's Nutricia unit in China was investigated following bribery allegations, which claimed that the company had bribed more than 100 doctors at 14 hospitals in Beijing, issued false receipts for reimbursements and gifts, and paid for doctors' junkets between 2010 and 2013.In 2007, Danone sold its baked goods business to Kraft Foods Group Inc (NASDAQ:KRFT) for $7.2 billion, and since then, the company has entered new markets, including in Asia, to expand further.For Hospira, which has a market capitalization of $8.46 billion, the deal would be the biggest one after its acquisition of Australian generic-drug manufacturer Mayne Pharma Group Ltd. in 2007 for about $2 billion."

163,"Mar 25, 2014 03:30PM ET",Here's How The Coffee Market Can Determine What Kind You Drink ,nan,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Wide price spreads for two types of coffee beans traded in New York and London dampen demand for the world’s most popular coffee bean, Latin America’s Arabica, just as demand for Asian Robusta rises.“If you had a little more spread, then you would be growing that [Arabica] demand much stronger,” said BNP Paribas SA EPA:BNP agricultural strategist Keith Flury at a coffee industry conference on Saturday. “But you’re not: you’re growing the Robusta demand.”StartFragmentEndFragmentArabica coffee beans, grown in Brazil, Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America, are the type best known to Western consumers and used exclusively by chains like Starbucks Corporation NASDAQ:SBUX. Robusta beans are largely popular in Asia and in instant coffee. They are produced by Vietnam and the Ivory Coast, among other countries.Traders watch the Arabica-Robusta spread, or price differential, to monitor variations in demand and price. Robusta futures are traded on London’s LIFFE exchange, while Arabica contracts trade in New York. Many consumers and industry experts view Arabica as superior in quality and flavor.“The market is encouraging Arabica rationing and production along with Robusta consumption,” reads a presentation given by Flury on emerging market and currency impacts on coffee. The key price spread last peaked in 2011, though current levels compare more closely to ratios from 2012.Arbitrage between Arabica and Robusta jumped almost 64 percent from January to February, said the International Coffee Organization in its latest monthly report. By the start of March, the differential exceeded $1 per pound, as Robusta stocks fell to their lowest level on record on the London futures market.Back at the end of 2013, BNP Paribas forecast stronger Arabica consumption in 2014, based on low prices and little difference in Arabica-Robusta prices. Now that Arabica coffee prices have rallied dramatically thanks to drought in Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, that view must be revised, according to Flury.   “The idea that the world is going to consume more Arabica in 2014: we have to review that again,” said Flury during his presentation. “It’s probably not going to happen on the kind of scale we envisioned, especially with the arbitrage as high as it is.”Coffee demand has grown slowly but steadily over the past decade, driven mostly by emerging markets. Consumers have drunk more Robusta relative to Arabica, as the latter bean has ceded significant share of global demand.  “The growth in demand in Robusta far outweighs the growth in demand of Arabica,” said Flury. “If you look at the demand globally of Arabica, it’s actually been relatively flat for a number of years now.”Coffee is the best performing commodity for the year to date, gaining 58 percent since the start of 2014. That has been one of the steepest and fastest price gains in coffee ever. One recent 20 percent surge came as the steepest weekly rally since 1999, reported Reuters.High price differentials can even push coffee roasters to tweak the composition of their coffee blends, to take advantage of cheap Robusta prices, according to the ICO.“If the arbitrage is too high, he might want to use more robusta to reduce the total cost,” said Mauricio Galindo, the organization’s head of operations, in an email to IBTimes.  Arabica-robusta coffee blends, frowned upon by some market participants, were last seen in 2011, when Arabica coffee touched over $3 per pound. On Tuesday, Arabica coffee traded at $1.74/lb in New York."

Since then, the Fed purchased USD85 billion in bonds a month until late 2013, when it began tapering the program.Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included Boeing, up 2.33%, Johnson & Johnson, up 2.05%, and Goldman Sachs, up 1.99%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst performers included Cisco, down 0.48%, Coca-Cola, which was up 0.17%, and American Express, up 0.26%."

Tuesday on expectations that policymakers can come up with a
solution to save Greece from missing its July debt payment and
avoid short-term contagion risk to euro zone peripheral
countries.	 Banks, which have significant exposure to Greece and other
euro zone peripherals, advanced, with the STOXX Europe 600 bank
index up 0.8 percent. The banking index is down 5.8
percent this year.	 Yet the rally could proved short-lived, with a confidence
vote in the Greek parliament for Prime Minister George
Papandreou due later in the day. Failure to win the vote would
put a 12 billion euros lifeline in doubt and raise near-term
concerns about Athens' ability to meet its debt payment next
month.	 Euro zone finance ministers said the Greek government,
parliament and broader society had until July 3 to approve new
steps in order to get the next instalment of 110 billion euros
in EU and International Monetary Fund aid agreed in May 2010.	 ""The market is likely to lack true conviction. The Greek
situation continues to cast a very long shadow over the market.
All eyes are going to be on the political vote in Greece to see
where that leads us,"" said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at
Hargreaves Lansdown.	 Even if Papandreou survives, euro zone policymakers want the
private sector to take part in a second bailout package, but
Fitch Ratings warned it would treat a voluntary rollover of
Greece's sovereign bonds as default. 	 By 0809 GMT, Greece's benchmark rose 1.4 percent and
the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares
was up 0.8 percent at 1,089.75 points, after falling 0.5 percent
in the previous session to a three-month closing low.	 The pan-European benchmark is down 2.8 percent this year.	  BUY LEVEL 	 Oil and gas stocks rebounded 1.6 percent after a
four-day losing run, with BP up 2.9 percent and Royal
Dutch Shell  up 1 percent.	 ""From a valuation perspective, the equity market is very
attractive. In a more normal environment, we would clearly be at
a 'buy' level,"" said Marco Bruzzo, fund manager at Mirabaud
Gestion AM, which has 10 billion Swiss francs ($11.86 billion)
under management.	 ""But on the short term, the market is reined in by the
sovereign debt crisis, i.e. U.S. economic slowdown and China's
inflation risks.""	 Bruzzo favours stocks with strong cashflow and pricing
power, such as Danone and L'Oreal , and is
underweight Spanish and Italian stocks.	 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.9 percent after losing 2
percent the previous session and Spain's IBEX 35 gained
1.5 percent, while the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Index
 put on 1.5 percent.	 Despite the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and a slowing
global growth, many companies have strong balance sheets and are
on the prowl for possible takeover targets to expand their
business after the economic crisis.	 SABMiller was the latest on the merger and
acquisition trail. It offered to buy Foster's Group for
$10.1 billion in cash, though the offer was rejected by the
Australian company. Shares in SABMiller fell 2 percent in strong
volume. 	 The value of global M&A deals totalled $1.38 trillion so far
this year, up 43 percent over the same period last year, data
from Thomson Reuters showed.

185,"Apr 14, 2011 07:16AM ET",Miners pull FTSE lower ahead of Chinese data,nan," * FTSE down 1 percent * Miner hits as concerns over China's inflation resurface * Reckitt drops as CEO retires  By David Brett LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Miners weighed on Britain's top
share index on Thursday as concerns over the Chinese economy
re-emerged, while investors reacted nervously to the retirement
of Reckitt Benckiser's chief executive. By 1052 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 59.01 points, or 1
percent, at 5,951.43, having closed 0.8 percent higher at
6,010.44 in the previous session ""The 45-point gain (on Wednesday was) not enough to suggest
that Tuesday's (1.5 percent) slide was an aberration,"" a
technical analyst at Charles Stanley said. ""I would reiterate the FTSE has breached its short-term
uptrend and has not yet done enough to convince that this is
going to be reversed in a hurry."" Miners fell along with base metal prices as investors shied
away from riskier assets. Analysts cited concerns ahead of
Chinese inflation and GDP data due on Friday. Chinese inflation in March accelerated to 5.4 percent from a
year earlier, Hong Kong media said on Thursday, which will add
weight to the government's vow to rein in price rises. ""For the coming months we expect increasing volatilities in
cyclical sectors with a more selective and less steady
performance trend,"" analysts at Unicredit said in an equity
strategy note, citing the impact of China's inflation and growth
concerns. Integrated oils also fell, with BP down 1 percent. BP and
Russia's Rosneft extended by a month the deadline to complete a
$16 billion share swap hours before its expiry, giving more time
to salvage the deal. In the resources sector, commodities trading giant Glencore
published details of long-awaited plans to raise up to $12.1
billion in a London and Hong Kong offering.  RECKITT RETREATS British consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser fell 6.5
percent after the firm said Chief Executive Bart Becht is to
retire, six months after announcing the departure of its chief
financial officer. ""It was one of the most highly regarded management teams, I
would have said, in the FTSE,"" Martin Dolan, an analyst at
Espirito Santo, said. ""The fact that they've both gone now I think is basically
going to cause some people to reassess (the situation)."" Chip designer ARM Holdings continued its recent erratic
form, falling 2.3 percent, having risen 6.7 percent in the
previous session on excitement surrounding Microsoft's
conference in Las Vegas and its use of ARM-based technology. Concerns over the impact on the supply chain as a result of
Japan's earthquake remain. ""(The Japan supply issue) is not going to affect in the
short term, it's more the long term going into Q2, Q3,"" Martin
Dobson, head of trading at Westhouse Securities, said. ""If they do get supply problems with components, those will
probably manifest themselves in forward earnings and I think
you'll probably see cautionary statements coming from a few tech
components and chip makers and the hardware companies if they
have Japanese supply."" Investor locked in gains on banks, a sector dogged by
regulatory uncertainty. Lloyds Banking Group shed 1.1 percent as Barclays Capital
cut its target price and kept its ""underweight"" rating on the
bank, saying the UK's Independent Commission on Banking's stance
on Lloyds ""will further dilute returns"". On the upside, 3I Group rose 1.2 percent boosted by the
partial realisation of its investment in Go Outdoors announced
late on Wednesday, and technical factors following a 12 percent
fall in April, traders said. Unilever climbed 0.7 percent as French peer Danone released
a strong first-quarter update. (Additional reporting by Brenda Goh and Tricia Wright.

Thursday, as worries over Chinese inflation and doubts about the
earnings season kept investors on edge, but losses were limited
as a main index managed to stay above a key support level. Tech shares featured among the top losers, with Ericsson
 down 2.7 percent, on lingering concerns over the
impact from Japan's crisis on the sector's supply chain. Sony Corp <6758.T> said it is mulling a two-week summer
shutdown of some company premises to save energy as Tokyo and
Japan's northern regions face the peak period with significantly
reduced power generation capacity following last month's
devastating quake. [ID:nL3E7FE08T] At 0833 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,132.88 points. It fell
to as low as 1,129.90, just above a key support level at
1,129.09 points, which represents the 50 percent retracement of
the index's drop from a February peak to a March low. Despite Thursday's retreat, investors' risk appetite was on
the rise, with the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index 
falling 2.5 percent. Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed source, said
China's annual rate of inflation in March was likely to be
5.3-5.4 percent, a 32-month high. [ID:nL3E7FE0EO] ""Inflation in emerging economies has become a serious issue,
as the impact from high commodity prices is stronger for those
countries,"" said Arnaud Scarpaci, fund manager at Paris-based
Agilis Gestion, which has 80 million euros under management. Resource-related shares fell, with Rio Tinto  down
1.2 percent and BHP Billiton  down 1.5 percent as metal
prices retreated. Losses in the sector, however, were limited by news of
Glencore's plans to raise up to $12.1 billion in an initial
offering. ""The fact they are going ahead during this slight softness
means they are very confident that prices will remain quite
robust,"" IG Markets analyst Cameron Peacock said. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index  was down 0.3
percent, Germany's DAX index  down 0.07 percent, and
France's CAC 40  down 0.3 percent. Shares in Roche  fell 0.9 percent after the
pharmaceutical group posted quarterly sales that missed
forecast, while Danone  rose 2.5 percent after
reporting forecast-beating sales. ""Overall, I think that quarterly results will be good. But
the real focus should be on earnings from big U.S. industrial
firms, which will shed light on the outlook for the U.S. economy
and the Fed's next moves,"" Agilis Gestion's Scarpaci said. ""In terms of valuation, the European stock market is the
most attractive, and its potential is underestimated at the
moment. Just look at Credit Agricole, trading at a price-to-book
ratio of 0.6, that's extremely low.""

lower on Thursday, as concerns over Chinese inflation moved back
into focus, and Reckitt Benckiser fell sharply as it announced
the shock retirement of its star chief executive. British consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser fell 7.7
percent after the firm said Chief Executive Bart Becht is to
retire, six months after the departure of its chief financial
officer. ""It was one of the most highly regarded management teams, I
would have said, in the FTSE,"" Martin Dolan, an analyst at
Espirito Santo, says. ""The fact that they've both gone now I think is basically
going to cause some people to reassess (the situation)."" By 0910 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 30.46 points, or 0.5
percent, at 5,979.98, having closed 0.8 percent higher at
6,010.44 in the previous session. Miners fell along with base metal prices as investors shied
away from riskier assets. Analysts cited concerns over Chinese
inflation. ""(Chinese inflation) might well be a focus. Overnight the
Asian markets were tangibly cut and we saw interest rate policy
in likes of Singapore increase, which may have add a little to
nerves as we wait for those Chinese inflation (and GDP figures
on Friday),"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Chinese inflation in March accelerated to 5.4 percent from a
year earlier, Hong Kong media said on Thursday, which will add
weight to the government's vow to rein in price rises. Economists polled by Reuters had expected annual inflation
in March to be 5.2 percent, up from February's 4.9 percent. ""For the coming months we expect increasing volatilities in
cyclical sectors with a more selective and less steady
performance trend,"" analysts at Unicredit said in an equity
strategy note, citing the impact of China's inflation and growth
concerns. In the resources sector, commodities trading giant Glencore
published details of long-awaited plans to raise up to $12.1
billion in a London and Hong Kong offering.  BANKS RETREAT Banks, Wednesday's top performers after JP Morgan results
helped boost confidence, retreated as investors locked in
profits on a sector still dogged by regulatory uncertainty. Lloyds Banking Group shed 1.1 percent as Barclays Capital
cut its target price and kept its ""underweight"" rating on the
bank, saying the UK's Independent Commission on Banking's stance
on Lloyds ""will further dilute returns"". On the upside, Intercontinental Hotels rose 1.2 percent with
traders citing a bullish note from Morgan Stanley. Oil services firms AMEC, Wood Group, and Petrofac rose up to
0.6 percent as Unicredit initiated coverage on all three
companies with ""buy"" ratings. Unilever climbed 0.7 percent as French peer Danone released
a strong first-quarter update. Retailer Marks & Spencer rose 0.7 percent as the beleagured

to post strong first-quarter sales growth on Thursday helped by
higher prices and a recent deal in Russia, with the focus on how
it handles rising commodity costs. The world's largest yoghurt maker with brands like Actimel
and Activia is expected to show like-for-like sales growth of
6.8 percent in the first three months of 2011 according to both
a Reuters poll of 14 analysts and a company-compiled consensus. The Paris-based group, which also owns Badoit and Evian
bottled water and Bledina babyfood, is faced by rising commodity
costs, especially milk, but is confident it can offset these
pressures by higher prices and internal cost savings. Analysts say the key will be what effect price rises will
have on sales volumes with austerity measures in many western
European nations crimping consumer spending and some emerging
markets showing signs of a slowdown in growth. With fresh dairy products accounting for nearly 60 percent
of sales, analysts said Danone's comments on milk costs and its
ability to raise its prices will be closely watched. ""We believe Q1 could surprise positively as pricing starts
to come through and yet consumer habits tend to be 'sticky' and
hence downtrading may take a while to occur,"" said analyst Sara
Welford at brokers Citi. Danone has already said the first quarter had started in the
same positive way as 2010 finished when fourth-quarter sales
rose 6.9 percent, and also has said input cost increases will be
at the top of its previous 6-9 percent range for 2011. Analysts expect the group to confirm its target of 6-8
percent like-for-like sales growth for 2011 and operating
margins up 0.2 percent at 15.4 percent helped by its dairy
products merger with Russia's Unimilk completed at end-November. Overall group sales at Danone are expected to rise 16.7
percent to 4.64 billion euros, according to the Reuters poll.

190,"Apr 13, 2011 08:32AM ET",Morocco Royal holding's assets soar amid protests,nan," * SNI's profit more than trebled in 2010 * Assets at more than $13 bln * Protesters demand that SNI 'degage'  By Souhail Karam RABAT, April 13 (Reuters) - An investment holding company
controlled by Morocco's royal family has announced a sharp surge
in net profit and assets in 2010 amid street demands for King
Mohammed to reduce his business and political clout. National Investment Co., or SNI, made a consolidated net
profit of 8.28 billion dirhams ($1.06 billion) in 2010, up from
2.38 billion in 2009, according to financial statements
published over the weekend in Le Matin, one of Morocco's most
pro-establishment newspapers. Siger, the firm that groups the main business interests of
the Moroccan royal family, holds a stake of around 60 percent in
SNI, market sources said. Officials at SNI could not immediately
be reached to confirm the figure. SNI's assets and turnover rose more than fourfold to 102.6
billion dirhams and 14.08 billion respectively in 2010 compared
with 22.53 billion dirhams and 3.43 billion in 2009. Based on the latest growth forecasts, Morocco's 2010 Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) should stand at 761.6 billion dirhams. SNI gave no explanation for its performance in 2010.  However, in August SNI and ONA Group, in which SNI already
held a majority stake, both delisted from the Casablanca bourse
to pave the way for a merger that would see ONA transfer all its
assets to SNI. ""The rise in net profit appears to have been fuelled by
capital gains on the transfer to SNI of assets ONA owned in
listed firms,"" a market source said. Explaining what prompted SNI to publish its financial
statements after being delisted, another source said: ""It had to
publish its financial statements because it has bonds traded in
the stock market"". Both sources did not want to be named citing
a ""sensitive political context"". Debt, which SNI itemised as non-recurring financial debt,
stood at 30.91 billion dirhams by the end of 2010 against 7.57
billion at the end of 2009. Of those, bonds totalled 13.7
billion dirhams against 3.9 billion a year earlier. A youth protest movement is spearheading calls for the king
to transfer his executive powers to elected politicians and
reduce his business clout. They, and many business leaders, say firms controlled by the
king and his close inner circle dominate key economic sectors.
At times, demonstrators have carried placards reading 'SNI
degage' -- or 'SNI clear off'. SNI has stakes in mines, steel, cement, supermarkets, sugar
refining, banking, telecommunications, insurance and renewable
energy. It is involved in partnerships with French firms
including Lafarge, Danone and Renault.  SNI also holds a 48.3 percent stake in AttijariWafa, North
Africa's biggest bank by assets. SNI is putting some of those stakes up for sale, including
AttijariWafa, Cosumar and Lesieur, the latter two being the
country's sole sugar refiner and its biggest cooking oil
producer.

191,"Apr 12, 2011 09:52AM ET",PREVIEW-Price rises and cost cuts help European food firms,nan,"* European food groups look to pricing for growth * Pricing, cost cuts to offset high input costs * Three big European food groups to report Q1 results * Danone: April 14, Nestle: April 15, Unilever: April 28  By Dominique Vidalon and Silke Koltrowitz PARIS/ZURICH, April 12 (Reuters) - Price rises pushed
through by Europe's biggest food groups will have helped to
offset higher commodity costs and tough mature markets to see
their sales growth momentum continuing into the first quarter. Nestle, Unilever and Danone all report sales figures this
month for the first three months of 2011, and the timing of
their price rises will be critical in offsetting the effect of
higher input costs. All three say price rises and internal cost savings in 2011
should offset the increased costs of commodities such as grain,
milk, cocoa and crude oil to drive sales growth close to 2010
levels and maintain profit margins or even nudge them up. ""On balance, we expect good sets of figures across the board
for Q1 sales, but the outlook is likely to remain cautious,""
said analyst Sara Welford at brokers Citi. Michael Steib at Morgan Stanley says growth is increasingly
driven by higher prices, and he anticipates the peak impact of
input cost inflation only by mid-2011. France's Danone kicks off the reporting season on April 14
with analysts expecting underlying first-quarter sales growth of
6.8 percent, including its Unimilk deal, according to both a
Reuters poll of 14 analysts and a company compiled consensus. CEO Franck Riboud told analysts late last month the
first-quarter had started in the same positive stance that the
group finished 2010, when the fourth-quarter grew 6.9 percent. The world's largest yoghurt maker with brands like Actimel
and Activia is expected to confirm its targets for underlying
sales growth of 6-8 percent in 2011 and operating margins up 0.2
percent at 15.4 percent. Analysts say the company has guided that input cost
increases will be at the top of its previous 6-9 percent range,
with the group heavily dependent on fresh milk prices, which
accounts for a third of its raw material and packaging costs. Danone completed its dairy products merger with Russia's
Unimilk at end-November to create the nation's top dairy product
group and make Russia its largest market. Danone owns 58 percent
of the new entity and privately-owned Unimilk 42 percent.  NESTLE, UNILEVER The world's largest food group Nestle is set to show
first-quarter underlying sales up 5.7 percent on April 15,
according to both a Reuters poll of six analysts and a company
compiled consensus, compared to 6 percent in 2010 and 5.7
percent calculated by analysts for the fourth-quarter. The Swiss maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars
has warned input costs would rise 8-10 percent on its cost base
of 30 billion Swiss francs in 2011, and analysts will look for
confirmation it can price and cut costs to protect profits. They expect Nestle to confirm its target for 5-6 percent
growth in 2011 and an improvement in operating margins, and will
look for comments on share buybacks as the group has said it
aimed to conclude its current 10 billion Swiss franc buyback in
the first half of 2011 and then decide on a new one. Anglo-Dutch Unilever is expected to report underlying
first-quarter sales growth of 4.2 percent in a poll of six
analysts by Reuters when it reports on April 28, following 5.1
percent growth in the fourth-quarter and 4.1 percent for 2010. The Knorr soup and Ben & Jerry's ice cream group has warned
that commodity costs are expected to rise by 4 percent of its
turnover in 2011 -- or nearly 1.8 billion euros -- which
analysts calculate as a rise of 12 percent, but the group is
confident pricing and cost cuts will offset this effect. The group is seen likely to reiterate its target for
profitable volume growth ahead of its market and for margin
improvement in 2011, and has said it should be able to grow
underlying sales annually at some 4-6 percent.

 By Atul Prakash LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - European shares bounced back on Friday and were
on track to post weekly gains for a third time in a row, with financials
rebounding after the previous session's sharp declines and some companies riding
on soothing results. But gains were capped after data showed Britain's economy contracted
unexpectedly in the third quarter of this year, squashing hopes of an end to the
downturn and instead making the current recession the longest on record. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.5 percent to
1,019.32 points by 1052 GMT after falling 1.1 percent on Thursday. The index,
which fell 45 percent in 2008, is up 23 percent this year and has gained almost
60 percent from a record low hit in March. In the past two weeks, barring one exception, the index has followed a
pattern by rising one day and falling in the next. Analysts said the behaviour
showed that investors were cautious in trading. ""That's a clear sign that the positive momentum is losing steam and there is
a real risk of a pull back, especially after a rally of 60 percent,"" said Koen
De Leus, economist at KBC Securities. ""Getting into the market now looks to me pretty risky. If you go into the
market now, see that you have something to fall back on, like stop-loss orders.
See that you have your parachute ready,"" he added. Financials were among the top gainers, with the DJ STOXX banking index
bouncing back after falling 1.9 percent in the previous session. The sector
index was up 0.6 percent on Friday and has spiked 172 percent since its March
lows. Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe
Generale and Credit Agricole rose between 1.5 to 3.2 percent. BNP Paribas, which said late on Thursday its 4.3 billion euro ($6.44
billion) rights issue has been subscribed 2.5 times, added 2.2 percent. Energy shares also gained ground as crude oil prices steadied to hold above
$81 a barrel. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol and
StatoilHydro added 0.1 to 1.4 percent. French oil major Total was up 0.5 percent. The company said it has made an
offshore oil discovery in Angola. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40
rose 0.8-1.1 percent.  RISK APPETITE RISES  The VDAX-NEW volatility index -- a gauge of investor risk aversion -- fell
to a one-week low on Friday, down 3.2 percent on the day, and flirting with a
13-month low. The lower the volatility index, which is based on sell and buy-options on
Frankfurt's top-30 stocks, the higher is investors' appetite for risky assets
such as equities. ""The market is rebounding, but it will remain stuck in a range, at least
until we get a clear catalyst,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff, technical analyst at
Aurel BGC, in Paris. ""Investors have been digesting corporate results and are now starting to

fresh one-year high. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,
Xstrata and ENRC rose 0.8 to 3.5 percent. World number two truckmaker Volvo jumped 6.8 percent after it made a smaller
third-quarter loss than expected, easing fears it would need more cash from
investors, though it still expects sharp declines in its main markets. French food group Danone was up 1.3 percent after the company said price
cuts and a step-up in advertising helped accelerate the recovery in fresh dairy
sales volumes in the third quarter. Syngenta AG, the world's largest agrochemicals maker, was up 2.9 percent.
Its chief executive told Reuters that the company is more optimistic about its
prospects for 2010 and sees a return to growth.

 (Adds detail, analyst quote, valuations) PARIS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - French food group Danone said
price cuts and a step-up in advertising helped accelerate the
recovery in fresh dairy sales volumes in the third quarter and
added that it was confident about next year. Quarterly sales at the group, whose top brands include
Activia and Actimel yoghurts, fell 1.7 percent to 3.78 billion
euros ($5.66 billion), pulled down by currency movements. At
constant rates like-for-like revenue rose 4.1 percent. Dairy volumes rose 7 percent, compared with 2.7 percent in
the second quarter and five quarters of declines before that,
Danone said on Friday. ""The sharpening of pricing in fresh dairy has delivered
excellent volume growth,"" independent analyst James Amoroso
said. ""We are now starting to see Danone returning to its former
glory."" Danone was expected on average to post third-quarter sales
of 3.82 billion euros, according to analysts polled by Reuters,
on dairy volume growth of 4.59 percent. Shares in Danone rose as much as 3.7 percent and were up 1.5
percent at 42.21 euros by 1015 GMT, compared with a 0.9 percent
rise on the French benchmark CAC 40 index. Danone makes about 57 percent of sales in dairy and has cut
prices, after raising them 10 percent last year, to buoy demand
as the economic crisis has dented consumer budgets. It has also
enjoyed growth at its baby food and medical nutrition units. The company, which says its dairy products help the
digestive and immune systems, trades at around 16 times forecast
2010 earnings, compared with multiples of nearly 15 for rivals
Nestle and Unilever. ""We believe that the momentum Danone is currently
experiencing is likely to set up for much better organic growth
in 2010 ... and in 2011,"" Bernstein Research analyst Andrew Wood
said in an email. Danone said second-half like-for-like sales growth would be
close to 4 percent, with an improvement in full-year operating
margin of 60-70 basis points. It repeated its forecast for 2009
fully diluted earnings per share to rise 10 percent. ING Financial Markets analyst Marco Gulpers said the
forecasts were in line with market expectations and signalled
that full-year sales would grow 3 percent like-for-like. Danone finance head Pierre-Andre Terisse told analysts milk
prices would likely increase in coming quarters, but said any
rises would not be dramatic and could be offset by productivity
improvements and ""competitive"" increases in its own prices. ""I have no concern on the growth for the dairy division in
the coming quarters,"" Terisse said. Overall, third-quarter dairy revenue fell 2.5 percent to
2.15 billion euros for a like-for-like rise of 2.3 percent. Group sales were dragged down 4.5 percent by exchange rate
changes ""mainly driven by the Polish zloty, the Mexican peso,
the Russian rouble and the British pound"", Danone said. Baby food sales rose 4.8 percent in the third quarter, while
medical nutrition revenue was 8.6 percent higher, Danone added. The group's water business, which has been struggling in some
developed markets, saw quarterly sales fall 8.7 percent overall
but rise 4.6 percent like-for-like, boosted by emerging markets
and a rebound in France, the UK and Germany. Nestle, the world's biggest food group, said on Thursday
that nine-month sales fell 2.2 percent to 79.5 billion Swiss
francs ($78.8 billion), below analysts' average forecast of 80.3
billion, hit by currency effects. The Swiss company reiterated its full-year forecasts. Danone raised 3.05 billion euros earlier this year in its
first capital increase in 22 years to cut debt and buy smaller
rivals hurt by the financial crisis. Terisse reiterated on Friday that the company was looking at
and working on small and medium-sized acquisitions up to 1
billion euros.

197,"Oct 16, 2009 09:03AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Risks to global equity rally,nan," (Clarifies penultimate paragraph) By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Four major risks threaten a solid
year-end rally to cap this year's stunning bounce back by global
equities -- earnings, bonds, currencies and cash. Investor optimism has been so unrestrained recently that
good earnings are beginning to be dismissed because they do not
meet exaggerated expectations. Take Goldman Sachs this week, for example. It beat earnings
expectations by 23 percent on a per share basis but the
announcement was met with disappointment. Stocks fell and the dollar rose initially when the results
came out because the market was so ebullient it was willing to
believe a so-called ""whisper number"" for the earnings at the
wildest edge of speculation. In the event, stocks recovered to close higher on the day.
But disappointments were the order of the day on Friday. Nonetheless, world stocks begin next week at 12-month highs,
up well over 70 percent from their March lows. High-yielding
currencies are in huge demand and emerging market debt spreads
have narrowed about half a percentage point in October alone. Underlining it all, measures of the volatility of Wall
Street stocks are falling. The VIX volatililty index, the ""fear
gauge"", has broken below its recent range and is now at
 ""normal"", pre-crisis levels. That in itself automatically creates buy signals in many
trading models. ---------------------------------------------------------- For a graphic showing the VIX and its ""normal"" levels, click
on http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/109/GLB_VIXRG1009.gif ---------------------------------------------------------- This all points to risk-hungry investors entering a new week
with the bit between their teeth again, despite the odd
disappointment such as Friday's Bank of America loss. ""Earnings turned in the second quarter of this year. We are
on track for a good 18 months of corporate earnings growth,""
said Bob Parker, vice chairman of Credit Suisse's asset
management arm. The market is enjoying high levels of liquidity, a store of
investor cash and generally positive economic numbers, he said.  Underlying economic numbers such as Chinese trade and
lending, UK unemployment, U.S. retail sales and euro zone
manufacturing have come in better than expected. Reuters polls this week found expectations among economists
that the U.S. and euro zone economies came out of recession in
the third quarter.  RISK APPETITE There are, nonetheless, the four risks. Much of the latest
tranche of the stock rally is based on optimism over earnings. Notwithstanding Goldman's failure to meet excessive
expectations and the Bank of America results, many reports have
been positive, among them JPMorgan Chase, Google and IBM. Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows that as of
Thursday, with 10 percent of S&P 500 index companies having
reported, 82 percent had beaten expectations. Should many others come in below forecast or expectations
rise too high Goldman-like, the market would be vulnerable to a
quick reversal. Retailers will be in focus next week and Europe will have
its first full week of reporting. Results are due from Apple,
Nestle, Danone, Coca-Cola, Cadbury, Hershey, LVMH, PPR, Ahold
and Home Retail. Government bond yields, in the meantime, have been rising
modestly this month as equities have gained and risk appetite
built up. The risk is that this becomes more rapid, creating a
sell-off that would send borrowing rates through the roof. The factors mitigating against this are continued low rates
and quantitative easing from central banks along with muted
inflationary pressures. This leaves markets highly sensitive to any hint that
authorities are seeking to exit from the programmes the set in
place to combat the financial crisis. Australia, for example,
has already begun raising rates.
 PARITY All eyes next week will also be on the currency markets
where the dollar's overall decline has begun to concern those
countries whose currencies are rising as a result. ""If we have dollar/euro going to $1.60 very quickly that
would put a big constraint on euro zone economic recovery,
likewise the yen at 85,"" Credit Suisse's Parker said. The dollar was a fair way from these levels on Friday, at
around $1.49 to the euro and 91 yen -- but the fact that these
levels are being mentioned shows the sentiment towards the
dollar. It has fallen 6.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies this year. Parity, meanwhile, is drawing nearer for the U.S.
dollar/Canadian dollar, dollar/Swiss franc and euro/sterling. 
The psychological impact of hitting such rates would magnify the
official reaction, exporters' scramble to hedge, and the
complaints about loss of competitive advantage. Finally, there are signs that the tidal wave of cash that
was put into money market funds at the height of the financial
crisis has now mostly been thrown back into other assets this
year. ""The latest outflows from money market funds took the YTD
total to $396 billion, equal to nearly 94 percent of the total
weekly inflows recorded by this fund group during 2008,"" Fund
trackers EPFR Global said this week. (Additional reporting by Swaha Pattanaik; graphic by Scott

200,"Sep 08, 2009 08:03AM ET",Cadbury's best bet is more cash from Kraft-analysts,nan," * Bigger cash element needed to attract Cadbury * Counterbidder seen unlikely * Kraft bid needs to be 820p plus to succeed - analysts * Cadbury trades up 2.2 percent, Kraft down 2.1 percent
premarket  By David Jones ZURICH, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Britain's Cadbury has few options
but to look for a higher bid and more cash after Kraft's 10.2
billion pound ($16.7 billion) offer for the world's No 2
confectionery group, analysts said on Tuesday. Investors like the logic of the combination and few, if any,
counterbidders are seen likely to emerge, raising the pressure
on Cadbury's management to do a deal at the right price. Kraft launched its bid on Monday at 300p cash and 0.2589 new
Kraft shares per Cadbury share, valuing the British group at
745p at Kraft's Friday closing share price, with the U.S. group
seeing annual deal cost savings of $625 million. ""We expect Cadbury's management to mount an aggressive
defence, but confess to seeing few options on the table as a
standalone company that would get the share price to 745p, let
alone if there were a higher offer,"" said Warren Ackerman at
Evolution Securities. The bid from Kraft on Monday is seen as an opening low shot
in a bidding battle, and Cadbury's shareholders will not be keen
on 60 percent of the price, or around $10 billion, coming in the
form of Kraft's U.S.-listed shares, analysts said, adding that 
investors would prefer more cash. ""We think Kraft is underbidding the potential synergies and
see the high Kraft equity component to the consideration as a
deterrent for Cadbury shareholders,"" said Martin Deboo at
Investec Securities. JP Morgan expected a raised bid of 820p while Banc of
America-Merrill Lynch saw 820-830p. The value of the cash and
paper bid will fall if Kraft shares dip as they open later
Tuesday for the first time since the bid. Kraft shares were down
2.1 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. Cadbury shares were up 2.2 percent at 800p at 1150 GMT after
a hefty rise of 38 percent on Monday when they touched 808p.
Kraft shares did not trade on Monday due to a market holiday. ""We see the proposal of 745p as an opening shot by Kraft. A
price of 850-875p, comparable with other major food deals, we
think is needed to win the day,"" said food industry analyst
Charlie Mills at brokers Credit Suisse.  NO BIDDING WAR Kepler analyst Jon Cox said he did not believe a bidding war
will emerge, given that Nestle, which is pretty much the only
company with the financial resources to make a bid, has
signalled it is not interested. Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said on Monday he was
open to opportunities if they fit strategically, but reiterated
the group did not plan any big acquisitions in 2009 or 2010. ""Kraft wants Cadbury and we presume the two sides will
settle at 850p per share or 14 times 2009 estimated EV/EBITDA,""
said Cox. Some analysts say Nestle may get together with Hershey with
Nestle taking Cadbury's gums and Hershey the chocolate to get
around anti-trust problems in chocolate. Kraft is looking at a Cadbury deal to become the world's
biggest confectionery group, tapping into Cadbury's big emerging
market exposure, and boosting the U.S. group's overall growth
rate in a deal which should encounter few anti-trust problems. The move would catapult Kraft to global No 1 in
confectionery with a 14.8 percent share ahead of Mars-Wrigley's
14.6 percent as it would join together Kraft's No 5 position
with a 4.7 percent share and Cadbury's No 2 global position. Kraft's Milka chocolate brand is one of the U.S. group's
nine brands with sales of over $1 billion while it has smaller
brands like Toblerone, Cote D'Or, Terry's and Suchard, to join
with Cadbury's Dairy Milk, Trident gum and Halls cough sweets. Kraft is the world's second biggest food group after Nestle
with 2008 sales of around $42 billion, dwarfing Cadbury's $11
billion, and it boosted its snacks business with the acquisition
of Danone's biscuits in 2007. Credit Suisse's Mills said the current Kraft offer equates
to 12.5 times his 2009 EBITDA forecast for Cadbury, compared to
an average price of 14 times for big food deals over the last 10
years, though Wrigley was bought by Mars last year at a more
giddy price of 17.6 times.Putting Cadbury shares on a Wrigley deal multiple would
equate to a price of 11 pounds, Mills said. (Reporting by David Jones; editing by Sitaraman Shankar)

it can create a ""global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery and
quick meals"" with combined revenues of about $50 billion. Cadbury, the world's second biggest confectionery group, has
rejected the approach by Kraft, which still hopes it can clinch

 (Adds fresh CEO, analyst quotes on outlook, acquisitions) By Andras Gergely DUBLIN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Food maker Kerry Group Plc posted
a 7 percent rise in first-half profit on Tuesday and improved
its 2009 earnings growth target, highlighting the sector's
strong prospects and a sign of improvement for the Irish
economy. Kerry sells foods ranging from sausages to smoothies but
makes more money supplying ingredients and seasonings to others
in the Americas, Europe and Asia, helping it to quickly refocus
towards cheaper items such as fast food in the recession. Shares in the company, Ireland's third-largest listed
company, rose 2.8 percent by 1130 GMT, as investors applauded
the prospect of continuing margin growth and an improved 2009
earnings forecast. The group said it expected earnings per share at the upper
end of the 160 to 165 cent range it had given in February. ""An improving margin picture is being played out across the
sector ... the earnings outlook in food manufacturing looks
positive,"" analyst John O'Reilly at brokerage Davy said. He pointed to Cadbury, Nestle and Danone as recent examples
of companies with rising margins, helped by low input prices. Kerry's revenue dropped by 3.2 percent like-for-like in the
first half to 2.27 billion euros ($3.3 billion) but cost savings
helped boost adjusted earnings to 67.2 cents per share, 2 cents
above the average of three analysts' forecasts. Kerry said sales of its brands such as Wall's and Richmond
sausages and children's snack Cheestrings were growing in the
UK, with the dominance of supermarkets' cheaper ""own brand""
items set to ease in the emerging economic recovery.
 The Irish market was further from returning to normality but
also seen turning a corner, McCarthy said. ""The worst is probably behind us or will be by the end of
this year from an Irish perspective on the retail side of our
business,"" Stan McCarthy, Kerry's chief executive, told Reuters.  MORE DEALS Data this month showed retail sales in Ireland fell almost
10 percent in June, the smallest drop so far this year, offering
a glimmer of hope for an economy suffering from one of the
deepest recessions in the industrialised world.  British retail sales in July rose 0.4 percent on the month,
twice as fast as expected. ""The results highlight ... the merit of Kerry's broad
geographic, category, customer, technology and product scope in
the current environment,"" Davy's O'Reilly said. Irish food group Greencore said earlier this month it
expected to improve its profitability this year, helped by
improved consumer sentiment in Britain. Kerry's basic earnings per share in the six months to June
declined to 53.5 cents from 60.1 a year ago due to restructuring
costs and integrating the newly acquired Irish peer Breeo Foods. ""I can see us doing some more deals this year but nothing
huge,"" McCarthy said, adding he was especially interested in
expanding in Asian countries such as India and had 250 million
euros or more to spend on acquisitions each year. Sales at Kerry's ingredients and flavours business dropped
by 1 percent on a like-for-like basis to 1.66 billion euros but
trading profit rose 4.5 percent to 144 million euros.

* Shares dip 2.6 percent 
  (Adds detail) By James Regan PARIS, July 24 (Reuters) - A revival in dairy sales helped
drive Danone to forecast-beating results, but raised questions
as to how long the firm can sustain the price cuts that helped
its key division bounce back. The French food group also benefited from resilient demand
for baby food through the economic crisis, but the rate of the
revenue climb at that division and at medical nutrition -- its
two fastest-growing businesses- - slowed in the second quarter. First-half operating profit increased 8.1 percent
like-for-like to 1.206 billion euros, compared with the average
of forecasts from nine analysts polled by Reuters of 1.187
billion euros, and up from 1.177 billion a year earlier. The firm also reiterated guidance for the full year. Dairy contributed 642 million euros to profits, up from 604
million a year ago, as price cuts ranging from 5 to 30 percent
helped volumes rise 2.7 percent in the second quarter and
reverse five consecutive quarters of declines. ""Volumes were significantly better than we had expected and
indicate that some of Danone's pricing actions and A&P
(advertising and promotion) investments are beginning to pay
off,"" Bernstein Research analyst Andrew Wood said. ""Finally, it
appears that the worst is over for dairy volumes."" Danone raised prices around 10 percent last year, but has
since made reductions, supported by a decrease in milk and
packaging costs, as the economic downturn has crimped customers'
budgets. But there may be a limit to how long Danone can maintain
this level of pricing, Citi analysts wrote in a note. While ""benign dairy costs will continue to facilitate
further price investment through the second half of 2009,
looking forward to 2010, in our mind, it is only a question of
when and not if there is a material rebound in Danone's dairy
costs,"" the analysts said. Danone shares were down 2.6 percent at 36.64 euros by 1039
GMT, against a 0.4 percent firmer French benchmark CAC 40 index. More exposed to dairy than Swiss rival Nestle, Danone stock
has fallen almost 10 percent this year, while Nestle has gained
2 percent. The DJ Stoxx food and beverage index is up 8.7
percent. Danone, which traditionally traded at a premium to rivals,
trades at 15.1 times estimated full-year earnings, compared with
a multiple of 14.8 for Nestle.  FOCUS ON BLOCKBUSTERS Danone, whose top brands include Activia yoghurt and Actimel
probiotic drinking yoghurt, makes 57 percent of sales in dairy. ""The priority remains the blockbusters,"" Chief Financial
Officer Pierre-Andre Terisse told analysts. ""If we were to
choose competition on price only, we would be dead at the end of
the day."" Danone has seen demand at its bottled waters division, which
includes Evian, decline, while baby food and medical nutrition
have achieved significant growth. However, like-for-like sales growth in baby food slowed to
7.4 percent in the second quarter from 10.5 percent in the
first, held back by Russia, Eastern Europe and China, Danone
said. Medical nutrition saw growth slow to 8.8 percent from 10.8
percent, though volumes rose 9.2 percent. Danone raised 3 billion euros in a rights issue last month
to cut debt, buy smaller rivals hurt by the financial crisis and
enable it to grow through the economic downturn. A 15.6 percent rise in free cash flow to 636 million euros
in the first half, along with the rights issue, helped cut net
debt to 6.98 billion euros as of June 30 from 11.06 billion on
Dec. 31, including put options granted to minority shareholders. Danone also confirmed its full-year group targets on Friday. ""Our scenario for 2009 remains that current consumption
patterns in our key emerging and developed markets will continue
over the balance of the year, with no significant improvement or
dramatic breakdown,"" Danone said. Nestle, the world's biggest food group, on June 29 stuck to
its target for 2009 organic sales growth ""at least approaching 5
percent"" and an increase in operating margin.. (Editing by Marcel Michelson, John Stonestreet)

 (Adds background) By Mayumi Negishi and Nathan Layne TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings
Ltd said on Monday it was considering a merger with larger rival
Kirin Holdings Co in a deal that would create one of the world's
largest beverage and food firms. The news sent shares of Kirin soaring 7.8 percent to a
nine-month high and lifted shares of other brewers amid
speculation that a deal would trigger consolidation in the
sector. A merger would put Kirin and unlisted Suntory on par in
revenue terms with U.S.-based Kraft Foods and Pepsico Inc, and
give the two more pricing power in Japan's mature market. ""If a merger is realised, that would give them the market
share to take leadership in pricing and help their soft drinks
businesses -- a chronic weak spot in an ultra-competitive market""
in Japan, said JP Morgan analyst Naomi Takagi. ""It's a huge positive if they can do it."" Suntory spokeswoman Naoko Tsuda said that the company was
considering various options including a merger with Kirin but
that nothing had been decided. Kirin spokesman Mitsutake Matano declined comment on the
possibility of a merger, repeating a statement that Kirin is
working with Suntory on procurement, distribution and other
business activities. Kirin and Suntory are in talks to merge under a holding
company, and aim to agree on the deal this year, the Nikkei
business daily said, citing unidentified sources. The merged firm would be the largest player in the Japanese
beer and soft drink markets and one of the largest worldwide,
with combined annual sales of 3.8 trillion yen ($41 billion),
giving it more resources to seek acquisitions abroad. Some analysts cautioned that a deal was by no means a sure
thing, citing potential regulatory resistance to a merged entity
that would command about half of Japan's beer market. ""It is not at all certain that a deal is really going to
happen. The hurdles ahead are by no means small,"" said Mizuho
Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji. Shares of Kirin rose 7.8 percent to 1,392 yen while the
Nikkei benchmark average fell 2.6 percent. Sapporo Holdings
surged 6.1 percent to 536 yen and Asahi Breweries climbed 2.5
percent to 1,395 yen. If the deal does get regulatory approval, Kirin would
comfortably nudge out Asahi Breweries's 37 percent market share.
It would also capture Suntory's health and soft drink businesses
in southeast Asia and in China, Mizuho's Saji said. ""I don't think Asahi or Sapporo are going to stand idly by,""
he said. The Nikkei said Kirin Holdings President Kazuyasu Kato and
Suntory Holdings President Nobutada Saji met at the end of last
year to initiate talks and they had informed some of their
executives of the merger plan by early July. The two sides will ask for feedback from Japan's anti-trust
regulator as early as this week, it said. Japan's beer market has shrunk by 15 percent in terms of
shipment volumes over the past decade, forcing the industry to
slash costs and look overseas for growth. Earlier this year Kirin, which held 37.5 percent of Japan's
beer market in January-June, agreed to a $2.5 billion buy-out of
Australian brewer Lion Nathan, bringing the total that the maker
of Kirin Lager Beer has spent on acquisitions to 968.5 billion
yen over the past three years. Last year Suntory, which is almost wholly owned by its
founding family, outmanoeuvred both Kirin and Asahi with a more
than 600 million euro ($836 million) deal for Danone's Frucor
juice unit and said it was ready to spend another $2 billion or
so on acquisitions. Suntory, which vies with Sapporo for a distant third place in
Japan's beer market behind Kirin and Asahi, has a product lineup
that includes Malt's beer, Dakara sports drinks, vitamins and a
whiskey that actor Bill Murray endorses in his role in the 2003
film ""Lost in Translation.""

help the two gain clout in Japan's mature market. ""If a merger is realised, that would give them the market
share to take leadership in pricing and help their soft drinks
businesses -- a chronic weak spot in a ultra-competitive market,""
said JP Morgan analyst Naomi Takagi. ""It's a huge positive if they can do it."" Suntory spokeswoman Naoko Tsuda said the company is
considering various options, and that nothing had been decided. When asked if a merger with Kirin was one of the options
under consideration, she said, ""Yes."" Kirin spokesman Mitsutake Matano declined comment on the
possibility of a merger, repeating a statement that while Kirin
is working with Suntory on procurement, distribution and other
business activities, nothing had been decided. Kirin and Suntory are in talks to merge under a holding
company, and aim to agree on the deal this year, the Nikkei
business daily said, citing unidentified sources. The merged firm would be the largest player in the Japanese
beer and soft drink markets, and one of the biggest globally,
with combined annual sales of 3.8 trillion yen ($41 billion),
giving them more resources to seek acquisitions abroad. Some analysts cautioned that a deal was by no means a sure
thing, citing potential regulatory resistance as the firms would
have command about half of Japan's beer market, and noting their
very different corporate cultures. ""It is not at all certain that a deal is really going to
happen. The hurdles ahead are by no means small,"" said Mizuho
Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji. Shares of Kirin were up 8.4 percent at 1,400 yen while the
Nikkei benchmark average was 1 percent lower. Sapporo surged 8.5
percent to 548 yen and Asahi climbed 4.2 percent to 1,418 yen. ""I don't think Asahi or Sapporo are going to stand idly by"",
said Mizho's Saji. The Nikkei said Kirin Holdings President Kazuyasu Kato and
Suntory Holdings President Nobutada Saji met at the end of last
year to initiate talks and they had informed some of their
executives of the merger plan by early July. Japan's beer market has shrunk by 15 percent in terms of
shipment volumes over the past decade, forcing the industry to
slash costs and look overseas for growth. Earlier this year Kirin, which held 37.5 percent of Japan's
beer market in January-June, agreed to a $2.5 billion buy-out of
Australian brewer Lion Nathan, the latest in a series of deals by
the maker of Kirin Lager Beer. Last year Suntory outmanoeuvred both Kirin and Asahi
Breweries Ltd with a more than 600 million euro ($836 million)
deal for Danone's Frucor juice unit and said it was ready spend
another $2 billion or so on acquisitions. Suntory, almost wholly owned by its founding family, and
Kirin hold a combined market share for beer products in Japan of
roughly 50 percent, putting them well ahead of Asahi Breweries at
about 37 percent, industry data show.

207,"Jul 10, 2009 09:08AM ET","ANALYSIS-Ageing, allergies aid Danone as yoghurt cools",nan," * Yoghurt seen weaker during recession, hurting valuation * Medical nutrition to post sustainable high sales growth * Acquisitions seen likely to boost medical nutrition  * Analysts see dairy starting to turn round later this year  By James Regan PARIS, July 10 (Reuters) - The world's biggest yoghurt maker
is not necessarily the first company a person with a milk
allergy would turn to for help. But that is one example of the sort of customer French food
group Danone is targeting to grow its medical nutrition business
alongside baby food as dairy sales dip through the economic
crisis and bottled water loses its sparkle. Acquisitions are likely to play a key part in that
expansion, where barriers to entry in foreign markets are often
high, after Danone carried out a rights issue to raise some 3
billion euros ($4.18 billion).
""As people become more health conscious, I think clinical
nutrition offers huge opportunities for growth,"" said Bernstein
Research analyst Eric Scher. ""It is fast-growth, high-margin. I
believe that double-digit growth can be sustained."" But he said there was no obvious target that could give the
business greater scale overnight: ""I don't think it's going to
be one transformational change. It's going to be smaller
acquisitions and pushing into markets where they are not."" Danone's medical nutrition business provides liquid food for
hospital patients unable to eat solids, food supplements for
elderly people with failing appetites and tailor-made products
for allergy sufferers or those with conditions such as epilepsy.
Brands include Nutricia and Neocate. The division contributed only a tenth as much revenue as
dairy last year, but sales jumped to 854 million euros from just
133 million the previous year, boosted by the purchase of Dutch
group Numico that also helped baby food sales more than triple. Danone last month sold new shares to existing shareholders
to help cut net debt, which reached 11.26 billion euros at the
end of 2008 after the 12.3 billion purchase of Numico in 2007. The company said the move would enable it to make
acquisitions worth up to around 500 million euros. Medical nutrition buys are on the group's radar, with its
footprint ""still very much in its infancy"" and ""very much
focused on Europe"", co-Chief Operating Officer Emmanuel Faber
said when the rights issue was unveiled. It is an ""industry that will consolidate in the next several
years and we intend to be a proactive contributor to this
consolidation,"" he said.  SHARES SUFFER DAIRY DISCOUNT Danone was founded 90 years ago in Spain to promote yoghurt
containing cultures from France's Pasteur Institute to combat
widespread intestinal disorders suffered by children in the
years after World War I. It expanded to France a decade later. But now the company, whose brands include Evian water and
Actimel yoghurt, is seen by some analysts as too dependent on
dairy, parts of which can be vulnerable in recession. Indeed, this is reflected in the fact the shine has come off
Danone's historical valuation premium.
 Danone now trades on a multiple of 13.9 times estimated
full-year earnings, behind larger Swiss rival Nestle on 14.3
times, based on Reuters data. Danone shares have lost 14 percent this year, while Nestle
stock is almost flat. The DJ Stoxx European food and beverage
index has added 4.1 percent this year. Nestle has reduced the proportion of sales from milk
products to around 17 percent and, like Unilever, benefits from
diversification. But at Danone, dairy provided 8.7 billion euros of 2008
sales, more than half the total, growing at 4.8 percent last
year, with its main domestic market saturated and price
competition intensified. Growth slowed to 1.7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Like-for-like dairy and water sales fell in the first three
months of 2009 while medical nutrition was the best performer
with almost 11 percent growth. Bulking up medical nutrition could help Danone shares regain
some of their lost premium, especially as the division is
expected to continue with double-digit percentage growth in
coming years as ageing populations lead to more demand for its
products and the industry consolidates. Fresenius Kabi, part of Germany's Fresenius and Europe's
leading clinical nutrition group, saw 2008 sales rise 23 percent
and operating profit grow 33 percent. It forecast 25-30 percent
sales growth at constant exchange rates in 2009. Nestle Nutrition, which includes the Swiss company's
healthcare, weight control and infant nutrition businesses,
posted 10.4 percent sales growth to 10.4 billion Swiss francs
($9.6 billion) last year, with over half in the Americas. Nestle bought Novartis Medical Nutrition two years ago to
become the world No. 2 in healthcare nutrition. ING Financial Markets analyst Marco Gulpers said that
Danone's Souvenaid multi-nutrient drink for Alzheimer's patients
could grow to sales of around 100 million euros. Another analyst said that mere organic growth in medical
nutrition would not be enough to improve Danone's valuations. ""It is the speed of the acquisitions and putting this
strategy of external growth in place,"" he said. But Danone has certainly not abandoned growth in the dairy
business that made its name and is looking to expand in new
countries with growth potential. This could include the UK, U.S.
and Italy, and not just emerging markets. ""As long as dairy is at least 50 percent of sales that is
what is going to drive the stock,"" said ING's Gulpers, adding
that the business was set to start recovering later this year. ""It's too early to say that the business model is broken.
Whether it's becoming more difficult to grow at the same levels
as in the past? For sure. To say that dairy has gone ex-growth,
I don't believe that.""

 (Adds details of the statement, background) PARIS, June 23 (Reuters) - Danone said on Tuesday it had
raised 3.05 billion euros ($4.23 billion) in its first
capital increase in 22 years, as the French food group aims to
cut debt and buy smaller rivals hurt by the financial crisis. Danone said it had sold 123.2 million new shares for 24.73
euros each -- representing a 31 percent discount to the stock's
closing price a day before the rights issue was announced on May
29 -- in an offer that was 182 percent oversubscribed. Shareholders of the world's biggest yoghurt maker were able
to subscribe to 4 new shares for every 17 shares held. The discount is less than that seen in other billion-euro
rights issues in France this year. Drinks group Pernod Ricard
 last month raised about 1 billion euros by selling
shares at a 36 percent discount. French cement group Lafarge and building materials
group Saint-Gobain held rights issues of 1.5 billion
euros with even deeper discounts.

211,"Feb 05, 2009 11:56AM ET",ANALYSIS-Guidance goes at Unilever as tough times loom,nan," By David Jones LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Tough times may prompt more of
Europe's biggest businesses to scrap financial guidance targets
after Unilever and GlaxoSmithKline abandoned them, blaming
economic uncertainty. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Sunsilk shampoo and Knorr soups
sent its shares spinning down as it scrapped targets, saying it
couldn't make forecasts when no-one was clear about the extent
of the recession. Analysts suspect other European powerhouses may be planning
similar moves, particularly in defensive sectors such as
consumer goods and drugs, which have in the past taken up a U.S.
led trend to set financial goals. ""The market will not like the lack of specific guidance, but
the market will have to start to get used to that generally, I
suspect,"" said independent analyst James Amoroso. Following Unilever Plc/NV's results on Thursday come Nestle
, Danone and Reckitt Benckiser in the next two weeks, with
Danone already pointing to lower guidance back in November. Unilever had targeted annual underlying sales growth of 3-5
percent with an underlying rise in margins each year towards a
15 percent target in 2010, but all that was swept away as its
new Chief Executive Paul Polman said he did not want to be
changing financial guidance every ""five minutes"". The move surprised analysts after big U.S. based groups such
as Procter & Gamble (P&G), Kraft and Sara Lee Corp recently
trimmed their guidance rather than abandoned it, making
Unilever's move something of a shock, especially as Polman had
spent most of his working life at P&G. ""We imagine that investors will not be pleased with
management's comment that it would be 'inappropriate' to give
2009 guidance or reaffirm the 2010 margin target of at least 15
percent,"" said analyst Andrew Wood at Bernstein Research. Most analysts had forecast Unilever would only, at best,
reach the bottom of its 3-5 percent annual underlying sales
growth target for 2009, with analyst Jeff Stent at Citi seeing
only 1.9 percent growth. Unilever shares slumped 7.2 percent to 13.77 pounds by 1600
GMT to be the FTSE 100 index's biggest faller after analysts
said that scrapping guidance hardly instilled confidence in the
business looking forward to 2009. The focus now switches to Danone which in November warned
that its underlying sales in 2009 would be a few percentage
points below its medium-term guidance of 8-10 percent annual
growth and Nestle which in October was upbeat for 2008 seeing
sales growth at 8 percent compared to its 5-6 percent long-term
target. Also back in October, household cleaning goods group Reckitt
Benckiser was confident of meeting its increased underlying 2008
sales target of 9 percent, and the British group has a tradition
of beating and upgrading its guidance. ""However, these companies are clearly under some pressure
from the global slowdown and we would expect them to be looking
seriously at abandoning or downgrading their guidance for at
least this year,"" said another consumer goods analyst. In the pharmaceutical world, GlaxoSmithKline's Chief
Executive Andrew Witty said the group would no longer provide
specific short-term earnings guidance on 2009 but said its
decision was not connected to performance. It would now focus
investor attention on implementing its long-term goals. ""We got a bit of a bombshell in terms of them not giving
guidance ... but it appears to be a general policy. They are
moving to a more opaque guidance perspective for the market,
probably to give themselves some breathing room,"" said Jeffrey
Holford, an analyst at stockbroker Jefferies. Over in the U.S. the world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart
Stores Inc said it would no longer issue monthly sales forecasts
because of volatile trends, and the U.S.'s biggest warehouse
club Costco Wholesale Corp said it would not give earnings
forecasts for its current fiscal year. (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler) (Reporting by David Jones; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

212,"Nov 20, 2008 11:12AM ET",UPDATE 2-France's Sarkozy vows to protect key industries,nan," * Launches 20 bln euro support fund * Available to viable firms hit by bank lending drought * Seen protecting strategic industries 
 (Adds details, quotes) By Yann Leguernigou SAINT-JULIEN-LE-CHEDON, France, Nov 20 (Reuters) - President
Nicolas Sarkozy vowed on Thursday to protect key companies from
being swallowed up by the financial crisis as he launched a 20
billion euro ($25.05 billion) fund to help French industry. In his latest step to give life support to the euro zone's
second-biggest economy, Sarkozy said the fund would invest in
viable firms in need of cash, and shore up the balance sheets of
companies deemed vulnerable in the face of falling stock prices. France's aim was to make sure the financial crisis did not
trigger the disappearance of strategic French industries at a
time when banks were still proving reluctant to lend and
investors could make easy investments in major companies. ""The day we don't build trains, aeroplanes, automobiles and
ships, what is left of the French economy? Memories. I will not
make France a tourist reserve,"" Sarkozy said in a speech at an
aerospace supply manufacturing company near Paris. ""I want France to keep its factories, I want this process of
factory relocation and outsourcing to stop and I want firms with
the potential to develop to be able to do so, even if financial
institutions at the moment are a little timid,"" he said. The new fund would be managed by state bank Caisse des
Depots, a state bank that traditionally has been used by the
government to shield companies from hostile overseas predators. It would consist of 20 billion euros to begin with, and
could grow in value, Sarkozy said, noting foreign investors, and
particularly sovereign wealth funds, would be welcome to join. France and the CDC planned to raise a total of six billion
euros in debt for the fund, with the rest coming from assets
previously held by the CDC and the state.  PROTECTIONIST? Investments would be made in viable companies, notably
small- and medium-sized enterprises unable to obtain capital
from blocked financial markets, he said. Money would also be poured into medium- and large-sized
companies including those that were deemed as strategic for the
economy but which would be vulnerable to takeovers. References made to the creation of such a fund have raised
fears of protectionism in a country that many say treated
yoghurt as strategic when U.S. soft drinks giant PepsiCo was
rumoured to be eyeing Groupe Danone in 2005. For Jean Claude Gruffat, who heads the American Chamber of
Commerce in France, the fund needs to be watched with attention. ""It is perfectly legitimate for states to protect their
strategic interest, they are all doing it. The question is what
is included in your definition of strategic sectors of
interest?"" said Gruffat. ""Every country has its own policy but my view is that as the
American Chamber of Commerce, we will pay a lot of attention to
what's done in different countries and make sure we have a level
playing field for our companies,"" he said by telephone. Highlighting that investments would not mean state control,
Sarkozy said that the fund would only take minority interests. Sarkozy said the fund would be headed by Patricia Barbizet,
an executive of Artemis, the holding company of billionaire
investor Francois-Henri Pinault. Bankers have noted the French investment fund is not the
same as the sovereign wealth funds of oil-producing or emerging
market states that typically use reserves to invest in markets
abroad, sometimes to secure natural resources.
