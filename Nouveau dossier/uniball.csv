120,"Aug 30, 2018 05:04AM ET",China trade fears end European shares' recovery,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Thursday, tracking a decline in Asian trading as weakness in Chinese markets eclipsed optimism that a NAFTA deal could be struck by Friday's deadline.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended early losses to 0.5 percent by 0830 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), which is sensitive to China due to its prominence as a German export market, dropped 0.9 percent. Chinese stocks fell after a Reuters poll showed activity in the factory sector likely slowed for the third straight month in August amid uncertainty over an escalating trade war with the United States.In Europe, trade-sensitive mining stocks (SXPP) tumbled 1.3 percent and autos (SXAP) fell 0.7 percent. ""It's a balancing act with on the one hand relatively positive momentum behind NAFTA, but when the focus turns to China and trade war it doesn't seem like an end is in sight because any escalation plays to Trump's rhetoric of how he's protecting U.S. prosperity and jobs,"" said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips Investment Management. Earnings reports caused some sharp moves in individual stocks.Shares in Europe's largest property company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (AS:URW) fell 5 percent even though the company reported a boost to profits from its acquisition of Australian shopping centre giant Westfield.Traders said a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note weighed on the stock after analysts at the U.S. bank downgraded their view on the European property industry to ""in-line"" from ""attractive"".""For almost every property stock in Europe we expect a lower total return profile compared to what it has been delivering,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. They also said rising inflation and bond yields would increase differentiation in the sector and leverage would become more of a focus.UK commercial property firm Intu (L:INTUP) fell 3.6 percent after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underweight from equal-weight, and peer  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) fell 4.1 percent.  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) lost 3.8 percent after a Morgan Stanley downgrade.Real estate (SX86P) was Europe's worst-performing sector, down 1.3 percent.Shares in Swedish radiation therapy gear maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) fell 6.6 percent after it reported an unexpected drop in first-quarter operating profit. Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) was a rare gainer, up 3.1 percent after the French conglomerate stuck to its full year outlook for rising profitability as its telecoms division improved.The prospect of Bouygues Telecom gaining market share sent shares in rival  Iliad  (PA:ILD), a telecoms disrupter offering cut-price contracts, tumbling 6.4 percent.Bringing up the rear was Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) which sank a further 8.1 percent, hitting its lowest in more than nine years and taking its year-to-date losses to 51 percent. GAM shares have sold off sharply since the firm suspended a top director and suspended, then liquidated, some bond funds. Overall in Europe, escalating trade disputes have driven cyclical mining and autos sectors down this year while healthcare and technology take the lead. With the second-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, companies in the MSCI Europe index (MIPO00000PEU) have delivered 10.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth in euro terms.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

148,"Apr 04, 2018 03:59PM ET",Exclusive: Starboard challenges U.S. mall owner Macerich's board - sources,nan,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Liana B. Baker and Carl O'Donnell(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP nominated directors this week to challenge the board of directors of U.S. shopping mall owner  Macerich Co  (N:MAC), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Macerich is the latest mall operator to come under pressure from activist investors during a downturn in the brick-and-mortar retail sector.  Taubman Centers Inc  (N:TCO), another shopping center operator, has attracted activist hedge funds, including Elliott Management Corp. Starboard may replace the majority of Macerich's 10-member board, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Macerich and Starboard declined to comment.Macerich shares were up 4.4 percent at $58.59 in late afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.85 billion.Macerich owns 53 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of 48 regional U.S. shopping centers. The company rejected a $16.8 billion bid from rival Simon Property Group Inc (N:SPG) in 2015 and has struggled since then, as thousands of U.S. stores have closed under pressure from e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).Third Point LLC, another activist hedge fund, disclosed a stake in Macerich in November. Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, an activist hedge fund specializing in the real estate sector, also owns Macerich stock.In the latest sign of consolidation in the sector, commercial real estate company  Brookfield Property Partners LP  (O:BPY) said last week it would acquire the 66 percent of GGP Inc (N:GGP) that it does not already own in a cash-and-stock deal valuing GGP, one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centers, at about $15.3 billion.In December, Europe's biggest property firm Unibail-Rodamco (AS:UNBP) agreed to buy U.S. and UK mall operator Westfield Corp (AX:WFD) for $16 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

152,"Mar 19, 2018 06:10AM ET","European shares sink, Micro Focus plummets",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday as investors remained cautious ahead of an expected Fed rate hike, while earnings and M&A took center stage with software company  Micro Focus  sinking and a bid for  Hammerson  boosting commercial real estate stocks. Micro Focus (L:MCRO) dropped 55 percent to a three-year low after it cut its annual revenue forecast and its CEO quit. Revenue was hit by lower license income and issues with its purchase of Hewlett Packard Enterprise assets.The firm's shedding of more than half its market value caused Europe's tech sector index (SX8P) to tumble 2.4 percent, its worst fall since early February when global markets sank.A scuppered cross-border commercial real estate deal also made waves on Monday, with Hammerson (L:HMSO) soaring 27 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 after saying it had rebuffed a takeover offer from France's  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM).The offer, which strategists said would have helped Klepierre gain a foothold in the UK market, valued Hammerson's shares at a 40.7 percent premium to Friday's closing price.Before today's surge Hammerson's shares were down 19.8 percent year-to-date, making them attractive to potential suitors. The rejection sent Klepierre shares down 3.5 percent.""Klepierre owns and operates 100 shopping centres in 16 countries across Europe and the quality has been improved over the past 5 years, with the UK the missing part of the jigsaw (the same could be said of Unibail),"" said Liberum strategists, referring to Klepierre competitor Unibail Rodamco (AS:UNBP).Europe's main benchmark, the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index, fell 0.7 percent as investors held their breath ahead of Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which marks the debut for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and a likely interest rate hike. Eyes were also on a news conference on Brexit negotiations, hastily scheduled by the European Commission for 1145 GMT, as speculation swirled over a potential interim deal ahead of the EU Summit later in the week.Disappointing results weighed on German consumer goods firm Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), which fell 5.1 percent after it said the first quarter was off to a slow start due to delivery difficulties in North America. While Hammerson's surge higher drove the European real estate sector index (SX86P) up 0.8 percent to the top spot, tech stocks were the worst performers.Even before Micro Focus' dramatic drop, European investors' sentiment had been turning more cautious on the tech sector which has led stellar gains across global markets.Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts on Monday said they had downgraded the tech sector to 'neutral' and upgraded utilities to overweight, arguing investors should increase their share of defensive sectors with economic indicators at elevated levels.German food processing machinery maker GEA Group (DE:G1AG) gained 4 percent after the firm said its CEO Juerg Oleas was to step down in April 2019 after more than a decade in office.Sweden's Dometic (ST:DOMETIC) fell 3.5 percent after the recreational vehicle products firm was downgraded to ""underweight"" by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), whose strategists said the U.S. RV market is overheating.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

182,"Dec 18, 2017 05:50AM ET",German Vonovia climbs property ladder with $6.1 billion Buwog deal,nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Maria SheahanFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Vonovia (DE:VNAn), Germany's biggest residential property company, has agreed to buy Austrian counterpart Buwog (VI:BWOA) in a cash deal valuing the latter at 5.2 billion euros ($6.12 billion), the two companies said on Monday.The deal will increase the size of Vonovia's portfolio to almost 400,000 flats from around 350,000 now and increase sharply its capacity for building new housing.Buwog's share price was up 17.2 percent at 28.84 euros by 1008 GMT, slightly below the offer price of 29.05 euros per share.Shares in Vonovia were flat, having risen 40 percent over the last year on increasing demand for housing in Europe's largest economy. Housing prices in Germany - relatively cheap compared with other European countries in the past - have spiked in recent years, prompting the Bundesbank to warn about the risk of a dangerous bubble developing earlier this year.Average real estate prices in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt have increased by more than 60 percent since 2010, the Bundesbank estimates, reflecting solid growth, low unemployment and low borrowing costs.The housing shortage had played a role in the run-up to Germany's parliamentary election in September.""Politicians have voiced the legitimate request that we build more apartments,"" Vonovia Chief Executive Rolf Buch said.The deal will help Vonovia intensify its construction activities, building on Buwog's extensive expertise in property development, he said, adding that the company will double its target of newly built apartments to 4,000 annually. Buwog CEO Daniel Riedl said that Buwog owns land on which 10,000 flats can be built, two thirds of which would likely be sold on after completion.Buwog shareholders are to be offered 29.05 euros per share under the offer, an 18.1 percent premium to Friday's closing price, which Vonovia plans to finance with debt.Buch said that the valuation was in line with that of comparable deals such as Unibail-Rodamco's (AS:UNBP) acquisition of shopping mall operator Westfield (AX:WFD) and Vonovia's own past deals.Analysts at brokerage Baader said that the offer price was reasonable, adding that the move was not completely surprising as Buwog has been seen as a takeover target for some time.The deal reverses Vonovia's strategy in Austria, where it had initially planned to sell its operations. While 55 percent of Buwog's property is located in German cities including Berlin and Hamburg, the rest is in Austria in cities such as Vienna, Graz and Klagenfurt.Buch said that the companies did not expect major antitrust concerns as the market is still fragmented with Vonovia having a market share of only 2 percent.Vonovia said it expected joint management of the two companies' flats following the deal would lead to cost savings of around 30 million euros a year, a substantial part of which is to be realized by the end of 2019.The deal will also have a positive effect on Vonovia's underlying earnings per share and adjusted net asset value per share, Vonovia said.Buwog will remain as a separate brand within Vonovia and keep its stock market listing.Further details of the offer are to be announced in February, when the bid will be officially launched.JP Morgan (N:JPM), Kempen, Victoria Partners and Freshfields advised Vonovia on the deal, while Buwog worked with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Schoenherr.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It's very difficult to be profitable on the internet, particularly pure-play online retailers,"" he told journalists on a call on Thursday.""Retailers need physical presence,"" he added, noting that largely online companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nespresso, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even Amazon had opened bricks-and-mortar stores.Franco-Dutch group Unibail's planned acquisition of Westfield will create a stronger competitor for the world's biggest commercial property owner Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), one with 104 centers and more than 1.2 billion visitors a year. The deal gives Europe-focused Unibail, which owns Les 4 Temps and Forum des Halles in Paris and has centers spreading from Helsinki to Valencia, exposure to Britain, the United States and Italy, countries where Westfield operates 35 malls.The acquisition is part of Unibail's strategy of increasingly focusing on high-end ""destination"" malls in landmark locations and Westfield would bring shopping centers in big cities like London, New York and San Francisco, which offer customers a wide range of restaurants, bars and entertainment. Unibail could replicate some of Westfield's services at its other centers around Europe, including staging events like concerts and hosting pop-up shops, according to a source familiar with the matter.""The big (Westfield) malls are only getting stronger,"" said Grant Berry, portfolio manager at Australian broker S.G. Hiscock, which holds real-estate investment trust shares, including Westfield.""Nothing's changed in terms of these big malls as gathering places for entertainment and experiences.""As part of its ""destination"" mall push, Unibail has said it plans to sell some regional Westfield shopping centers in the United States to concentrate on malls in central locations of big cities, but has not provided more specific details.Cuvillier said one of the reasons why many American malls and department stores were struggling was a failure to diversify into offering customers food.""I think it (food retailing) is a way of recovery for United States shopping centers.

185,"Dec 13, 2017 06:54AM ET",Westfield $16 billion Unibail-Rodamco sale rings the bell on retail's next chapter,nan,"By Byron Kaye and Sonali PaulSYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - For investors in Australia's Westfield Corp (AX:WFD), its $16 billion sale to European property giant Unibail-Rodamco (AX:UNBP) may mark a turning point for a mall industry under pressure to reinvent itself amid fierce online competition.But to billionaire Frank Lowy, who built Westfield's vast European and U.S. shopping center network into multi-purpose leisure venues, it was also the perfect moment to call time on a family empire.""He probably thought that he'd taken it as far as he could with his sons, and there were other people that may have a different way of approaching the industry,"" said Harold Finger, founder of Sydney-based shopping center investor Haben Property Fund Pty Ltd, who has known Lowy since he was a boy. ""He's 87 years old, his kids are not little babies any more, they've got kids and they've got other interests that they can get involved in,"" he said, referring to two of Lowy's sons, Peter and Steven.The sale of Westfield to Paris and Amsterdam-listed Unibail-Rodamco is a milestone for so-called bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have so far argued they can downsize or, in Westfield's case, go upmarket to avoid the incursion of online competitors led by U.S. giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).But analysts and investors in the sector disagree about what comes next.""Lowy has bailed on Westfield before Amazon destroys his malls and turns them into relic tombs of the 20th century,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity investor the Patriarch Organization, by telephone from Los Angeles.""You can only do so much to re-imagine a shopping mall, and they've tried here in Los Angeles, but it's like trying to reinvent the horse and carriage. No matter how much you try you can't turn a horse into a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It's not going to happen.""The deal may nudge other mall owners towards considering a sale more seriously, though some point out that further M&A action will be more difficult with Westfield and Unibail-Rodamco - two big players - now off the board.The Lowy family, which owns 9 percent of Westfield, will end up with a 2.8 percent stake in the combined group.Citi analysts noted Lowy's public statement that he remained committed to his seven-decade-old company as an investor but said ""it's hard not to see today's announcement as signaling a significant shift in view"". The deal has lifted expectations in a sector sold down by investors over its gloomy outlook.Shares of  Scentre  Group (AX:SCG), which Westfield spun off in 2014 to hold its Australian shopping centers while Westfield kept the U.S. and British assets, rose 2 percent on Wednesday, on top of a 4 percent jump a day earlier. GOING HIGH-ENDThe explosion of online retail has led to a worldwide decline in department store footprints, forcing mall owners such as Westfield to rethink their business models to sustain or grow earnings.In the United States, Macy's Inc (N:M) and  J C Penney Co  Inc (N:JCP) have said they would shut hundreds of stores to protect themselves from declining sales.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimates that up to 25 percent of U.S. malls will shut by 2025. Westfield has been seen as a pioneer of reinventing the mall concept, adding cinemas, apartment towers, high-end food courts and luxury fashion labels to its rental mix.The overhaul - which has spanned the Westfield portfolio from Beverly Hills, California, to London and Milan - has nonetheless curtailed earnings growth as capital works hit rents, weighing on the company's share price and making it attractive for buyers.""Westfield particularly we saw as a good opportunity because it's rare that you see a group that has such high quality assets, and they're building out what is really the pre-eminent retail portfolio globally,"" said Grant Berry, a portfolio manager at Australian broker S.G. Hiscock, which invests in retail real estate investment trusts (REITs), including Westfield.""They've been doing all the right things and the market hasn't been giving them credit for that.""Winston Sammut, managing director of Folkestone Maxim Asset Management, said the deal offered Lowy and his family an exit just as their business entered its most challenge phase, while offering the buyer access to a fresh market.""It'll probably turn out to be good timing,"" said Sammut. ""There's still a lot of headwinds for the sector in general. The writing's on the wall. You've got to take opportunities as they come.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) have provided 6.1 billion euros in funding to cover the cash portion of the offer, Unibail said. Unibail-Rodamco shares traded down 2.2 percent at 0929 GMT, with analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux saying that the deal looked expensive.RETAIL REINVENTIONShopping center owners are scrambling to reinvent themselves to keep up with rapid changes in consumer behavior, with the expansion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com coinciding with an explosion in online purchases, while consumers increasingly treat malls as places for socializing and window shopping.Once dominant United States department store operators such as Macy's Inc (N:M) and  J C Penney Co  Inc (N:JCP) have announced plans to shut hundreds of stores in recent years, putting pressure on landlords to find new ""anchor tenants"" or come up with new ways to grow returns. ""Westfield has got assets in the UK and in the U.S. that are all in mature Amazon markets. They're already 50 percent through that online retail switch,"" Morningstar analyst Tony Sherlock said of the deal.Lowy, who said talks to seal a deal had taken just six weeks and expressed ""mixed emotions"" about the sale, will retire as chairman and his sons Steven and Peter, will retire as co-CEOs.The Lowy family owns 9 percent of Westfield and will end up with a 2.8 percent stake in Unibail-Rodamco if the deal goes ahead. The Lowys said they would rather be investors now than executives, after putting in a combined 145 years at Westfield.Lowy said it made sense to sell because it was a ""very good price"", but acknowledged that the sale partly reflected the global trend of consolidation and the pressures on retailers.The offer price closed the gap between the underlying value of the company and its share price, Peter Lowy added.Westfield's flagship malls include Westfield London, where it is working on a 600 million pound ($800 million) expansion, and Century City in Los Angeles, where it is completing a $1 billion overhaul.It also has stakes in 18 suburban U.S. shopping centers, three of which it wholly owns.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deutsche Wohnen's stock slumped 6.5 percent on the prospects of a capital increase to finance the merger.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote
