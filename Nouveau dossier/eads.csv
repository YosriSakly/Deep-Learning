Senators would need 67 votes to override his veto, which looked unlikely after Thursday's votes. The first and second resolutions of disapproval passed 53-45 and a third vote covering the remaining 20 resolutions was 51-45.Backers of the resolutions, led by Democrat Bob Menendez and Republican Lindsey Graham, said they sent a bipartisan message to Saudi Arabia that Washington is not happy about human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.Many also expressed deep concern with Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the war in Yemen, where the two countries are battling Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The United Nations has described the conflict in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of people including thousands of civilians, as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.TENSIONS WITH IRANHours before the vote, Iran shot down a U.S. military drone, escalating fears of wider military conflict. Washington said the incident was an ""unprovoked attack"" in international air space while Tehran said the drone was over its territory. Trump later said the attack apparently was a mistake by an Iranian ""general or somebody.""Opposing the resolutions, the Senate's Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, cited tensions with Tehran. ""The timing could not be worse for the Senate to send the wrong signal,"" he said. Graham, normally a close Trump ally, underscored the unusual divide between the White House and some Republicans over Saudi Arabia in an emphatic Senate speech before the votes.""You cannot have a strategic relationship with the United States and behave in a fashion that shows no respect for human dignity, no respect for international norms,"" Graham said.Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the disapproval resolutions also reflected Congress' desire to preserve its powers to declare war and review major foreign weapons sales. Trump also used an emergency declaration strategy to circumvent Congress and try to get funding for a wall on the Mexican border.Menendez scoffed at the administration's contention that the threat from Iran was an emergency that warranted so many weapons sales to third countries. ""This is a power grab, pure and simple, with lasting implications for the role of Congress in the sale of arms around the world,"" Menendez said.The resolutions are expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives before reaching Trump's desk.MORE LEGISLATION EXPECTEDDespite Trump's veto threat, members of Congress said they expect some Saudi-related legislation would come into effect this year.Lawmakers are working on a separate measure ""to hold Saudi Arabia accountable"" for human rights abuses and Khashoggi's murder. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also is due to consider as soon as next week legislation that would take away the ability of Trump, or any president, to use emergency authority to sell arms to any country besides NATO members and certain other key partners without congressional review.Among military equipment in the deals are Raytheon (RTN.N) precision-guided munitions, support for  Boeing Co  (BA.N) F-15 aircraft and Javelin anti-tank missiles, which are made by Raytheon and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (LMT.N).Other products involved are  General Electric  (GE.N) engines for use in F-16 fighter jets operated by the UAE, and a fuzing system for precision guided bombs from the U.S. unit of French firm  Thales  SA (TCFP.PA).Other companies with products or services in the deals are Britain’s BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) and Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA).In London on Thursday an English court ruled that Britain had broken the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi Arabia that might have been deployed in the war in Yemen, after activists said there was evidence the weapons had been used in violation of human rights statutes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

4,"Jun 17, 2019 05:44AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday, June 17:1. Draghi kicks off busy week for central banksEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will give opening remarks to the euro zone monetary authority’s annual three-day meeting in Sintra, kicking off a busy week that will include policy decisions from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England.Ahead of the meeting, Benoit Coeure, one of the possible candidates to succeed Draghi, gave a gloomy interview to the Financial Times, warning that market-based indicators of inflation expectations are signalling a much bleaker outlook for the economy than current data. That's keeping the euro close to a two-week low against the dollar.Although no interest rate changes are expected this week from the Fed, BoJ or BoE, Fed chair Jerome Powell will be in the spotlight as investors expect a clearer hint as to what the Fed would see as an actual trigger to cut interest rates.2. Huawei launches profit-warning as trade tensions drag onHuawei Technologies Chief Executive Officer Ren Zhengfei said Monday he expects the company’s sales to drop to around $100 billion this year and next after the U.S. banned American companies from doing business with the Chinese firm.Although the U.S. blacklisting of the Huawei was done for “national security” reasons, U.S. President Donald Trump did suggest in an interview with CNBC last week that something could be done with the company as part of the trade negotiations with China.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross played down the importance of Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting on June 28 and 29, while reiterating the American president was “perfectly happy” with continuing with his tariff strategy.Congressional hearings on the next planned round of U.S. import tariffs get underway on Monday.Read more: Broadcom Earnings Show Chip Stock Slump Could Get Worse - Haris Anwar3.

Asian shares staged a timid recovery near one-week lows. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng had one of the strongest showings, rising some 0.4% after territory's leader Carrie Lam backed down on a bill that would have allowed extradition to China.4. 737 MAX trials to start as Boeing seeks to restore confidenceThe Federal Aviation Administration could start flight trials of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX safety enhancement as early as this week, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal.At the Paris Air Show on Sunday, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg admitted the company had made mistakes regarding the model's warnings systems, and promised that Boeing’s first priority was to rebuild trust.With the MAX 737 grounded for safety reasons, Airbus (PA:AIR) will reportedly launch its A321XLR airplane at the Paris Air Show. It's hoping to seal over 200 orders, according to reports.The air show comes at a time when the slowing economy is taking a toll on airlines. Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) became the latest to issue a profit-warning Monday, citing overcapacity in the short-haul sector and higher fuel costs. 5. Iran plans to break uranium limit in 10 daysIran announced Monday that it will break internationally-agreed limits on its stocks of enriched uranium in 10 days unless Europe takes steps to help it counteract the crippling effect of U.S. economic sanctions.Tehran had previously threatened to renege on the nuclear deal after the Trump administration withdrew from the pact last year and imposed economic sanctions.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the U.S. is “considering a full range of options”, against a backdrop of rising tensions embodied by the attacks on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf last week. Iran has denied accusations of planning the attacks.Pompeo, who has said that there is ""no doubt"" that Iran was behind the attacks, said a military response was among the options under consideration.-- Reuters contributed to this report."

7,"Apr 30, 2019 05:35AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, April 30:1. Google revenue slowdown weighs on techGoogle’s parent-company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw its shares plunge nearly 8% in premarket trade Tuesday after the company reported quarterly earnings.The internet giant registered its slowest revenue growth in three years due to increased competition in advertising and challenges at YouTube, where it is struggling to assure clients that their ads don’t sponsor adult or offensive content.Alphabet said its revenue rose 17% in the first quarter to $36.3 billion, missing forecasts for $37.3 billion and well below a 26% annual increase seen in the first three months of 2018.That put downward pressure on other tech stocks, with Nasdaq 100 futures off 0.2% compared to flat readings in Dow futures and S&P 500 futures.Markets will have more heavyweight tech earnings to digest today as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports after the market close. Outside the tech sector,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Merck (NYSE:MRK)and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) are among company earnings to watch ahead of the opening bell.Read more: Apple’s Q2 Earnings: Growth In Services Unit Is Crucial To Sustain Rally - Haris Anwar2. China reports weak factory activity ahead of trade talksFactory activity in China expanded at a slower pace than forecast in April, suggesting that fiscal and stimulus measures aimed at reviving the economy haven't been entirely successful yet.China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 50.1 this month, holding just above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. Economists had forecast an increase to 50.7.The weaker-than-expected reading arrived as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer arrived in Beijing for another round of trade negotiations with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that will continue next week in Washington D.C.Mnuchin said Tuesday that he hopes to make “substantial progress” this week and next, without giving further details.U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that he would soon host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the White House. A meeting between the two leaders would likely see them signing off on an agreement to end a dispute over tariffs and market access.3. Fed kicks off policy meeting amid consumer, housing dataThe Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting on Tuesday amid expectations that interest rates will remain on hold. At its March meeting the Fed indicated that it will hold off from hiking rates for the rest of the year amid expectations for a slower pace of economic growth.Although data released last week showed that growth in the U.S. economy unexpectedly accelerated in the first quarter, the expansion was boosted by gains in trade and inventories which may be transitory. The core private consumption price index, generally considered to be the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, cooled off in March, supporting arguments for a pause in policy tightening.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting ends on Wednesday.Also on Tuesday’s economic calendar, markets will gauge the latest reading of consumer strength with the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for April.In the housing market, S&P/Case-Shiller will release their house price index for February while the National Association of Realtors will publish its report on pending home sales in March.Earlier, the euro zone posted surprisingly strong growth of 0.4% in the first quarter, ahead of the 0.3% expected. The 1.2% year-on-year growth rate was the best in a year.4. Trump sues  Deutsche Bank  and  Capital One  U.S. President Donald Trump, along with his three eldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka - and seven of his companies, filed a federal lawsuit against Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and Capital One (NYSE:COF) in an attempt to prevent the banks from responding to congressional subpoenas.The subpoenas represent a tightening of Congressional scrutiny of the president, who famously broke with tradition by not publishing his income tax returns during the 2016 campaign. The lawsuit claims that record requests from Democrat-controlled House committees serve no legitimate or lawful purpose.""The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,"" the lawsuit said.5. Major Boeing customer threatens switch to AirbusIn the wake of two fatal accidents that grounded Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets, one of the company’s major customers has threatened to order aircraft from its rival Airbus (PA:AIR).Flydubai Chief Executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said that he would seek compensation for the grounding of 14 737 MAX planes and may seek replacements from Airbus, according to a report from Financial Times.Boeing is struggling to present a software fix and new pilot training package that will convince regulators that the plane is safe to fly. The company admitted on Monday that a cockpit alert notifying pilots of a sensor malfunction did not work as presented. The warning only functioned on a separate indicator panel that was available for a fee."
8,"Apr 30, 2019 04:29AM ET",StockBeat: Chinese Data Stop Europe Following Wall St Higher,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Europe’s stock markets got off to a shaky start on Tuesday, after a round of weaker-than-expected business surveys out of China reminded participants that the world economy may not be out of the woods just yet.With earnings season in Europe cranking up, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.6 points, or 0.2% at 390.60 by 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).Italy’s FTSE MIB 30 was holding up best, still supported by Standard & Poor’s decision to affirm the country’s credit rating on Friday, although bank stocks were suffering on fresh concerns about the stability of the government, and on comments from Treasury Minister Giovannia Tria about the widening budget deficit.London’s listed mining stocks were broadly lower after the Chinese data forced investors to trim their hopes for commodity demand.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) fell the most after announcing problems of its own too – it cut its forecasts for copper and cobalt production this year due to a spate of problems at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Australia.There has been a welter of earnings updates to digest, with Airbus (PA:AIR) coming slightly off its all-time highs after unchanged guidance on commercial deliveries for the rest of the year underlined how capacity constraints will limit its ability to exploit Boeing's (NYSE:BA) misfortunes (even though it increased output of the A320, its main rival to the 737 MAX). The group also took a charge of 190 million euros ($220 million) to reflect the company’s inability to sell fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia owing to a German government refusal to grant export licenses.There’s also been mixed reports from the region’s banks, with Spain’s Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) both falling after disappointing updates marked by problems in emerging markets, while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) rose 4.6% after announcing its first buyback in years.Elsewhere,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was down 0.4% after reports that President Donald Trump, three of his children and his real estate company filed a lawsuit to stop the bank releasing details of its business with them under subpoenas from Congress.

Trump's New Front in Trade WarPresident Donald Trump has opened a new front in the U.S.’s trade war with the rest of the world.The administration is threatening tariffs on $11 billion on imports from the European Union to compensate the U.S. for alleged damage done to Boeing (NYSE:BA) by what the U.S. sees as unfair subsidies to its rival Airbus (PA:AIR).The move is the latest development in a dispute over subsidies to the two aircraft makers going back 14 years.2.

Oil Hits New HighsOil prices continued to climb as fighting in Libya intensified, raising the threat to the country’s crude exports. The price for the benchmark WTI Futures contract hit $64.78 overnight, its highest level in over five months.Rising prices have emboldened investors to place over $85 billion in bids  for oil company Saudi Aramco’s debut bond, which will be priced later today – probably at a yield below that of its owner, the Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaNot all the signs are bullish though. Bloomberg reported earlier Tuesday that Venezuela had restarted one of four upgrading facilities it uses to process its crude for export, while Reuters said Russia will want to raise its output when its current deal with OPEC on supply cuts expires in June.At 4.30 PM ET (2030 GMT), the American Petroleum Institute is due to present its weekly report on crude stocks.

U.S. Treasury Yield Curve Remains Inverted The U.S. Treasury yield curve remained inverted for the third consecutive session, stoking fears of an impending U.S. recession.At 5:45 AM ET (09:45 GMT), the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 2.44%, after having hit a 16-month low of 2.39% last Friday.Meanwhile, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill stood at 2.46%.Read more: Widening U.S. Yield Curve Inversion Jolts Investors; Panic Averted For Now: Darrell Delamaide2. U.S. Futures Edge HigherU.S. stock index futures pointed to a cautiously higher open, with investors keeping their eyes on movements in the U.S. Treasury market.The blue-chip Dow futures were up 100 points, or about 0.4%, the S&P 500 futures rose 10 points, or around 0.35%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 25 points, or roughly 0.35%.Elsewhere, European stocks were subdued in mid-morning trade, with major markets across the region moving in different directions. Bourses in Paris and London were slightly higher, while stocks in Germany and Madrid slipped.Airbus (PA:AIR) rose more than 2% after the European planemaker secured an order from China for 300 jets, in a deal estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars.Brexit remained in focus after U.K. lawmakers voted on Monday night to take control of the Brexit process from the government of Prime Minister Theresa May.Earlier, markets in Asia closed mixed, with Japan's Nikkei jumping 2%. Shares in mainland China however ended lower, with the Shanghai Composite down 1.5%.3. Busy Day on the Economic Calendar Several important U.S. economic reports are expected today, with February housing data topping the agenda.The Commerce Department at 8:30AM ET (12:30 GMT) is expected to report building permits fell 1.3% last month to 1.320 million units.Housing starts, meanwhile, are expected to drop 0.8% to 1.213 million units.The latest report on home prices from S&P/Case-Shiller is then due at 9AM ET (13:00 GMT).Recent data has painted a worrying picture of the U.S. housing market, which is struggling with rising mortgage rates and tight inventory.Later, the Conference Board releases its March update on consumer confidence at 10:00AM ET (14:00 GMT). The consensus forecast is for a reading of 132.0, up from 131.4 in February.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 96.10.4. API Oil Supply ReportIn commodities, the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report for the week ended March 22 at 4:30PM ET (20:30 GMT), amid expectations of a decline of about 2.4 million barrels.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 66 cents, or around 1.1%, at $59.48 a barrel, while international Brent crude oil futures tacked on 50 cents, or roughly 0.8%, to $67.33 per barrel.With less than a week to the end of the first quarter, WTI is up 30% on the year and Brent 25%, with both benchmarks benefiting extensively from aggressive Saudi-led production cuts since the start of January, along with other constraints on supplies from Iran and Venezuela, notably in the form of U.S. sanctions.5. Uber Buys Mideast Rival Careem in $3.1 Billion DealRide-hailing service firm Uber announced it has acquired its Middle East rival Careem for $3.1 billion, in an effort to buy dominance in a competitive region ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering.Uber said late Monday night it would pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes in a deal that gives it full ownership of Dubai-based Careem.The long-expected agreement ends more than nine months of start-and-stop negotiations between the two companies.Uber will kick off its IPO next month, and is reportedly seeking a valuation of at least $100 billion.-- Reuters contributed to this report"
14,"Mar 26, 2019 05:03AM ET",StockBeat: China Sends an Unsubtle Message Via Airbus,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- There’s nothing subtle about Chinese diplomacy.President Xi Jinping has inked a mind-boggling $29 billion deal for Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft during a state visit to Paris, France, a show of economic power aimed as much at Washington as at Europe.The order, for 290 single-aisle planes and 10 A350 wide-bodied aircraft, is much larger than the $18 billion order that was floated by French President Emmanuel Macron when he visited China last year.Airbus’s shares are up 1.7% on the news and only 2% off the all-time high that they hit earlier in March.The order appears to disturb the balance that China has traditionally kept in buying from the two duopolists of the aviation industry.The ostensible reason for that is the problem with Boeing’s 737 MAX, in the wake of two fatal crashes in recent months. China was among the first countries to ground the U.S.-made airplane earlier this month, and China’s demand for new aircraft is so huge and so pressing – Airbus estimates it will need an average of a new airliner or freighter every day for the next 20 years – that it can’t afford to wait on Boeing (NYSE:BA).But there is a clearly visible subtext. China is also at a difficult point of trade talks with the U.S., its largest trading partner, trying hard to push back against what it sees as aggressive U.S. tactics to rebalance relations between the two. China is trying to conciliate the U.S. by committing to increase its imports of American goods, but Bloomberg reported earlier this month that it’s now considering dropping the 737 MAX from its shopping list. In Beijing’s eyes, doling out largesse to Airbus is a useful reminder to Washington of what U.S. business stands to lose by pushing Beijing too hard.Elsewhere, European markets have opened mixed. At 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.36 points, or 0.1% at 374.68. Germany’s Dax index was down 0.4% (with investors continuing to pile out of Bayer (DE:BAYGN) in the wake of last week’s court verdict against it), while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.1%, supported by news from Westminster on Monday evening that makes a ‘no-deal Brexit’ a touch less likely."
15,"Mar 14, 2019 05:06AM ET",StockBeat: Brexit Drama Lifts European Markets; FCA Targets Fund Stocks,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Europe’s stock markets are marching higher Thursday, confident that U.K. lawmakers’ decision to vote against a ‘no-deal’ Brexit “at any time” has effectively ended the risk of a disorderly divorce.At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 20.6 points, or 0.6% at 3,344.05, while Germany's Dax was up 0.4% and France's CAC 40 up 0.7%. The FTSE 100 was lagging, up only 0.3%, after another sharp rise in sterling overnight.Conventional wisdom is that anything that softens or even cancels Brexit is good for the U.K. and for the European economy, but whether the degree of optimism visible this morning is justified is another question.European officials are determined to have the whole show wrapped up by May, so that it doesn’t overshadow the European parliament elections. That leaves precious little time for any further maneuvering and leaves the risk of an accidental 'no-deal Brexit' -- which is still the legal default scenario -- very much on the table.Anyway, the key point this morning is that Prime Minister Theresa May intends to use last night’s vote to bring back her twice-rejected deal for another vote, in the hope that the die-hard Brexiteer lawmakers will finally accept that her deal is the best outcome they can hope for.Compelling as the drama/farce is, there’s more going on in markets that just Brexit: Chinese industrial production growth slowed sharply in February, adding to fears that its slowdown could extend until the middle of the year.In Europe, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)is up 0.3% after falling Wednesday as it postponed the IPO of its truck unit Traton. Analysts had hoped the IPO would unlock some value for VW and strengthen its balance sheet as it girds itself for massive investment in electric vehicles. The company also confirmed it’s aiming to cut another 7,000 administrative jobs as part of that restructuring.Also in the spotlight are U.K. asset managers, who opened lower after the Financial Conduct Authority floated plans that could ban or sharply cut the ‘exit fees’ that they charge to customers. St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) and  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) recovered quickly to be up 1.0% and 0.3% respectively, while  Jupiter Fund Management  (LON:JUP) was down 1.9% and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) fell 0.5%.Meanwhile, Italy’s Generali (MI:GASI) and defense and engineering group Leonardo (MI:LDOF) have both risen after upbeat earnings statements. Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) is taking a breather after rising 4% on expectations that it will profit from the troubles of its rival Boeing (DE:BA)."

18,"Mar 04, 2019 02:46PM ET",Boeing's Big Gains Make Dow Vulnerable,nan,"By Charley BlaineInvesting.com - If you're a follower of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you have to like the index's 10%-plus gain this year.But watch the biggest driver of the Dow's run-up, Boeing (NYSE:BA). The aerospace giant closed Friday at $440.62, but was down 2.4% Monday afternoon. The Dow was slumping as well.As of Friday, Boeing was up 36.6% for the year. The next-closest performer was  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), up 22%. But there's a difference. Boeing hit nine 52-week highs in the month of February alone. IBM is still trading 14% below its 52-week high.A break in Boeing makes the Dow vulnerable to a nasty pullback because the Dow is a price-weighted index. The higher the price, the bigger its impact. Boeing's 2.4% decline Monday knocked 72 points out of the Dow -- 21% of the total. The biggest percentage loser, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), off more than 4%, cost the Dow 60 points.In fact, Boeing's gain 2019 gain through Friday represented 30% of the Dow's 11.6% rise. Take Boeing out and the Dow was up only 8.1%.At current levels, Boeing is looking pricey, according to technical measures.And analysts surveyed by Investing.com have a price target on the stock of $443.75, barely a blip above Friday's close. Nineteen of 24 analysts surveyed believe the stock will outperform, which it already has in spades this year.True, Boeing has a lot of good things going for it.

20,"Feb 19, 2019 03:10PM ET",Can IBM Shares Continue Their Roll?,nan,"Investing.com - It may shock, but  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shares are on something of a roll. The question is how long the roll will last.The stock is up 21% this year, second among the 30 stocks in the Dow. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is tops, in part because Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is struggling and because traders are betting a U.S.-China trade deal will get done.But IBM? This is a stock that fell 25% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2017 and has struggled to show revenue growth for years.Maybe IBM has a few things going for it.Most important is that, for now, investors seem willing to wait to see if CEO Ginni Rometty's bet on building a real cloud business comes to fruition. The business has been growing, but maybe not as quickly as some investors want. Revenue for the business grew 12% in the fourth quarter to $19.2 billion.But IBM faces intense competition from players like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure business and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform.The key is IBM's pending $34 billion acquisition of open-source cloud developer Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), expected in the latter half of the year. It's seen as the big fuel for the cloud business.Add to that continued investments in analytics and artificial intelligence.And IBM has real and long-standing relationships with the biggest players in the financial services industry that at least provides stable service revenue.The stock began the year on the cheap side after hitting a 52-week low of $105.84 during the December market meltdown. Even now, its $1.57-a-share quarterly dividend represents a 4.6% yield, compared with the S&P 500's yield of about 2%. And the dividend doesn't seem to be at risk.Technical indicators mostly rate the stock a buy. Its relative strength index, a measure of a stock's momentum, is about 60. A reading above 75 suggests it's overbought and vulnerable to a selloff.But the proof ultimately will be real results, which may explain why the stock's up 2.7% in February, about even with the S&P 500 but trailing the Dow's 3.7% gain."

24,"Feb 14, 2019 04:27AM ET",MarketPulse Europe - Nestle Shows Where the Growth Is,nan,"Investing.com -- It’s all about growth.On a day when Europe’s largest economy confirmed it didn’t grow at all in the last quarter of 2018, shares in Nestle (SIX:NESN) rose over 2.9% to an all-time high, as it posted its first rise in organic sales growth in six years.The company’s turnaround under CEO Marc Schneider appears to be gathering pace as it adapts to changing consumer tastes and sheds underperforming assets. That means there’s more money for shareholders, earlier than they expected: Nestle is raising its dividend by 4% and accelerating its 20 billion-franc stock buyback program.While Nestle’s figures owe a lot to company-specific actions such as disposals and more leverage, they reflect a trend that is fast becoming one of the themes of 2019: the more sales you have outside of a stagnating Europe, the better are your chances of growing.Nestle is following where Europe’s luxury goods makers – who make most of their money in North America and China - have led so far this year. Nestle too said that growth was strongest in the U.S. and Asia.Contrast that with the news on the home front: Germany’s fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised to zero Thursday. Elsewhere in Europe, domestic-focused sectors like banks are trailing local markets in both Spain and Italy this morning (although Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), a domestic-focused German bank, has bounced 2.7% after beating some very low expectations).But hopes on an agreement in the U.S.-China trade dispute continue to support the general mood: the broad-based Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.5% at 366.74, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.5% at 11,216 and the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.4% at 7220.03Elsewhere, Airbus (PA:AIR)soared 5.3% after it said it would end production of A380 superjumbo, while Juventus (MI:JUVE) was up 1.1% after it successfully sold 175 million euros of bonds at a rate of around 3.5%, allowing it to repay more expensive bank loans. That’s despite the bonds not carrying a rating."

""And we're not yet turning that delivery mechanism back on until they get their act together.""Bombardier spokesman Eric Prud'Homme said the company is working with NYC Transit to approve a ""technical solution"" that would return the trains to service. ""We expect this to happen shortly,"" Prud'Homme said. A spokesman for MTA, which oversees NYC Transit, referred to the webcast when contacted by Reuters for a comment.Bombardier shares gave up early gains to trade down about 2 percent soon after the Reuters report.Montreal-based Bombardier's rail unit accounts for about 55 percent of total revenue and has an order backlog of $34 billion. But some older contracts are marred by delays and performance problems.Bombardier has said it will focus on growing its rail and business jet divisions after the company ceded a controlling stake in its flagship CSeries jet program to Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and sold its Q400 turboprop aircraft program to Canadian aircraft manufacturer to Viking Air.Its stock fell sharply after the last quarterly earnings in November when the company missed cash flows due to troubles with a handful of delayed rail orders.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Swiss Federal Railways would not take new trains from Bombardier until it fixes the ones already in service.""CHRONICALLY LATE""Bombardier has delivered 160 cars from the 2012 NYC order of 300 R179 subway cars, worth about $600 million. The order is now expected by September 2019, compared with an original completion date of early 2017.The MTA is undergoing a 10-year plan to modernize the city's transit, with billions of dollars of investment earmarked for thousands of new subway cars. ""I have just made it very clear to them (Bombardier) that they are certainly not making their case for new orders very favorable. And that right now I wouldn't be wasting my board's time in asking for the business for them,"" Byford said. ""If we're comparing bids and we know that someone is chronically late, by not just a couple of months, but a couple of years, this board will remember that,"" MTA board member Susan Metzger said. Prud'homme said Bombardier is taking responsibility for the trains, and has over 50 full-time employees in NYC working to support the R179 fleet. The company will have to provide at least 16 additional trains above the 300, free of charge and MTA board members were told the agency is in negotiations for an additional two trains as damages.Separately, Bombardier said on Thursday it will buy a wing manufacturing unit from aircraft parts supplier Triumph Group (N:TGI) to boost its business jets program.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""If there is a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK."" The world's second-largest aerospace group employs 14,000 people in Britain, including 6,000 at its main wings factory at Broughton, Wales, and 3,000 in Filton, western England, where wings are designed and supported.Critics of previous warnings by Airbus have cast doubt on whether the France-based group would move significant operations out of Britain, arguing Broughton is an efficient factory and that the case for staying is buoyed by a weak sterling.German-born Enders insisted Airbus was not bluffing, adopting a more partisan tone than in previous statements.""Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong,"" he said.""Of course, it is not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to re-direct future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

When we do that, the result is very positive,"" Quenet told reporters on Wednesday, declining to discuss details of profitability.Arianespace is competing for two major launch contracts in the Asia-Pacific region that should be awarded this year and expects there could be tenders for another three, he said.Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), completed 11 launches with its Ariane 5, Vega and Soyuz rockets in 2018, in line with guidance that had been lowered mid-year from an initial 14.The company, which has a mission of guaranteeing Europe independent access to space and is used by government and commercial clients, this month forecast up to 12 launches in 2019, with four of them targeted in the first quarter.The Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates the satellite launch services market is worth $5.5 billion a year. SpaceX has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.Another U.S. group, the United Launch Alliance joint venture between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), said last week it would conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months as it also looks to lower costs to better compete against SpaceX.Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said this month it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan.SpaceX, which media reports say is valued at $30.5 billion, said this month it would fire about 10 percent of its more than 6,000 employees, seeking to create a leaner company to deal with the ""extraordinarily difficult"" challenges of developing interplanetary spacecraft and a global space-based internet.Arianespace's majority shareholder, ArianeGroup, announced on Tuesday it had signed a contract with the European Space Agency to study a mission to the moon before 2025 with the aim of mining regolith, an ore from which it is possible to extract water and oxygen.Quenet said if the mission proceeded, it would be launched with the Ariane 6 at its facilities in French Guiana.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

As a precaution, he returned the aircraft to Lucknow. The aircraft is currently at Lucknow and being inspected by the technical team,"" IndiGo said in a statement.Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), said the aircraft was powered by PW1100G-JM engines.""We are working with our customer to help minimize any disruption to their operations,"" Pratt & Whitney said in a separate statement."
34,"Jan 21, 2019 07:24PM ET",SMBC urges jetmakers to erase production snags before raising output,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - The head of one of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies has told leading planemakers to ""get their house in order"" and wipe out manufacturing delays before pushing already record production rates to even higher levels.SMBC Aviation Capital's chief executive, Peter Barrett, urged caution over production increases as he confirmed a new order for 65 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo-family aircraft to secure the Japanese-owned leasing company's growth well into the next decade.""We have been consistent with both manufacturers (Airbus and Boeing) in saying get deliveries right today ... get your production and delivery systems up to scratch,"" Barrett told Reuters.Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) are within reach of production rates at or close to 60 aircraft a month for their best-selling narrow-body models but have struggled with late deliveries.Both have begun exploring future output of about 70 jets a month to meet strong demand, but some of their engine makers are reluctant to back the move immediately, given difficulties experienced in switching to a new generation of fuel-saving engines.The cautious tone on future production reflects recognition that manufacturers must first ""get their house in order"" and improve the timing and quality of aircraft already being delivered, Barrett said.Aircraft lessors who control about half the world's fleet are traditionally cautious about production increases, fearing that a glut would knock values of assets they already own. But they have also been increasingly vocal about supply disruptions.SMBC Aviation, the world's fourth-largest leasing company, has said the order for 65 planes first reported by Reuters included 15 Airbus A321neos, the largest medium-haul model.Barrett said SMBC also had the option to upgrade A321neos to the longer-range A321LR version and that it is monitoring possible plans by Airbus for a longer-range A321XLR.Industry sources have said Airbus has stepped up pre-marketing for a 101-tonne A321XLR, which would expand the use of narrow-body jets for longer transatlantic trips. It is expected to launch it by mid-year to pre-empt Boeing proposals for a new mid-market jet with 220-270 seats.Barrett said SMBC would look at the possible new Boeing jet but its price and performance would be critical.Aircraft financiers are meeting in Dublin this week against the backdrop of a sector concerned that a decade-long boom is faltering as uncertainty creeps into the global economy and interest rates rise.SMBC is watching developments in China and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union for any wider economic impact but says overall demand for leased jets remains solid.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

IndiGo, India's biggest carrier by market share, and its low-cost rival GoAir, which fly the A320neos in the country, were forced to ground the aircraft on several occasions due to issues related to the engines. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered that airlines must inspect some parts of the 1100 series engines weekly and train the cabin and cockpit crew to deal with and report any kind of odor, burning smell or smoke. ""Log all the cases detecting odors/smoke in cabin during operation for necessary investigation and rectification,"" the DGCA said in its notification, adding that in all such cases the engine would need to be inspected in detail and used only after the defect is resolved.IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), and GoAir did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. Airbus and Pratt & Whitney were not immediately reachable. The new rules, which are effective immediately, were issued days after a meeting between the civil aviation ministry, the regulator, the two airlines, aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies (N:UTX) to discuss the issues with the engines. ""During (the) meeting, it was decided to issue directive in addition to the existing measures related to combustion chambers and No. 3 bearing issues for identifying and correcting impending failures of dry face seal,"" the DGCA said. The notification also said there would be restrictions imposed on the operation of A320neo flights to Port Blair - the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands. It was not immediately clear whether the regulator planned to restrict all A320neo flights to the islands or only place restrictions on a specific series of the engines that have been found to have issues.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Jan 17, 2019 11:20AM ET",Explainer: Why Siemens-Alstom rail merger is creating European tensions,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) agreed in 2017 to merge their rail assets, hoping to create a European industrial champion. But the EU's competition authority has doubts about the deal and could turn it down, despite the companies offering to take steps to clinch it.Siemens said on Thursday it was not prepared to make further concessions, meaning the merger's fate now likely rests in the hands of the European Commission, whose 28 commissioners are themselves split on the issue.The Commission has not commented publicly on its deliberations, beyond saying it will take a decision by Feb. 18.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned the EU's executive of a grave political error if it rejects the deal.His outspoken intervention reflects a frustration in Paris and some other European capitals that the EU's competition laws no longer reflect modern-day geopolitical realities, and in particular the threat from China.WHAT'S THE LATEST?Sources said Siemens planned no further concessions after it already offered to license parts of its high-speed train business and sell parts of its signaling operations to allay the EU antitrust concerns.For its part, Alstom said it considered the proposed concessions already on the table ""appropriate and adequate"" to get the deal approved.The merger would create the world's second largest rail company, with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros ($17 billion). That is roughly half the size of China's state-owned CRRC Corp Ltd (SS:601766) but twice the size of Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb). EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager worries the merger would stifle Europe's rail industry and has voiced doubts that China is likely to be a competitor on European railways in the near future.WHY IS IT SO POLITICALLY CHARGED?French President Emmanuel Macron champions a ""Europe that protects"". That includes protecting citizens from the threat to European jobs from Chinese firms. Europe, he says, needs to create industrial giants, like planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), to ensure its firms are not squeezed out of their own market.The Commission bases its judgment on EU competition law - ensuring that consumers have a choice that maintains downward pressure on prices in the European market.A weakness of the EU is its faith in an international rules-based system, especially when others violate it, French officials say.By applying its antitrust rules to the letter, the EU may end up benefiting China more than its own economic area, the French argue.At the same time, officials in Brussels question whether bending competition rules to forge European champions is the best way to rein China in or teach it a lesson.In a sign of the Commission's splits, the French and German commissioners are speaking up internally about the need to take the Chinese threat into account in deciding whether the Siemens-Alstom merger would hurt competition, European officials say.Several national regulators have opposed the deal or raised doubts about it, as have unions at the companies, making it hard for the Commission to overlook concerns.ARE THE EU LAW'S OUTDATED?France's Le Maire says Europe needs to wake up, branding its competition laws ""obsolete"". One German official said the Commission struggled to see beyond the EU market: ""They haven't understood the way China works ... (it) is not a market economy. There's this EU bubble thing, they haven't seen the global tectonic shifts."" Vestager says European champions cannot be built by undermining competition, and questions whether using competition policy is the best way to alter China's behavior. French officials acknowledge the debate is one that will not be resolved before a decision on Siemens-Alstom is due, meaning the deal may end up becoming collateral damage.AREN'T MACRON AND VESTAGER POLITICAL ALLIES?With a high profile in Brussels for attacking tax avoidance and monopoly powers among U.S. multinationals, Vestager is widely talked about as a liberal who could win support beyond her party as the next Commission president.The former Danish economy minister hasn't announced any public bid for the job, but if she does she would likely need the backing of Macron, another liberal, whose party will compete in May's European elections for the first time.If she ultimately rejects the Siemens-Alstom deal, it might taint her relations with Macron. Even so, French officials acknowledge that she has every reason to want to protect her reputation for applying the EU's rules firmly and fairly, earned via investigations into Google (O:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  over taxes, no matter what the political cost.WHAT DOES THIS LEAVE THE MERGER?Tom Pick, a competition expert at law firm Fieldfisher in Brussels, said he had heard no noises from Vestager that suggested she had changed her mind as a result of the concessions offered by the companies.""From what I see, what they are probably going to say is a prohibition, unless they have decided to market test again and have come to a different view,"" Pick said.The Commission will take a decision in a ""collegial"" manner involving all 28 commissioners, one nominated from each member state. As the commissioner responsible for competition, Vestager has a very strong say but the process of arriving at a collective decision can be opaque.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) aims to make a decision this year on the future of its CRJ regional jet as it ""aggressively"" pursues new orders to secure its industrial future, the Canadian planemaker's chief executive said on Wednesday.The company is exploring ""all strategic options"" for the loss-making program including a potential sale, but its immediate focus is to win orders and cut costs, CEO Alain Bellemare told Reuters.Asked whether Bombardier would reach a decision this year, he said, ""I hope so, for sure. The more certainty we can provide the better but we are getting good traction"".Bellemare was speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony marking a new U.S. assembly line for the larger A220 jetliner development, which Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell to a venture led by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR).Bombardier, which had struggled to keep pace with the huge cash demands of a new aircraft program, later sold its older Q400 turboprop program and announced a review of the 20-year-old CRJ series.""I don't want to drag this on for too long but a lot of that is not in my hands; it is also in customers' hands,"" Bellemare said.""We are trying to see how we build a backlog. For us to keep this thing going we need to have a skyline (future production profile) that makes sense. We are willing to maybe reduce our production volume but at the same time we need to have sufficient volume to feed the supply chain,"" he added.""We are very aggressive right now. We are working aggressively with airline customers. That's our number one priority.""Analysts say adding new orders and lowering costs are measures designed to throw the aging CRJ program a lifeline and make it more attractive to long-term investors.The CRJ competes with Embraer (SA:EMBR3) regional jets and is helped by union ""scope clause"" rules in the United States restricting the size of jets used by regional airlines.Bellemare played down concerns that the clauses could be renegotiated, hurting demand for the CRJ, saying they had historically been hard for airline managements to change.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It follows a similar deal by Boeing's rival Airbus (PA:AIR) which bought Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) commercial plane division that competed with Embraer.

42,"Jan 09, 2019 12:01PM ET",Exclusive: Saudi private jet industry stalls after corruption crackdown,nan,"By Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) - A crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia has severely dented the kingdom's private jet industry in a sign of the impact the campaign has had on private enterprise and the wealthy elite.Dozens of planes, owned by individuals and charter companies and worth hundreds of millions of dollars, are stranded at airports across the kingdom including Riyadh and Jeddah, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Some were handed over to the state in settlements reached after the crackdown was launched in late 2017, when dozens of princes, businessmen and government officials were detained, they said.Others belong to Saudis who either face travel bans or are reluctant to fly the planes because they are wary of displays of wealth that might be seen as taunting the government over the anti-corruption campaign, two of the sources said.The government media office did not respond to requests for comment. The General Authority of Civil Aviation said questions on the impact of the anti-corruption drive on the private jet industry were outside its mandate, adding that its relationship with private aviation covers operations, safety and regulations.The crackdown's impact on the business community and private enterprise, which are already reeling from low oil prices and weakened consumer confidence, has shattered investor confidence and contributed to a sense of uncertainty around the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The idle aircraft, which one of the sources estimated at up to about 70, include Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Gulfstream jets, the sources said. There are also larger Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) aircraft that are more commonly associated with commercial airlines but are often used in the Middle East as private jets.A Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo can cost up to $130 million, though the final cost depends on how the jet is fitted out with technology and amenities, including private bedrooms, meeting rooms, and even gym equipment. The number of registered private jets in Saudi Arabia stood at 129 as of December 2018 compared with 136 a year earlier, according to FlightAscend Consultancy data. Private jets offer users flexibility as, unlike commercial airliners, they are not constrained by arrival and departure time slots. They also enable users to travel more discreetly. UNDER THE RADARSaudi Arabia's finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, said last month the state had collected more than 50 billion riyals ($13.33 billion) from settlements reached under the crackdown.Most of the detainees held at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel in November 2017 were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government, which said it aims to seize more than $100 billion in total in either cash or assets. It is unclear how the government would transfer ownership of the jets grounded across Saudi Arabia as many are owned through offshore firms or are mortgaged, two of the sources familiar with the matter said. Three of the sources said it was likely that the jets were still registered in the kingdom.Two of the sources said the government could absorb the aircraft into existing fleets used by ministries and state-owned corporations. A third source said the government had been looking to set up its own private jet company made up entirely of seized aircraft.The anti-corruption campaign launched by Prince Mohammed has won widespread approval among ordinary Saudis, partly because the government has said it will use some of the funds to finance social benefits.Critics have said the purge was a power play by the prince as he moved to consolidate power in his hands.There have been few private jet flights in Saudi Arabia over the past year, largely because there are fewer planes readily available, including for charter, three of the sources familiar with the matter said. VistaJet Chief Commercial Officer Ian Moore compared it to the situation in China where an anti-corruption crackdown has also weakened the private jet market.""It's not really politically great to be seen flying privately at the moment, particularly owning your own aircraft,"" he told Reuters.Some wealthy Saudi elite are taking commercial airlines to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other destinations and then chartering private jets to avoid government scrutiny, two of the sources said.Plane manufacturers said the appetite for business jet sales in Saudi Arabia has dropped since the anti-corruption crackdown was launched in November 2017.""Political instability does not help consumer confidence in any way, shape or form,"" Embraer Executive Jets Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Friedrich told Reuters.

46,"Jan 08, 2019 06:21AM ET",Airbus met 2018 delivery target subject to audit: sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) operationally hit its main industrial target of 800 aircraft deliveries in 2018 after record handovers in December, two people briefed on the matter said. The final published number is subject to ongoing auditing checks, with raw delivery data standing on the 800 threshold, but Airbus is said to be optimistic that the European company has all but averted its first ever missed delivery goal.The unofficial tally, a European record, includes the Canadian A220 recently taken over by Airbus and reflects a frenetic effort to catch up after engine delays and other snags.It follows days of speculation over whether Airbus had managed to reach its main industrial goal, after cutting it in November due to gaps in engine supplies.""It seems that they made it,"" said one of the people.Airbus declined to comment.Shares in the European planemaker fell sharply last week after earlier signs that Airbus was unlikely to meet the target, including a report that it had fallen short by up to 9 jets.Industry sources had later said they did not rule out that Airbus would pull off a positive surprise as figures were compiled and audited. Airbus was due to publish full-year data on Friday but may bring this forward.Airbus shares were up by 2.7 percent in mid-session trading.Boeing (NYSE:BA) will publish its own data later on Tuesday and is expected to remain the world's largest planemaker for a seventh successive year after targeting 810-815 commercial deliveries.The roll call of new orders was less clear after a late push by both sides but Boeing reached a book-to-bill ratio of 1 after grabbing more net orders than deliveries in 2018, sources said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

49,"Jan 04, 2019 11:48AM ET",Airbus chases aircraft lessors as order race tightens,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has been chasing deals with leasing companies in recent weeks to try to narrow a gap in orders against rival Boeing (N:BA), while industry experts took a somewhat more sanguine view on 2018 deliveries after shares took a beating.The outcome of the recent leasing talks could affect a tighter-than-expected race for orders in 2018, though Airbus is relying on a recent burst of orders for a newly acquired Canadian jet program and lags Boeing on a like-for-like basis.The last-minute order flurry complicates a jigsaw of data awaited by investors as uncertainty lingers over whether Airbus met its crucial aircraft delivery target for 2018 - a reliable guide to profits and a barometer of supply chain tensions.Industry sources have said Airbus was unlikely to meet the 800-jet goal (782 excluding the Canadian A220), but others said Airbus could still spring a surprise after workers delivered jets late on Dec. 31 that had not been expected to make the cut.Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Airbus had delivered more than 790 and fewer than 800 aircraft in 2018.Shares in Airbus rebounded 3 percent on Friday after falling as much as 7.9 percent on Thursday due to doubts over deliveries and what dealers described as a possible trading error.In a new year message to staff, planemaking chief and designated chief executive Guillaume Faury sounded upbeat on 2018 but warned industrial execution and quality must improve.Even though official data would not be announced for a few days, ""all our team deserve a big congratulations,"" he said.Airbus is due to announce commercial data on Jan. 11, but without the fanfare of an annual news conference that for years featured outspoken former sales chief John Leahy as the company reins in communication before its full results, due on Feb 14.On the race for new orders, Irish leasing company SMBC Aviation was in talks with Airbus in the closing stretch of 2018 and looked close to expanding its narrow-body fleet by several dozen jets, industry sources said.SMBC Aviation and Airbus declined comment.Airbus was also said to be scouting for business in China, where it has a deal pending with lessor ICBC for 80 jets. A provisional order was announced at the Farnborough Airshow last July but the name of the buyer was never officially disclosed and the order is not yet on Airbus's books.People familiar with the deal linked it at the time to ICBC Leasing, one of China's fastest-growing leasing companies.A similar deal for 100 planes from Chinese-owned lessor Avolon, which had been kept under wraps in similar conditions as the industry waited to see how trade tensions between China and the United States would play out, was confirmed in December.Both Airbus and Boeing typically turn to leasing companies to stay afloat when economic concerns deter airlines, but the financiers who now control about half the world fleet pick their moment carefully in order to capture the steepest discounts.Airbus ended November with 380 net orders for 2018, to which it has since added 100 from Avolon and two U.S. deals for a total of 120 A220 aircraft. Boeing ended November with 690 net orders and has not announced firm new business since then.The U.S. company publishes its data on Jan. 8.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The jet will next fly to the city of Xian in central China for more test flights with a focus on aircraft flutter and airspeed calibration, the company said.The second prototype of the C919 jet conducted its first flight in December 2017, seven months after the maiden flight of the first C919.COMAC said it is assembling a further three prototypes, and that all six will be scheduled to conduct flight tests next year.The C919 has dozens of customers that have placed orders and commitments for 815 jets.COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators by the end of 2020, as well as Europe's aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

53,"Dec 20, 2018 01:43PM ET",Brazil judge again blocks Boeing-Embraer tie-up as deal nears close,nan,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Thursday issued his second injunction blocking the proposed sale of 80 percent of planemaker Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aviation division to  Boeing Co  (N:BA), as attempts to stop the deal intensified while the two companies neared closing the transaction. The same judge issued a similar injunction earlier this month that was swiftly appealed and overturned last week. The latest decision was in response to a class action filed by Embraer's union in Sao Jose dos Campos, where the planemaker is based. Embraer said it ""will take all necessary judicial measures"" to overturn the injunction. Boeing declined to comment. Embraer shares were down almost 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo on Thursday afternoon after rising almost 3 percent in the morning before news of the injunction.Challenges to the deal, which would help reshape the global aviation market as competition between Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) intensifies, have been plentiful and are common in Brazil.Four left-wing congressmen also challenged the proposed tie-up and won the previous injunction. Prosecutors with Brazil's labor ministry are investigating whether the tie-up could lead to job losses. An investor group sued on Monday, saying the deal should have been a public tender offer.Boeing and Embraer said on Monday they had finalized the terms of the agreement, increasing the valuation of the Brazilian planemaker's commercial division to $5.26 billion, citing higher closing costs. The net proceeds will remain the same.The agreement needs approval from the Brazilian government because it holds a so-called ""golden share"" in Embraer that gives it veto power over strategic decisions and any change in its controlling interest. The planemaker formally sought that approval on Monday and it is expected within 30 days.In his decision, the judge questioned whether Embraer's 20 percent participation in the proposed commercial aviation spinoff would actually be worth something.""The brutal asymmetry in the shareholder structure of this venture prevents it from being carried out without compromising the survival of national interests,"" Judge Victor Giuizo Neto wrote. The previous injunction was in response to a separate class action, filed by four legislators from the left-wing Workers Party.Separately on Thursday, Embraer announced a firm order of 100 jets from Republic Airways.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

55,"Dec 20, 2018 11:21AM ET",Airbus shares fall after report of U.S. joining corruption probe,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) fell sharply on Thursday after Le Monde newspaper reported the United States had opened an investigation into allegations of corruption, raising the stakes of probes already under way in Britain and France.The French newspaper said Airbus could face record fines of several billion euros as a result of the combined probes into allegations of fraud, corruption and bribery.Airbus shares were down by around 4 percent in late session trading, having at one stage fallen by as much as 9 percent.The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.In an obliquely worded statement reflecting standing instructions from fraud agencies not to comment on media reports directly, Airbus said it was already co-operating with UK and French probes triggered in 2016 by its own internal audit.It also noted it had previously disclosed that U.S. authorities had sought information on the case and added, ""Here, too, Airbus is co-operating with the U.S. authorities in close coordination with the (British) SFO and (French) PNF.""Estimates of a fine as large as 4-5 billion euros as a result of the reported U.S. action are about twice previous estimates, but several analysts said the stock market reaction was overdone against a backdrop of jittery global markets.Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said the 4-billion-euro drop in Airbus's value extended a fragile period driven by broader economic concerns and French wage protests.MIDDLEMENAt the center of the case is a decades-old system of third-party agents or intermediaries run from a now-disbanded headquarters unit which at its height involved some 250 people across parts of the world and several hundreds of millions of euros of payments a year, insiders say.Airbus is in the throes of a board-driven management clearout designed to demonstrate cooperation and change the face of the company in the hopes of winning a judicial settlement on the use of middlemen, a practice it says ended in 2014.Such a settlement would likely involve a fine and management upheaval but would avoid criminal prosecution and the even worse scenario of being barred from public contracts in the United States or falling foul of European Union debarment regulations.In October, Reuters reported that the board had hastened the departure of finance director Harald Wilhelm, prompting his surprise decision to resign even while acknowledging he had started the audit and halted the system of payments.People familiar with the matter have said the clearout extends across the senior ranks of the company and, coupled with a wave of retirements, led to an unprecedented speed of change.Others have been placed under pressure to leave, prompting arguments over who should take responsibility for the highly centralised system, multiple sources close to the case said.Airbus said in February it had been asked to supply information to U.S. authorities about conduct at the center of a UK and French probe into the use of middlemen in jetliner sales, potentially drawing the United States into the corruption case.In a separate case, Airbus said in 2017 it had reported inaccuracies in filings to U.S. regulators under a part of U.S. arms exports controls governing the use of commissions.People familiar with the case say progress has been slowed by French rules limiting the ability of foreign agencies to collect information or directly question French citizens.Several sources said U.S. authorities had demonstrated frustration at the process and taken steps through sporadic questioning to remind Europe about their interest in the case.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It would sit at the top of a narrowbody range driving most Airbus profits.The upgrade would boost the A321's take-off weight to some 101 tonnes for the A321XLR compared with 97 tonnes for the longest-range A321LR, which can carry 206 people 4,000 miles in two classes and went to its first customer last month.It would rely on more powerful engines already offered as an option, giving 33,000 pounds of thrust instead of 30,000 pounds.An Airbus spokesman said the A321 ""still has lots of potential"" and declined comment on product strategy.Until now, Airbus has kept Boeing guessing on how it might respond to its plans for a New Mid-Sized Airplane (NMA) with 220-260 seats between traditional small and large jet segments.Among Airbus's top targets will be the major U.S. airlines, who could use the A321XLR to serve transatlantic routes with premium seats and who are also likely to be wooed by Boeing for its new jet. Their decisions could influence the fate of both projects.The A321XLR would be less attractive for low-cost carriers who could not exploit the extra range without giving up part of their 240-seat preferred layout due to structural limits.The contest for the middle of the market is expected to dominate the commercial jet industry in the coming year.Boeing aims to define a new corner of the jet market with a wide-cabin aircraft capable of operating as cheaply as the workhorse single-aisle planes like the A321 and its own 737.Without an all-new design on its drawing board, Airbus is trying to squeeze its rival by tweaking profitable models above and below the NMA, but has had limited success with its larger A330neo and is directing effort where it has the most advantage.With its A321XLR, Airbus aims to ""shoot at the NMA from below,"" a person familiar with the plans said. However, it has already shelved plans for a much more extensive redesign.Analysts say some questions remain about its performance, while the industry also faces an unresolved debate over how long passengers will sit in narrower fuselages as medium-haul jets get more and more range to complement dedicated long-haul jets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Dec 17, 2018 11:00AM ET",Airbus to boost some pay as Macron urges French firms to tackle crisis,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) is ready to pay a special bonus to its lowest-paid workers after French President Emmanuel Macron called on French companies to help tackle weeks of protests about the cost of living, according to a staff memo.The intervention by Europe's largest aerospace firm - part-owned by French, German and Spanish states - comes after Macron last week urged company leaders including planemaking chief and designated CEO Guillaume Faury to do more to ease the crisis.However, Airbus - which depends primarily on exports of jetliners in competition with U.S rival Boeing (N:BA) - has also stressed the importance of remaining competitive and warned against focusing solely on ""cyclical and pecuniary measures"".""Airbus is ready to contribute and support the government's action in response to this emergency, while recalling the absolute necessity to maintain the competitiveness of French companies that are exposed, like Airbus, to strong international competition,"" said the memo to French staff seen by Reuters.A spokeswoman said the size and scope of any bonus payment had yet to be defined and would be discussed in the regular course of dialogue with the company's unions.Airbus employs 48,000 people in France where aerospace workers are comparatively well paid, with average industry salaries of 4,250 euros ($4,815) a month compared with the national average of 2,250, according to aerospace lobby GIFAS.Airbus does however have an unspecified number of lower-paid workers in France, where its lowest wage stands at 1,700 euros a month, compared with the national minimum wage of 1,500.Macron met bankers and company bosses including Faury last week after weeks of demonstrations against his government. Thousands took part in a fifth weekend of protests on Saturday.The 'yellow vest' movement started in mid-November with protests at junctions against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilization against Macron's economic policies.During the protests, a convoy of parts for the world's largest airliner, the A380, was briefly halted by protesters.Last week reports said protesters blocked access to Airbus and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) sites in Toulouse, where the planemaker is based.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Dec 16, 2018 12:34AM ET",Boeing opens first 737 plant in China amid U.S.-Sino trade war,nan,"By Josh HorwitzZHOUSHAN, China (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) opened its first 737 completion plant in China on Saturday, a strategic investment aimed at building a sales lead over arch-rival Airbus (PA:AIR) in one of the world's top travel markets that has been overshadowed by the U.S-China trade war.The world's largest planemaker also delivered the first of its top-selling 737s completed at the facility in Zhoushan, about 290 km (180 miles) southeast of Shanghai, to state carrier  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) during a ceremony on Saturday with top executives from both companies.The executives, alongside representatives from China's state planner and aviation regulator, unveiled the plane at an event attended by hundreds of people.Boeing and Airbus have been expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the fast-growing aviation market, which is expected to overtake the United States as the world's largest in the next decade. Boeing invested $33 million last year to take a majority stake in a joint venture with state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) to build the completion center, which installs interiors and paints liveries. Chicago-based Boeing calls itself the top U.S. exporter and delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, where it forecasts demand for 7,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years valued at $1.2 trillion.However, the plant's inaugural ceremony was overshadowed by tensions between the United States and China as they engage in a bruising tit-for-tat tariff war. The world's two largest economies are in a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. ""Am I nervous about the situation? Yeah, of course. It's a challenging environment,"" John Bruns, President of Boeing China, told reporters on a conference call earlier on Saturday.""We have to keep our eye on the long game in China. Long term, I'm optimistic we will work our way through this,"" he said.While the trade frictions have hurt businesses such as U.S. soy bean farmers and Chinese manufacturers, their impact on Boeing has been unclear. U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs.Bruns said he remained optimistic about the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China and described aviation as a ""bright spot"" amid tensions between the two countries. Asked about the possibility of technology transfer agreements between Boeing and COMAC, Bruns stressed that the purpose of the plant was for installing seats, painting vehicles, and completing the planes' final delivery. ""That's only a part of what we do in the production of airplanes,"" he said.Officials and executives made no direct reference to the trade tensions in public remarks at the planemaker's Zhoushan facility.Boeing aims eventually to hit a delivery target of 100 planes a year at Zhoushan, although Bruns deflected a question on how quickly it would reach that level and said Boeing had no plans to expand work to other aircraft types.Boeing also hopes the plant will relieve pressure at the Seattle-area facility where it plans to boost production next year of its best-selling 737 narrowbody aircraft but has struggled with production delays.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Dec 14, 2018 07:17AM ET",Exclusive: China Development Bank supervising HNA asset sales - sources,nan,"By Kane Wu, Shu Zhang and Julie ZhuHONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB) is leading a team to supervise HNA Group's asset disposals as the heavily indebted conglomerate scales back operations to a point that will leave it holding only core assets, people familiar with the situation said.The finance-to-aviation group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the group stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets.Faced with soaring debts and China's crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, HNA has pushed ahead with asset sales that have so far included real estate, stakes in hotels groups and discussions on key overseas units such as Ingram Micro and its luxury $300-million-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"".A work group, led by China's largest policy bank CDB as HNA's biggest creditor, moved into HNA headquarters in Haikou in the southern province of Hainan in the second half of the year and is closely monitoring its asset sales, the people said. The bank is not involved in individual sale negotiations but any deal would need its nod, according to two of the people.Last month, Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), HNA's main domestic carrier, said it was seeking a 7.5 billion yuan ($1.09 billion) loan from a group led by CDB, to help cover operating expenses. Earlier this month, financing from CDB was instrumental in Airbus (PA:AIR) resuming stalled delivery of planes to HNA-affiliated airlines.CDB is pushing HNA to get its house in order by the middle of next year, said two of the people, who could not be named as the information is confidential. ""It looks like the regulators have gone beyond simply cutting back HNA's assets and maybe moving toward complete dissolution of the company but they have yet to declare that as the official policy,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, which focuses on China.An HNA spokesman said the group was refocusing its strategy around its core aviation-related assets to improve operations and strengthen its balance sheet. ""The company has remained disciplined and thoughtful as it takes decisive actions to streamline its portfolio and organizational structure,"" he said.CDB declined to comment. BACK TO COREHNA is planning to shed assets and retain only Hainan Airlines and its logistics business, three of the people said.It has been engaged with potential investors for its stakes in two Hong Kong-based carriers, Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express Airways, two of them said. Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings had expressed interest in the airlines but walked away in the end, according to one of them. HNA is also in talks to bring in new investors as controlling shareholders in its smaller regional airlines in China, the people said. On Wednesday, HNA signed an agreement with state-owned Beijing Tourism Group to transfer shares in Beijing Capital Airlines.""Overseas airlines and domestic regional airlines are not part of the core businesses and will likely go off its books,"" said a Hong Kong-based hedge fund analyst, who has been following HNA's unwinding of assets. Last month, Hainan Airlines agreed a restructuring of its Urumqi Air unit which involved ceding majority control to the Urumqi government and leaving it with 30 percent.Founded in 1989 as an airlines operator in China's Hainan island, HNA had been aggressively buying overseas assets and expanding its businesses since 2015, aiming to build a global empire with trophy holdings such as stakes in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Hilton Hotels Worldwide Holdings (N:HLT).Less than three years later, HNA has found itself reversing track. It has sold over $12 billion in overseas assets this year and has at least $23 billion more to offload, according to Reuters calculations based on filings and media reports.The conglomerate has disposed nearly 300 billion yuan ($43.6 billion) worth of assets in 2018, its chairman Chen Feng told local magazine Caijing in November.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Dec 14, 2018 05:10AM ET",Jet Airways' survival may rest on founder Goyal leaving the cockpit,nan,"By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jet Airways Ltd's (NS:JET) 69-year-old founder Naresh Goyal, who started out as an assistant in a travel agency, wove together charm, persistence and consummate dealmaking to build India's biggest full-service carrier.Now, his penchant for control has emerged as a major obstacle as the indebted airline tries to negotiate a rescue deal, several people who have worked closely with him or known him over the years told Reuters on condition of anonymity.""He was a visionary in his day but those days are behind us,"" said a senior aircraft financier who has done deals with Goyal. ""This is the moment of truth for Naresh Goyal.""The rising dominance of low-cost carrier IndiGo (NS:INGL) in a price sensitive market as well as high oil prices, hefty fuel taxes and a weak rupee have left Jet strapped for cash and unable to pay employees and lessors on time.The 25-year-old airline, which Goyal set up with his wife at a time when state-run Air India was the only real formidable opponent, has outstanding dues of about $400 million.Jet, which has a mainly  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fleet, has delayed pre-delivery payments to the Seattle-based aircraft maker as well as to Airbus SE (PA:AIR), and is overdue on its repair and maintenance contracts, two sources aware of the matter said.Although the Indian air travel market is the world's fastest growing, at about 20 percent a year, it is also hobbled by cut-throat competition and chronically low fares. To stay afloat, Jet is cutting flights on some non-profitable routes and trying to raise cash by monetizing assets.It still retains a valuable strategic position as the biggest operator at Mumbai airport, where all of the good slots have been taken and a second airport is years away. It also has lucrative slots at major international airports and code share agreements with more than 20 airlines. Jet has survived a near-death experience once before; in 2013, Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways injected $600 million of capital for a 24 percent stake in the airline, three London Heathrow slots and a majority share in Jet's frequent flyer program. The infusion helped Jet pare down debt and fight growing domestic competition.The airline is in talks with Etihad a second time and with Indian conglomerate Tata Sons for fresh funds or a stake sale, but sources have told Reuters that any rescue would require Goyal to step down, or take a less prominent role.Goyal has rejected seeking funds from Tata if it meant him having to give up his position, two sources aware of the discussions said. Talks with Etihad are continuing.Goyal did not directly respond to requests for comment but a Jet spokeswoman said the ""conjectures being implied with regards to the organization's ways of working"" were misleading.""The airline management is a fully empowered team ... all strategic, operational and tactical decisions are taken by the management under the advice of the company's board of directors,"" she said.UNFORGIVING BUSINESSWill Horton, an independent aviation analyst based in Hong Kong, said it was time for Jet to evolve beyond ""one leader or family"".""A change at the top runs its course down. Freedom to implement a new management plan is critical for strategic and financial partners, existing and potentially new,"" he said.When Goyal launched Jet Airways in 1993, air travel in India was at a nascent stage. He kickstarted the sector's growth and put the country on the map.With 124 planes, Jet now flies to places like Hong Kong, Dubai, Paris and London, besides over 45 destinations in India.Ceding control may not be easy for Goyal. He is Jet's chairman and holds a 51 percent stake in the airline with his wife Anita still on the board.""It is a very mom-and-pop kind of operation where nothing happens without the two of them,"" said a former Jet employee, who describes the founder as a workaholic.Goyal is always involved in key decisions and the airline's CEOs often have little executive power and do not survive for long, according to two other current and former employees.Jet has had seven CEOs in 10 years with its current chief Vinay Dube taking over in August 2017.""The airline is his life and he built it from nothing, you have to give him respect for that,"" said one of the former employees. ""But ... the airline business can be unforgiving.""In 2012,  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines, founded by Indian businessman Vijay Mallya, went bust for want of cash, leaving its lessors and creditors with pending dues.After Kingfisher went down, India ratified the Cape Town convention, an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments. That means Jet's lessors could choose to reclaim planes in case of a default. The airline could also be dragged to court by its creditors under India's new insolvency laws.LIMITED OPTIONSJet is committed to turning around its business and creating ""a competitive cost structure that ensures a sustainable future for the airline and its stakeholders"", the spokeswoman said. She did not comment on any specific deals but said the airline continues to be in active discussions with various investors to secure ""sustainable financing"".But Jet's rescue options appear somewhat limited given its poor financial position - it posted losses in the last three quarters and its shares have fallen about 70 percent so far this year, erasing more than $900 million in market value.Goyal, is knocking on all doors, including that of the government. Jet and Etihad executives also met lenders in India to discuss a rescue deal.Senior Etihad adviser and former Jet CEO Cramer Ball was in Mumbai last week, just days ahead of a meeting of the Abu Dhabi carrier's board on Dec. 7 where it was expected to discuss its investment in the Indian airline, two sources said. The outcome of the closed-door meeting remains unknown.Etihad, in an e-mail to Reuters, said it would not comment on speculation.However, the Abu Dhabi carrier, which owns 24 percent of Jet, is ready to put in more money only if Goyal dilutes his stake, a source aware of the matter told Reuters. Even so, Etihad's stake will be capped at 49 percent due to foreign ownership rules in Indian airlines and if it goes past the 25 percent ownership threshold, it would need to adhere to capital markets regulations and make an open offer to shareholders to buy a further 26 percent stake. If forced to do this, Etihad would risk breaching the foreign ownership restrictions and so it may have to seek a rare exemption from the markets regulator from making an open offer.Talks with Tata are on the backburner for now but three people familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said they may be found waiting in the wings if the Etihad deal falls through.""There is an expectation that there will be a rescue and Goyal will find a way - he always does - but there is no clarity on how much control he will have after a deal is done,"" said one of the people who works with him.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Dec 14, 2018 03:29AM ET",Airbus names Mhun as next programs chief,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Friday named services boss Philippe Mhun as its next head of programs, succeeding defense and commercial aerospace veteran Didier Evrard, who is scheduled to retire.The move completes a tandem of top-level industrial changes at Europe's largest aerospace group after Airbus last month hired Bosch appliances executive Michael Schoellhorn to replace soon-to-retire Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB).Mhun, 56, is currently senior vice-president of services at Airbus - a fiercely competitive marketplace in which both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are targeting increases in revenue as they place after-market activities at the center of future developments.He began his career in engineering at the now defunct French airline UTA and followed it into Air France when UTA was absorbed into the French national carrier in the early 1990s.In July, Mhun confirmed plans for Airbus to triple revenue from commercial aircraft services - such as spare parts and predictive maintenance data - to $10 billion in the next decade.Boeing has said its possible next development, a mid-market jet carrying 220-260 passengers, will allow it to speed up the introduction of digital design methods so that future services revenues are factored in from the earliest planning stage.Sources said Mhun's appointment will bring a customer perspective and an after-market emphasis to Airbus, which is also investing in digital tools to draw more business from the full life cycle of a jet, from design to retirement.""It means that services will be driven deeply into programs,"" a person familiar with the company said.Evrard is credited with the execution of two of Europe's most ambitious aerospace projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, with relatively few delays compared to past programs such as the A380 superjumbo.He had been due to retire earlier in 2018 but agreed to stay until year end, along with Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams, in order to tackle recent industrial and supplier problems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

65,"Dec 13, 2018 07:08AM ET",Airbus strategy review augurs clean break under new CEO,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has launched a strategic review to outline changes under incoming chief executive Guillaume Faury as it faces industrial challenges and prepares for overdue modernization, industry sources said.The ""Airbus Next Chapter"" review involves a team of planners working outside the normal strategy organization in pursuit of a break from years of industrial problems, management feuds and an ongoing bribery scandal.It is being led by former investor relations chief Julie Kitcher in what one insider described as a signal to financial markets that profits will be embedded in strategy, as the once state-sponsored European project marks its 50th anniversary.Planemaking boss Faury, who becomes CEO when Tom Enders retires next April, ""wants to go fast and introduce a new state of mind; he wants to turn the page on the past,"" a person familiar with the company said.Airbus declined comment on the review, which is designed to war-game strategic decisions and possible structural changes.Founded in 1969, Airbus (PA:AIR) has risen to compete on a par with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and is one of Europe's leading exporters.But its growth has been punctuated by Franco-German tensions, personal rivalries and most recently a crippling bribery investigation that accelerated management departures.The review may address how Airbus can meet demand by sharply ramping up production of jets like its A320. One previous taboo that may come up for discussion is a fragmented production system securing jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.The A320 is the lifeblood of Europe's largest aerospace group, described by operations chief Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB), who retires later this month, as the ""golden goose"".Executives are warning Airbus must not find itself lacking in proven technology for the A320's successor after 2030, as it had been in wide-bodies when Boeing launched its 787.For now, Airbus is winning a bigger slice of the market on the A320 but some analysts say it has fallen behind Boeing in manufacturing techniques - a gap that could grow if Boeing launches a mid-market jet with a new factory system.The review may study how Airbus can compete with Silicon Valley for talents in the digital era, while handling a wave of departures through retirements and a board-driven clearout.Spurning global firms that typically work for Airbus, Faury has brought in Zurich-based consultants Egon Zehnder who are better known as head-hunters. The roll-call of scheduled retirements continued this week as Alberto Gutierrez was named head of military aircraft as Fernando Alonso steps down after stabilizing the troubled A400M.Programmes chief Didier Evrard, who led two of Europe's most ambitious projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, is due to retire this month and will be replaced by an internal candidate from services or engineering.Some changes are happening already, with Airbus switching its quality-control chief this week after a series of snags.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The carrier is cashing in on a booming leasing sector after ordering hundreds of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) planes at bargain prices in recent years to become one of Airbus' biggest customers.Castlelake, a global fund focused on alternative investments, has been stepping up its exposure to aviation assets. In June last year, it raised $1 billion from investors including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and pension funds.""Castlelake is growing at a fast pace and looking to buy aviation assets,"" said one of the people. ""This is one of their biggest deals in Asia with one airline.""Castlelake clinched the deal from Malaysia's AirAsia after edging out U.S. lessors, funds and leasing units of major Chinese banks in a tightly contested deal, said the people, who did not wish to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the transaction.Castlelake and AirAsia are expected to close the deal in the next few weeks, the people said.Castlelake and AirAsia declined comment.Earlier this year, AirAsia agreed to sell part of its aircraft leasing portfolio in a staggered deal for $1.2 billion to firms managed by BBAM Ltd, one of the world's largest aircraft portfolio managers.Castlelake is buying older aircraft which are under lease to AirAsia's affiliated airlines, the people said. AirAsia's leasing subsidiary, Asia Aviation Capital, manages AirAsia's planes.""This is an upcoming sector for asset managers. They see an opportunity to buy older aircraft and sell them once the lease expires,"" said another person familiar with the transaction.Castlelake was ranked as the 32nd biggest lessor with the value of its total fleet estimated at $2.1 billion in consultancy FlightGlobal's ranking of top global lessors as of September 2018.Chinese bank-owned leasing units and the likes of U.S. listed AerCap Holdings NV (N:AER) and  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) GE Capital Aviation Services dominate the leasing industry, but the share of asset managers and funds is gradually rising.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Avianca had agreed to buy 100 A320neo planes to modernize its fleet.""Of those 100, we'll probably receive between 50 and 80 planes,"" he said. ""We don't have any doubt that we will keep growing, what has changed is the rhythm of the growth.""Technological advancement is part of the reason for the airline wanting to reduce its purchases, Rincon added.""The rhythm of technology is changing, it will take a while to get all of the order and we don't want to have a commitment to planes with today's technology which will be received by us in 10 or 15 years,"" he said. A reduction in the original order, which was set to cost $10 billion, will also give Avianca some financial breathing room, Rincon added.At the end of last month Avianca, United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and Copa Airlines of Panama said they had finalized a three-way joint venture that will allow them to plan routes and fares together and share revenues on those routes.United, Avianca and Copa are already codeshare partners and Star Alliance members.""We've started conversations with Lufthansa, but its very embryonic,"" said Rincon. ""We hope to reach an agreement to benefit our passengers in Europe, which is a relevant and growing market.""The deal with Lufthansa would be similar to the one just agreed with United and Copa, Rincon added.Under the United and Copa agreement, United said it would provide a $456 million term loan to cash-strapped Avianca's top shareholder, Synergy Group Corp. Loss-making Avianca has a roughly $4 billion debt pile, of which 40 percent is due within the next two years, according to recent financial statements.That deal still has to be approved by regulators.Avianca will also start operating a regional subsidiary in Colombia in 2019, meant to serve medium and small-sized cities with 12 ATR 42 planes.

69,"Dec 07, 2018 07:30PM ET",Airbus wins December deliveries some breathing room after busy November,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has left itself a slightly less challenging task on deliveries for the final weeks of the year than 2017's record surge in December, but only after trimming the target with its most recent results, company data showed on Friday.Airbus said it had delivered 673 aircraft up to the end of November, leaving 109 aircraft still to be delivered in December in order to reach a core target of 782 deliveries - excluding the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now selling as the A220.Airbus in October said it maintained a target of 800 deliveries for 2018, but that these would now include 18 A220 models previously been excluded from the goal - a move equivalent to cutting the core Airbus target by 2 percent to 782 aircraft.Had it not done so, it would have had to repeat last year's record feat of 127 deliveries in December, after taking into account a 20 percent rise in deliveries last month. Airbus recently took formal control of the former Bombardier A220 after buying it to bolster its lineup of larger jets and thwart a possible sale of the project to China, a future aerospace rival.Still, it has been struggling to keep its own deliveries on track this year due to a combination of engine delays and industrial problems. Most industry sources have estimated it will hit the recently softened target, but with a razor-thin margin for error.November saw an acceleration of deliveries to airlines linked to China's debt-laden HNA Group, including five for Beijing Capital airlines, directly or via leasing firms.Reuters last month reported Airbus was set to resume stalled deliveries of jets to HNA Group.November also saw the first delivery of the upgraded A330neo long-range range model to TAP Portugal.Further A330neo deliveries have been slowed by snags at engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Airbus's incoming chief executive said last month those delays should be re-absorbed by end-2019.Emirates took two A380 deliveries in November.On the order front, Airbus sold 40 planes commercially plus three internally for conversion to air tankers.Its January-November tally of 439 gross orders - or 380 after cancellations - leaves it well behind rival Boeing Co's (N:BA) totals of 821 gross and 642 net orders up to the end of October, the latest period for which figures are available.Earlier on Friday, leasing firm Avolon firmed up an order for 100 A320-family aircraft that will appear in the year-end order count, due to be released in mid-January.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"Dec 06, 2018 05:08PM ET",Embraer-Boeing aviation deal blocked by Brazilian court,nan,"By Ricardo Brito and Marcelo RochabrunBRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal court on Thursday granted an injunction blocking the proposed tie-up between U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), a deal the Brazilian company says is crucial to its survival.Embraer shares in Sao Paulo closed 2.42 percent lower, although it remained too early to say whether the injunction will actually block or significantly affect the deal. Labor groups in Brazil often bring court challenges against significant business deals and the injunction could be reversed.The decision forbids Embraer's board of directors from signing the deal to create a joint venture on commercial aviation that Boeing would control. Boeing declined to comment and Embraer did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The legal action was brought by four congressmen with Brazil's left-wing Workers Party.The companies announced in July that Embraer would sell 80 percent of its commercial aviation business to Boeing in a deal valuing that segment at $4.75 billion. Embraer, among the world's largest makers of mid-sized planes of up to 150 passengers, used to compete in that segment with Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).The deal has stalled partly because the Brazilian government, which has veto power at the planemaker, has been reluctant to give it a greenlight. Only then could the company call a shareholders meeting to approve it.In his decision, judge Victorio Giuizio Neto cast doubt that the proposed deal would be good for Embraer's bottom line. ""The reason is very simple, Boeing is not giving up anything"" in this transaction, he wrote. The decision says Embraer would give up its profitable commercial division. He added that the new company would threaten the rights of the Brazilian government because it would restrict its control over Embraer to the part of the company that will not be sold to Boeing. Bombardier spun off its mid-sized commercial jet division earlier this year after selling a controlling stake to Boeing rival Airbus (PA:AIR).The deal between Boeing and Embraer is widely seen as a reaction to an earlier deal between that joint venture. Boeing and Airbus historically have produced larger aircraft than Embraer and Bombardier. But the mid-sized segment is expected to grow substantially, which would give Airbus a significant advantage over Boeing unless the U.S. planemaker also expands into that market. Brazil President Michel Temer said he would leave the decision to the future administration, which takes office Jan. 1. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has said he is in favor of the deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges,"" said Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson in a statement.Outgoing Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the two firms made ""a great industry team.""Militaries rely on tankers - which are essentially flying gas stations - to extend their reach by refueling combat aircraft during military exercises or military missions. Demand has grown given the large number of longer-range military operations underway around the world.Airbus is banking on the international success of its A330-based Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), which has been selected by 12 countries, including Australia, Britain and South Korea. The aircraft is already refueling or capable of refueling most major U.S. combat airplanes, including the stealthy F-35 fighter jet.Lockheed, builder of the F-35 and the C-130J transport plane that can also be used as a tanker, will give Airbus a strong partner for future U.S. bids, the companies said.""This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise,"" said Michele Evans, the new head of Lockheed's aeronautics division. The U.S. Air Force, which wants to ultimately replace its entire fleet of over 400 tankers, is examining ways to meet growing demand for aerial refueling with possible fee-for-service arrangements, purchases of hundreds of additional aircraft, and the future development of a stealthy tanker.Senior executives from Airbus and Lockheed agreed in Madrid to jointly explore all those opportunities, but are still working on details of their future cooperation, according to sources familiar with the matter.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

According to sources, deliveries of over a dozen planes have been hit by HNA-related funding shortages.Reuters reported last week that China Development Bank (CDB), HNA's biggest creditor, was expected to be involved in financing deliveries of up to 8 of the planes.Airbus declined to comment on Tuesday whether these were the eight planes that CDB's aviation leasing arm had agreed to finance, saying that talks and contractual terms with customers are confidential, but added that deliveries were ongoing. HNA did not immediately respond to Reuters questions. The Chinese aviation-to-finance conglomerate has attracted much scrutiny for its $50 billion worth of deals in recent years that included hotels in the United States and left it the largest shareholder in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).Faced with soaring debts and China's crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, HNA has been pushing ahead with a series of asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotel groups, but has said that it will hold onto its core airline business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

75,"Nov 29, 2018 07:50PM ET",Exclusive: Boeing eyes Lion Air crash software upgrade in 6-8 weeks,nan,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim HepherSEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is weighing plans to launch a software upgrade for its 737 MAX in six to eight weeks that would help address a scenario faced by the Lion Air crew during last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.Crash investigators are focusing on the possibility that a new anti-stall system that repeatedly pushed the Lion Air jetliner's nose down was being fed by erroneous data from a faulty sensor left in place after a previous hazardous flight.Boeing has said cockpit procedures that were applied on the previous flight are already in place to tackle such a problem, and that its 737 series remains safe to fly.But U.S. regulators have said Boeing is also examining a possible software fix, after coming under fire for not outlining recent changes to the automated system in the manual for the 737 MAX, the latest version of its best-selling passenger jet.While plans for the possible fix are not final, Boeing's software upgrade could block the recently modified anti-stall system, known as MCAS, from continuously running until the plane hits its nose-down limit, the sources said.The MCAS function would be disabled if the crew counteracted it by trimming or adjusting settings in the opposite direction, according to two people briefed on Boeing's proposals. ""When the crew makes the adjustment, that would essentially disengage MCAS unless it got new data,"" one of the people said.Data from the Lion Air flight recorder suggests the pilots sought to correct the system more than two dozen times before the jetliner plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people onboard. Attention has focused on the role of a suspect ""angle of attack"" sensor used to drive alerts on stall or loss of lift.While each 737 has two of these blade-shaped vanes, the plane's anti-stall system relies on data pulled from just a single vane during each flight, compared with a three-sensor ""voting"" system on rival Airbus (PA:AIR) jetliners. Boeing's software update would come as an emergency measure from Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration, the sources said. SECOND PROBE The specific system for preventing stalls was not originally designed to monitor both probes because regulators assumed risks of a mishap were small and would be further reduced by the presence of a trained crew and power switches on errant systems.Now, however, Boeing is examining whether the anti-stall system should also check data from the second probe before engaging, according to a person briefed on the matter. Boeing declined comment on the proposed changes.""As part of our standard practice following any accident or incident, we examine our aircraft design and operation, and when appropriate, issue bulletins and make recommendations to operators to further enhance safety,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said. ""Boeing continues to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.""The FAA has repeatedly said it will ""take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant.""A decision to update the software has not been finalised and Boeing could choose a different strategy, the people said.The world's largest planemaker has 4,542 of the upgraded 737 MAX on order from airlines, worth over half a trillion dollars at list prices, or about half that after typical discounts. Boeing has delivered 241 of the jets to customers since it entered service last year, according to its website.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Baker(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the activist hedge fund that sits on Arconic Inc's (N:ARNC) board, is working to address potential liabilities weighing on the sale process for the U.S. aluminum products maker, according to people familiar with the matter.Elliott's move comes after Arconic rejected an acquisition offer of more than $11 billion from Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) as inadequate. Elliott hopes its intervention can help Arconic fetch a higher price, the sources said on Thursday.Arconic shares rose 3.3 percent to $21.51 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $10.4 billion. The potential legal liabilities stem from Arconic's building and construction systems division, which makes facades, windows and framing products. Its Reynobond PE panels were used in the cladding of the London's Grenfell Tower apartment complex, where more than 70 people were killed last year in a blaze.Elliott has proposed a structure that would place liabilities of Arconic's cladding business in a separate entity, the sources said. The technique, called ringfencing, has been used by other industrial conglomerates seeking to limit exposure to similar legal claims, the sources added.Elliott would also roll its 11 percent stake into the winning bid for the company, the sources said. This will allow Elliott to retain its equity in the company while other shareholders get cash.Arconic has asked Apollo, as well as a buyout consortium led by Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) and  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), to now submit new offers for the company on Friday, the sources said. Arconic's board plans to meet next week to review the offers, one of the sources added.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Arconic, Blackstone and Carlyle did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Elliott and Apollo declined to comment.A deal for Arconic would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year. It would come after U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of aluminum tariffs this year drove up some costs for Arconic, which makes aluminum components for cars and airplanes.Arconic, which was spun out of  Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) in 2016, said in February it would carry out a ""strategy and portfolio review."" It said last month in its third-quarter earnings announcement that it was ""extending the scope and duration of this activity to address additional scenarios,"" and that it expected to complete its review in the fourth quarter.Arconic reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit last month and raised its full-year earnings forecast, driven by higher demand for aluminum parts used by its airplane customers, including  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus planemaking chief Guillaume Faury said he expected Airbus to catch up on delayed A330neo deliveries by end-2019.Sales of the A330neo have also fallen short of expectations as Boeing places its 787, but Faury predicted these would pick up following the first delivery.""The A330neo will in my view get more traction when it is in service,"" he told reporters.One of the earliest and largest customers for the A330neo, leasing firm Avolon which financed the first TAP aircraft, said Airbus still needed to win more orders.""It is a soft (order) backlog. We would prefer if there were more airplanes sold to more customers - wouldn’t anybody?,"" Avolon Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery told Reuters.""But the thing that is giving us comfort is that the replacement wave for the (earlier) A330-200 hasn’t really kicked in and it should kick in this year, next year and the year after.""Airbus recently won A330neo orders from Kuwait Airways and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), but Delta said it had deferred some deliveries of the newer A350 and industry sources say Kuwait had been given flexibility to delay or cancel A350s in return for its support.MID-MARKET STRATEGYThe A330neo - sporting a newer cabin and larger engines than existing A330 long-haul jets - is the latest gambit in a battle between Airbus and Boeing over the fiercely contested 'middle of the market,' sitting between long-haul and medium-haul planes.Boeing is weighing proposals to develop a dedicated jet carrying 220-270 people in a development analysts say could damage the A330, the most profitable Airbus wide-body model.Airbus is attempting to close its jaws around the same part of the market through a combination of the 250-300-seat A330neo at the top end and the smaller A321neo underneath.The dogfight between plane giants has been one of the most intense for years, prompting European claims that Boeing is trying to drive the A330neo out of the market to make way for its potential new jet. ""Boeing failed in its mission to kill the A330,"" Airbus twin-aisle marketing head Crawford Hamilton said.Boeing rejected this. ""We are focused on delivering the most capable, most efficient and versatile airplanes to airlines around the world,"" a spokesman said.Boeing says it has won 65 percent of wide-body orders in the last 5 years. Airbus says the A330 won some 50 percent of orders contested against the 787 since the A330neo version was launched in 2014. Both firms select data to support marketing campaigns.The aircraft delivered to TAP Portugal on Monday is the 298-seat A330-900neo, the larger of two versions developed by Airbus and one that dominates the tally of 242 aircraft on order.Of these, 28 are officially earmarked for IranAir but Airbus says these won't be delivered any time soon due to renewed U.S sanctions, which apply to all jets using significant U.S. parts.The smaller A330-800neo took its first flight this month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Supporting over 120,000 jobs, the UK's aerospace sector is the second largest in the world and depends on smooth cross-border trade. This makes it vulnerable to any checks and delays that would snarl up supply chains and throw an industry-wide ramp-up to meet surging global demand off course.A string of suppliers have told Reuters they are either stockpiling parts, producing extra goods to be stored by their customers, or holding out to see whether a deal can be struck. Bitrez, a speciality chemicals manufacturer based in north west England, said some customers now ask suppliers to provide material to their premises, with the customer only invoiced as the stock gets used.""Most of our larger customers have imposed or pushed for consignment stock deals so this has allowed them to increase stocks and provide a buffer,"" Paul Jones, MD of the 24 million pound-turnover company said. ""Brexit is the driver for it.""CASH FLOW Such demands put pressure on the cash-flow of small companies and Paul Adams, head of aerospace at consultancy Vendigital, said that was one of the biggest short-term risks for smaller aerospace suppliers. ""When you're talking about adding time to a process what you're really talking about is consuming cash, mainly in the form of inventory, but also possibly resources to help with that,"" he said.Even this sort of stockpiling would only realistically provide a limited extension due to restrictions on space and cost implications. And not all companies have the capability or space to step up at all.""The aerospace guys have started stockpiling stuff, we're seeing that,"" said Tony Worsley, the managing director of Elder, a manufacturer of metal and polymer components.But the family-owned, 4 million pound turnover company with 30 employees, can't stockpile all the materials it will need if a no-deal Brexit leads to days or weeks of supplies at UK ports.""I haven't got the space, the resources,"" he said. Britain's aerospace sector includes small engineers across the country producing parts for the wings of the Airbus A320 plane, the Rolls-Royce engines which power passenger aircrafts, and the F-35, one of the world's most advanced fighter jets.The industry had already been on a steep production curve as the likes of Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Rolls-Royce, Pratt and Witney and others race to meet demand for jets, particularly from China.Weaker cash positions in smaller firms can add to the risks embedded in the supply chains of larger quoted companies, which are already rising due to the output hikes.Global commercial aircraft production will reach 1,800 planes by 2022, up over 20 percent from 2017, Deloitte has said.Andrew Mair, head of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a regional industry body which represents about a quarter of the UK's sector, said the recent ramp up meant it was impossible for some small companies to produce extra inventory.""They can't keep up with current volume requirements, they cannot stockpile,"" he said.The complex nature of building air frames and aero-engines means even the smallest suppliers can cause delays. The A380 is made up of 4 million components made by 1,500 companies in 30 countries, while 18,000 components go into Rolls-Royce engines.Adams said some suppliers hold power in the short term because they're in a unique position to do what they do. ""They can and will push back,"" he said.CLOCK TICKINGAs the Brexit clock ticks down, the bigger companies are worried that their own contingency plans are only as robust as those of the thousands of smaller suppliers on which they rely.Airbus, which has 4,000 companies in its UK supply chain, said in July it was activating its Brexit contingency plans to build up ""buffers"" because it thought the British government's strategy was unravelling.""Our teams across Europe are in daily contact with suppliers about a range of subjects; we have both written to, and surveyed, our suppliers regarding Brexit and are working with those companies,"" said a spokesman for Airbus.A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said: ""We are working hard to ensure that our supply chain has all the relevant information they need to plan for Brexit and we believe our suppliers will be able to take the steps necessary to ensure continuity of supply of both goods and services."" Rolls-Royce's CEO said last week the engine-maker was still intending to stockpile parts, to give it ""the logistical capacity that we need to carry on running our business.""That fits with what small suppliers are starting to see. Mark Venables, the managing director of Alloy Wire International, a central England-based provider or specialist wire, said customers were asking for its Brexit plans.Alloy Wire has, in fact, been taking on extra warehousing and building up its own buffers. ""We have been preparing for the last few years because we have been in effect carrying extra stock,"" he said. ""We took another unit on in August last year and have invested more than $5 million in material over the past twelve months - the biggest investment we've ever made in stock.""If Britain can emerge through the Brexit deadline relatively unscathed then there could be a silver lining and company bosses, like Mark Crouchen, of Rockwood Composites, a 20 person, 1.5 million pound turnover, are hopeful. Corporate spending could spike if Britain agrees a good divorce deal, British finance minister Philip Hammond has said, following a period when companies have been ""sitting on their hands"" as they wait to see the outcome of the negotiations. South west England-based Rockwood, a maker of composite material parts used, for example in cabin doors and the decoy system in the Eurofighter, said its orders were all bespoke. It was hard to blame Brexit directly, but Crouchen said he had seen delays over the last two years.""But we've certainly seen a big surge in work for next year and beyond. It's very, very unusual.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Wilhelm will stay in his role until the annual shareholder meeting 10 days later.Airbus also appointed Bosch appliances executive Michael Schoellhorn as the new chief operating officer for its commercial aircraft business, replacing veteran troubleshooter Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB) who is due to retire at the end of this year. Schoellhorn is currently chief operating officer of Bosch subsidiary BSH Home Appliances, which makes washing machines under the Bosch and Siemens brands.Airbus highlighted his experience in digital manufacturing techniques that the planemaker is boosting in its factories.Chief Executive Tom Enders paid tribute to Williams, an industry veteran of 50 years who has been seen as one of the most dependable internal voices as the company targets an ambitious ramp-up in production to meet soaring jet demand.The plans have been derailed by engine problems as well as quality problems at a plant in Hamburg, industry sources say.Reuters reported on Tuesday that Airbus was poised to make top financial and operational appointments as incoming CEO Guillaume Faury tightens his grip after months of turmoil over corruption investigations and output delays. Wilhelm's decision in May to stand down was seen as a surprise after he ended payments to middlemen and opened the door to ongoing fraud investigations. He had shaped a more market-friendly stance and pushed a leaner corporate structure.Although Wilhelm has not been accused of wrongdoing,, sources have said his exit reflects a board-driven clearout designed to present a new face to UK and French investigators.Airbus shares stood 0.5 percent higher in early session trading.Reuters reported last month that Wilhelm would be replaced by a fellow German from outside the group.CEO Enders also steps down in April next year and the company is due to appoint a new chairman in 2020.The appointments came weeks after Infineon Technologies took a new multi-million euro provision to cover the cost of a possible settlement with the administrator of its former memory chip unit Qimonda, sending its shares lower.Infineon's chips activate car accessories and cut vehicle emissions, making the company - which was spun off from engineering conglomerate Siemens in 1999 - exposed to trade friction and shifts in the economy in the same way as Airbus, whose main competitor is U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A number of operational appointments, meanwhile, is expected to underscore Faury’s focus on stabilizing output and fixing quality problems.Airbus last month cut its core 2018 delivery target by 2 percent to 782 jets and faces a continued challenge to maintain that goal, people familiar with its production plans said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Our first international flights will connect Vietnam with South Korea and Japan, early in the second quarter.""""There has been a surge in the number of golfers coming from South Korea to play in Vietnam recently,"" he added, saying that direct flights to the United States is also a Bamboo goal.The launch comes as Vietnam clocks double-digit expansion in both domestic and inbound passenger numbers, at a time of rising incomes in one of Asia's quickest-growing economies. Meanwhile, the government aims to make tourism a growth driver through visa exemptions and promoting investment in related infrastructure.Bamboo initially scheduled its maiden flight for October but delayed as it did not have a business license, which it received earlier this month. But it is still awaiting its air operator's certificate (AOC), without which it will remain grounded.""We are processing Bamboo Airways' request for an AOC. We will issue the AOC when all the requirements are met,"" said Vo Huy Cuong, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration.Bamboo hopes to begin ticket sales at the end of November. It plans to operate initial routes with leased aircraft.FLEET BUILDINGBamboo signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus SE (PA:AIR) in March to buy up to 24 A320neo narrow-body jets, and a provisional deal in July for 20  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787-9 wide-bodies worth $5.6 billion at list prices. ""We will operate 10 planes when we start services and expand to 40 or 50 planes by the end of next year,"" Quyet said.It took domestic market leader VietJet Aviation JSC (HM:VJC) around six years after launch to build a fleet of 50 aeroplanes.One industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, was skeptical Bamboo could reach such scale in the time frame given.""It's impossible to add aircraft as fast as it says it will given regulatory restrictions preventing any airline from expanding its fleet so rapidly in the initial phase, plus slot restrictions and infrastructure constraints in Vietnam,"" said the source.Quyet said the target was designed to increase plane availability to guarantee ticket supply. ""The risk would be higher if we chose to start with only 1 to 3 planes,"" he said.Aviation consultancy CAPA said Bamboo would need to overcome ""intense competition"" from established players that serve destinations it is targeting and already have slots at major airports where demand is robust.To differentiate itself, Bamboo will use its parent's golf courses, which will number 100 by 2022, Quyet said.""We will offer packages that no other local airline can,"" he said.""Once we do this, we want to do it big and different.

Harster also called for a separate contract for work on an engine for the new jet to enable optimal flexibility and give the customers direct control over the propulsion system.Bruno Fichefeux, head of future combat air systems at Airbus, told the conference he expected conceptual work on the program to begin soon, ""bilaterally or with Spain.""A Spanish official told the conference his country was in discussions with both the Dassault-Airbus team, and a separate project being led by Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) to secure a role on one of the projects. A French military official said the two projects could also be merged at a future date.Douglas Barrie, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said government and industry ties would likely shift again, as in the 1970s and 1980s during work that ultimately led to the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault's Rafale.""We're at the start of that process again now.

As part of the order, Delta said it was deferring the delivery of 10 pricier A350 jets to 2025-26. The agreement contains the right to convert the A350 orders to A330-900s. ""Expanding our A330 order book not only ensures that Delta's near-to-medium-term widebody needs are taken care of, but also drives our strategic, measured international growth,"" said Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West.The A330neo is powered by next-generation engine technology from Rolls-Royce (L:RR) that provides better fuel performance and range for transoceanic travel, Delta said.The jet will feature the latest in design and technology and become the first Delta aircraft to include all cabins: Delta One suites, Delta Premium Select, Delta Comfort+ and Main Cabin.With the order, Atlanta-based Delta's A330 fleet will grow to 35 from 25. It is part of the company's long-term policy of investing 50 percent of operating cash flow back into the business, West said. For Airbus, it is the second order for the A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise. Sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from Boeing Co's (N:BA) newer Boeing 787.Industry sources have questioned how far recent A330neo orders represent net new sales for the European aircraft maker because they could water down some earlier orders for the A350.The new-generation A350 is a longer-term bet for Airbus and competes with the Boeing 787 and 777. But one market source said Airbus was willing to give up some orders for the newer plane in order to keep the A330neo afloat and prevent production cuts.Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects to take delivery of two A350s in 2019 and two in 2020. It will retire older Boeing 767s in coming years as the aircraft reach the end of their serviceable life cycle.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

These flights have no economy class seats. It represents a major expansion in the U.S. market for Singapore Airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the 20 percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for ultra-long non-stop services due to their popularity with time-sensitive business travelers.Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Mak Swee Wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up. For premium economy, however, he said some markets were not ""entirely familiar"" with the product, which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class. ""I think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product, initially with very attractive pricing, but eventually I think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight,"" he said at an analyst and media briefing.His comments came after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday an 81 percent plunge in second-quarter net profit, hurt by higher fuel prices, lower airfares and non-cash losses at its part-owned  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH).Yields, a proxy for ticket prices, fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, failing to help offset the impact of a 24 percent rise in fuel prices. Singapore Airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as S$1,698 ($1,230.17) return from Singapore to New York for weekday travel over part of the peak Christmas travel period, according to its website. That is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Dubai-based Emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time, according to a Reuters search on  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE).Mak declined to comment on whether Singapore Airlines could consider changing the configuration of the plane to include more business class seats.When it previously flew to New York and Los Angeles non-stop on four-engined A340-500 jets that used more fuel, it had initially offered both ""executive economy"" and business class but later switched to an all-business class configuration. Those flights were abandoned in 2013 when high fuel prices made them uneconomic.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""There is a lot of the great China dream and the role that the military play in that.""NO NEED FOR THE WEST The show has been taking place against a backdrop of a tariff spat with the United States and U.S. accusations of espionage by China's state aerospace apparatus.Chinese President Xi Jinping said weeks before the show that Russia and China should work together to oppose protectionism and what he called unilateral approaches to international problems, a veiled reference to U.S. foreign policy.The two countries unveiled a mock-up of the CR929 wide-body civil jet, widely seen as a high-level initiative, and signed a helicopter sale in one of the few deals.A senior executive at Russian state conglomerate Rostec told Reuters both countries were keen to develop their civil aircraft building capabilities to reduce their dependence on the Western companies that currently dominate the supply chain.""The Chinese-Russian aircraft is showing that they have a choice, that they don't have to buy (aircraft) from the West and that if there are any problems on trade they can develop perfectly adequately in cooperation with Russia,"" said aerospace analyst Sash Tusa of Britain-based Agency Partners.Helping efforts to showcase the strides China is making in aviation was Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which wants to become a serious competitor to Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) and regional jet players Canada and Brazil.Three of its self-developed ARJ-21 regional jets, decorated in the liveries of customers including Genghis Khan Airlines, flew demonstrations in a performance some analysts said indicated that the problematic program was turning a corner. COMAC's General Manager Zhao Yuerang told a news conference attended by Chinese government officials that the company now plans to deliver 100 ARJ-21 planes within the next five years. ""We have smoothly passed the difficult teething period that every new plane model has to face,"" he said. NO-SHOWSSome industry executives, however, said it was difficult to ignore some glaring holes in China's carefully orchestrated show of strength, noting attendance numbers appeared to have fallen. It took place in the same week as a Shanghai import expo, viewed as one of China's most important foreign policy events for the year. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported, citing military insiders, that organizers had scaled back the Zhuhai event due to trade tensions and reduced funding. There were also a number of no-shows among the range of domestic products that China was expected to put on display. In a separate report, the SCMP reported the WS-15 Emei engine for the J-20 fighter was not used as had been expected.COMAC did not bring its banner product, the narrowbody C919, which has been in flight tests for over a year. COMAC officials said its two C919 planes were busy flight testing. A senior industry executive called this a deliberate ""PR strategy"" to focus attention on the CR929 and its wider political message of joint Chinese-Russian resilience to U.S. pressure. But others said it was hard to escape the narrower explanation that the program itself was under strain.""This does not reflect terribly well for the country’s broader ambitions in this field,"" Tusa said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

UAC last year kickstarted full-scale development of a wide-body jet with China that eventually aims to compete with Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) planes. Another Rostec subsidiary is also cooperating with Beijing to build an aero engine.""Any big nation cannot afford being dependent on others...We are trying to acquire full independence in our capacities,"" Kladov told Reuters, adding he was referring to areas like technology and production capabilities for civil aircraft. ""When you're dependent on just one source of supply, then you're not fully independent; you're reliant. Any monopoly is a wrong thing. When you have a choice, it's a good thing, then nobody can push you around.""U.S. and European firms currently dominate the aerospace supply chain from engines to avionics and have been heavily involved in Russia's civil aircraft programs. The Irkut MC-21, a medium-range passenger plane that is being built by another Rostec unit, is powered by engines supplied by United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney. The company rolled out the plane for the first time in 2016. Kladov said the MC-21 was now undergoing certification and that developers hoped it could be fully operational and in service by the end of 2019. The company also hopes the MC-21 will be able to fly using Russia's self-developed Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine in one year, after the engine recently obtained certification, he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference in Chicago that deliveries would rebound in November and December despite persistent problems with engine-maker CFM International Inc, a venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).Boeing is expected to release its orders and deliveries figures for October next week. Deliveries are a closely watched metric since that is the point when airlines pay the bulk of the money for a new jetliner.""The deliveries for the balance of the year will be backloaded,"" Smith said. ""You'll see a lighter October than you would typically, and you'll see higher-than-production-rate delivery profile for November and December.""Boeing is working through its recovery plan for its best-selling 737 single-aisle jetliner caused by delays on fuselages, engines and other components which created a production bottleneck at its Seattle-area plant over the summer.Smith said the focus now is ""on GE and GE supply chain, getting them back on the recovery plan.""""We're still not fully recovered and don't expect to until the end of the year,"" he added. His comments come after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive on Wednesday to address how to handle erroneous data from a sensor on the Boeing 737 MAX jet in the wake of last week's Indonesian jetliner crash.Boeing said in a statement that it had alerted pilots to the issue. The FAA said it was mandating that airlines follow the Boeing bulletin.Boeing has delivered 568 aircraft in the first nine months of 2018, as it works to overcome the 737 factory snarls, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago, putting it on track to deliver another record year of plane sales.That keeps the manufacturer, which aims to deliver 810-815 planes in 2018, in front of its European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

President Donald Trump criticizes China for what he sees as intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. business and a gaping trade deficit, while Beijing calls the complaints unreasonable. The two sides have resorted to tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars.While U.S.-made aircraft, among America's biggest exports to China, have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs, analysts said they were still waiting to see what the trade war would spell for U.S. companies such as Boeing.George Xu, the top China executive at Boeing's biggest rival Airbus (PA:AIR), said at a news conference that the European planemaker did not expect a sales windfall from the tensions.""I am Chinese and we don't like this kind of trade war,"" he said. ""Nobody will be the winner in this kind of trade war.""Airbus had hoped to close a deal for 184 aircraft during a trip to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January, but negotiations appear to have stalled, industry sources say.In carefully worded comments, Boeing's senior vice-president of Northeast Asia sales, Rick Anderson, said China was a rapidly growing aviation market and that he believed Washington and Beijing understood that.""We continue to engage with leaders of United States and China, and continue to urge productive conversation to resolve the trade discrepancies,"" he said.""We are optimistic for a quick solution.""AMBITIONS ON DISPLAYChina and United States have in recent days stoked optimism that a breakthrough might be made, after Trump spoke by phone with President Xi Jinping last week.The two countries have also announced that they will hold a delayed top-level security dialogue on Friday.Still, Beijing has shown little sign of taming its ambitions to catch up with rivals like the United States, France and Germany in high-end technology.Projects being showcased in Zhuhai included a full-scale mock-up of a widebody CR929 jet being jointly developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) in hopes of eventually competing with Boeing's 787 and Airbus' A350 jets.The global market for widebody jets is estimated to be worth $2.5 trillion over the next two decades, according to Boeing, with the fleet size more than doubling to 9,180 jets.Widebodies account for around 20 percent of projected global jet deliveries over that period but almost 40 percent by value.Hundreds of spectators and industry executives at the airshow were also treated to a roaring flight demonstration that involved three of China's Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters, which debuted at the show two years ago with a 60-second flypast.China put the J-20 into service last year that experts say is a part of Beijing's plan to narrow a military technology gap with the United States and its F-35 stealth fighter.Sophisticated anti-aircraft batteries were also on display.""If you tie those together with the J-20, the message is about Anti-Area Access Denial.

Its parent companies are tackling restructuring at GE and delays on smaller Pratt & Whitney engines, industry sources say.Airline president Tim Clark has reportedly denied suggestions that the airline is slowing down taking delivery of existing A380s, saying delays are due to production problems.""Unfortunately, quite a few of the A380 deliveries have slipped and they are all compressed in the back end of the year in the next two months, so we are taking them now,"" he told the Airline Ratings website.Reuters reported last week that there were delays in delivering some A380s to Emirates and quoted one source as saying Emirates did not need them for now and had parked a number as part of efforts to manage capacity.Durability problems affecting Roll-Royce's Trent 1000 engine have resulted in premature repairs and led to as many as 40 or so Boeing 787s being idle at any time, industry sources say.The crisis has had a knock-on effect on other programs as Rolls diverts production capacity from the similar Trent 7000 engine, resulting in delays to the Airbus A330neo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Engineers at the Airbus plant in Bremen, Germany on Thursday carefully packed the spacecraft into a special container that will fly aboard a huge Antonov cargo plane to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a first step on its way to deep space.In Florida, the module will be joined with the Orion crew module built by  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), followed by over a year of intensive testing before the first three-week mission orbiting the Moon is launched in 2020, albeit without people.Future production of Orion and the European module could result in billions of dollars of new orders for the companies involved in coming years, said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for human exploration and operations for NASA.""This is the system that will enable humans to move sustainably into deep space ... and leave the Earth-Moon system for the first time ever,"" he said.Current plans are for a first crewed mission in 2022, but NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) then plan to launch a manned mission every year, making the Orion project both politically and economically important at a time when China and other countries are racing to gain a foothold in space. Airbus's European Service Module will provide propulsion, power, thermal control and consumables to the Orion crew module, marking the first time that NASA will use a European-built system as a critical element to power an American spacecraft.""This is a very big step. The delivery and the flight to America are just the beginning of a journey that will ultimately take us to 60,000 miles beyond the moon, further than any human has ever flown before,"" Oliver Juckenhoefel, vice president of on-orbit services and exploration for Airbus, told Reuters.Orion is part of a growing push to put humans back on the Moon, where the unexpected discovery of water has energized scientists, with rapid technological developments such as 3D printing paving the way for lunar-based infrastructure, such as data server relay stations, in coming years.""It sounds like science fiction, but I'm convinced it's coming, and the only question for us in Europe is whether we want to be part of it or not,"" Juckenhoefel said. ""In industry, we have to be careful that we don't miss the boat.""NASA's Gerstenmaier said ESA was interested in participating in a so-called ""lunar gateway"" with an eye to landing humans on the Moon again around 2028, and providing a base for travel to Mars and beyond.Airbus won a 390 million euro ($446.12 million) contract to build the first ESM module in 2014, and is working on a second order valued at 200 million euros. Now it is negotiating with ESA for further orders that could add up to a billion euros, Juckenhoefel said.Mike Hawes, who runs the $11 billion Orion program for Lockheed, underscored the importance of the program for future exploration of deep space.He said Lockheed was negotiating with NASA for up to 12 follow-on missions that could result in billions of dollars of new orders, while working to halve the cost of future spacecraft.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

China has become a key hunting ground for foreign firms to do deals as its airlines have expanded fleets to keep up with surging travel demand, putting the country in a position to overtake the United States as the world's top aviation market in the next decade. But China's economic growth has weakened to its slowest pace since the financial crisis and its relations with other countries have been tested by Beijing's ambitions to grow its own domestic champions in industries such as aviation. And while U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs, analysts said they were still waiting to see what the trade war would spell for U.S. companies such as Boeing, Honeywell (N:HON) and Gulfstream, who face fierce competition in China from the likes of Airbus and other suppliers. The United States exported $16.3 billion of civilian aircraft to China in 2017, the biggest category of goods it exported to China, according to a paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.""It is not unlikely that China might strategically steer future aircraft purchases to Airbus rather than Boeing,"" said Marc Szepan, a China aviation expert at the University of Oxford and former industry executive.""""In addition, there might be a re-evaluation of the relative attractiveness of industrial partners for China's future aircraft programs such as the CR929 which might favor European over U.S. component and structures suppliers.""SHOW OF STRENGTHSo far, Beijing has avoided showing its hand in either direction as deals by Chinese leasing firms to buy foreign aircraft are either pushed back or kept private.Recent U.S. allegations in court filings that Chinese intelligence attempted to steal information on a French-U.S. turbofan engine developed for commercial jetliners - a clear reference to the Safran-General Electric LEAP (PA:SAF) (N:GE) - could further fray relations, analysts said.Beijing has also criticized the U.S. decision not to send senior officials to a Shanghai import expo that takes place in the same week as the airshow and counts as one of China's most important foreign policy events for the year.""Right now the political winds are quite concerning,"" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will likely make a deal with China on trade, adding that a lot of progress had been made to resolve the two countries' differences but warning that he still may impose more tariffs on Chinese goods.China is expected to put on a show of strength in space and defense, with self-developed fighter training FTC-2000 aircraft, a historically high number of weapons as well as its latest unmanned aerial vehicles among the kit on display.China's air force said on Friday that a number of Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters would perform demo flights, after having debuted at the show two years ago with a 60-second flypast.Kelvin Wong, senior Asia Pacific defense technology expert at IHS Markit, said this would be part of the deliberate messaging often associated with the closely watched show.""It appears the PLA (People's Liberation Army) is definitely showcasing its growing confidence in the latest J-20 combat aircraft,"" said Wong.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

107,"Nov 02, 2018 07:20AM ET",Boeing's China plant to start operations in December,nan,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will start operations at its 737 completion plant in China next month and  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) will take delivery of the first plane produced there, the U.S. planemaker said on Friday. Boeing invested $33 million last year in a joint venture with the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) to oversee the plant, taking a majority stake. The plant, in the eastern city of Zhoushan, will install interiors and paint liveries.Boeing's comments were first reported by Chinese media outlets on Friday after a media visit to the plant, and confirmed by a company spokesman. State-backed ThePaper.cn quoted Boeing China President John Bruns as saying that the factory will deliver only one aircraft in 2018 and then gradually increase output until it hits a delivery target of 100 planes a year. Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) are expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the fast growing aviation market. Airbus has a A330 completion plant in the eastern city of Tianjin.Boeing also renewed production contracts for the 737 with AVIC Aircraft (SZ:000768) and Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co Ltd, and recognized five new Chinese companies as eligible suppliers during a ceremony at Zhoushan, ThePaper.cn said. Analysts have expressed concerns that Boeing could eventually be affected by ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China although the planemaker's products have not been hit by Chinese tariffs.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

108,"Nov 02, 2018 07:17AM ET","Boeing eyes services M&A, small or big, in tussle with Airbus",nan,"By Eric M. JohnsonSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is looking for future deals ""small or big"" now that it has absorbed parts distributor KLX Inc, an executive told Reuters, as the world's largest planemaker tries to beat out rival Airbus (PA:AIR) in the highly profitable market for aircraft parts and services.Boeing last month closed the KLX acquisition for $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt, its largest deal since merging with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.Now it expects further purchases to help it triple the revenue of its year-old Global Services division to $50 billion in a decade, the unit's chief executive Stan Deal told Reuters in an interview.""When we come up with selective, complementary investments, whether it's small or big, we will make it,"" Deal said. ""Our first thrust is organic,"" he added. ""We have plenty of things we can invest in organically to create growth.""Both Boeing and rival Airbus are muscling deeper into the higher-margin market for repairs, maintenance and analytics services in a push that has rattled the aerospace supply chain.Deal declined to specify a price range or geography for its next targets, but said any bolt-on acquisitions would expand beyond the ""technology or breadth inside of Boeing."" This could mean deals in areas such as avionics services, which is in increasing demand as airplanes become more equipped with complex electronic systems.UNIFIED FRONTParts suppliers often reap the bulk of their profit in servicing jetliners over their multi-decade lifespan rather than when they are first assembled, and Deal said Boeing has this week launched fresh campaigns for new business with airlines and equipment manufacturers as a unified Boeing-KLX front. Boeing, which forecasts services to generate a third of the global aerospace industry's $7.6 trillion in revenue for the next 10 years, is not alone in wanting to dominate the segment.Europe's Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenue from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said.Boeing's deal with Wellington, Florida-based KLX, which supplies materials like fasteners, bearings, and hydraulic fluids globally, will bring anticipated annual cost savings of $70 million by 2021.""We've already begun to see results along that line,"" Deal said. ""Over the course of a year we'll be collapsing (KLX's) IT infrastructure."" Boeing's proposed stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3), which still requires government and shareholder approvals, ""is part and parcel"" of the services growth push, too, Deal said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

109,"Nov 01, 2018 07:37AM ET",Vietjet to finalize $6.5 billion Airbus order: sources,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Anshuman DagaHONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-growing budget carrier Vietjet Aviation (HM:VJC) is set to finalize a $6.5 billion jet order with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) during a visit to Hanoi by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Friday, people familiar with the matter said.The order for 50 A321neo jets is part of an aggressive investment in the Vietnamese airline's fleet that has provided lucrative business for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).It is also a boost for Airbus as it seeks to turn a raft of provisional orders put together at July's Farnborough Airshow into hard revenues, narrowing a gap against Boeing this year.The deal is the biggest economic component of an official visit to France's former colony by Philippe from Nov. 2-4, during which he will oversee deals with French firms and hold talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc, they said.Airbus and Vietjet both declined to comment.Vietnam and France also signed an agreement in September to expand defense collaboration, although details are scant. VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao told Reuters this week that Vietjet plans to maintain an average fleet age of just three years to keep fuel and maintenance costs low.It placed provisional orders for the A321neo jets and 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets in Farnborough and has been negotiating to firm them up, with deliveries expected between 2020 and 2025. The formal signing, to take place on Friday, will help to dispel doubts over the substance of deals announced in Farnborough, which was marked by a rash of vague or incomplete order announcements.Finalizing such deals can involve tough negotiations as airlines try to squeeze out last-minute concessions.However, finance industry sources have expressed concerns about a glut of orders in Southeast Asia from airlines like Vietjet, Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and Lion Air of Indonesia and question whether all of the several hundreds of planes on order from the Asian low-cost carriers will actually be delivered.Vietjet told the Airline Economics conference in Hong Kong this week that low-cost airlines have a relatively low market position in Vietnam, and that those most successful in driving down unit costs would ride out any downturn in the market.Vietnam's expansion has also been peppered with trade sensitivities as Vietjet - which says it enjoys government support - juggled Airbus and Boeing procurements: a strategy also designed to win bigger discounts.Two years ago, Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching an order for 100 737s during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Until then, VietJet had only bought from Airbus, including an order for 92 jets in 2013.Philippe's visit is the latest example of Western leaders beating a path to Asia's low-cost carriers, whose orders have secured thousands of manufacturing jobs, trade experts said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

111,"Oct 31, 2018 04:16AM ET",U.S. charges Chinese intelligence officers for jet engine data hack,nan,"By Sarah N. Lynch and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese intelligence officers conspired with hackers and company insiders to break into private companies' computer systems and steal information on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners, according to a U.S. indictment unsealed on Tuesday.The indictment said that at the time of the hacks, a Chinese-state owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in aircraft manufactured in China and in other countries.Chinese-made jets, including the C919 and ARJ21, currently use foreign engines but the country has been trying to develop a competitive homegrown alternative.The 10 people charged conspired to steal sensitive data ""that could be used by Chinese entities to build the same or similar engine without incurring substantial research and development expenses,"" the indictment released by the U.S. Department of Justice said. It said more than a dozen companies were targeted, but only  Capstone Turbine Corp  (O:CPST) was identified by name.The Justice Department said those hacked included a French firm co-developing a turbofan jet engine with a U.S. company. France's only civil turbofan engine maker,  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), co-develops engines with U.S.-based  General Electric  Co (GE) (N:GE) through their longstanding CFM International partnership, the world's biggest jet engine manufacturer by number of units sold.The venture's latest engine, known as LEAP, powers the largest category of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) jets and includes a version for China's new passenger plane, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) C919.A Safran spokesman in China declined to comment and the company's French head office could not be contacted outside normal business hours.GE declined to comment.The indictment charges Zha Rong and Chai Meng along with other co-conspirators who worked for the Jiangsu province Ministry of State Security, a unit of the foreign intelligence arm of the Ministry of State Security.It says their efforts to steal sensitive commercial aviation and other data took place from January 2010 through May 2015.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the charges were groundless.""The relevant accusations are pure fiction and totally fabricated,"" he told reporters in Beijing, without elaborating. This is the third major corporate espionage-related case involving Chinese intelligence officers brought by the Justice Department since last month.In late September, a Chinese national who had also enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve was arrested in Chicago for working for Chinese intelligence to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked for U.S. defense contractors.In October, the Justice Department also announced it had arrested a spy for China's Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets from several U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.In that matter, the FBI said the extradition of Chinese operative Xu Yanjun from Belgium was unprecedented, and the case highlighted the Chinese government's direct control over economic espionage in the United States.John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, highlighted the pattern of the three cases in a public statement.

Some conference delegates said this may have been at the expense of at least part of its pending order for newer A350 aircraft.""Airbus may be ready to give up a few A350s to keep the A330 going,"" a leasing executive said, asking not to be named.Airbus has said the replacement cycle for earlier models of A330 aircraft, as they retire, will lift demand for the A330neo. Airbus is relying on the jet to continue a profitable but declining wide-body franchise and to keep commercial depth to an airframe that it needs to keep building for military customers."
114,"Oct 29, 2018 01:40PM ET",Airbus 2018 delivery goal questioned by analysts ahead of results,nan,"By Tim HepherHONG KONG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) will have to equal a record final quarter for deliveries if the European planemaker is going to meet its overall 2018 targets following a series of production setbacks.Flight Ascend, a UK-based consultancy which monitors fleet developments worldwide, told aircraft investors in Hong Kong that Airbus may struggle to meet its target for 800 total aircraft deliveries this year.And Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said in a note that Airbus faced a shortfall in deliveries of its best-selling A320neo due to ongoing engine delays and operational problems.The warnings came as Airbus prepares to post third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, when all eyes will be on whether it keeps its full-year target of 800 jet deliveries.By end-September, Airbus was already facing a tough - though not unprecedented - challenge in meeting its full-year goal, a Reuters analysis of delivery data shows.To meet the goal it would have to repeat exactly the record pattern of 2017, when 37 percent of the total number of annual deliveries were squeezed into the final quarter.Airbus ""usually pulls a rabbit out of the hat, so I wouldn't bet against it,"" a financial source familiar with the process said, adding delays had stressed the global aircraft industry.For the first nine months, Airbus delivered 503 aircraft, leaving it once again with 37 percent of the targeted annual figure to accomplish in just three months. The average achieved over that quarterly period in the past 10 years was 31 percent, according to a Reuters review of Airbus data.Crucial to whether Airbus meets its goal is progress on best-selling single-aisle jets like the A320 and A321.Commercial jets make up 76 percent of Airbus revenues, which are mostly paid on delivery, while aircraft lessors, who control around half the global fleet, lose $10,000 a day for a late A320-family jet, experts said.Airbus does not publish separate delivery targets for single-aisle jets but Flight Ascend estimates this year's target at around 630, leaving 76 a month to go in the last quarter.""October numbers are sitting in the mid-50s which means it ... is very challenging to reach the target for the end of year,"" Ascend's Ryan Hammacott told a Hong Kong seminar.Earlier this month, Reuters reported Airbus faced new problems in producing the A321neo, a model central to its ambition to dominate the top end of the single-aisle market and thwart Boeing's (N:BA) plans for a new mid-sized passenger jet. Last week Rolls-Royce (L:RR) disclosed a shortfall in engine deliveries for the big A330neo.Airbus planemaking president Guillame Faury last week confirmed Airbus was facing internal problems with the A321neo, but declined to discuss any impact on the delivery target.Faury, who is the designated future Airbus chief executive has made stabilizing deliveries a top priority.Harned said stock markets may absorb a downgrade in the delivery target but would watch for any signs of stress in 2019.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

115,"Oct 26, 2018 08:39PM ET",Delta Air Lines happy with pilot contract rules for regional flights: CEO,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Friday he was satisfied with pilot contract language governing the outsourcing of regional flights and does not see it becoming an issue during upcoming negotiations.Bastian said he was ""happy with existing"" language, or scope clauses, which set guidelines on the size of planes that can be operated by regional feeder carriers, among other things.Commercial planemakers are closely watching for any change in pilot scope clauses, which bar planes heavier than 86,000 pounds (39,000 kg) with more than 76 seats from regional routes, where pilots are generally paid less than their mainline counterparts. Pilots are fiercely opposed to any changes.Delta's contract with its pilots becomes amendable in 2019.Bastian was speaking at a Montreal-area factory run by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) as the No. 2 U.S. carrier takes delivery of its first A220 jet. The 110-seat narrowbody aircraft will serve as a ""cornerstone of domestic growth"" on the carrier's mainline routes, Bastian said. United Airlines (O:UAL) has already faced pushback from pilots after asking for changes to its scope clauses.American Airlines (O:AAL) pilots are not expecting any demands from the carrier to change scope clauses when negotiations kick off in January 2019, said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for their union, the Allied Pilots Association. Scope clauses have become an issue for Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) of Japan, which are building new planes that are too heavy to be flown by regional carriers because they exceed the weight requirement. Earlier this month, Embraer said it removed a 100-plane order from its backlog due to uncertainty about whether pilots would agree to fly its E175-E2 for U.S. regional carriers, because the plane exceeded scope weight limits.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

116,"Oct 26, 2018 12:49PM ET",Exclusive: Airbus to name outsider after board hastened CFO's exit - sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is close to naming an outsider to replace finance chief Harald Wilhelm after board moves to overhaul top management in response to a corruption probe hastened his surprise resignation in May, people close to the matter said.British and French authorities are investigating the use of middlemen in jetliner sales and the European planemaker says it is also supplying information to U.S. authorities.Wilhelm, 52, who is not due to leave Airbus until next year, has not been accused of wrongdoing, two people familiar with the investigation said. Indeed, he initiated the planemaker's decision in 2014 to rip up a decades-old system of middlemen supporting jet sales, opening the door to British and French investigators.     Wilhelm's departure is the most striking evidence yet of a board-driven clearout designed to help Airbus win more lenient judicial settlements by presenting a completely fresh face to anti-fraud agencies, four people familiar with the matter said.Airbus declined to comment on management changes, while Wilhelm also declined to comment. Airbus has said it reported its own concerns over the past use of intermediaries to British authorities in 2016 and that it is co-operating with all pending investigations.Although Airbus abolished a system of political balance between its host states among its top management some years ago, the board will nominate a new German finance chief from outside the group in coming weeks, reflecting a desire to still balance French and German executives, two of the people added.Wilhelm said in May he would leave Airbus in 2019, dashing plans for a staggered succession after CEO Tom Enders steps down in April. Airbus said at the time he had decided to leave ""in agreement with the board of directors"", without giving a reason.It also praised the record of Wilhelm, who has spent 18 years in finance roles at Airbus. He had been expected to stay longer and had sought confirmation from the board over his future, two people familiar with the matter said. However, only days before the announcement Wilhelm learned that the board wanted him to leave at the same time as Enders, so that Airbus could mark a clean break, they added.""The board panicked. They handled this very badly,"" a person familiar with the discussions said. Asked about such criticism, a spokesman said neither Airbus nor its board had any comment.As CFO from 2012, Wilhelm automatically became co-chairman of a panel that ultimately approved payments to agents, five sources said. The German CFO increasingly asked questions about the longstanding system of payments and after a series of audits, he halted them altogether in 2014.Although he had no role in the handling or recruitment of agents or ""business partners"", Wilhem's position on the obscure ""Company Development and Selection Committee"" left him vulnerable to broader pressure for a clearout of managers from an increasingly skittish board, the sources said. INVESTIGATION FALLOUTThe upheaval of the investigations into Airbus has barely disturbed a record run in its share price to around 100 euros, but Wilhelm's exit dismayed some investors, who made their concerns known at the top of the company.The previously unreported circumstances surrounding Wilhelm's departure highlight the unpredictable and continuing fallout from the compliance probe, which has coincided with a string of management departures since it began in 2016.The board's decision over Wilhelm mirrored growing signals that only a complete makeover would allow Airbus to win settlements surrounding the Anglo-French investigation.In a 2017 landmark ruling that is still being digested, a British judge offered engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) a settlement involving a fine rather than criminal charges for allegedly paying bribes, saying it was a ""dramatically changed organisation"" with a new board and new executive team.Under Britain's fledgling U.S.-style system of deferred prosecution agreements, the ruling demonstrated that firms may avoid prosecution and get discounted fines if they thoroughly overhaul leadership teams and show ""extraordinary cooperation"".Several sources say Wilhelm's shock departure sowed internal fears of a broader ""witch hunt"" in the hopes of winning such a deal, with staff at every level being interviewed by lawyers.Enders, who himself faces investigation over an Austrian fighter deal but denies wrongdoing, rejects any witch hunt is taking place at Airbus, which has new compliance rules, and has said its ability to compete depends on a change of culture.

117,"Oct 26, 2018 08:04AM ET",Rolls-Royce shares tumble after report of Airbus engine delays,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Rolls-Royce (L:RR) fell as much as 13 percent to their lowest since April 2017 and were on track for their biggest one-day fall in three years on Friday after a Bloomberg report said there were delays to its engine production for Airbus (PA:AIR).The report said Rolls-Royce is running into production hurdles on the engine for the new Airbus A330neo jet as the European planemaker rushes to meet delivery targets this year.In France, Airbus shares sank 5 percent, set for their worst day since June 2016.Airbus declined to comment and Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The reported setback compounds weak sales and engine reliability problems in testing for the latest model of Airbus's most used wide-body jet, which has historically been a second key source of cash for Airbus behind its best-selling A320.A source close to the company confirmed that ""there is a problem"" with Rolls-Royce's Trent 7000 engine that exclusively powers the A330neo, echoing problems on a similar model that is available on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787, causing some planes to be grounded.Market sources say the A330neo, a refresh of the A330 launched with fuel-saving engines in 2014 at a time when oil was above $100 a barrel, has struggled to make its mark because of lower oil prices and the popularity of the underlying model.Additionally, Boeing has been targeting potential customers with its newer Boeing 787, powered by alternative engines from Rolls-Royce rival  General Electric  (N:GE).Airbus and Rolls-Royce say the A330neo could benefit from a trend towards low-cost, long-haul operations, the economics of which are looking more attractive as oil prices return to $80.But there are continued doubts about a major order from AirAsia (KL:AIRA), which is now looking at smaller A321neo aircraft to replace part of its deal for 100 A330neo jets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

118,"Oct 24, 2018 05:21PM ET","Exclusive: Russia opposes U.S. OneWeb satellite service, cites security concerns",nan,"By Maria KolomychenkoMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's state security agency is opposing a high-level deal for the U.S. OneWeb satellite startup to bring Internet access to remote parts of the country because it says the project could be used to gather intelligence and damage national security. OneWeb, which plans to use a constellation of hundreds of satellites to provide a worldwide Internet network, struck a deal with Russian space agency Roscosmos in 2015 to send them into orbit and it clinched a joint venture with a subsidiary of the agency to service Russia.But now, after objections from Moscow, OneWeb is relinquishing its majority stake in the venture, according to two industry sources and a Russian state procurement document.Speaking at a conference in Moscow, Federal Security Service official Vladimir Sadovnikov said the FSB was against the project servicing Russia for security reasons since it could potentially hand a foreign Internet service provider a monopoly over rural and remote areas.""Some of Russia's regions would become totally dependent on a foreign satellite service,"" Sadovnikov said, adding that Moscow had not received any conclusive evidence that OneWeb's satellites would not be used for intelligence gathering.""The only way to address the threats of foreign satellite networks like OneWeb, especially in the Arctic region and Far North, is to restrict their usage in Russia,"" Sadovnikov said. He added that Russia favored setting up a similar network partnering with India, China and countries which he described as non-aggressive. Moscow's ties with the West are at a post-Cold War low following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and rows over sanctions, Syria, alleged election meddling and a poisoning attack on a former spy in Britain. Sadovnikov conceded that there were satellite projects similar to OneWeb in scale such as Iridium which were already in use, but they were not used widely and are therefore not seen as a threat. Roscosmos and Oleg Ivanov, Russia's deputy minister for digital development and communications, declined to comment. RUSSIAN CONTROLLate on Wednesday, OneWeb issued a statement to Reuters confirming that its joint venture with the Roscosmos subsidiary would be majority Russian owned and operated locally.The OneWeb system ""is designed to fully respect the regulatory and cultural requirements of its many partner countries"", the statement said.The company said it recognized that security was of paramount concern to every country in which OneWeb will operate. It said its system would ensure all Internet traffic remained secure. It said the OneWeb system would begin launching early next year.Almost 45 percent of the world population does not have access to the Internet, according to Internet World Stats. OneWeb aims to make it available to everyone, including on aircraft and other high-speed transport. The project is meant to be fully online by 2027.Russia is important to the success of the project as it has many remote and far-flung areas where high-speed broadband is not available. OneWeb was founded by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) manager Greg Wyler and closed an $1.7 billion investment deal with Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Bharti, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Hughes, Virgin Group, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank.It plans to create a network of 900 satellites, most of which will be sent into orbit by 21 Soyuz launch vehicles from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Guiana Space Center. The contract for the launch was signed by OneWeb, Arianspace and Roscosmos in 2015. It will cost OneWeb $1 billion to have the satellites sent into orbit, Igor Komarov, Roscosmos' former CEO, said after signing the deal. The first launch was scheduled for late 2017, but the company has pushed the date back several times. The launch is now scheduled for between December 2018 and February 2019, according to Wyler. In 2017, OneWeb strengthened its partnership with Roscosmos by creating a joint venture with satellite operator Gonets, a subsidiary of Roscosmos, to develop the project in Russia. OneWeb currently holds a 60 percent stake and Gonets has the rest. However, Gonets now intends to increase its stake to 51 percent and is looking for a contractor to estimate the cost of the deal, a document submitted by Gonets in the Russian state procurement system showed. Gonets is a state company and is therefore required to publish details of all procurement orders in line with Russia's anti-corruption legislation. Two industry sources - one at the FSB, and the other an official at the Ministry for Digital Development and Communication - confirmed to Reuters that Gonets would become a controlling stakeholder in the joint venture with OneWeb.This is a key condition for OneWeb operating in Russia, although there are other conditions as well, the source at the FSB said without detailing what those other conditions were. ""OneWeb is an important project for Roscosmos and Russia's space industry, but national security issues come first. There are many doubts regarding that project, especially because of the sanctions against us,"" said the source at the FSB. OneWeb submitted a request to receive a frequency band in Russia, but was refused by authorities, according to Russian media reports confirmed by a communications official. A source at the Ministry for Digital Development and Communications said OneWeb would be given permission after legal issues regarding the joint venture were completed.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

119,"Oct 24, 2018 03:33PM ET","No-deal Brexit risks travel chaos, nightmare at airports: IATA",nan,"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit could wreak chaos for travelers and a nightmare at airports, global airline industry body IATA warned, calling on British and European Union aviation authorities to put in place a plan to avoid such a worst-case scenario.Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019 but with just over five months to go, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to reach a withdrawal deal and both sides have stepped up preparations for the possibility there will not be one.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday that planning for a no-deal Brexit needed to move much faster to ensure planes can keep flying and safety and regulatory frameworks keep functioning whatever the new relationship between the pair after March 29. ""We predict chaos if nothing is done,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters on a call on Wednesday.""On April 1 it will be us, the airlines, who have to manage millions of passengers potentially grounded in airports unable to take a flight ... It will be a nightmare in European airports and UK airports,"" he warned.Separately, IATA released forecasts on Wednesday showing that airline passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037, bolstered by strong demand in Asia, though protectionism risks curtailing growth.De Juniac said the trend toward restricting free trade, such as the introduction of recent tariffs, was weighing on the aviation industry’s most recent forecast of 3.5 percent compound annual passenger growth rate over 20 years, down 0.1 percent from an earlier report. That small decline means 60 million fewer passengers over 20 years.On Brexit, de Juniac said that airlines were ""completely in the dark"" as to how to plan for what sort of flying rights, safety framework and border management would exist if there is no deal due to a lack of transparency around the discussions. He said they needed certainty on these three critical issues.Flying rights to, from and within the EU, as well as between the United States and Britain, are covered by EU-wide ""Open Skies"" agreements. But unlike with trade, where Britain would revert to World Trade Organization rules under a no-deal, there is no default fallback option for the aviation sector.""A backstop contingency plan to keep planes flying after March must be published, and quickly,"" de Juniac said. The exclusion of the airline industry from EU-British discussions was exacerbating the potential for chaos, he warned, adding that IATA was ready to offer solutions if asked.The chief executive of Ryanair (I:RYA), one of Europe's biggest airlines, has warned that if there is a no-deal Brexit, UK flights could be grounded for up to three weeks. IATA said it did not expect a scenario where all flights were grounded. ""As a short term, emergency fall-back position, we understand that the EU and UK CAA have plans for a ‘bare bones’ agreement ... to ensure at least a basic level of connectivity,"" IATA said in a study also published on Wednesday.But it warned that minimum connectivity could be as little as 5 percent of the current number of weekly flights between Britain and Spain. In Montreal, Airbus SE (PA:AIR) planemaking head Guillaume Faury told reporters on Wednesday the European company is working on priorities if there is no deal.""For the moment our focus is completely on managing the transition period and making sure there is no disruption,"" he said,"" he said. ""This uncertainty is by the way, one of the most difficult stakes (involving Brexit).""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The 92-page lawsuit alleges that Bombardier employees who were recruited by Mitsubishi or AeroTEC brought with them confidential documents and data related to the certification of airplanes in Canada and the United States. Bombardier is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Mitsubishi Aircraft and AeroTEC from using the information it says was taken. The lawsuit says the employees sent key documents to their personal email accounts prior to leaving Bombardier and joining the Mitsubishi project.A spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Aircraft said on Monday the company believed Bombardier's claim was ""groundless"". ""We will consider the details and prove this in the appropriate venue,"" she added.AeroTEC could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.Mitsubishi's regional jet program, Japan's first passenger plane since the 1960s, has been delayed by several years, with first customer ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) now expecting the 90-seater plane in 2020, rather than in 2013 as originally envisaged.In the lawsuit, Bombardier accused Mitsubishi Aircraft of violating the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 by trying to use the confidential data and documents obtained from former employees to accelerate the ""extremely complex and costly"" process of getting its planes certified. According to the lawsuit, Mitsubishi has in the past cited the difficulty of achieving certification as one of the factors holding up the launch of its planned regional aircraft. It is set to compete with Bombardier's C Series jet, which was renamed as the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A220 in July.Bombardier said it took it nearly a decade to take its C-Series from concept to commercial flight. It said only four companies since 2000 had been able to develop a ""clean-sheet"" aircraft program approved by regulators in Canada, Europe and the United States.""This is because, understandably, these various regulatory agencies require aircraft manufacturers to meet innumerable exacting standards to ensure aircraft airworthiness and public safety,"" Bombardier said in the lawsuit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A decision is expected before Christmas, he said, with the widebody jets to replace aging 747s, 777-200s and 777-300s. It would also give the airline the capacity to relaunch U.S. flights assuming Thailand's safety rating is upgraded by the Federal Aviation Administration.""We also have to do proper market studies whether it is the east coast, the west coast or whatever,"" Chantalitanon said of U.S. flights. ""At the moment we have not decided where our metal is going to land and we also need the delivery of our future fleet.""The flights would compete against non-stop U.S. flights from Southeast Asian rivals Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and Philippine Airlines Inc (PHL.UL). Chantalitanon said there was enough premium traffic from Thailand and neighboring countries to make the flights viable.Thai Airways, which has been struggling financially, is pinning hopes of a revival on the new leadership team, jet purchases and improving its brand as tourism booms in the region.Chantalitanon said there had been a ""bit of a drop"" in passenger demand on Chinese routes after a boat accident in July that killed dozens of tourists. European and Japanese demand was stronger, he said, with the airline adding more flights to those regions.($1 = 32.6100 baht)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Frankly in anticipation of this geopolitical situation I think people are just going out and moving (cargo) quickly.""Asia-Pacific air cargo volume rose 4.8 percent in January-August, showed data from the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). That was lower than last year's 9.8 percent but came off a higher comparison base at a time of record shipments, said AAPA Director-General Andrew Herdman.""Given this short-term effect of scrambling to meet deadlines for tariff imposition and so on we are seeing pockets – lanes and channels – where demand is stronger than expected. For the next several months the cargo picture remains relatively robust. The question is what will the outlook for next year be.""INTERNET SHIPPINGAsian airlines have an outsized role in air freight, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the global market as the region is a major manufacturing hub and e-commerce is growing.""E-commerce is changing the way people are buying stuff, especially in countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines,"" said Jean-Francois Laval, Airbus SE (PA:AIR) executive vice president, Asia sales. ""It is coming from China, from Korea, it is coming from other parts of the region. You need a huge amount of cargo space.""Boeing on Monday forecast air cargo traffic would double over the next 20 years, growing at an average rate of 4.2 percent a year.To meet that demand, the aircraft manufacturer expects the world freighter fleet to expand over 70 percent to 3,260 planes. Around half of air cargo is carried in the bellies of passenger jets, with the remainder flown on dedicated freighters.WAR PREPARATIONSome large Asian cargo carriers including Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) rely on freight for around a quarter of revenue.""Last year the cargo market was extremely hot. In 2018 it still grew. The trade tensions in the world will have some effects but we haven't seen it yet. I see constraints coming in a very short time. However we are preparing for it,"" Korean Air President Walter Cho told reporters on Friday.""Anything from the U.S. to China and vice versa is going to be affected. We are looking at alternate markets to China and the U.S. as well."" Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) President Yuji Akasaka said the trade war had made no change to the cargo market to date and he only expected an impact if ""extremes"" occurred.""If it does happen it may affect us in the future but as of right now we haven't seen it and hope it will cool down and go back to normal,"" he said through a translator.In the short term, trade war impact has not been too visible because initial tariffs were on items not typically transported by air such as metals, AAPA's Herdman said. That is starting to change, however, as duties apply to more goods.""I heard one example... Seafood from the U.S. to China is subject to retaliatory tariffs, so demand in China is down. Guess what?

131,"Oct 11, 2018 12:01PM ET",Delta profit tops estimates as cost controls help offset fuel surge,nan,"By Tracy Rucinski and Ankit Ajmera(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said on Thursday it sees a return to margin growth next year as it posted a estimate-beating rise in quarterly profit on strong demand and tight cost controls, sending shares higher.With oil prices hovering near four-year highs, Delta and peers such as  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) are facing a surge in fuel costs that is weighing on profits, even as demand for air travel is strong.To combat that headwind, airlines have increased ticket prices, used more fuel-efficient planes and hiked baggage fees.""Our commercial momentum and improved cost trajectory give us confidence that we are on a path to deliver continued top-line growth and expand margins as we move into 2019,"" Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said.Net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the third quarter, from $1.16 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. The company took a $30 million charge from Hurricane Florence last month in the quarter, but said the impact from Hurricane Michael has been minimal.On an adjusted basis, Atlanta-based Delta earned $1.80 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.74, according to Refinitiv data.Adjusted operating revenue rose 8 percent to an all-time third-quarter record $11.8 billion, driven by a rise in domestic and transatlantic revenues.Corporate travel remained strong in the United States and demand should not be hurt by rising U.S. interest rates, the carrier said. Shares climbed 3.4 percent to $51.42, underpinning gains on the Dow Jones US Airlines index (DJUSAR) and S&P Composite 1500 Airlines index .J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors that Delta's outlook left the door open for fourth-quarter margin expansion and higher margins in 2019, which it sees as ""critical"" for the stock performance.Delta said it would keep any growth in nonfuel unit costs below 2 percent next year.The company expects overall capacity to rise about 3 percent in 2019, and said it is replacing older narrowbody aircraft with larger, more efficient Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A321s and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737-900s through 2020. This will provide a nearly 15 percent improvement in seat cost, executives said.Delta said it expects earnings of $1.10 to $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter, in line with estimates, and total annual revenue growth of about 8 percent versus 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Washington Post reported he was lured to Belgium by U.S. agents.The FBI called it an unprecedented extradition and said the indictment showed the direct oversight of China's government in economic espionage against the United States.The charges come as Washington increases pressure on Beijing over its trade policies and alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.Cybersecurity experts said the arrest was another sign of the escalating trade tensions between the two countries, adding they had seen increasing espionage by Beijing for business advantage.""China is actively engaging in targeted and persistent intrusion attempts against multiple sectors of the economy, including biotech, defense, mining, pharmaceutical, professional services, transportation and more,"" said CrowdStrike Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch.A U.S. Department of Justice statement said Xu, a deputy division director for the State Security Department of China's Jiangsu province, targeted several U.S. aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, a subsidiary of  General Electric  Co (N:GE).It described another unnamed firm as ""one of the world's largest aerospace firms, and a leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems,"" and a third as a leader in unmanned aerial vehicle technology.GE Aviation has supplied engines for large  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) aircraft, and is working on a new generation of engines for commercial planes and heavy-lift military helicopters.The indictment against Xu said he targeted aviation firms since around December 2013. It also said he made contact with experts working for the firms and recruited them to travel to China, often for the initial purpose of delivering a university presentation and paying their costs and a stipend.""This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States,"" the statement quoted Bill Priestap, the FBI's assistant director for counterintelligence, as saying.John Demers, the assistant U.S. attorney general for national security, said the case was not an isolated incident.""It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense,"" he said. ""We cannot tolerate a nation stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.""The Chinese Embassy and Xu's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The maximum penalty for conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage is 15 years, while that for conspiracy and attempt to steal trade secrets is 10 years.The Ministry of State Security is China's intelligence and security agency and is responsible for counterintelligence, foreign intelligence and political security.Cybersecurity experts said former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping had reached an understanding in 2015 on cyber espionage, but the agreement appeared be withering away.Chris Painter, the former U.S. State Department official who negotiated the agreement, said in a Twitter post it was ""not surprising that now the relationship has deteriorated, so has the agreement.""Late last month, the Department of Justice reported the arrest of a Chinese citizen in Chicago on charges he covertly worked for a high-ranking Chinese intelligence official to help try to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked as U.S. defense contractors.NBC News on Tuesday quoted U.S. officials as saying a professor at a top cancer research center in Houston facing child pornography charges was also under scrutiny for alleged economic espionage for China.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

133,"Oct 10, 2018 07:20PM ET",Lift off: Singapore Airlines to boost U.S. presence with world's longest flight,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) is poised for a major boost to its U.S. footprint from Thursday evening as it resumes, after five years, the world's longest commercial flight - a near-19 hour non-stop from Singapore to New York.The route, combined with the airline's plans to restart non-stop services to Los Angeles and add more non-stop flights to San Francisco next month, will give the premium Asian carrier its biggest-ever U.S. presence.The airline has already ordered seven new ultra-long range twin-engine Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-900ULRs fitted with just 161 business class and premium economy seats - and no economy class seats - for the U.S. capacity increase. Singapore Airlines had abandoned the marathon Newark and Los Angeles routes in 2013 when high fuel prices made the use of four-engine Airbus A340-500 jets uneconomic. It has since flown to New York's JFK Airport via Frankfurt and to Los Angeles via Tokyo and Seoul.The airline's revenue contribution from the Americas region is currently at 14 percent, down from 20 percent in 2013 due to the loss of the non-stop flights, Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective, said.""Operating trans-Pacific connecting flights opened Singapore Airlines to a lot more competition from other carriers and resulted in the loss of high-yielding business traffic,"" she said. ""We expect Singapore Airlines to regain market share, especially in the premium travel market."" She said capacity would need to be managed carefully given high fuel prices, but there should be sufficient demand as long as the United States and global economies remained robust.Non-stop ultra-long haul flights can typically command an airfare premium of around 20 percent versus those involving one or more stops, according to travel industry data, given their popularity with time-sensitive business travellers.However, Singapore Airlines has been offering low initial fares on its U.S. non-stop routes, including as little as S$1,438 ($1,040) return for premium economy on Singapore-Newark, CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said.""While it's early days, there will be questions whether the latest attempt at U.S. nonstops will be profitable for Singapore Airlines given the very intense competition in the Singapore-U.S. market, rising fuel prices and the large number of premium seats Singapore Airlines has to fill on the seven newly delivered A350-900ULRs,"" he said.Brent crude prices (LCOc1) are currently trading near $85 per barrel, significantly below a 2013 peak of about $119 but still up about 27 percent so far this year. The benchmark is on track for its third straight year of gains. [O/R]United Airlines offers non-stop flights from Singapore to San Francisco, while other carriers like Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp (TW:2618) compete with one-stop Singapore-U.S. offerings.The Singapore-Newark route will top Qatar Airways' Doha-Auckland route as the world's longest, but Australia's Qantas Airways is considering the introduction of an even longer 20-hour Sydney-London flight from 2022.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said last month only that September deliveries of the 737 narrowbody jetliners would be as good as August.Boeing's quarterly numbers indicate ongoing progress with suppliers and set the world's biggest aircraft producer up for a strong finish to the year, said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu.""We expect a full recovery in the fourth quarter,"" Kahyaoglu said.The numbers brought overall aircraft deliveries for the first nine months of 2018 to 568, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago.Boeing, which aims to deliver between 810-815 planes in 2018, is in front of its main rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year, up from 454 aircraft deliveries in the same period last year. Boeing delivered 57 planes in September last year.Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR) has been grappling with delays to deliveries and quality problems, leaving it a steep trajectory in deliveries for the fourth quarter in order to meet end-year targets.Deliveries so far this year included eight of the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now known as the A220. The Toulouse, France-based company expects to deliver about 800 planes in 2018, excluding the Canadian-designed A220.Boeing is also ahead in the order race with Airbus, booking 631 net aircraft orders after cancellations in the first nine months of the year, well ahead of the 256 orders recorded by Airbus.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

135,"Oct 08, 2018 01:14PM ET",Airbus picks planes boss Faury as next CEO to end uncertainty,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Planemaking boss Guillaume Faury was named as the next chief executive of Airbus (PA:AIR) on Monday, ending months of uncertainty over the leadership of Europe's largest aerospace group and underlining the dominance of its commercial jet arm.The 50-year-old Frenchman will replace German-born Tom Enders when he retires at the next shareholder meeting in April 2019, the Franco-German-Spanish company said in a statement.Chairman Denis Ranque, a Frenchman, will step down when his own term expires in 2020, it added.The announcement came after the board brought forward discussions on the handover amid a growing leadership vacuum in the wake of a series of management departures, internal and external graft probes and the pre-announced exit of Enders.It did so as the board grappled with the need to avoid appearing indecisive following months of uncertainty over the top job and a string of mid-level and senior departures. On Sept. 28, Reuters exclusively reported Airbus was moving swiftly towards appointing Faury as its next CEO and could announce a decision within weeks.Faury was appointed head of the core planemaking business last December after Fabrice Bregier agreed to quit following a power battle with Enders, in a shake-up that also saw the German CEO draw back from plans to seek a third term in 2019.Pressure to end uncertainty over the CEO job grew with the resignation of sales chief Eric Schulz in August, with the former Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) executive's abrupt departure strengthening calls for an internal successor to Enders..FAURY SEEN COMBINING ROLESA person close to Enders denied there had been any leadership vacuum since he announced his intention not to seek a third term and said he had remained involved in the business.As CEO of the only serious rival to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA), Faury will continue to tackle industrial problems affecting some jet deliveries while overseeing smaller but increasingly autonomous helicopter and defense units.People familiar with the matter said he would not be replaced in his current role, though this did not exclude shoring up the operational management as two top industrial executives prepare to retire at the end of this year.The Airbus planemaking business merged with the parent group last year, but until now had maintained separate figureheads.Faury will also need to restore morale shattered by a probe into the use of middlemen, now in its third year and which has left management sidelined as board directors pilot the inquiry.Airbus said its board would begin selecting a new chairman ""in due course"", with a view to ""maintaining international diversity"" at board and management level.Sources said last month that Faury's hiring could herald changes in the board as Ranque would step down in 2020. Airbus usually divides chairman and CEO jobs between French and German nationals, though the ability of Paris and Berlin governments to dish out top jobs for purely political reasons was halted in 2013. Although their power is curtailed and Airbus claims full independence, the two governments each maintain a voice as 11-percent shareholders and major defense buyers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Gulf airline was the launch customer for both A350 models and said in February it could switch some of its existing order of A350-900s to the bigger A350-1000.""Since taking delivery of the world’s first A350-1000 in February 2018, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft's performance, which has prompted us to update our original order,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement. State-owned Qatar Airways has upgraded the order amid a political dispute in the Arab region that has forced the airline to increase operational costs by flying longer routes.Qatar Airways has been banned from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain since June 2017 as a result of those countries cutting ties with Qatar.The upgraded order will come as a relief to Airbus, which is betting on the A350-1000 to contain any market pressure from rival Boeing (N:BA) which is developing its new model 777 twin-engined jet.The A350-1000 is designed to seat 366 people and competes head-to-head with Boeing’s profitable 777. Airbus says the lightweight A350-1000 is 25 percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the 777, the 777-300ER.Qatar Airways is the top A350 customer with 76 on order, which now includes 42 A350-1000s with a list price of $367 million.

138,"Sep 28, 2018 08:08AM ET",Exclusive: Insider favored as Airbus speeds up CEO search - sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is moving swiftly toward appointing planemaking head Guillaume Faury as its next chief executive after accelerating the search for a successor to outgoing Tom Enders to address a growing leadership vacuum, people familiar with the matter said.The board could announce a decision within weeks, ahead of its end-year target, as the European planemaker juggles a trio of pressures from management changes, industrial delays and a paralyzing corruption probe, they said. Airbus (PA:AIR) declined comment.Faury, 50, was appointed head of the core planemaking business last December after Fabrice Bregier agreed to quit following a power battle with Enders, in a shake-up that also saw Enders draw back from plans to seek a third term in 2019.The main external candidate,  Thales  (PA:TCFP) Chief Executive Patrice Caine, is reluctant to leave the French defense company but could do so if asked to by the French government, reports say.The timing of the transition was not immediately clear, but two sources familiar with Airbus said it had not been excluded that Faury would become CEO as early as this year, advancing plans for a May 2019 handover.The board could make a final decision by a Nov 13 meeting.Enders plans to step down when his mandate expires in May after launching the company's digital transformation. His former rival Bregier was named on Friday as head of the French unit of Palantir, the U.S. data analytics firm powering that strategy.INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMSFaury, who accompanied the board this week to China, has been seen as the top internal candidate to replace Enders since Bregier's exit. Pressure to end uncertainty grew with the resignation of the Airbus sales chief this month.Faury has had less than a year to establish himself at the main business after previously running helicopters.""He has won his spurs at Airbus (Commercial Aircraft). He is an industrialist who knows the issues and technology,"" a source familiar with the discussions said.The soft-spoken, frugal French engineer will nonetheless have to tackle industrial problems that could weigh on cash generation and the pace of further production increases.Besides delays on the A320neo plane, Airbus now faces a rash of quality problems as a new assembly line beds down in Germany, prompting Faury to tell staff this month that it risked losing customer confidence, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Quality problems can add costs and further delays.Shares in Airbus, whose main rival is Boeing (N:BA), were down 0.7 percent at 108.12 euros on Friday, although they remain near record highs as production targets so far remain intact.Faury will also need to restore morale shattered by a probe into the use of middlemen, now in its third year and which has left management sidelined as the board pilots the inquiry.If confirmed, his hiring could eventually herald changes in the board, where French chairman Denis Ranque retires in 2020. Airbus usually divides chairman and CEO jobs between French and German nationals, though the ability of Paris and Berlin governments to influence that balance openly was halted in 2013.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Besides building jets, Airbus is a major European defense contractor, responsible for the production of France's nuclear missiles and German fighters.""They are not going to talk about everything. It will be a general discussion,"" an industry source told Reuters.The head of the Airbus planemaking division, Guillaume Faury, seen as a possible successor to Chief Executive Tom Enders whose mandate expires next year, is also in China for the off-site meeting, a person familiar with the matter said.A spokesman for Airbus said it would not comment on the movements of its senior management or on details of the meeting, said to be taking place in a secured private location.Booming Chinese air travel is a major driver of record Western production of passenger jets, while China is preparing to showcase its own aerospace industry at an air show next month.Airbus earlier this year announced plans to increase the number of its best-selling A320-family medium-haul jets assembled at Tianjin from 4 a month to 6 a month by 2020, representing about a tenth of total A320 output.A year ago it added a completion plant for A330 aircraft in Tianjin, hoping for a boost for its slow-selling A330neo model which gained European safety certification on Wednesday.However plans for a landmark sale of up to 180 jets during a visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January fell through shortly after a perceived gaffe by two European envoys over China's sensitive historical relationship with Japan.In June, industry sources said the two sides were once again in jet sale talks bolstered by the production increase and at the Farnborough Airshow a month later, Chinese interests were said to be behind a number of anonymous deals.Among pending deals, Airbus is urgently trying to close what industry sources described as a provisional $9 billion deal with Chinese lessor ICBC for 80 jets, partially announced in Farnborough without the buyer's name being disclosed.""We are always in talks with our customers, but we only communicate when deals are ready,"" the Airbus spokesman said.Bloomberg News reported earlier that the two sides were close to an $18 billion deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the company's internal discussions are private.Regulator Transport Canada, which will make the final decision on the timing of the certification, said by email it could not provide ""further details"" on Bombardier’s Global 7500 because the information was confidential.Bombardier spokesman Mark Masluch declined on Monday to comment on expected milestone dates for the Global 7500, but reiterated that the luxury jet was ""on track to enter service this year.""The Global 7500 comes to market as corporate plane makers expect to generate higher revenues during a time of recovering appetite for business jets.Bombardier, now halfway through a turnaround plan after facing a cash crunch in 2015, is counting on deliveries of the long-range business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. Originally called the Global 7000, the business jet was renamed the Global 7500 in May.Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), received Federal Aviation Administration certification for its G500 this year and soon expects certification for a second plane, the G600.Global 7500 would have a range of 7,700 nautical miles, 300 longer than initially expected, and be able to connect far-flung destinations like New York and Hong Kong.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"Sep 13, 2018 03:20PM ET",Company veteran named Airbus sales chief after ex-Rolls executive quits,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) named its second new sales chief in less than a year on Thursday after chief commercial officer Eric Schulz abruptly resigned nine months after being poached from Rolls-Royce (L:RR) to lead the battle for jet sales against Boeing (NYSE:BA).The European planemaker said Christian Scherer, head of turboprop maker ATR and an Airbus veteran who had been beaten to the job by Schulz in November last year, would take over the position immediately, reporting to Chief Executive Tom Enders.Reuters earlier exclusively reported that Schulz was expected to resign. Airbus said his decision had been taken for personal reasons.The surprise exit comes as Airbus faces delays and industry-wide reliability problems with engines that soured relations with several customers and left the Frenchman increasingly frustrated, people familiar with the matter said.The company now has a battle on its hands to recapture lost ground after its share of orders against Boeing this year slumped to barely a quarter in the wake of a looser than usual set of commitments at the Farnborough Airshow.Sources said Scherer's aggressive commercial streak could challenge Boeing's lead in the airplane market, where the two sides are embroiled in a bruising battle for wide-body sales. But several note he is not a preacher of 'market share' for its own sake, especially where jet market stability is at risk.TENSIONS Schulz was picked for the high-profile Airbus post last year after the company bungled efforts to name an internal successor to John Leahy, the U.S.-born sales kingpin who retired in February.His appointment reflected a desire by the board to bring in outside blood as Airbus endured turmoil over the impact of ongoing UK and French corruption investigations, which severely demoralized the Airbus marketing machine.But Schulz's previous position as head of Rolls-Royce civil engines did not always guarantee him a sympathetic hearing from airlines currently suffering problems with Rolls engines on Boeing and Airbus jets, according to multiple aircraft market sources.He was also widely said to have struggled to get a grip on the complex and sometimes faction-ridden Airbus universe.Nonetheless, his decision came as a complete surprise to top management who were informed this week, insiders said.Schulz could not be reached for comment.Sources had also reported a tense relationship between Schulz and Guillaume Faury, head of the planemaking division, who is the leading internal contender to replace Enders in coming months. ""I think (Schulz) understood which way the wind was blowing,"" a person familiar with the company said.Another person close to the company denied such tensions had triggered Schulz's decision to leave.A320NEO ARCHITECTBefore joining turboprop affiliate ATR in 2016, Scherer forged the successful A320neo jet program and Airbus's jet manufacturing entry to the U.S. with a plant in Alabama. The A320neo - an upgrade of Airbus's most-sold jet with fuel-saving engines - generated thousands of orders and powered Airbus shares to record highs, but has been hit by delays in deliveries of engines mainly from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).In his two years at the helm of ATR, Scherer scored key sales to India and the U.S. but was forced to curb deliveries to Iran after Washington exited an international deal to ease sanctions.His transfer back to parent Airbus is the second unexpected exit of a French chief at ATR in as many years and could renew pressure for an Italian to occupy the rotating presidency of the firm, co-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

President Xi Jinping is overseeing a sweeping modernization of the armed forces in a bid to project power far from China's shores and the 2016 airshow saw the first public unveiling of the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter.""The air force will further showcase its brand-new image at home and broad of 'real battle, transitioning and strategic air force'"" Shen Jinke told a news conference ahead of the biannual event, set for Nov. 6 to 11 in the southern city of Zhuhai.

146,"Sep 11, 2018 01:30PM ET",German ministry seeks data on quicker fighter jet deliveries,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBERLIN (Reuters) - The German military has asked potential bidders in a high-stakes competition to replace its aging Tornado fighter jets about accelerating deliveries of new warplanes before an initial target date of 2025, sources familiar with the matter said.The defense ministry posed the question in early August in a follow-up to its initial request for information from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and Boeing (N:BA), both from the United States, the sources said.The ministry had no comment on the latest twist in a tender that could be worth billions of euros. One of the sources said the request signaled concerns about the growing cost of servicing the current fleet of 85 operational Tornado jets.Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen says she favors a European solution - the Eurofighter Typhoon built by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo SpA (MI:LDOF) - but Lockheed and Boeing still hope for a chance to bid for the work.Airbus and the U.S. government submitted data this spring about the four fighter jet models under consideration - the Eurofighter, Lockheed's F-35, and the Boeing F/A-18E/F or F-15E.Germany is studying a number of options, including buying one type of jet to replace the Tornado jets, a split buy of two aircraft types, and a service life extension of the Tornado jets, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.Germany has also asked Washington for information about the possibility of leasing Boeing F-15 fighter jets, two sources said, although that is seen as an unlikely outcome.Von der Leyen in July said she expected a preliminary decision on the next steps by the end of the year.POSSIBLE SPLIT BUY?One proposal calls for Germany to buy 40-45 Lockheed F-35 jets to replace those Tornados that can carry nuclear bombs, and about 75 new Eurofighters to replace both the other Tornados and a first batch of Eurofighters delivered between 2003 and 2008.Buying F-35s would allow Germany to keep a mixed fleet of fighter jets, a key requirement in its military strategy, while averting costly and time-consuming modifications to the process of certifying the Eurofighter to carry nuclear bombs.Although not a nuclear power, Germany hosts some U.S. nuclear warheads under NATO's nuclear-sharing policy and operates a number of Tornado warplanes that can deliver them. The U.S. has told Germany it could take 12 to 18 months to study the Eurofighter certification issue.German industry executives are pressing for quick answers, given that the already high cost of keeping the Tornado jets flying could rise once Britain and Italy phase out their fleets.""The cost of spare parts and operations keeps going up,"" one industry executive said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

147,"Sep 11, 2018 12:39PM ET","Boeing 737 deliveries rebound in August to 48, from July low",nan,"By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it delivered 48 of its best-selling 737 single-aisle aircraft in August, bouncing back from the 29 it delivered in July, the fewest in years.Deliveries at the world's biggest planemaker have been delayed as unfinished aircraft pile up at its Renton, Washington plant as a result of production bottlenecks at its suppliers that have disrupted manufacturing.Boeing's 737 and Airbus' (PA:AIR) A320 family of single-aisle jetliners are the cash cows of the two aircraft makers, the world's largest.""Our team made good progress in August and we're focused on fully recovering the delivery schedule by the end of the year,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said.While monthly delivery figures can fluctuate, the numbers give a snapshot of how far behind Boeing is delivering planes against its production target of 52 narrowbodies per month. Deliveries are crucial to planemakers because that is when airlines pay most of what they owe for the aircraft. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said 737 deliveries were above his estimate of 30 to 35 units, and made him feel more confident about Boeing's ability to hit its 2018 targets.The snarl in Renton, fueled by shortages of engines and fuselages as Boeing sped production to record levels in June, is likely to hurt third-quarter results and threatens to hinder its efforts to boost build rates again in 2019, some analysts said after meetings in the Seattle area last week.Boeing largely attributes the logjam to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).As it works to clear the backlog, Boeing has deployed about 600 employees from other facilities to the Renton site, and sent engineering teams to suppliers, the company said. Boeing has also started hiring back retired workers on a temporary basis, Reuters reported on Monday.The retirees will get $500 monthly bonuses in addition to wages while also continuing to receive their pension payments, a union official said. Boeing executives said last week 2018 cash flow projections, a measure closely watched by investors, would remain unchanged, as would its goal to speed up production again in 2019, analysts said.Monthly 737 deliveries totaled 48, down from 50 a year ago, Boeing said. Total plane deliveries were 64 in August, compared with 66 units a year earlier and 39 units in July.Boeing said its total 2018 net orders were 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 planes toward the end of July.The company said its total 2018 net orders were 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 planes toward the end of July.Boeing's shares were up 1 percent at $345.49 in mid-day trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

149,"Sep 11, 2018 11:11AM ET","Bemoaning UK handling of Brexit, a pro-Leave planemaker looks to EU, U.S.",nan,"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - One of Brexit's most fervent supporters, the planemaker Britten-Norman, is now complaining about Britain's handling of its planned exit from the European Union and is considering moving some functions into the EU or to the United States.The CEO of the privately owned firm, which builds the 10-seater Islander aircraft, a stalwart of Caribbean island hopping, said whatever happens the company will remain largely British-based. But lack of clarity over the future relationship with the EU has forced it into an uncomfortable position. ""What we have is assurances from the UK government that nothing is going to change after March next year ... but in terms of trying to bank on that, I can't bank on that,"" William Hynett, who has run the London-headquartered company for 15 years, said in an interview. ""There would be those there who are probably unkind enough to say, well, you wanted this outcome, so tough luck,"" he said.The company did ask for it: a Britten-Norman plane flew around Britain towing a ""Vote Leave"" banner in the weeks before the June 2016 referendum.One of its flights took it over a memorial service for Jo Cox, an anti-Brexit member of parliament murdered by a Brexit supporter. The company said it hadn't known about the service and apologized for flying over it.But Hynett does not apologize for the stance it took. ""Our position on Brexit hasn't changed,"" he said.He blames lack of planning and clarity from the government for forcing Britten-Norman to be ready to shift some of its functions away from the UK.Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. What sort of relationship the two will have after that has yet to be determined.Most other aerospace companies have warned the uncertainty around Brexit threatens their businesses. Aerospace giant Airbus (PA:AIR), the European planemaker which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, has warned about the risk to jobs and investment.Rolls-Royce (L:RR) has laid out contingency plans to move a design-approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany, and to stockpile parts.But for smaller operator Britten-Norman -- Britain's only independent commercial planemaker, with 150 employees and 15 million pounds of annual turnover -- Hynett believes complying with costly EU regulations outweighs any benefits from being in a trading bloc where few of its customers are located. Britten-Norman, whose owners include Oman's Zawawi family as well as Hynett, has been making its Islander aircraft, a specialist at taking off and landing on unprepared surfaces, since 1965. Over 1,300 have been produced; current output is one Islander or Defender plane, its other model, per quarter, with some parts made by a sub-contractor in Romania.Under consideration as part of the company's Brexit contingency plans is the possibility of shifting the ""type certificate"", a required airworthiness credential, from being certified by the European safety regulator EASA to the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Agency.Another is establishing the type certificate in a European country, should Britain be excluded from EASA after Brexit, and not have its own certifying procedure set up. ""Whether we use European conduits or partial migration to America or anything else as part of our future strategy in order to mitigate some of these risks, absolutely, we'll do what we have to,"" he said. He declined to name the European country he had in mind.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have been jostling to increase market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country.The company has so far been mostly spared in an ongoing trade war between the United States and China. Large airplanes have been left out of China's retaliatory tariff lists although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States. Boeing also predicted that China will account for 18 percent of the world's commercial airplane fleet by 2037, up from 15 percent currently, and forecast that the country will need over $1.5 trillion in commercial services to support its fleet.Three quarters of the 7,690 plane orders over the next 20 years will likely be for single-aisle aircraft while China's widebody fleet will require 1,620 new planes, tripling the country's current widebody fleet size, it added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

About 50 semi-finished 737s were scattered around the Renton plant last week, analysts said, several times the number of semi-finished aircraft Reuters reported in July.Boeing largely attributes the snarl to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture between France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).""We are working closely with our suppliers Spirit and CFM as they track toward recovery, as well as our customers,"" Bergman said. ""Our team has been mitigating supplier delays, and our factory continues to build 52 airplanes per month.""CFM is working to fix delays by year-end, the GE-Safran venture said. Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Among airlines with large 737 fleets,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has seen slight delays on a small number of 737 MAX deliveries, while No. 4 carrier Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) sees ""minor changes"" on future deliveries, but the delays have not disrupted operations, company representatives said.Aircraft leasing company  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) was still seeing 737 delivery delays of ""a month or less,"" spokeswoman Laura Woeste said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""And so therefore you'll see a much more heavily weighted Q4,"" Smith added. ""Those jobs are now in our factory and each one of those suppliers is getting more on track,"" he said.The top-selling 737 is powered by engines made by French-U.S. venture CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE) of the United States. CFM has had some industrial problems in producing its new LEAP engine for the 737 MAX and some aircraft for rival Airbus (PA:AIR).Boeing is also grappling with delays on fuselages supplied by Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR). Spirit, which makes some 70 percent of the structure of the 737, has faced disruptions this year in its own supply chain as parts makers scrambled to meet soaring demand. Spirit has said it is working to get back on track by mid-2018.Boeing aims to reach production of 57 of the narrow-body jets per month in 2019.Smith also said Boeing continues to spend a lot of time talking to airlines about a possible new mid-market jet it says will fill a niche between the bread-and-butter single-aisle planes that dominate most fleets and the bigger long-range, twin-aisle jets.Discussions continue to focus on the plane's economics and how airlines could use the aircraft to optimize their product lines, Smith said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Of these, $9 billion is involved in the outstanding A350 and A380 claims.Airbus disputes those numbers, saying they overstate the amount of support embedded in the contested loans. It has meanwhile leveled significant subsidy claims against Boeing.In the latest legal move, the EU said it had informed the WTO in May that it had withdrawn all remaining subsidies and taken appropriate steps to remove their adverse effects, and it wanted a legal ruling to that effect. Such a legal ruling would remove the basis for U.S. sanctions.""The legal basis for this request is that... these measures have resulted in the European Union achieving full compliance, by (i) withdrawing the remaining subsidies, and/or (ii) taking appropriate steps to remove their adverse effects,"" the EU said.""By taking appropriate steps to bring the measures at issue into conformity with the European Union's WTO obligations... (the EU) has consequently eliminated any nullification or impairment attributable to non-compliance with those recommendations and rulings.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

164,"Aug 05, 2018 05:05AM ET",IranAir gets five more ATR regional planes before sanctions,nan,"DUBAI (Reuters) - IranAir took delivery of five more ATR turboprop aircraft, Iranian state media said on Sunday, shortly before Washington imposes new sanctions on Iran after exiting a nuclear pact between Tehran and major world powers.All five new ATR 72-600 planes landed in Tehran's Mehrabad airport after leaving Toulouse, France, where they were built, and refueling in Urmia in northwestern Iran, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in May to pull the United States out of a 2015 deal requires most companies to complete ongoing business with Iran before U.S. sanctions are reimposed after a wind-down period which expires on Aug. 6.ATR - co-owned by Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF) - has been pressing U.S. authorities to allow it to deliver aircraft it built for Iran.After the signing of the accord to reopen trade links in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear activities, IranAir ordered a total of 200 aircraft from Western planemakers including 20 from ATR, which is based in Toulouse, France.But few have been delivered and planemakers say they are unable to use the wind-down period because Washington has also revoked export licenses needed by all Western planemakers due to their heavy use of U.S. parts.ATR - which had delivered 8 planes to Iran under the deal and started building another 12 - has been lobbying the U.S. Treasury to allow it to take advantage of the normal wind-down period for Iran business by giving it temporary new licenses. Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, an adviser to Iran’s transport minister, was quoted by the semi-official news agency ILNA as saying that Iran had paid for the five planes on Friday, a day before the planes left France. ""The delivery of these five aircraft is a sign of Europe's commitment to the nuclear accord,"" Fakhrieh-Kashan told ILNA.ATR declined to comment on Saturday. Industry sources said the final number of planes to be delivered would be known in coming days.The U.S. decision on Iran has raised question marks over whether ATR can reach a target of stabilizing annual deliveries at 80 aircraft in 2018. The planemaker has said it will suffer financial damage if it cannot deliver the aircraft it has already produced following earlier U.S. approvals, and is looking for alternative buyers.Airbus said last month it would not attempt to deliver any more planes to Iran in the wind-down period. It has delivered just three of 100 ordered by IranAir.Boeing (N:BA), which had sold 80 jets to IranAir under the 2015 nuclear deal, does not plan any deliveries. Unlike the European firms, it never placed the Iranian deal in its official order book on the grounds that it never received a deposit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

167,"Jul 26, 2018 02:40AM ET",Airbus Profit Jumps as Jet-Delivery Delays Begin to Ease,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) second-quarter profit doubled as the company accelerated deliveries of its best-selling single-aisle jetliner following delays at the model’s two engine providers.Adjusted earnings before interest and tax increased to 1.15 billion euros ($1.35 billion) from a restated 572 million euros a year earlier, Toulouse, France-based Airbus said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated a figure of 1.05 billion euros, based on six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Customer payments for the re-engined A320neo family of planes had been held up by a three-month halt in handovers of Pratt & Whitney-powered jets, which have been dogged by a series of glitches, and manufacturing issues concerning aircraft with turbines from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.-led CFM. Airbus has since made headway in reducing the number of planes parked outside its plants from a May peak, with 110 Neos delivered in the first half out of 239 in total.Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders, who plans to stand down next year, said that while Neo deliveries surpassed those for the original A320 model in the second quarter, meeting a target of 800 handovers across Airbus’s full aircraft lineup for 2018 as a whole remains challenging.Cost-Split“Our operational focus in commercial aircraft remains squarely on securing the production ramp-up,” he said. Airbus is also assessing how to split additional costs from parked narrow-bodies with both engine suppliers.The A350 wide-body program has shown strong progress, according to the CEO, with the “cost curve” improving as output is increased to 10 planes a month by the year’s end. Combined with higher asking prices as the jet exits its launch phase, when more bargains are on offer, that helped account for the bulk of earnings improvements in the first half, though Enders said it’s still too early to decide on further production ramp-ups.Airbus confirmed plans to lift adjusted Ebit by about 20 percent to 5.2 billion euros this year before the integration of the new A220 plane acquired from Bombardier Inc. It also still expects free cash flow before disposals and acquisitions of approximately 3 billion euros.Demand for Airbus’s planes remains strong, the company said, with more than 430 orders and commitments worth in excess of $62 billion booked last week at the Farnborough air show in England, the year’s biggest industry expo.The company booked a 98 million-euro provision against price escalation on the delayed A400M military transport program, together with costs of 21 million euros from its H160 helicopter and 40 million euros in compliance and merger expenses. At the same time it had a 157 million-euro gain from the sale of assets in its defense and space division.The CEO clarified comments published at the weekend on a possible combination of Airbus’s military aircraft assets with those of BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc, saying he “was not suggesting” an outright merger of the businesses but that their parallel next-generation fighter programs should “converge.”(Updates with comments from CEO conference call.)"
168,"Jul 25, 2018 02:25PM ET","Boeing's refueling tanker woes obscure profit beat, shares fall",nan,"By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue but shares dropped as much as 3.6 percent after it reported $426 million in higher costs on its long-delayed KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. Analysts worry that the world's largest planemaker's exposure to an escalating trade fight between Washington and Beijing as well as mounting costs on the tanker program will slow Boeing shares, up more than 21 percent year to date.""The KC-46 has returned to again haunt Boeing's results,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.""Management has previously expressed confidence that there would be no more tanker charges, and yet they keep coming,"" Stallard said, adding that the higher tanker costs came with unchanged earnings and cash flow forecasts.Chicago-based Boeing said the KC-46 program cost an additional $426 million before taxes in the quarter as the company worked through test delays and production changes to eight aircraft in various stages of production. Boeing has amassed roughly $3 billion in costs on the program, a derivative of its 767 commercial aircraft, as it works to deliver tankers to the Air Force in October - more than two years behind schedule. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on a post-earnings conference call that plans to complete manufacturing on the tankers was ""clear, and firmed up.""Muilenburg also said he was not surprised by the unusually high number of plane orders announced during last week's Farnborough Airshow with unnamed buyers. Rival Airbus (PA:AIR) said the firms did not want to be identified due to jitters about appearing to side with the United States or other economic powers amid heated trade rhetoric.""I don't find it (the anonymity) surprising one way or the other,"" Muilenburg said, adding that Chinese demand for Boeing aircraft extends far beyond a single air show.""As we think about the China-U.S trade relationships, aerospace is something that is good for both countries,"" Muilenburg said. ""It creates growth capacity in China. It's helping to grow their economy. It's growing jobs in China. And as China grows, it's growing jobs in the U.S.""Despite the KC-46 problems, Boeing beat expectations on quarterly profit. Core earnings, which exclude some pension costs, were $3.33 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $3.26, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Overall revenue rose 5 percent to $24.26 billion, also topping estimates, while commercial aircraft deliveries increased by 6 percent to 194 aircraft. Boeing booked 239 net orders during the quarter, including 91 wide-body jets.For the full year, the company expects total revenue of $97 billion to $99 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $96 billion to $98 billion.Boeing also forecast a 2018 operating margin of 10 percent to 10.5 percent in its defense business, down from its previous outlook of roughly 11 percent, and did not change its 2018 core earnings outlook of $14.30 to $14.50 per share.Wall Street has estimated $14.56 per share.The stock was down 2.6 percent to $349.11 in afternoon trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It may also look to Boeing (N:BA), which recently teamed with Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and has close ties to Saab, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. Teaming up with BAE, Saab and possibly Embraer on a new fighter would provide a serious counterweight to the Franco-German project, which has not yet awarded initial study contracts to Airbus and Dassault.It would also offer Boeing, which builds F/A-18E/F and F-15 fighters, a chance to get back into a new fighter development programme after losing out to  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter contract in 2001.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

172,"Jul 19, 2018 11:50AM ET",Aviation industry urged to hire more women as staff shortages loom,nan,"By Andrea ShalalFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Executives from top aerospace and aviation companies called on Thursday for stepped-up efforts to attract more women, saying this could help solve looming shortages of pilots, mechanics and top managers in the traditionally male-dominated sector.The industries are coming under scrutiny because of the low numbers of women employed as senior executives or airline pilots. At the same time, a growing shortage of pilots is putting the sector's recent growth at risk.The head of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, caused a storm last month when he said that a woman could not do his job, although he later apologised, saying his comments had been intended as a joke and were taken out of context.Charlotte Pedersen, chief executive of Luxaviation Helicopters, a private aviation operator, said urgent action was needed since the sector faced a potential ""huge gap"" in management capacity in a decade as current executives retired.""We can't just recruit from half the population,"" Pedersen, the first female pilot in the Danish air force, told a panel discussion at the Farnborough Airshow.Marnie Munn, an airline captain with easyJet (L:EZJ), told the conference that only three to four percent of pilots globally were women.Jane Basson, chief of staff to Airbus CEO Tom Enders, said women now accounted for 17.5 percent of the company's workforce of 140,000 but that was just a tick up from 15 percent in 2005.""It's not progressing fast enough,"" she said, adding that her company was now using data analysis tools to understand why it was proving so difficult to recruit and retain women.In addition, she said Airbus (PA:AIR) was using tools such as smart phone applications to provide encouragement and support to workers, but could tailor those to reach women specifically.Hundreds of industry executives attended the panel, with many signing a UK charter that commits organisations to support promotion of women to senior roles, set their own targets and report on their progress to boost accountability.More than 50 aviation and aerospace companies with operations in Britain have signed the charter, and the number is growing, said Katherine Bennett, a senior vice president with Airbus. It is modeled on a similar pledge in the finance sector.Signatories also agree to have a senior executive oversee diversity efforts, and to link pay of senior executives to meeting internal targets on gender diversity and inclusion.Budget airline easyJet has a target that 20 percent of its new pilots should be female by 2020 and British Aviation Minister Liz Sugg said other firms were taking similar steps.But more work was needed to close pay gaps that often exceeded 50 percent in the aerospace sector, add women to corporate boards and recruit more female pilots, she said, noting that women make up just 5 percent of pilots at UK-registered airlines.""We really do have a long way to go before these barriers disappear altogether.

The new helicopters will replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.Buying the Chinook would strengthen cooperation among German and its NATO partners, while providing assurance that the products and capabilities would be readily available to be available, Cunningham said.He said he did not expect changes at the helm of the German air force and arms procurement arm to affect the competition. ""I don't envision a significant change,"" he said.Barry McCullough, who leads business development at Lockheed's rotary and missions systems business, said cost would clearly play a role, and that his company was working hard to reduce the cost of the new CH-53K aircraft.He said a plan was in place to trim overall programme costs by $800 million, which would drive down unit costs for possible foreign military sales to Germany and Israel.

176,"Jul 18, 2018 09:10AM ET",Airbus says activating Brexit contingency plans as UK strategy 'unraveling',nan,"By Sarah Young and Victoria BryanFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is activating its Brexit contingency plans as the British government's strategy for leaving the European Union appears to be ""unraveling,"" the head of Europe's biggest planemaker said on Wednesday.Britain is due to leave the EU in less than nine months, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc, creating a headache for companies that rely on the smooth flow of goods and parts across borders.Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in Britain, has issued a series of warnings about the dangers of the country quitting the EU without an agreed deal, saying this month that could halt output at its plants and leave aircraft grounded.CEO Tom Enders said at the Farnborough Airshow that the so-called White Paper published by the UK government last Thursday which laid out its post-Brexit plans for trade with the EU was positive, but that events since had changed that view. ""I thought that the White Paper was going in the right direction,"" Enders told reporters.""Now we see that unraveling again so all the more reason for us to take more serious decisions,"" he said, referring to the Conservative government's move to accept amendments to its plan from a group of hardline Brexit supporters in its party.Airbus will now activate contingency plans to ensure its production can continue whatever the trading relationship after Brexit, Enders said, adding the main focus was on stockpiling parts that currently arrive at factories on a ""just in time"" basis. ""We are now activating contingency plans which largely focus on building some buffers ... so we should be able for a short period after the exit happens to mitigate the effects,"" he said. British engine-maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) said on Tuesday it too could start stockpiling parts, but would not do that until around the fourth quarter of this year.Even if UK Prime Minister Theresa May can secure enough support for her Brexit blueprint at home, she still needs to win agreement from the EU.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

178,"Jul 17, 2018 08:41AM ET",Boeing lifts industry demand forecast as air show deals roll on,nan,"By Eric M. Johnson and Victoria BryanFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) raised its rolling 20-year industry forecast for passenger and cargo aircraft on Tuesday, as a steady flow of deals on day two of the Farnborough Airshow underscored the industry's resilience to rising global trade tensions. The world's biggest planemaker predicted 42,700 industry deliveries over the next two decades, up three percent from its estimate of 41,030 a year ago. That would be worth $6.3 trillion at list prices versus last year's $6.1 trillion forecast.The U.S. group and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) continued to rack up deals at the air show in southern England after a brisk opening day on Monday.Russian airline Volga Dnepr committed to buying Boeing freighters worth $11.8 billion at list prices, while U.S. leasing company Air Lease Corp committed to buying as many as 78 Boeing aircraft worth $9.6 billion.In the meantime, Airbus bagged a provisional deal with an unidentified customer for 100 single-aisle A320 family jets, worth about $11.5 billion at list prices.But analysts cautioned many deals firmed up provisional ones, disclosed previously unidentified buyers, or changed existing orders, making it hard to gauge the level of demand. Rising oil prices and interest rates, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union all pose a risk to an eight-year boom in civil aviation, which has boosted industry order books and share prices. Boeing's forecasts underscored the sector's reliance on emerging markets in general and China in particular, making the U.S. planemaker especially vulnerable should trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate into a full trade war.Boeing, which calls itself America's biggest exporter, delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, one of the world's fast-growing aircraft markets.Boeing's vice-president of commercial marketing Randy Tinseth told a news briefing that China looked set to overtake the United States as the world's biggest domestic air travel market in 10-15 years.But he declined to be drawn into commenting on U.S. trade policy, saying: ""We are going to focus on what we can control.""To view a graphic on Airbus, Boeing vs US benchmark from 2008-2018, click: https://reut.rs/2JtcJG2INTENSIFYING COMPETITIONDominating Boeing's upbeat outlook was a five percent increase in the forecast for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, underpinned by an unchanged prediction for average global traffic growth of 4.7 percent.The Chicago-based planemaker now sees 31,360 deliveries in the medium-haul, single-aisle category, the cash cow of the world's top two planemakers and popular with low-cost airlines. Two weeks ago, Airbus (PA:AIR) raised its own rolling forecast for industry deliveries by more than seven percent and revamped the way it predicts demand, introducing new plane categories from 'Small' to 'Extra-Large' and blurring the traditional boundaries between aircraft types. Boeing's Tinseth said Airbus sought to show it was winning a sizable share of the aircraft market. ""Let me make one thing clear,"" Tinseth said. ""By every measure, in every way, our wide-bodies are winning. Period."" Even so, Boeing lowered its wide-body delivery forecast by 140 aircraft to 8,070, saying higher deliveries over the last year and longer-range single-aisle planes ate into the rolling forecast. Boeing saw a small increase in demand in the cargo market, a barometer of trade and business confidence, forecasting 980 new freighters from a projected 920 a year ago, fuelled by the growth of e-commerce, particularly in China. The planemaker unveiled a volley of freight orders in the first two days of the Farnborough show.Boeing's overall forecast tally is a bigger number partly because it counts aircraft with 90 seats or more, whereas Airbus starts at 100 seats. The smaller-end of the aircraft market has seen its biggest shake-up in decades after Airbus closed a deal to buy Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) 110-130-seat CSeries jet, mirrored last week by Boeing's tentative deal to acquire the commercial unit of Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3). Boeing shaved its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to use their scale to heap pressure on suppliers to lower costs, which could trigger consolidation.With the industry giants moving onto its turf, Japan's big hope for the regional jet market, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), was dealt a setback on Tuesday when it had to cancel a demo flight after the jet was hit by a truck.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

179,"Jul 17, 2018 07:39AM ET",IAG's Level airline plans budget long-haul flights from Vienna,nan,"VIENNA (Reuters) - British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) plans to expand its long-haul network from Vienna with new budget brand Level, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said on Tuesday.Most budget airlines offer short-haul routes, but Level was established last year to offer low-cost long-haul flights, joining a handful of other airlines in this relatively new market, including Norwegian (OL:NWC).""One of the reasons we chose the Level brand to operate from Vienna (is) that we are looking for opportunities to further expand long-haul flights,"" Walsh said at a news conference in Vienna to launch Level, adding that a decision on the new routes had not been taken yet.But Level will initially fly short-haul routes from Vienna where it will compete with Europe's biggest low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA). Vienna Airport (VI:VIEV) has been trying to attract budget carriers with an incentive scheme in the aftermath of the collapse of Air Berlin. Budget airlines which have launched or increased services in Vienna in the past few months include easyJet (L:EZJ), Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) Eurowings, Budapest-headquartered Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), and IAG's own short-haul low-cost carrier Vueling.Aviation industry experts have already started speculating that there might eventually be casualties in such a crowded market.Walsh said: ""We would not do this if we weren't convinced this is for the long term."" He said the Austrian market was still under represented and under served and that its short-haul budget brand Vueling would continue to fly from Vienna.IAG initially agreed to buy former Air Berlin's Austrian business Niki before it lost out to Niki Lauda. Level will start operating from Vienna with four leased Airbus A321, which were part of Air Berlin's insolvency estate, and plans to increase its fleet to 30 within the next five years, Walsh said.Its 14 European destinations include routes which are already served from the Austrian capital such as Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona. IAG has already ordered more aircraft for its carriers and is currently in talks with Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) about buying more planes for its long-haul fleet, Walsh said. The group can chose between several options to buy or lease aircraft, according to Walsh. A decision was not expected before the first quarter of 2019.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

180,"Jul 16, 2018 09:12AM ET",Jetmakers see brisk start to air show as UK tries to soothe Brexit worries,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Sarah YoungFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Planemakers racked up more than $20 billion of deals on the opening day of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, suggesting demand for new passenger jets remains in rude health despite worries over trade tensions and Brexit.The deal-making came as host Britain tried to convince a skeptical aerospace industry about its plans to leave the European Union, saying supply chains would continue to run smoothly and pledging money for a new fighter jet program. European jetmaker Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) have been enjoying an almost decade-long boom thanks to rising emerging markets growth and a need among Western airlines to upgrade their fleets, and order books are bulging. Higher oil prices, rising interest rates, global trade tensions and uncertainty over Brexit have all raised concerns that demand may slow. But business was brisk on the first day of the July 16-22 air show, though analysts will be watching closely to see how many of the deals are new, and how many involve adjusting earlier business or switching models - something not always easy to spot at first.Even before the first displays had taken to the skies over a sun-baked southern England, Boeing said delivery firm DHL, part of  Deutsche Post  DHL Group (DE:DPWGn), had placed a $4.7 billion order for 14 777 freighters, and purchase rights for seven additional freighters. It followed that up with a $3.5 billion deal for 30 of its hot-selling single-aisle 30 737 MAX 8 aircraft with U.S. aircraft leasing firm Jackson Square (NYSE:SQ) Aviation, while Qatar Airways finalised an order for five 777 freighters.Meanwhile, Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for Taiwanese start-up StarLux Airlines to buy 17 of its A350 wide-body planes worth around $6 billion at list prices, and another MoU with an unidentified leasing firm for 80 A320neo single-aisle jets worth about $8.8 billion. The Farnborough Airshow is the industry's biggest event this year. It alternates with the Paris Airshow and collectively they account for over a quarter of industry order intake each year.BREXITOpening the event south west of London, British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to reassure aviation bosses that her under-fire Brexit plan won't disrupt their supply chains.""We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,"" she said.Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019.Airbus, which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called ""hard"" Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. Also at the air show, Britain's defense minister Gavin Williamson unveiled a model of a new fighter jet called ""Tempest"" that the country plans to build. He announced 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) of funding for the project to 2025 and said he was looking for other countries to join, with a senior Royal Air Force official saying Sweden was the most likely partner. The project faces competition from a rival European one after France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter program, saying it would start as a bilateral effort with Germany that could be expanded later.WIDE-BODY WORRIESOn the civilian side, the air show is expected to confirm demand for narrowbody jets from airlines such as Mexico's VivaAerobus, which is shopping for some 40 Airbuses, and lessors like Goshawk, which ordered 20 A320neo jets on Monday but is also expected to be interested in 737 MAX. Major lessors Air Lease and Avolon are also in town.But both Airbus and Boeing are under pressure to increase orders for some of their wide-body jets due to a recent slowdown in that part of the market. One exception is the Boeing 787, after a multi-year effort to end delays and cost overruns.Speaking after the deal for wide-body A350s with StarLux, Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz said he was confident the market for such planes would pick up. ""What I have said consistently is that I see the wide-body market picking up within 18-24 months. I am quite confident.""""There are explanations as to why this wave is now coming. We had a very massive wave 4-5 years ago with a lot of orders. I think the market had to pause a little bit until we could deliver consistently and get to ramp up and rate. I think this is behind us now.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""These accusations are unfounded,"" Laudamotion managing director Andreas Gruber told journalists in Vienna. ""We have paid all our bills on time."" Laudamotion was formed by former formula one motor racing champion Niki Lauda out of the remains of the Niki carrier that was part of Air Berlin. It flies a fleet of 9 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s leased from Lufthansa and 10 Boeing (N:BA) 737 jets from shareholder Ryanair (I:RYA).

Northrop and Airbus Defence and Space, a unit of Airbus SE (PA:AIR), have teamed up on the program, to be called Pegagus in Germany, which will help Germany beef up its surveillance capabilities. The aircraft are launched from land and can be programmed to fly autonomously as high as 60,000 feet to gather a wide array of intelligence data.The German government plans to buy three of the drones, equipped with sensors and a mission system built by Airbus, with deliveries to start in 2025, according to government documents.The decision came after the messy 2013 cancellation of plans to buy a version of Northrop's Global Hawk drone, after it became it clear it could cost up to 600 million euros to get the new system approved for use in civil airspace.Chappel said he was upbeat given that the entire process - including preparations for certifying the drones' use in civil airspace - was moving forward more smoothly this time. ""The German government understands what they want,"" Chappel told Reuters ahead of the Farnborough air show. ""We're going to be very careful and make sure we start a program that's going to be successful because nobody wants to have a problem again.""He said the groundwork had been laid on both sides, and all the parties involved were closely aligned to get the deal done.""All the homework has been done ... getting it through the contracting pipe is what we're working on,"" he said.German government sources have said it will be less costly to get aviation approval for Triton since the process is being baked in from the start of the program.Northrop developed the Triton, a marine-based variant of its Global Hawk, for the U.S. Navy under a contract awarded in 2008.Australia last month said it would buy six of the Triton remotely piloted aircraft to beef up its maritime patrols, with the initial investment of A$1.4 billion ($1 billion).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Washington recently imposed 25-percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded with tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China..The U.S. administration then raised the stakes, threatening 10-percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting China to warn it would hit back.""Rhetoric about potential penalty actions are a concern to us,"" Muilenburg said.Speaking ahead of the Farnborough Airshow, Muilenburg, who has struck up good relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, said both the United States and China understood the importance of aerospace to their economies.China needs planes to boost its transport capacity and the United States relies on the sector for thousands of valuable export jobs, he said.""Aerospace thrives on global trade, free and open trade,"" Muilenburg said, adding the sector drove economic benefit globally.Besides industry concerns about trade tariffs, and in some cases disruption from Britain's exit from the European Union, planemakers are also on the alert for any disruption stemming from tightness in global supply chains due to record output.""It's on all of our radars everyday,"" Muilenburg said.MID-MARKET JETOn Boeing's plans for a potential new passenger plane, Muilenburg said the U.S. company would not take a decision on whether to launch the potential middle-of-the-market design until 2019.He stressed it would not let the entry to service slip beyond a target of 2025, even though it is taking the time needed to hone the business case for the novel type of jet.""We want a 2025 airplane,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister said, adding it would be more economic to run than other aircraft in its category.Boeing is looking at developing a plane to try to stimulate new routes in a gap between its benchmark 737 single-aisle model and the smallest version of its wide-body 787 jetliner.Analysts say the deadline is crucial because it represents the sweet spot for replacements of elderly 757 and 767 fleets.Any sign of delay would allow European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to argue that airlines would do better to pick an improved version of its hot-selling A321neo plane, covering many of the same missions.Boeing executives said the market would be better served by a tailor-made aircraft with superior economics. Airbus says its A321neo already accounts for a large slice of that sector.Flanked by many of Boeing's top executives as the company prepares to play up innovation at the July 16-22 air show, Muilenburg said he saw a future for supersonic and hypersonic technology but that it was too early to talk about the timing.Boeing executives highlighted the value of its investments in Britain after a trade row between Boeing and Canada's Bombardier threatened jobs in Northern Ireland, where Prime Minister Theresa May depends on support for her majority.Britain is said to be nearing a decision to award a new contract for early-warning planes to Boeing, prompting a backlash from Airbus and others wanting a formal competition.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

190,"Jul 15, 2018 10:20AM ET","Embraer pushes E2 jet's low maintenance, fuel costs amid Airbus rivalry",nan,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) is pushing the low maintenance costs and fuel burn of its E2 jet as it battles tougher competition from the rival A220, now backed by Airbus (PA:AIR), executives said on Sunday.""I'm hopeful that we'll be able to present a good showing on Tuesday,"" John Slattery, President and CEO Embraer Commercial Aviation, told Reuters onboard its E190-E2 jet, looking ahead to possible order announcements at this week's Farnborough air show. Boeing (N:BA) earlier this month struck a deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Embraer under a new $4.75 billion joint venture, coming after Airbus completed a deal to take control of rival Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) Cseries program.Embraer was dealt a blow last week when JetBlue opted for the A220-300, formerly known as the Cseries, over the Embraer model. Speaking separately ahead of the air show, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer said the Airbus deal allowed the former Cseries to reach its full potential. ""It's the best aircraft in that segment. It's a clean-sheet design, it's not a re-engine of an existing platform,"" he said, adding its benefit lay in low operating costs and fuel savings. The E190-E2, which Embraer is showing at Farnborough with a shark painted on its nose, is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer's commercial jet line-up with new wings and new Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.""The combination of knowledge gained from the first generation and the new technology is what makes us unique,"" Rodrigo Silva e Souza, vice president marketing, Embraer Commercial Aviation, said, highlighting fuel burn and longer maintenance intervals as the main savings for operators. The smallest version of the E2, the E175-E2 has been slowed due to a scope clause in U.S. pilots' contracts that bars it from the U.S. regional aviation market due to its weight.Slattery said Embraer was still planning entry into service towards the end of 2021, adding he saw opportunities outside of North America, such as replacing turboprops being flown in south-east Asia and CIS countries. Bombardier's Cromer said he didn't expect the scope clause to be changed any time soon, adding that benefited its CRJ airplane. Meanwhile, U.S. carriers are still interested in the current version of the E175, Slattery said, adding that jet would continue to be produced as long as it's required.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

191,"Jul 15, 2018 07:30AM ET","Planemakers plot course through trade, Brexit worries to air show deals",nan,"By Tim Hepher, Eric M. Johnson and Andrea ShalalFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Aerospace firms are setting out wares from luxury jets to lethal drones at back-to-back British air shows this week, hoping trade tensions will not deter airlines from buying jetliners even as geopolitical uncertainty allows them to sell more weapons.The quintessentially English atmosphere of the Royal International Air Tattoo, where straw-hatted VIPs watch fighters thunder over picturesque Cotswolds villages, gives way on Monday to the Farnborough Airshow, where the hard-nose business deals in the $800 billion aerospace and defense sector will be done.Trade tensions between the United States and both China and Europe, disputes over the consequences of Britain's exit from the European Union and an increase in global protectionist rhetoric have barely dented a prolonged industry boom.""The overall environment will reflect industry health, despite the dark clouds of Brexit and other global trade setbacks in the background,"" said analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group.""In short, we'll see more of what we've seen for years: aviation remaining a strangely protected and happy corner of a turbulent world.""Boeing (N:BA) is expected to confirm demand for air transport is rising after Airbus (PA:AIR) lifted forecasts last week, citing strong economic growth in emerging markets and the need to replace older planes in Western markets.The bullish outlook was underscored ahead of the show by forecasters Flightglobal Ascend. The two giants will add to record orders for benchmark narrowbody jets, whose waiting lists underpin their near-record share prices, while seeking a recovery in sales of bigger jets. After a lull, Boeing will be looking for a boost to its largest twinjet, the future 777X. Sources said recently it is in talks for an eye-catching deal with Saudi Arabia.Airbus will hope to end uncertainty over AirAsia's support for its A330neo jet after a showdown on prices. That could also involve a deal for smaller planes, though doubts have been expressed over financial commitments to Airbus.Farnborough is the first such event since Airbus and Boeing shook up the industry by agreeing to absorb key commercial programs of smaller rivals Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer as they prepare for future competition from China.The result should be a fierce contest for sales in the 100-150-seat sector even before Boeing closes its Embraer deal.A new airline, Moxy, is expected to confirm a large order for the rebranded Airbus A220, the former Bombardier CSeries.Airbus, Boeing and S&P500 in 2018: https://reut.rs/2LlnTyGINDUSTRIAL POKERThe event is also expected to provide new evidence of strong demand for freight planes as e-commerce drives up shippers' profits despite global trade tensions.Analyst predictions for total commercial orders and commitments vary from last year's 900 to about half that.While high fuel prices make efficient new planes attractive, they hurt the bottom line of buyers, delaying some decisions.""We are not blind: there are things that need to remain on watch,"" the head of major engine-maker CFM said on Saturday.Farnborough will also be an opportunity for aerospace firms to plot next moves on civil and defense for decades to come.The July 16-22 show is not only about order headlines but also about sending signals to investors, keeping competitors guessing and keeping potential buyers interested. Boeing will want to maintain interest in a potential new mid-market plane, while giving itself until next year to decide whether to launch the new 220-270-seat jet.While it is further ahead in pre-development than at the same stage on earlier programs, it must convince airlines it can be ready in 2025, the deadline for many fleet overhauls. Airbus may talk up its possible new A321XLR, designed to address a shortfall in transatlantic performance of its longest-range single-aisle jet and targeted at U.S. majors.The aircraft, with an improved take-off weight of 100 tonnes and 4,500 nautical miles range, has already had an unannounced commercial launch in a bid to head off Boeing's proposed new jet from 2021, industry sources said.U.S. sources doubt it will do everything Airbus claims.Both planemakers are likely to deepen a push into high-margin services, announcing maintenance and operational deals in competition with airlines and parts providers. It's part of a tug of war for profits between planemakers and their partners.Suppliers will be trying to gauge how far the jetmakers are prepared to go in buying up parts of their supply chain. And many in Europe will be discussing how to prepare for a possible 'hard Brexit' or a disorderly UK exit form the European Union.Sensitive UK choices over international partnerships are also expected to loom large in the defense side of the show.The UK government will set out a combat air strategy with potential repercussions for defense suppliers around the world. It could ignite efforts to develop a successor to the four-nation Eurofighter but is expected to leave open whether Britain would seek to enter a project already underway between France and Germany, or risk a repeat of costly procurement splits.For now, Sweden is shaping up as the most likely partner and South Korea, Japan and Turkey or Gulf arms-buying countries like Saudi Arabia could be drawn in, arms analyst Francis Tusa said.""It is a game of industrial poker,"" he told Reuters.

195,"Jul 11, 2018 05:28AM ET","India's Vistara orders Boeing, Airbus jets worth $3.1 billion in growth plan",nan,"By Aditi Shah and Jamie FreedNEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian airline Vistara has placed firm orders for six  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 jets and 13 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320neos valued at $3.1 billion at list prices, as it looks to add more domestic flights and launch international routes later this year.The order for Boeing's 787s marks a new setback for Airbus in an intense battle for widebody orders as the European planemaker seeks to strengthen the order book for its upgraded A330neo passenger jet. Boeing posted figures on Tuesday showing a significant lead in new orders over its European rival, buoyed by demand for the 787 following a series of showdowns against the A330neo. Airbus said last week it saw good demand for the upgraded jet and is expected to announce orders soon. The Farnborough Airshow, which typically attracts large numbers of airline orders, will be held in Britain next week.Vistara joins rival Jet Airways (NS:JET) and low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) that have plans to grow their international operations to offset a highly competitive, price-sensitive domestic market.""India's position as the world's fastest growing domestic aviation market and its impressive growth in air passenger traffic that has more than doubled over the last decade makes us confident of our aggressive plans for domestic expansion and international foray,"" Vistara CEO Leslie Thng said in a statement on Wednesday.The joint venture between India's Tata Sons Ltd and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), said it would procure another 37 A320neos from leasing companies and also had purchase rights over 4 more 787-9s and options over 7 more A320neos.The purchased and leased Airbus jets, fitted with CFM International LEAP engines, will be delivered between 2019 and 2023. The Boeing jets, to be powered by GE (N:GE) engines and used for medium and long-haul flights, are expected in 2020 and 2021.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELThere is huge potential for international travel from India, where the domestic aviation market has grown about 20 percent annually in recent years.Only 0.3 percent of the 1.3 billion population currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million Indians who could potentially afford to do so, according to an analysis of household income by aviation consultancy CAPA. CAPA expects Vistara to place another large widebody order within the next 1-2 years and also expects InterGlobe Aviation's (NS:INGL) IndiGo to pursue an ""aggressive international strategy"" by soon announcing a large order.""India will see closer to 100 wide-body orders in next 1-2 years indicating a strong international strategy,"" said Kapil Kaul, CEO and director for South Asia at CAPA.Jet Airways placed a firm order in June for 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, taking the total to 225 new aircraft which it expects to add to its fleet over the next decade.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

JohnsonSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) first-half aircraft deliveries rose more than 7 percent, lifted by demand for its bestselling 737 jetliners as airlines seek more fuel-efficient planes, and orders were more than double those of European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).The announcement on Tuesday caps a successful half year for the world's largest planemaker and comes a week ahead of the Farnborough Airshow in Britain, where airlines typically place orders.Chicago-based Boeing had 460 net aircraft orders in the first half of 2018, compared with Airbus's 206, rebounding after losing that race to Airbus last year. Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because that's when airlines pay over most of the money, while orders give a better glimpse of planemakers' prospects.Boeing said its in-house financing arm, Boeing Capital Corp, acquired 75 single-aisle 737s for an unnamed buyer, indicating Boeing had to help arrange financing to close the deal.Such deals do not typically stay on Boeing's balance sheet but would be sold on to other lessors. Boeing declined to name the underlying customer involved. Boeing has said it aims to ship between 810 and 815 commercial aircraft in 2018, as much as 6.8 percent more than the industry record 763 jets it delivered in 2017, putting it ahead of Airbus for the sixth year in a row. Airbus forecasts delivering around 800 planes in general for 2018.Airbus scored a key victory on Tuesday, with U.S. airline JetBlue (O:JBLU) announcing it would buy 60 of its A220-300 narrowbody jets, the first major order for the planemaker's newly rebranded program as its battle with rival  Boeing Co  intensifies.Boeing said first-half deliveries rose 7.4 percent to 378 aircraft, led by higher demand for its single-aisle 737 jetliners. Deliveries have been fueled by strong demand from airlines that are enjoying booming passenger travel.Airbus delivered 303 aircraft in the first half, down about 1 percent from a year earlier.Boeing shares rose 1.5 percent to $347.16. The Farnborough Airshow, held every other year in alternation with Paris, kicks off July 16 outside London. Global planemakers could reap 900 orders and commitments from the show, down just slightly from last year's event, as strong oil prices prompt airlines to top up orders for fuel-efficient narrowbody models, aviation consultancy IBA Group said.On average, the summer jamborees account for 30 percent of annual commercial business, according to IBA.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The deal closed on July 1.""We feel the 220 is the perfect fit for our network, strategy and customer experience, and most importantly, for our owners,"" JetBlue Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest said in a phone interview. ""It really is the ideal aircraft to carry the momentum of our structured cost program well into the next decade."" The A220 will replace JetBlue's existing fleet of 60 Embraer E190 aircraft, with those jets retiring beginning in 2020. The A220's triumph over Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) sets the stage for a fierce competition between Airbus and Chicago-based Boeing Co (N:BA) in the narrowbody market. Both major planemakers have recently taken stakes in smaller rivals' jet programs. Boeing last week announced a tentative deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Embraer under a new $4.75 billion joint venture.""It's a very smart decision on JetBlue's part because the A220 is an extremely flexible airplane,"" Atmosphere Research Group fleet analyst Henry Harteveldt said, adding that it was a ""completely new airplane"" with a fuel efficiency that would allow JetBlue to carry ""20 to 30 more passengers for free.""The jets will be powered by Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) PW1500G engines. Pratt & Whitney is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).JetBlue declined to outline the financial details of the deal.

200,"Jul 10, 2018 05:22AM ET",European shares extend recovery rally as oil stocks lead,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday as investors shifted from worrying about a trade war to focusing on a corporate earnings season expected to deliver solid results.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rose 0.2 percent by 0830 GMT, a 2 1/2-week high, and headed for its sixth straight day of gains as commodities shares supported the market in the face of rising protectionism. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) declined 0.1 percent, however, as the pound recovered from Monday's drop after top-level government resignations. Fading concern over trade had pushed Wall Street and Asian stocks up overnight as well. ""It’s more of an absence of bad news rather than outright positive news that has driven the trade story over the last few days,"" said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.Oil stocks (SXEP) were the biggest boost to the index, rising 1 percent. Crude prices climbed on concern over potential supply shortages as Norwegian oil workers prepared to strike later in the day. Industrials stocks like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn),  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), among the worst-hit by news of tariffs, also boosted the European index. Trade-sensitive luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) extended their recovery rally.Overall, analysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the STOXX 600 before Europe's earnings season kicks off in earnest. But on Tuesday disappointing results caused the most eye-catching moves. Shares in interdealer broker TP ICAP (L:TCAPI) sank as much as 31.5 percent to a two-year low, on pace for their worst day ever. The company announced its CEO would depart and warned on profit, blaming Brexit-related costs.Ocado (L:OCDO) shares fell 2.4 percent after the online supermarket said its 2018 pre-tax loss would exceed market consensus as investment spending cut into first-half earnings.Among notable gainers, speciality chemicals firm  Wacker Chemie  (DE:WCHG) rose 2.8 percent after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts raised the stock to buy from hold.""We think the market is overestimating the impact of renewed price pressure in polysilicon for solar and at the same time underestimating the value of Wacker's Silicones business,"" they wrote.

201,"Jul 06, 2018 08:46AM ET",Airbus CEO steps up warning on danger of hard Brexit,nan,"By Tim HepherLONDON (Reuters) - The head of Airbus (PA:AIR) warned the British government on Friday that in a worst-case scenario Brexit could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. Companies have become increasingly vocal about the risks of Brexit, hoping to have an impact on the outcome of crunch talks between British Prime Minister Theresa May and her senior ministers on Friday. For companies, the biggest worry is that Britain leaves the bloc without a deal, a so-called ""hard"" Brexit.""The certification for thousands of parts that are today part of the supply chain, part of our aircraft, would fall apart, and that could be a very troubling situation for us and could eventually lead to a standstill of production,"" Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said, contemplating the worst-case scenario. For Airbus, which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, that worst-case scenario would occur if Britain is no longer part of the EU aviation safety certification agency, EASA, which gives planes and parts approvals so that they can fly.Guillaume Faury, boss of Airbus's planemaking unit, said planes could also be grounded.""In case there is no agreement, we will not be allowed to install parts and make them fly on airplanes so there will be aircraft grounded,"" he said at Airbus's annual media briefing in London. FRACTIOUS CABINET PM May hopes to settle differences in her fractious cabinet about Brexit at the meeting at her country residence Chequers, enabling her to unblock stalled talks with the European Union.Those talks follow a step-up in warnings from various companies in recent weeks. Airbus last month issued its strongest warning yet over Brexit, saying that withdrawal without a deal would force it to reconsider its long-term position and put thousands of British jobs at risk.Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover joined in on Wednesday, saying that a chaotic Brexit would cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing operations in the United Kingdom. The retail industry said a ""no deal"" might see ""food rotting at ports"".Enders did not seem hopeful that the British government will make progress, saying earlier that it has ""no clue or at least (no) consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm"".He defended Airbus's decision to issue the warnings.""We will, of course, speak up. We do this because this is what we owe our shareholders,"" German-born Enders said. Asked to provide examples of the steps being taken to soften the impact of Brexit, Airbus's Faury said the company was looking at installing a three-month buffer of parts in some factories.But in order to reach this level in the nine months remaining before Britain leaves the European Union, suppliers would have to abruptly raise production by one third - whereas most of suppliers were already at full capacity, he said.Airbus is building warehouses to store the extra parts, an industry source added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

202,"Jul 06, 2018 07:51AM ET",Airbus upbeat on prospect for A400M export contract this year,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Friday it was optimistic it could sign a first export contract for its troubled multi-nation A400M military transport plane this year, and expressed growing confidence about prospects for European defense cooperation.Airbus Defence and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke said the company had been in negotiations with a potential buyer for the A400M airlifter, but did not name the country.""We are pretty optimistic that there will be a first signature of a contract for the A400M for export still this year,"" Hoke told an Airbus media day in London that was webcast. Airbus says the A400M - built by Airbus for seven NATO buyers - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - is finally turning the corner after years of cost overruns, technical challenges and schedule delays.Hoke said Airbus expected to demonstrate by the end of the year the plane's ability to refuel helicopters in mid-air, one of several features whose delivery has been delayed.The A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military and humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (N:BA) C-17.Hoke said Airbus also expected to complete revamped delivery deals with individual buyers this year following a declaration of intent signed in February.Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the company saw rising defense demand in Europe, where military budgets are now expanding after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, and given pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.""The freefall that we had ... until fairly recently has been stopped, thanks to Mr. Putin and also thanks a little bit to Mr. Trump,"" he said, citing ""significant"" new projects both in the short and long-term.Hoke also highlighted fresh momentum in efforts to bring together the highly fragmented European defense market, and credited French President Emmanuel Macron for helping push forward a European drone program and a Franco-German future fighter project.Hoke said the fighter jet program would start with two lead nations, but other nations - including Spain and Britain - could be invited to join in later. The move reflected lessons learned on the A400M program, which experts say was burdened by over-ambitious wish lists from participating nations.Europe needed to focus its efforts on one fighter project to remain competitive globally, Hoke said. ""We cannot survive global competition if we fragment this market ... further,"" he said.Airbus and its long-time rival, France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), signed an agreement to work together on the project in April, a deal that Hoke said many never expected to happen.""It was a turning point. It showed that we can cooperate and make things happen,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

203,"Jul 06, 2018 07:12AM ET",Airbus says over the worst in A320neo delivery logjam,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is over the worst on engine delays that have hampered deliveries of its A320neo passenger jet, with the number of semi-finished and undelivered planes beginning to come down, its planemaking chief said on Friday.The European aerospace group has faced a backlog of up to 100 A320neo jets nicknamed 'gliders' - sitting on the ground outside factories without their engines - due to delays in deliveries mainly from U.S.-based Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).Airbus President Guillaume Faury said this number had now fallen to 86 at the end of June. He also said that Airbus expected to deliver more of the A320neo models, carrying the new type of engine, in the second half than the current A320 model.Airbus has not yet taken any decision on whether to increase output of single-aisle to 70 a month early next decade, with its engine makers not yet ready to make the jump, Faury said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

204,"Jul 05, 2018 05:54PM ET","Boeing to take over $4.75 billion Embraer unit, targeting Airbus-Bombardier",nan,"By Brad Haynes and Tim HepherSAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) struck a deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) under a new $4.75 billion joint venture, the firms said on Thursday, reshaping a global passenger jet duopoly.The new company, encompassing Embraer's airliner business, thrusts Boeing into the lower end of the market, giving stiffer competition to the CSeries jets designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).The memorandum of understanding signed by Boeing and Embraer values the Brazilians' commercial aircraft operations, the world's third-largest, at $4.75 billion and Boeing's planned 80-percent stake in the venture at $3.8 billion.The Boeing-Embraer alliance, following on the heels of the Airbus-Bombardier tie-up announced last year, represents the biggest realignment in the global aerospace market in decades, strengthening established Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan, analysts say.Chief Executive Paulo Cesar Silva told employees in a note reviewed by Reuters that consolidation in the aerospace supply chain had also forced Embraer's hand.""This has been happening with both our suppliers and our clients. They have started to organize in big blocs, making it harder for companies of Embraer's size to negotiate,"" he said.Embraer shares fell 10 percent in New York and nearly 15 percent in Sao Paulo on disappointment at the financial terms of the long-awaited deal.The price tag for Embraer's commercial aviation unit was ""significantly lower"" than early reports, according to analysts at Vertical Research Partners, who underscored in a client note that a deal must still clear political and regulatory barriers before closing as proposed at the end of next year.""We also see strong odds of Embraer shareholders demanding a higher price for the stake in the commercial segment,"" wrote BTG Pactual analysts Renato Mimica and Samuel Alves in a note.The partnership, which adds a 70- to 130-seat family to Boeing's lineup, is expected to boost the U.S. firm's earnings per share from 2020, generating annual pre-tax cost savings of about $150 million by the third year, the companies said.Boeing shares were little changed on Thursday.CASH AND DEBTEmbraer will transfer much of its debt to the new venture and receive cash from Boeing, Embraer executives told analysts. About a fifth of the cash payment will go to taxes and the rest could be split between share buybacks, a special dividend, deleveraging and new product development, they said.Silva told employees in his note that Embraer would improve its cash position by $1 billion once the deal closes, allowing more investment in new projects. Embraer will hold the remaining 20 percent of the Boeing joint venture and keep control of its defense and business jet operations. Concern over U.S. influence in military programs had raised flags in the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto at Embraer dating back to its privatization.However, recent signals from Brazil's President Michel Temer and military officials suggest the government is satisfied with the new structure of the tie-up, as long as Brazilian jobs are maintained and Embraer continues to develop new technology.One government official said the deal as announced on Thursday was likely to get approval in Brasilia. Another official said government approval was not certain and would depend on the final details presented later this year. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity.In addition to the passenger jet deal, Boeing and Embraer will deepen a sales and services partnership on the new KC-390 military cargo jet through a separate defense venture that is likely to eventually receive a joint investment, Silva said.A union of metalworkers in Sao Jose dos Campos, where Embraer is based, said in a statement it would ""pressure"" the federal government to use the golden share it owns in Embraer to veto the deal. The Embraer-Boeing tie-up took shape more than two years after the idea was first presented internally to Boeing's board and reflects a longstanding affinity between the two planemakers, a person familiar with the discussions said. However, the pressure for an alliance accelerated when Airbus last year announced it would take control of the CSeries jet, which had been struggling in its battle with Embraer at the small end of the airliner market. That deal put enormous marketing weight behind Embraer's competitor, while for Boeing the transatlantic tie-up threatened to expand the revenue base of its European arch-rival.""The Boeing-Embraer announcement confirms the strong market potential in the 100- to 150-seat category,"" Airbus said through a spokesman. ""Boeing and Embraer are following Airbus and Bombardier.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

205,"Jul 05, 2018 08:20AM ET",UK retail says no-deal Brexit will see 'food rotting at ports',nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government and the European Union must avoid a no-deal Brexit ""at all costs"" as this would clog up food supplies, raise prices and throw retailers out of business, the UK retail industry's lobby group said on Thursday.The warning from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) came a day before British Prime Minister Theresa May hosts ministers at her country residence to try to reach agreement on how to push on with the all-but-stalled Brexit talks.In a letter to May and the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, BRC chairman Richard Pennycook said failure to reach a deal that protects the free flow of goods after Brexit on March 29, 2019, would harm both UK consumers and EU-based producers.""Failure to reach a deal – the cliff edge scenario – will mean new border controls and multiple ‘non-tariff barriers’, through regulatory checks, that will create delays, waste and failed deliveries,"" he said.""The consequences of this will be dramatic for UK consumers. It is likely that we will see food rotting at ports, reducing the choice and quality of what is available to consumers.""The BRC's intervention follows similar warnings from several other businesses, including Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], Airbus (PA:AIR), Siemens (NS:SIEM) and John Lewis [JLPLC.UL].Pennycook, the former boss of the Co-operative Group, noted that 50 percent of Britain's food is imported, and of that 60 percent comes from the EU.He said that in 2016 3.6 million containers from the EU passed through UK ports, equating to more than 50,000 tonnes per day of food. These goods can currently enter the UK with minimal delay, allowing for frictionless trade.HIGHER PRICESPennycook said food and beverage products would face an average increase in the cost of importing from the EU of up to 29 percent from non-tariff barriers alone and warned that many of these increases would be passed on to consumers in higher prices.The BRC has also estimated that more than 12,500 small retail businesses will be at risk of going bust, while EU businesses face losing 21 billion pounds ($27.8 billion) of agri-food exports to Britain.Pennycook said time was running out for the food supply chain as EU farmers needed to know who their customers would be before planting their crops or raising their animals this autumn, for delivery to UK consumers next spring.At Friday's meeting in Chequers, May's country residence, the prime minister is expected to propose a new plan to ease trade and offer Britain more freedom to set tariffs after Brexit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK Industry is in no-one's interest,"" JLR's Indian parent firm  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO) said in a statement https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/8cbd16d7-4768-49b6-b752-85dcec2fbf45.pdf on Thursday.Shares in Tata plunged to their lowest in more than five years on Thursday, as investors turned jittery on the company, whose biggest business is JLR, which contributed nearly 77 percent of its total revenue in the year ended March 31, 2018.""Prima facie, 1.2 billion pounds looks on the higher side and hence the reaction to the stock today,"" said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst with Ambit Capital.Speth's comments come ahead of a meeting on Friday between Prime Minister Theresa May and her cabinet ministers to decide on strategy for Britain to negotiate its way out of the European Union, ending a 40-year trading relationship.Because of uncertainty about what Britain actually wants from the EU after it leaves, the outcome of the cabinet meeting is seen as critical to progress in talks with the EU on the issue. Recent weeks have seen criticism of the government by some of the biggest companies operating in Britain. Airbus (PA:AIR) and Siemens (NS:SIEM) last week went public with their fears about what leaving the EU customs union and single market would mean for their businesses. JLR said it needed ""free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than 1.2 billion pounds in profit each year. As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around 50 billion pounds in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further 80 billion pounds more in the next five,"" Speth said in a statement.""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He did not elaborate on whether this meant new firm orders for the 110- to 130-seat planes.Airbus SE (PA:AIR) took a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries after completing a tie-up with the Canadian train and plane maker on Sunday.Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its key commercial jet for a token fee of one Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales, high costs and low production rates pushed the plane program well over budget.Enders repeated comments from 2017 that he expects to sell ""thousands"" of CSeries aircraft, although neither he nor plane program head Philippe Balducchi would give specific figures for new orders in 2018.Balducchi told employees the European planemaker would have to ""drastically cut costs,"" reiterating the company's plan to bring down the cost structure of CSeries production.While Airbus is expected to put pressure on CSeries suppliers to lower costs, Enders did not give specifics on whether there could be employee cutbacks.""We're at the start of this partnership,"" he said. Enders also told reporters he is worried that an escalation in a U.S. trade dispute with other countries could trigger retaliation that could impact air traffic. ""Of course we're worried if this escalates,"" Enders said.U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum from Europe, Canada and other countries, sparking retaliation.The World Trade Organization said in a report on Wednesday that trade barriers being erected by major economies could jeopardize the global economic recovery and their effects are already starting to show.

208,"Jul 03, 2018 03:30PM ET",Cuban flagship airline's woes deepen after crash,nan,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson AcostaHAVANA (Reuters) - In the busy summer travel period in Cuba, a long line of people wait for hours in the sweltering heat outside the Havana office of state-owned airline Cubana, many of them eager to visit families in the provinces.But they are not waiting to book flights. Instead, they hope to get their money back on plane tickets or exchange them for bus tickets across the island.Cubana, which has a virtual monopoly on domestic flights, has suspended nearly all of them due to a lack of working aircraft, plunging travel on the Caribbean's largest island into chaos and highlighting problems at what was once a vanguard of Latin American aviation.The flight suspensions were made a month after a Cubana flight crashed after takeoff from Havana airport in May, killing 112 people. They come at a time when Communist-run Cuba is trying to stimulate tourism, one of the few bright spots in its economy, by promoting beach resorts and colonial towns hundreds of kilometers (miles) from the capital.""Now I will have to take a 16-hour bus-ride to Guantanamo but what other options do I have?,"" said kindergarten teacher Marlene Mendoza, who was bathed in sweat and got a bus ticket to eastern Cuba after queuing for more than seven hours.Analysts say Cubana's troubles stem largely from dual ills that afflict the whole state-run economy: the U.S. trade embargo and a problematic business model.Cubana did not reply to requests for comment for this story.Founded in 1929 as one of Latin America's first airlines, Cubana was nationalized after Fidel Castro's leftist 1959 revolution. In its heyday, it flew Cuban troops to Africa and passengers to allied socialist countries around the globe. For decades it got around U.S. sanctions that restricted it from buying planes with a certain share of U.S. components - including European Airbus (PA:AIR) and Brazilian Embraers (SA:EMBR3) - by acquiring first Soviet and then Russian aircraft.The carrier maintained a decent safety record but its reputation for mediocre service and delays prompted many foreign tourists to use mostly land transport. Then, over the past year, it started canceling more flights than usual, often putting passengers up in hotels for days, without commenting publicly on the disarray.After the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 crashed on May 18, Cubana said it had leased the plane from Mexican company Damojh due to a lack of its own aircraft. A second Damojh plane has been grounded pending a safety audit of its fleet by Mexican authorities, data from Flightradar24 shows, aggravating the shortage.Cuban, Mexican and U.S. authorities are still investigating the crash and have not commented on possible causes. Damojh has said in a press release that is fully cooperating with those investigations into the ""lamentable accident.""Just four of Cubana's own 16 planes are flying, according to a Reuters examination of data on Flightradar24 and Planespotters.net. NOT FLYING HIGHOver the past month, the airline announced it was axing several routes mainly used by Cubans and reducing the frequency of flights to Santiago, Holguin and Baracoa, all popular tourist destinations. In a statement, it said it was working to resolve the situation and apologized for the disruption.Cubana also suspended all international routes except to Buenos Aires and Madrid, several staff told Reuters. The company did not comment publicly, leaving would-be travelers sharing their confusion on online forums.""It has lost a lot of prestige. It's already not the famous Cubana that used to fly to all parts of the world,"" said one former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, who retired 6-1/2 years ago after working for Cubana for 40 years.""Anywhere else in the world, a company like Cubana would have folded.""Cubana said in mid-June it did not have enough aircraft largely because of maintenance issues and lack of parts, which aviation experts say can cost millions of dollars.The airline sells tickets to Cuban citizens at heavily subsidized prices. Its budget is also stretched by ferrying official delegations around sometimes at a financial loss, a former Cuban diplomat familiar with Cubana operations said.Cash-strapped Cuba points the finger at the 56-year-old U.S. trade embargo, saying it has cost its flagship carrier millions of dollars. The coup de grace was possibly the purchase of six An-158 regional jets from Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov since 2013.Cubana has said those planes have had technical problems and getting parts for the joint Russian-Ukrainian project has proven difficult since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.An Antonov representative told Reuters Cubana had not been paying for the necessary work but it had signed a deal in April with the airline to cooperate ""to resume the use of AN-158 planes before the end of the current year.""Typically, airlines lease planes when theirs are undergoing maintenance or there is a spike in demand, but the U.S. embargo and financial constraints likely complicate this for Cuba, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of U.S. aviation consulting company the Teal Group.In May, Lithuanian lessor Avion Express and Italian lessor Blue Panorama both ended their contracts with Cubana, the companies told Reuters, without explaining why. Data from Flightradar24 shows they withdrew respectively four Airbus A320s and one Boeing 737. That is around the time when Cubana turned to the little-known Damojh, leasing the 39-year-old Boeing 737. Damojh has faced safety concerns in other countries in the region. Guyana's aviation authority told Reuters it had revoked Damojh's permit to fly there last year due to issues such as overloading planes. The airline declined to comment on the matter.The crash in May has undermined trust in Cubana.""I like to travel by plane.It's faster and more comfortable,"" said Maylín López, 48, waiting at Havana's bus station for her 15-hour ride to eastern Cuba. ""But I can't even imagine doing that now.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Performance is right. Engine is right. PDP (pre-delivery payments) is right."" he said. ""And performance of the 330 251-tonne is right. If right, (it is) the plane we dreamt of and fought for and then we can order more. Or else.""Pre-delivery payments are made to manufacturers in the run-up to production and are sometimes financed using loans. It remains unclear to what extent AirAsia has yet paid advances.The remark is the latest in a series of teasing comments from Fernandes apparently designed to heighten competition between Boeing and Airbus and to take advantage of AirAsia's position as an anchor customer for the A330neo.After a series of losses to Boeing's 787, several analysts have said the future of the A330neo will be under mounting scrutiny if AirAsia abandons its order. However, with this month's Farnborough Airshow approaching, Airbus is expected to do its utmost to try to bag at least one alternative order to restore some momentum to the program.With only 214 A330neos on order - including 66 for AirAsia X and another 28 for IranAir that are unlikely to be delivered due to U.S. sanctions - the program is in need of a fresh boost to mop up more than 15 unsold production slots next year.The 251-tonne version, which could fly non-stop from Kuala Lumpur to London, is designed to provide more range by improving fuel capacity but will not be available for delivery until 2020.Fernandes also said on Tuesday he believed the A321neo, a large narrowbody jet, was a ""great plane"" and raised the prospect of ordering more. He is also the CEO of AirAsia, which has 100 A321neos on order.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The accountancy firm's report chimed with a Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey last week that showed optimism across British businesses about the outlook has faded to its lowest level this year.Britain will leave the European Union in March 2019 but a transitional trade agreement has still to be finalised amid disagreements among Prime Minister Theresa May's team over Britain's future relationship with Europe.Last month, multinational companies Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) warned their investments in Britain could be at risk if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. They directly employ about 30,000 people in Britain.""Uncertainty about the timing and the nature of the Brexit settlement has added to CFOs' worries about the final destination of the Brexit process,"" Deloitte Chief Economist Ian Stewart said.""The boost to CFOs' spirits we saw in the last survey, following the announcement of the Brexit transition deal, has been short-lived.""A net 17 percent of large companies said they expected revenues to rise in the coming 12 months, down from 31 percent in the first quarter of the year, the survey showed.And only 10 percent of large companies said increasing capital spending was a strong priority, down from 12 percent in the last survey. Official data last week showed business investment fell 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the sharpest fall since late 2016.

216,"Jun 29, 2018 11:04AM ET",HAL-like robot to help astronaut in space odyssey,nan,"By Joey RouletteCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A science fiction-inspired robot hardwired to assist astronauts launched from Florida early Friday to become the first personal, artificial intelligence-powered companion in space. The Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, or CIMON, is an English-speaking droid roughly the size of a basketball that will help German astronaut Alexander Gerst conduct experiments on the International Space Station. “What we’re trying to do with CIMON is to increase the efficiency of the astronaut,” Matthias Biniok, an engineer for chip maker  IBM  (N:IBM) and one of the lead architects behind CIMON’s artificial intelligence, told Reuters. CIMON will verbally communicate step-by-step instructions to Gerst during three planned science experiments on the space station’s European module. Currently, astronauts read these instructions from a laptop, which Biniok says is an arduous process that a responsive, hands-free companion like CIMON can replace. “Right now our main mission is to support the astronauts with their daily tasks to save time, because time is the most valuable and most expensive thing on the ISS,” Biniok said.SCIENCE FICTION COMICThe German Aerospace Center plans for CIMON to undergo three one-hour sessions to demonstrate how well the robot can help with experiments, like a crystal growth study, a test for its eight on-board cameras and an exercise to help Gerst solve a Rubik’s cube. CIMON will return to Earth on Dec. 13. Biniok said the concept of CIMON was inspired by a 1940s science fiction comic series set in space, where a sentient, brain-shaped robot named Professor Simon mentors an astronaut named Captain Future. CIMON also parallels HAL, the sentient computer in Stanley Kubrick's movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""Philipp Schulien, a German engineer for CIMON’s hardware contractor, Airbus (PA:AIR), said extending astronauts’ abilities in space is imperative for future space exploration journeys, like the crewed missions to Mars that are scheduled to take off as early as 2020. “There are certain effects that might appear during long-term missions like the so-called groupthink effect,” Schulien said, citing a behavioral phenomenon in which humans that spend lengthy periods of time in isolation are driven to make irrational decisions. “Long, isolated groups tend to stop communicating with the ground,” he said.A robot like CIMON with human-like personalities could help mitigate the disorientation astronauts may feel in space, Schulien said. CIMON is among 5,900 pounds of cargo that launched to the International Space Station on Friday, atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It is scheduled to reach the station on Monday."
217,"Jun 28, 2018 02:30PM ET",Fox shareholder urges Murdoch to give Comcast time to beat Disney bid,nan,"By Carl O'Donnell(Reuters) - TCI Fund Management Ltd, a large Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) shareholder, has urged Fox executive chairman Rupert Murdoch to give Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) a chance to top Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) $71 billion offer to buy most of Fox's assets, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. The hedge fund, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, owns 7.4 percent of Fox shares and said he disagreed with Fox's view that Comcast's bid would come with higher regulatory risk. TCI is ""strongly motivated"" to support whichever deal came at a higher price. The letter highlights shareholder appetite for a continued bidding war between Disney and Comcast over Fox, whose stock traded 1.7 percent higher on Thursday at $49.62, more than $10 above Disney's revised, roughly $38 per share offer. Disney, Fox and TCI declined to comment. Comcast could not be reached immediately for comment. Hohn’s $17.5 billion hedge fund has held stakes in German carmaker  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF), and called for changes to boost their stock prices. Hohn said a U.S. judge's recent approval of AT&T Inc's (N:T) agreement to acquire  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) is ""unequivocally positive"" for similar deals, such as Comcast's bid for Fox. He also said the U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Disney earlier this week, which cleared the way for that company's planned acquisition of Fox, further reduced the regulatory risk for a potential Comcast deal. Hohn said the timetable for a Comcast deal would be roughly similar to a one with Disney, given the need for either transaction to obtain regulatory approvals internationally. Disney agreed to buy Fox for $71 billion in stock on June 20, trumping a $65 billion cash bid from Comcast. Disney had originally agreed to buy Fox for around $52 billion late last year. Fox delayed its planned shareholder meeting, scheduled for next month, to give Comcast time to come back with a higher bid. The Fox assets in play include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox’s stake in Hulu.Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. A deal for Fox would allow Comcast to better adapt to new trends in the pay-TV industry, as consumers abandon traditional cable bundles in favor of web-based offerings such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).The Financial Times first reported on the letter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It envisions a mid-market jetliner with 220 to 270 seats and a range of up to 5,000 nautical miles, with global demand for 4,000 to 5,000 jets over 20 years, though rival Airbus (PA:AIR) disagrees with that forecast. Boeing wants an engine that burns 25 percent less fuel for every pound of thrust it produces compared with the 757's decades-old turbines, the Air Current reported. The timing for choosing either one or two manufacturers was not immediately clear, it said.General Electric (N:GE) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rolls-Royce, which is facing problems with parts of the Trent 1000 engine that have led to the grounding of some 787s for repairs, said, ""whenever an aircraft manufacturer comes forward with a proposal we will have a technology response.""A Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) representative referred to comments made earlier this month by its commercial engine business chief Chris Calio: ""I think the (Geared Turbofan engine) scales well, and so we're always looking and interested in other applications for the GTF as long as it makes sense for us.""Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said in a research note that CFM ""is likely to be the keenest contender"", and might offer a derivative of its GE9X engine, which serves the forthcoming 777X.

222,"Jun 26, 2018 09:31AM ET",A third of European firms to cut investment because of Brexit: survey,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - One in three European firms plans to cut investment spending as a result of Brexit and more than one-tenth of those with operations in Britain expects to pull out of the country entirely, according to a survey by Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG).Half of the companies do not expect Britain leaving the European Union to change their investment plans, the survey of 600 euro zone firms, published on Tuesday, showed. But the number of companies suggesting they will make cuts within the next six to 12 months and citing Brexit as the reason rose for the first time in two years, to 34 percent.With the likely trading and regulatory environment once Britain leaves the EU next March still uncertain, businesses are becoming increasingly vocal.Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Airbus (PA:AIR) both said last week that a British withdrawal from the EU without a deal could threaten future investment and even their presence in the country, putting thousands of British jobs at risk.Uncertainty over Brexit has halved new investment in the British car industry, the country's main car lobby group said on Tuesday. In the May 8-29 survey, UBS asked a range of European firms, 82 percent of which have investments in the UK, how they would react to Brexit.Of the companies, 13 percent said they planned to pull all of their capacity out of Britain, while 31 percent said they would remove a large amount. One-fifth said they would not relocate any capacity, and 5 percent planned to increase UK operations.Uncertainty related to the future of the European Union was top of the companies’ worry list, followed closely by lack of clarity over Brexit and the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. Euro zone countries were the most preferred new destinations for nearly half of respondents, while central and Eastern Europe was preferred by 32 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

223,"Jun 26, 2018 07:11AM ET","As investment stalls, auto industry warns PM May: Avert a Brexit car crash",nan,"By Sarah Young and Guy FaulconbridgeLONDON (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Brexit has halved new investment in the British car industry and Prime Minister Theresa May should urgently change tack to keep the world's fifth largest economy in the EU's customs union, the country's main car lobby group said.Public announcements of fresh investments into new plant, machinery, models and model development fell to 347.3 million pounds ($461.1 million) between January and June 21, down from 647.4 million pounds in the first half of 2017.""There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of (Brexit) negotiations,"" said Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).""Government must rethink its position on the customs union,"" Hawes said, referring to the May's position that Britain will leave the customs union which groups EU members in a duty-free area where there is a common import tariff for non-EU goods.With only nine months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how trade will flow as May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc.In a sign of just how worried big business is getting,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), Airbus (PA:AIR) and BMW (DE:BMWG) have publicly cautioned Britain in the past week that their businesses will be hurt by a disorderly Brexit.When asked about business worries by ambassadors, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was reported by The Daily Telegraph newspaper to have quipped: ""F*** business"". A spokesman disputed that he had used bad language.CLIFF EDGE BREXIT?Under the current timetable, both London and Brussels hope to get a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by Brexit day in March 2019, though few diplomats expect the deal to be struck until months later.The nature of the future relationship with the world's biggest trading bloc remains unclear and there is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal, or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade.That could be highly damaging for an industry which is dependent on the speedy movement of huge numbers of parts across borders. The average car, for example, has about 30,000 parts. BMW's Mini plant in Oxford brings in five million components a day and the company is increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity around how it will be able to do that in future.The car manufacturer's UK boss, Ian Robertson, told Reuters that if Britain tumbled out of the EU without a deal on March 29 there was no longer enough time to put in place the systems to ensure components could keep moving easily across borders.""What we are asking for is negotiations to take place, decisions to be made, clarity to be achieved and then we can plan our business model accordingly,"" Robertson said on the sidelines of the SMMT conference. Even a small increase in paperwork or customs checks after Brexit, for example, could lead to spiraling costs for big manufacturers which depend on vast supply chains that stretch across Europe and the globe.At stake is the future of one of Britain's few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s: a car industry employing over 800,000 people and generating turnover of $110 billion. Much of the industry is owned by foreign companies.The world's biggest carmakers including Toyota (T:7203), BMW and Ford (N:F) have urged Britain to ensure that they can import and export without hindrance after Brexit.One British manufacturer is McLaren Automotive, which produces about 5,000 high-end cars a year. Its chief executive Mike Flewitt said the industry needed to know the shape of the new trading relationship in good time. ""The thing we plea for most is time, is notice,"" Flewitt said. ""If we don’t know what's coming then we just run into a brick wall.""SHORT-TERM PAIN Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain's $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.Around 52 percent of Britain's total $1.1 trillion trade in goods last year was with the EU so May wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible.SMMT chief Hawes said the British government's current position - leaving the EU single market and the customs union - would hurt the industry.""The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

224,"Jun 26, 2018 04:20AM ET",China's regional jet gold rush hits regulatory turbulence,nan,"By Brenda GohSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regional jet market is struggling to get off the ground as Beijing slows approvals for new airlines, industry executives say, dashing hopes that recent policy changes would drive aircraft sales. Foreign companies such as  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), Embraer SA (A:EMBR3) and ATR had cheered a 2016 policy that required passenger carriers to operate at least 25 city-hopper jets before graduating to bigger aircraft.It appeared to all but assure sales of such small planes in the world's fastest-growing aircraft market, currently dominated by wide-body jets, as the regulator tried to boost flights into China's smaller cities.But there is a problem, executives say: the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has only approved two new airlines since the ""Rule 96"" policy went into effect. ""The truth is that almost two years has passed and I have not succeeded in one single deal,"" said one executive from a Chinese aircraft lessor speaking on condition of anonymity, who added that he had met with numerous start-ups to promote regional aircraft.The executives added that although the slowdown was probably well meaning, caused by regulators' concerns over safety and quality, it meant that there was a queue of at least six Chinese airlines waiting for approval. The policy had stoked optimism among regional aircraft makers, as Chinese airlines have for years mostly focused on growing their fleets of Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (NYSE:BA)  Out of 3,311 commercial aircraft flying in China at the end of March, just 5 percent were regional jets, the CAAC said in April. By comparison, regional jets in 2016 took up 30.6 percent of the 7,039-strong fleet of aircraft in the United States, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration.  ""The intention is that (the regulators) want to push, but they have enhanced the entry barriers so they have very high standards for the investors,"" said Wang Qi, chief China representative for French turboprop manufacturer ATR, which is renewing its Chinese certification.  Chinese airlines in general have a good safety record. The CAAC did not respond to requests for comment.  PATIENCE AND FRUSTRATION For many, Rule 96 underlined Beijing's intentions to improve regional air transport. The country's 13th five-year plan for 2016-2020 included 500 new airports. But only Tianjiao Airlines in Inner Mongolia and  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) subsidiary Beijing Airlines, which converted from a private charter operator to a passenger airline, were approved last year.  An executive at Tianju Airlines, which is waiting for the green light to start carrier operations from central China's Shaanxi province, said regulators grew more cautious.  But he said the airline hopes to fly next year, after four years of preparations and at least one change to its proposal to adjust to CAAC policies.  ""We currently fulfill all conditions,"" said the executive, who only gave his surname as Li because he was not authorized to speak to the media. AirAsia Group (KL:AIRA), which is working with local partners to establish a low-cost carrier in China, has looked at options like buying an existing air operator's certification to speed things up, according to two sources familiar with their plans.  The company, which last year signed a memorandum of understanding with China Everbright Group and the Henan government, declined to comment.  OPTIMISM  The only aircraft that meet Rule 96's seat limits of 100 or less and are certified to be sold in China are Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd's [CMAFC.UL] ARJ-21, AVIC Aircraft's (SZ:000768) MA60 turboprop and Bombardier's Q400 and CRJ 900 models. Bombardier and Embraer said they remained optimistic about their prospects in China.  ""The situation under Rule 96 continues to evolve,"" Bombardier Commercial Aircraft's President Fred Cromer said in an interview with Reuters at the company's Montreal-area factory in the Canadian province of Quebec last week.  ""The fact that we have a plane that's well known by the authorities there and an operator that operates quite a few works in our favor,"" he said in reference to Bombardier CRJ 900 operator China Express.  Embraer said in an e-mail that it expects its E175 jet to obtain CAAC certification by September.  But Corrine Png, chief executive of transport consultancy Crucial Perspective, said Chinese airlines were still more inclined to buy larger jets to meet surging travel demand amid a shortage of landing slots and pilots.  ""It would be costly to maintain a small number of regional jets in China which may not be economically efficient from the Chinese airlines standpoint,"" she said. HOMEGROWN COMPETITION Industry insiders are also concerned that Beijing may be promoting China's domestically produced aircraft over more advanced models.  COMAC put the ARJ-21 regional jet into service in 2016 and has delivered just five so far. But it has orders for 450 planes, dwarfing the numbers for Bombardier and Embraer's in China. Tianju Airlines told Reuters it had considered Airbus' A320 and Embraer E190 jets but decided to buy the ARJ-21.  ""We think it's the most suitable model for us,"" said Li, who declined to comment further.  ATR's Wang said the turboprop maker planned to look beyond regional jets and consider general aviation, which Beijing has also pledged to support with infrastructure investment.  Any company can buy an aircraft and begin operating it for charters, for instance. That means ATR could reconfigure its 42-seat model into a 30-seat offering for such businesses, he said. ""That category has very low barriers and there are potential investors for ATR,"" he said.

225,"Jun 25, 2018 04:22PM ET",BMW executive says would shut UK plants if Brexit hits supply chain,nan,"By David Milliken and Edward TaylorLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) would have to close its Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) plants in Britain if Brexit seriously disrupts its supply chain, an executive at the German carmaker told the Financial Times.The warning follows concerns voiced last week by the head of Siemens' (DE:SIEGn) operations in Britain, who told Reuters that the country should stay in the European Union customs union, contrary to the British government's policy.""We always said we can do our best and prepare everything, but if at the end of the day the supply chain will have a stop at the border, then we cannot produce our products in the UK,"" BMW customs manager Stephan Freismuth was quoted as saying.Around 60 percent of the 378,000 Minis made by BMW last year rolled off the production line in Oxford. Its factories in Swindon, Hams Hall and Oxford currently employ around 6,300 workers to make BMW engines and Mini vehicles. Airbus (PA:AIR) has also warned that British jobs would be under threat from a 'no deal' Brexit, drawing criticism from government ministers who said such comments undermined Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating position.BMW's Freismuth added that the company wanted to keep its British plants open and was working on contingency plans, but that any disruption to imports of components would increase costs and damage its 'just in time' manufacturing model.About 90 percent of the parts used in BMW's British factories come from mainland Europe.""If you have a stop for one day, it costs a lot of money, but at the end if there are more stops our management have to decide how this can be sorted,"" he said.A BMW spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to our manufacturing operations in the UK and continue to operate business as usual, as we work through a range of possible Brexit outcomes and their potential impact on our business.""BMW however warned that the lack of clarity surrounding future customs arrangements remains a cause for concern.""As previously stated, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations is not helpful when it comes to making long-term business decisions,"" BMW said. BMW's just-in-time production system requires the free movement of parts and goods. ""Clearly if parts cannot physically get to a factory at the expected time, that factory will not run as smoothly and reliably as is desirable,” BMW said. A spokesman for the British government said it was confident of securing a good deal with the EU that allows for the ""most free and frictionless trade with our European neighbours"".

Macron sent his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to Beijing this weekend partly in a bid to move the negotiations forward.At a joint news conference, Li said China had long been a large customer for Airbus aircraft, and noted their joint manufacturing facility in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. “I explained to Mr Prime minister that in recent years we have bought quite a lot of passenger aircraft, and there needs to be a period to digest this. In spite of this, we are still willing to strengthen cooperation with France’s Airbus,” Li said, adding China planned to buy lots of planes in 2018.“We are willing to continue discussing the issue of buying Airbus aircraft and in due course to sign agreements to buy Airbus aircraft,"" Li added. Philippe said he was glad China had expressed its willingness to soon firm up its purchase commitment.State-controlled China Eastern is seeking 150 single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 or the competing Boeing (N:BA) 737, industry sources have said.

Kang Hwan-seok, a DAPA spokesman, told a media briefing the decision was made after a comprehensive review of legal aspects, cost, schedule and performance.Saab (ST:SAABb) and Airbus (PA:AIR) had also shown interest in meeting the government's needs with the Swordfish and C295 MPA models respectively, but the Boeing contract was ultimately awarded on a ""sole-source"" basis that did not require a competitive tender process.South Korea said in February that it would procure from overseas new maritime patrol aircraft with stronger anti-submarine capabilities in order to better respond to the threat of North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The February decision came before relations between the two Koreas thawed rapidly this year, with United States and South Korea indefinitely suspending two military training exercises, after the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month. Boeing's (N:BA) P-8A Poseidon had been the likely candidate as its features such as its large payload and distance of flight more than clears South Korea's requirements, a military source with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier on Monday on condition of anonymity.Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said it was not a ""bad choice,"" given Poseidon's features.

A report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block more tech exports to Beijing hit Asian stocks overnight and dented early European trading.Europe's tech sector (SX8P), which is mainly composed of hardware firms more sensitive to trade barriers, fell 1.2 percent on the news which could herald higher costs for companies.Chipmakers BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicro (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) were the biggest fallers, down 2.6 to 3.6 percent, while heavyweight software firms SAP and Micro Focus also dropped. The autos sector (SXAP), a key target for Trump who said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent, was the worst hit. It fell 1.4 percent, set for its seventh straight day of losses. Analysts have downgraded their expectations for global autos stocks earnings worldwide as the trade war deepened over the past weeks. Bank stocks (SX7P), highly sensitive to economic turmoil, were the worst-performing with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) bottom of the DAX while HSBC (L:HSBA), Santander (MC:SAN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) led Europe-wide falls.Overall, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) declined 0.7 percent while Germany's exporter- and autos-heavy index fell 0.9 percent. An Ifo survey reading showing that Germany's business morale fell in June added extra pressure on the DAX.Overall investors have grown more risk-averse due to increasing tensions over trade, driving some to reconsider their pro-cyclical positioning. ""We recommend buying into trade-newsflow-driven market weakness as the stronger growth is what should ultimately prevail,"" said JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka. He added however that further trade war escalation could jeopardize his positive position on the DAX, on cyclicals and exporters.Industrials, which need unfettered access to markets, were also selling off. Airbus (PA:AIR), ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) were among biggest drags on the STOXX.Italian cable maker  Prysmian  (MI:PRY) fell 4.3 percent, the biggest loser on the STOXX, at the open after it cut its guidance due to additional expected costs related to issues with its UK WesternLink undersea cable project.Among stand-out gainers, Danish medical equipment maker Ambu (CO:AMBUb) jumped 6.5 percent to the top of the STOXX after JP Morgan started coverage of it with an ""overweight"" rating. Telenet (BR:TNET) also gained 5 percent after starting a 300 million euro share buyback program.British mid-cap workspace group IWG (L:IWG) rose 5.2 percent after confirming it received a possible cash offer from private equity firm Terra Firma and is evaluating it.In small-cap UK stocks, Britain's biggest real estate firm Countrywide (L:CWD) sank 23.4 percent after a profit warning, the latest in a host of UK companies to signal results would be hit by adverse market conditions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) last week issued its strongest warning over the impact of Britain's departure from the European Union, saying a withdrawal without a deal would force it to reconsider its long-term position and put thousands of British jobs at risk.Other European companies with major operations in Britain have also started to speak out two years on from the Brexit vote, voicing concerns over a lack of clarity on the terms of trade when Britain leaves next March.""It was completely inappropriate for businesses to be making these kinds of threats for one very simple reason - we are in an absolutely critical moment in the Brexit discussions and what that means is that we need to get behind (Prime Minister) Theresa May,"" the health minister Jeremy Hunt told the BBC.""The more that we undermine Theresa May the more likely we to end up with a fudge which will be absolute disaster for everyone,"" he added.German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) has warned the company would have to make contingency plans within months if the government did not soon clarify its post-Brexit position and German industrial group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) said it urgently needs clarity on how its operations would have to be organized.The leaders of five major business lobby groups also warned the prime minister over the weekend that the ongoing uncertainty about Brexit could cost the economy billions of pounds.Hunt, a senior figure in the government who is viewed as a potential future prime minister, dismissed ""siren voices"" who say Brexit negotiations are not going well and said people should ignore them.However, Paul Drechsler, the president of leading business lobby group the CBI, said Hunt's criticisms were the ""perfect strategy"" for discouraging investment and would make it harder to increase tax revenue to spend on matters such as healthcare.

""This country needs ministers to be enthusiastic champions of business as found in most other countries."" THE PARTY OF BUSINESS? The ruling Conservatives have traditionally considered themselves the party of business, advocating free markets, lower taxes and political stability.But as Britain's politics become more polarized because of Brexit, many business leaders are feeling alienated by a party that is pushing through policies on trade and immigration that they say will damage their companies.With only nine months until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, little is clear about how trade will flow as May, who is grappling with a divided party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc.Business leaders are increasingly concerned that their concerns are being ignored and are stepping up their contingency plans in case Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.The health minister's comments were later echoed by the international trade minister, Liam Fox, who said Britain's negotiating position was being undermined by companies urging the government to rule out leaving without a deal.""People who are making these comments need to understand that they may be actually putting the UK at a disadvantage by making these cases,"" he told Sky News.The foreign minister Boris Johnson was quoted in the Telegraph newspaper by two sources over the weekend as dismissing business leaders' concerns about the impact of Brexit, using foul language in a meeting with EU diplomats.A spokesperson for the foreign office disputed whether Johnson had used bad language and said he had been attacking business lobbyists.Brexit remains the defining issue in British politics two years after Britons voted by 52-48 percent to leave the bloc.Around 100,000 supporters of the EU marched through central London on Saturday to demand that the government hold a final public vote on the terms of Brexit, organizers said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

232,"Jun 23, 2018 10:28AM ET",Thousands join London march to demand Brexit deal referendum,nan,"By Henry NichollsLONDON (Reuters) - Around 100,000 supporters of the European Union marched through central London on Saturday to demand that the British government hold a final public vote on the terms of Brexit, organizers said.Protesters packed the main arteries of the capital, waving British, Irish and European flags and colorful banners to call for a ""People's Vote"" on the eventual deal in which Britain leaves the world's biggest trading bloc. On the second anniversary of the 52 to 48 percent Brexit vote, polls show political divisions are entrenched. Despite some confusion over what Brexit will actually mean there has been no clear change of heart.The ""People's Vote"" campaign, which includes several pro-EU groups, is campaigning for a public ballot ""so that we can decide if a decision that will affect our lives for generations makes the country better or worse off"". Neither of Britain's two main political parties back the idea of holding a referendum on the final deal.""People have seen politicians making a cataclysmic mess of a really bad deal they didn't vote for, or even a no deal they didn't vote for,"" a spokesman for the campaign told Reuters. ""This is the people telling the political elite that they got it wrong.""One banner read: ""17 million voted for Adolf Hitler. 17 million voted for Brexit. 17 million can be wrong"" and another couple carried a placard which read: ""We are doing this for our grandchildren.""A Survation poll earlier this week found that 48 percent of respondents supported a referendum on the final deal, while 25 percent were opposed.As yet there is no certainty about what the final deal could look like, amid infighting in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative government as well as among some of its opponents about what they want from Britain's new trading ties with the EU after it leaves in March next year.'BOG ROLL BREXIT'Marking the anniversary, Britain's foreign minister Boris Johnson, one of the main proponents of the ""Leave"" vote, wrote a column in tabloid newspaper the Sun defending Brexit.Britain had voted for ""the freedom to bust out of the corsets of EU regulation and rules"" he said, and any softening of the final deal - such as continued membership of the single market and customs union - would be unwelcome.Those who voted for Brexit had not changed their minds, he said. ""They don't want some bog roll Brexit - soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long"" he said, using a British slang term for toilet paper.Johnson was also quoted in the Telegraph newspaper by two sources as dismissing business leaders' concerns about the impact of Brexit, using foul language in a meeting with EU diplomats. A spokesperson for the foreign office disputed whether he had used bad language and said he had been attacking business lobbyists.Speaking on BBC radio, Jurgen Maier, head of German manufacturer Siemens in Britain, said slogans such as ""full British Brexit"" - used by Johnson - were ""incredibly unhelpful"". ""What we need to do now is get closer to our European partners and work out what a realistic, pragmatic Brexit is, which works for both sides,"" he said.On Friday, Airbus (PA:AIR) said that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal it would be forced to reconsider its long-term position and put UK jobs at risk.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It picked Airbus in late March.""I believe it is a good day for Greece with the news coming out of Brussels, but certainly a very good day for Aegean and Airbus,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said at a signing ceremony at Aegean's technical base at Athens airport.Earlier on Friday Greece reached an agreement with euro zone finance ministers, securing debt relief to smooth out its return to market financing after eight years of living mainly on loans from euro zone states.""We begin a new cycle of growth while reducing our operating cost, necessary in a globalised and competitive market,"" said Dimitris Gerogiannis, Aegean's CEO, adding the order was for up to 42 planes, including 10 A321s.Aegean, which flies domestic and international routes, also owns former flag carrier Olympic Airlines, which was privatized in 2013. Most of its current leases need to be replaced between 2019 and 2023. Last year, Aegean grew full-year net earnings by 87 percent on an improved load factor and higher sales, riding a strong tourism year. In 2017 it flew a total of 13.2 million passengers.While the new aircraft will offer 15 percent fuel savings, they are just the hardware, CEO Gerogiannis said. ""It is the quality, culture and efficiency of our people that gives us our competitive advantage,"" he said.Aegean executives said the carrier will also invest 30 million euros ($35 million) to build a new 12,000 square meter facility in Athens for flight and cabin crew training.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

235,"Jun 21, 2018 12:42PM ET",Exclusive: Canada could make it harder for U.S. to win fighter bid - sources,nan,"By David LjunggrenOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is discussing changes to a multibillion-dollar fighter jet procurement process that could make it harder for a U.S. company to win the order as trade relations between the neighbors sour, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said.Canada is considering whether to penalize companies from countries that have caused it economic damage, the sources said on Wednesday. While a final decision is not expected before next year and the threat could be posturing, the move shows how the Trump administration's trade disputes are spilling over into other areas.A spokeswoman for federal Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough - who has overall responsibility for major purchases of military equipment - declined to comment. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential.Boeing Co's (N:BA) F-18 Super Hornet and  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 fighter were among the favorites to capture the contract to supply 88 planes, worth between C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) and C$19 billion.Defense sources have long said the Canadian air force would prefer an American-built jet, citing the importance of operating easily with U.S. armed forces.But a change in procurement terms would give more of a chance to European suppliers: Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which makes the Eurofighter; Saab AB (ST:SAABb), which makes the Gripen; and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), which makes the Rafale.Defense sources, however, say the European jets are likely to become obsolete by around 2040, at which point they could no longer incorporate the latest technologies.Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters, some of which are 40 years old. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.Ottawa has already said bids will be evaluated in part by examining whether firms competing for the order have caused any past economic damage to Canada. Officials said at the time this was aimed at Boeing, which last year launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).Government officials are now discussing whether Canada should also consider economic damage caused by governments, a clear reference to worsening relations with Washington, said the sources.""Politically it's hard to spend billions of dollars on contracts with a country that's hurting you,"" said one of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the extreme sensitivity of the situation.However, the sources emphasized that the discussions are at an early stage and Ottawa could eventually decide to drop the proposed language.Canada - which is due to release the exact specifications for the jets next year - has not yet finished work on the clause referring to economic damage caused by a single firm. U.S. President Donald Trump last month slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, prompting Canada to announce its own retaliatory measures. Trump has also threatened tariffs on Canadian autos, which could badly hurt the economy.Ottawa froze talks with Boeing about the fighter jet contest but after the company's trade challenge against Bombardier failed, Canadian officials made clear the firm would not be discriminated against if it chose to bid.

The A321XLR would carry extra fuel and extend the range of the A321LR aircraft, which recently claimed a long-distance record for single-aisle jets in testing.Asked at the Paris Air Forum if an A321XLR was of interest, CEO Bjorn Kjos replied: ""Definitely, yes. An A321 with a long range is an extremely interesting plane."" U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) is studying plans for what industry sources describe as a hybrid jet combining a wide cabin and a restricted cargo space, shaped to fly efficiently in a space between the industry's single-aisle jets and wide-body long-haul aircraft.Kjos said it was ""a very interesting concept"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sobie said it would have been more attractive for Scoot to add A320s for growth to keep its short-haul fleet all one type, but that would not have solved the problem of the looming 737 deliveries.""Ultimately it is clear that Scoot needs additional capacity to take over more SilkAir routes and the transfer of the 737s was the best solution for the Singapore Airlines Group,"" he said. ""The route transfers should improve the group's profitability and long-term position, outweighing the additional costs associated with Scoot operating two narrowbody families.""Sobie said he expected the first jets would be transferred in late 2018 or early 2019, giving the airline time to remove business class seats from SilkAir jets and to hire pilots.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

238,"Jun 20, 2018 10:48AM ET",Looking for another Nasdaq? Try Europe's aerospace and defense stocks,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - Fat order books covering several years of sales have made European aerospace and defense firms a winning bet as a slowing economy and political instability have clouded prospects for the region's equity market.The sector's stock prices have been hitting record highs, even as investors become more wary of European economic growth falling from its peak and as fears of a global trade war put other big multinational industrial stocks in the crosshairs.For many investment funds, the aerospace and defense sector is more insulated from the economic cycle as it works through a huge backlog of orders and fractious geopolitics spur demand for military equipment. ""Order books are currently very large (and this) gives visibility and makes the group somewhat more resilient from the general economic cycle,"" said Sandrine Perret, strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), International Wealth Management, in Zurich.""It gives the aerospace sector a comparative advantage relative to others that are more sensitive to short-term business fluctuations,"" Perret added.On top of that, while U.S. President Donald Trump's trade protectionism raises uncertainty about future U.S. demand, that could be more than offset for European firms from countries seeking to reorientate trade away from Washington.The European aerospace and defense index  is up 15 percent so far this year, just below the all-time peak touched last week when the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts following four months of largely weaker-than-expected economic data . That has put the sector ahead of others not only in Europe, but also in the United States. The record-breaking Nasdaq (NDX), for example, is lagging with a 13 percent year-to-date gain.A number of stocks in the sector, from plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) to French defense electronics group  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and German engine firm MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn), have been surging from one record to another.""Investors are very happy and companies are delivering,"" said Celine Fornaro, head of European Industrials equity research at UBS in London. ""The sector is long-cycle, less exposed to the volatility of the quarters."" Airbus's commercial order book of more than 7,100 jetliners currently represents a record eight years of anticipated production. And defense companies have once again begun selling more than they deliver, in a sign growth is returning to the sector amid tensions between the West and Russia. For graphic on a winning bet click https://reut.rs/2JQptM1WHAT COULD STOP THE CYCLE? Europe-based companies are also getting a lift from the stronger dollar, which is being underpinned by the U.S. economy's outperformance versus Europe and prospects for more interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Credit Suisse's Perret said European manufacturers sell aircraft and retail parts in dollars, while their production costs are largely in euros.This helps explain why the European aero-defense stocks are on track to outperform their U.S. peers this year, although she said the currency tailwind may be short-lived.""We foresee the euro rebounding against the dollar over the next three months."" said Perret. Nevertheless, Europe's aero-defense index is on track to beat its U.S. equivalent  for the first time since 2015. The U.S. index, which tracks companies such as Airbus rival Boeing (N:BA) and security firm  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), is up 3 percent so far in 2018, one fifth of the European rise.Overall, analysts and investors remain upbeat about prospects for the industry and broker sentiment over stocks such as Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and  Cobham  (L:COB), which have lagged the sector, has improved.Several analysts lifted their share price targets for Rolls-Royce on Monday after the UK engineer, which has been in turnaround mode since 2015, announced new mid-term goals.Cobham shares shot up on the same day after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock, citing the company's turnaround and the start of ""multi-year upcycles ... in core defense and aerospace markets"". According to research firm Forecast International, European defense spending is seen rising by more than 3 percent a year to $277 billion in 2022, as NATO countries in Europe are under pressure from Washington to increase spending. Trade body IATA, meanwhile, sees air passenger numbers doubling to 7.8 billion in 2036. UBS's Fornaro sums up the mood. ""We're very upbeat because more people fly and in more countries. Nothing is really new in this industry but it's hard to say what could stop the cycle,"" she said.""Past cycles were brought to an end by unpredictable events: the 9/11 attacks and the SARS outbreak in 2008,"" she added.

239,"Jun 20, 2018 08:38AM ET","After surrendering CSeries, Bombardier pushes regional plane revival",nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - As Bombardier (TO:BBDb) surrenders hopes of securing a top spot in commercial aviation with the sale of its money-losing CSeries jet program to Airbus (PA:AIR), the Canadian company is now drawing up plans to breathe new life into its older regional planes.Bombardier is shoring up its loss-making regional jets and turboprops with a mixture of hard-sell, cost-cutting and outsourcing. It is also growing its line of business jets after a cash squeeze and production delays forced it to cede a majority stake in its high-tech CSeries which aims to break into the market for mainline jets dominated by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA). The company will now ""sharpen the focus"" on its remaining commercial planes, with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer recently expanding the leadership team for the division which has combined orders in hand for just for over 100 planes, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.Bombardier also plans to showcase its CRJ regional jets, which recently had a cabin upgrade with more overhead bin space to appeal to business travelers, at the industry's flagship Farnborough Air Show in July, an event it previously used to market the CSeries, two sources familiar with the company's thinking said. The company's regional jet initiative won a boost from Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), which on Wednesday announced orders for 20 CRJ 900s with the new interiors, valued at around $961 million by list prices, as it and other U.S. carriers replace aging 50 and 70-seat planes with new regional jets. According to the memo and sources familiar with the situation, the company is now moving forward with a plan to lower its regional Q400 turboprop's costs by outsourcing its wings and cockpit from Toronto to lower cost countries, although specific locations were not named. In 2016, Bombardier expected to move the cockpit to China and the wings to Mexico with the union's agreement, but Bombardier failed to carry it out because the program's volumes were previously too low, both sources said.Bombardier said in the memo it also aims to reap more profits by promoting aftermarket services for its over 2,000 regional planes already in the air, which is part of a broader strategy the company is using for its business jets. In a sign that Bombardier will push harder on servicing existing planes, the company plans to hire a separate executive to head customer service for its regional planes, a position currently filled by the same person who heads the Q400 program, the second source said.All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Bombardier's private strategies.HEADWINDSFor Bombardier, the challenge is to erase losses and generating $1.5 billion in revenues by 2020. But the turnaround strategy faces headwinds.Bombardier's efforts to revive regional plane sales, which it sees as a $240 billion market between 2017 and 2036, come as some forecasters are expecting limited near-term sector growth.""Demand for regional aircraft will remain weak relative to large commercial aircraft,"" said Moody's in a recent note. It predicted that regional aircraft deliveries, including the CSeries, would grow by over 4 percent in 12-to-18 months, compared with an 8-to-10 percent rise in larger aircraft. The 110-130-seat CSeries overlap regional and mainline passenger jet markets.Bombardier is also tasked with winning orders for its regional Q400 turboprop, which sources say the company considered selling. The plane holds barely a quarter of a market that is dominated by ATR, a prop-making joint venture between Airbus and Italian group Leonardo. Such a disparity in sales can turn into a nightmare for the losing planemaker as its adversary benefits from higher volumes to bring down unit costs, which in turn help it sell more.Bombardier's Cromer has appointed an executive to pursue its plan to outsource the Q400's cockpit and wings from Toronto, which would make the prop more competitive with lower-cost ATR, the memo said. ""We've got a backlog now so that allows us to evaluate all the outsourcing possibilities,"" the source said.The Q400 will continue to be produced at a plant in Canada's largest city Toronto, which was recently sold by Bombardier but remains under lease for 3 to 5 years, until a new site can be located.Bombardier said in a statement that is ""constantly looking at strategic options for all our businesses.""The company will also step up marketing campaigns in India and Africa, aiming to persuade airlines to pick the longer-range Q400s to connect cities with secondary destinations which either do not have service or are served by jets that have higher operating costs. India has emerged as a fast-growing market for turboprops, benefiting both ATR and Bombardier, which won its largest single order to date for the planes last year from Indian low cost carrier SpiceJet.Promoting the Q400 for underserved markets in Africa also helped win a recent order from Ethiopian Airlines..But the African market also has risks, with Angola's president recently telling Euronews that a domestic airline startup was a ""fictitious company,"" casting doubt on its order of 6 Q400s.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to some of the carmakers that Trump has explicitly targeted in his tariffs rhetoric, fell the most, down 1.2 percent. BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 0.8 to 2.4 percent. The STOXX 600 autos sector (SXAP) hit a seven-month low.""The automotive sector is one of the main sectors that could potentially be impacted by import tariffs,"" said Weidenbach, adding that the impact on different German carmakers may depend on how much of their production is U.S.-based.Europe's companies in general are more exposed to the global economy than their U.S. counterparts, making them more vulnerable to countries imposing higher tariffs on goods. Some 18 percent of European company revenues comes from North America and 9 percent from China. Thirty-two percent is derived from emerging markets.U.S. companies get just 4 percent of their revenues from China and 10 percent from Europe, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Multinational sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell 2.5 percent, as the fear of an end to unfettered access to global markets also bruised luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS), LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Moncler (MI:MONC).Industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX, along with French planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). Mining shares (SXPP) tumbled 2.4 percent, tracking a decline in London copper prices amid the escalating trade tensions.Highly valued tech stocks were also selling off as investors shed the sectors that have led the strong equity rally. The tech sector (SX8P) fell 1.4 percent, having hit a 17-year high as recently as Friday.The most impressive falls were in the UK retail and housing sectors.  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares plummeted 10 percent after the British department store warned on profits for the third time in six months, blaming its poor trading on increased competitor discounting and weakness in its key markets.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

French officials cautioned there were no signs of an imminent airplane deal.State-controlled China Eastern is seeking 150 single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 or the competing Boeing (N:BA) 737, industry sources said.China's ICBC Financial Leasing has also expressed interest in placing an Airbus aircraft order, the sources said. The fate of a landmark Chinese order for 180 Airbus jets was left uncertain in January when French President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly failed to clinch the order during a Beijing visit. China often marks such visits with industrial deals.A person familiar with the January negotiations said they had been complicated by the fallout from comments published by French and German envoys over the 1937 Nanking Massacre, in which China says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people.In an op-ed piece in the Financial Times in December, French and German ambassadors to China cited the political, economic and social dividends of post-war reconciliation between France and Germany and drew a thinly veiled comparison with China.""Will it be possible to transfer the experiences of Europe to Asia? We cannot answer this question. But it is important to us to share our own experiences in the context with the anniversary of the beginning of the Nanjing massacre.""Two people familiar with the matter said Chinese officials reacted coolly to the piece, deeming it unwarranted foreign advice on a painful episode in China's history.The first person familiar with the talks said this had slowed preparations for Macron's visit, meaning that the necessary advance work for a plane sale and other deals had not been completed in time.A French diplomatic source acknowledged that the article triggered a negative reaction but said there was no evidence that it was linked to the outcome of the plane talks.Macron's office and Airbus declined comment. German officials were not immediately available. The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Separately Hainan Airlines has emerged as the buyer in a deal for 15 A350 passenger jets, industry sources said. Airbus disclosed the order without identifying the buyer this month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

242,"Jun 18, 2018 08:26AM ET",Exclusive: Airbus weighs new long-range A321 version in Boeing challenge,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is considering adding extra endurance to the longest-range version of its A321 passenger jet in a further effort to pre-empt a potential new mid-market jet being studied by U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA), industry sources said.A new version called the A321XLR is the latest study on the drawing board in a battle of wits as both jetmakers battle for supremacy in the 200-270-seat segment, valued by analysts at hundreds of billion of dollars over 20 years.The proposed new A321XLR would carry extra fuel and expand the range of the A321LR aircraft, which recently claimed a long-distance record for single-aisle jets in testing, the sources said, asking not to be named as the idea remains confidential.It is expected to be aimed at North American carriers, whose ordering decisions could be decisive as Boeing weighs up whether to go ahead with plans for a new 'middle-of-the-market' aircraft.""We do not comment on our product policy,"" an Airbus spokesman said.Noting that Airbus had 80 percent of sales in the A321 category, the spokesman added, ""We are under no pressure"".Airbus has been heavily outselling Boeing in the lower end of the 200-270-seat segment with the single-aisle A321, while Boeing has been dominating at the upper end with strong sales of the 787 Dreamliner at the expense of the Airbus A330neo.This is the space into which Boeing proposes launching its 220-270 seat mid-market jet, a hybrid with the twin-aisle cabin of a wide-body jet but the smaller cargo space of a single-aisle plane thanks to a novel shape designed to fly more efficiently.Airbus has been toying with several proposals to extend the A321's advantage and try to limit the impact of Boeing's new plane or even prompt its rival to abandon the idea.Airbus says the A321LR, due to enter service this year, will have a maximum range of to 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 km). Boeing says the 737 MAX 10, the largest member of its competing 737 family, has a range of 3,300 nm.JUGGLING RISKSIn a surprise move, Airbus previously halted work on a study dubbed A320neo-plus, Reuters reported in April.The advanced blueprint would have featured increased fuel capacity, a longer fuselage and improvements to the A321's wing.A longer-term project, code-named A320neo-plus-plus,"" with an all-new carbon-fibre wing, has also been put to one side.By halting the studies, Airbus aims to force Boeing to show its hand on the middle-market segment before risking its own capital with a response, people familiar with the decision said.But others say doing nothing is not without risk since failing to defend the profitable A321 could encourage Boeing to launch its newer jet. ""If you do it, you have to move quickly,"" an industry source said, referring to plans to improve the A321.The A321XLR - with more fuel capacity but no extra seats or aerodynamic redesign - is a compromise bet that Airbus hopes will fend off Boeing for the smallest upfront investment.In an interview last week, Boeing's sales chief said it would take the time needed to decide whether to launch its new jet, rejecting suggestions that it is dragging its feet.""We are doing our due diligence,"" senior vice-president Ihssane Mounir told Reuters.The jet is widely expected to be developed in two versions.Boeing is looking at a product that is ""a little bigger than an A321 but goes a lot further"" and ""about the size of the A330 but has a lot better efficiency,"" he said. Speaking to Reuters earlier this month, Airbus President Guillaume Faury deflected questions about A321 revamp plans.""Airbus like any company has different options and is looking at the future,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

243,"Jun 15, 2018 12:50PM ET",Boeing creates one-stop shop for jets and services in Airbus battle,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) has reorganized its sales operations as part of a push into services that has helped it take a lead over rival jet maker Airbus (PA:AIR) this year. Boeing set up a standalone division in 2017 to build a $50 billion business in services for civil and defense aircraft. These can include repairs, crew rostering, parts and even wind forecasts. It previously offered only limited services. Now sales of jetliner services have been brought under the same umbrella as plane sales, headed by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, Boeing Co's overall commercial sales chief.The previously unreported move, which started late last year, is designed to increase the number of deals and boost profits as it will make it easier for Boeing to sell high-margin services at the same time as it sells planes. The change comes as airlines try to keep a lid on costs by planning jet purchases and long-term operations together. ""We approach the campaigns in a much more comprehensive way than we have ever done before,"" said Mounir, whose role was expanded to include responsibility for jetliner-related services across the group.""So the price and inherent capability of the airplane are just one thing that we are bringing to the table. I'm not going to go beyond that, or I will be divulging the secret sauce.""Airbus and Boeing dominate the jet market, worth $5 trillion over 20 years. Airbus is also developing services but has not brought sales together yet - though it may do so in future.Boeing officials say recent sales wins for Boeing's 787 plane over Airbus' A330neo have involved ""multiple plays"" of which coupling jets and services can be one element.[nL5N1QO6BP] Mounir's 600-strong sales team has won orders for 376 planes, or 70 percent of new commercial jet orders this year. Airbus has the rest of the main market with 161 planes. Analysts say success for the 787 and a potential new mid-market Boeing jet depends in part on clipping the wings of the latest version of Airbus' older competitor, the A330.European industry sources say Boeing slashed 787 prices to ""kill"" the A330.Mounir, 46, who was promoted to one of the industry's most daunting jobs in October 2016, denied this.""It has not been a price game (or) a price strategy,"" Mounir said when asked about the claim, adding multiple factors including improved reliability had boosted the 787.""I am not out to kill anything; I am out to serve our customers ... I don’t wake up one day and say I am going to go and kill that product.""Though Mounir will oversee certain services sales, income will still be reported under the Boeing Global Services unit. DOUBLE-ACTBoeing has also sharpened its sales offensive by deploying both Mounir and Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister, a former  General Electric  (N:GE) executive steeped in analytics.The double-act attended a Sydney airline gathering last week and held back-to back meetings with airlines and lessors. Their Airbus counterparts appeared a less comfortable tandem, several delegates said.""Between the two of us we are at the forefront of the battle...but in the backshop we have people who are really good,"" said Mounir, speaking in his first in-depth interview since taking charge of Boeing jet sales.Born in Morocco, Mounir left for the United States at 17 and studied and taught aerospace engineering in Kansas before joining Boeing as an aerodynamicist.Analysts say one of Mounir's challenges is to keep the smaller single-aisle 737 thriving as a main source of profits. Airbus leads that crucial segment with the hot-selling A321neo.Boeing launched the 737 MAX 10 at last year's Paris Airshow to catch up. Around half the initial sales came at the expense of existing 737 variants, however.Mounir said the 737 sales were on track and deflected questions about whether Boeing was ready to increase output.Analysts say both companies could unveil new deals with airlines at the Farnborough Airshow in July.""If our customers want to do something for the air show, we’ll do something special with them, have fun with them...But we are having a good year; I like where we are,"" Mounir said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

244,"Jun 15, 2018 06:20AM ET",Airbus warns governments not to interfere in European fighter program,nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European efforts to develop a next-generation military combat jet will end in disaster if individual governments insist on dictating specific suppliers or sites, the chief executive of European aerospace firm Airbus (PA:AIR) warned on Friday.Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that a decision by Germany and France to develop a new ""Future Combat Air System"" was an important step toward expanding European defense cooperation.He said Airbus and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) had come to agreement surprisingly quickly on their respective roles in the fighter jet project, but warned governments against trying to influence the process. ""It will be a success if we don't let governments interfere with their demands for the use of specific suppliers and locations in certain countries. That will only lead to disaster,"" Enders told the newspaper.Similar issues have cost Airbus dearly, said Enders, who has often criticized the way the multi-nation A400M military transport plane program was structured when it began. Airbus took a further 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) charge on the troubled program in February.""I hope that European companies will insist that future multilateral programs have clear leadership structures and reasonable technical requirements and timetables,"" he told the newspaper.Airbus, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon, and Dassault, which builds the Rafale jet, signed an initial agreement in April to cooperate on the new air combat system, with an eye to replacing current fighter jets by around 2035-2040.Enders also called for Germany to move forward more boldly on closer European defense integration, citing concerns about what he called the ""deplorable"" state of the German military after years of neglect.One key step would be to introduce majority-rule decisions in European foreign policy, replacing the current requirement for unanimous decisions, Enders said.""Europe can only safeguard its interests if it is unified. It's burning all around us,"" the Airbus executive said, citing escalating tensions with the United States, difficult ties with China and Russia, and increasing tensions within the EU itself.He urged EU officials and member countries to focus less on EU budget debates and more on strengthening security, securing Europe's borders and moving forward on a joint foreign and defense policy.The EU also needed to look at tax cuts pushed through by U.S. President Donald Trump that were providing a big incentive for companies to invest there, he said.""If we in Europe continue to have high government spending and thereby high taxes, we will fall behind,"" he said. ""The low tax rates and the threatened protectionism are a strong incentive to invest more there.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

From our perspective we invested in order to see the business grow internationally. If you look at the results of Indian airlines their performance is better internationally.""Promotions such as $50 one-way tickets on the two-hour flight from Mumbai to Delhi are easy to find and, with airlines expected to take delivery of more than 500 aircraft over the next five years, pressure on fares and profits is increasing.India is one of the cheapest domestic airline markets in the world, with an average fare of 13 cents per kilometer flown, according to data from travel firm Rome2Rio, less than half the 27 cents per km average in China and the United States.Airlines including Vistara, SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) and InterGlobe Aviation Ltd's (NS:INGL) IndiGo are in talks to buy or lease widebody aircraft as they firm up international growth plans to boost profitability. For graphic on India aviation market growing at more than 20 percent click https://tmsnrt.rs/2L3pSqxINTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIESThere is huge potential for international travel from India, where the domestic aviation market has grown about 20 percent annually in recent years. Only 0.3 percent of the 1.3 billion population currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million Indians who could potentially afford to do so, according to an analysis of household income by aviation consultancy, CAPA.The international market is dominated by foreign carriers but the market share of Indian airlines including Air India and Jet Airways (NS:JET) has been climbing, helped by policies that limit access by foreign carriers, and reached about 38 percent in 2017, up from 31 percent a decade earlier. Foreign airlines such as Emirates and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) have reached the limit of flights into India allowed under bilateral agreements and New Delhi has not extended additional rights, creating an opening for domestic carriers to grow, said Binit Somaia, director for South Asia at CAPA.""Demand is there, income levels are rising and people want to travel internationally,"" he said.Jet Airways is considering launching new flights from Mumbai to Sydney, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, while Vistara is planning to order six  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 aircraft and will expand its narrowbody fleet of Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neos as it starts international flights, sources have said. A Jet Airways spokesman said the airline ""continuously reviews its fleet and network plan ... to realize greater synergy with its business strategy.""DOMESTIC COMPETITIONIn the domestic market, which provides crucial connections for international flights, airlines have been jockeying for position at a time when one-time leader Air India has been losing market share to rivals with far lower costs, such as IndiGo.The Indian government last month failed to attract a single bidder by the deadline for its 76 percent stake sale in the loss-making national carrier. Revenue per available seat kilometer, a measure combining airfares and seats filled, has been falling at Indian airlines due to stiff competition at a time when the oil price has risen nearly 50 percent in the last year.For graphic on revenue per available seat kilometer vs oil prices click https://tmsnrt.rs/2y3dci5IndiGo last month reported a steep fall in quarterly profit due to higher fuel prices and continued pressure on yields, a proxy for airfares.IndiGo has lifted the proportion of its capacity dedicated to international flights to 15 percent, from 11 percent, in the last year and is seeking regulatory approvals needed to operate long-haul flights, Rahul Bhatia, the company's chairman, said during an analyst call.SpiceJet and IndiGo are the only two listed Indian airlines to post a profit for the last 13 quarters consecutively.Analysts say SpiceJet has achieved this by maximizing its aircraft utilization and also flying less competitive routes where it can have a better control over fares, helping protect yields. Even so, it plans to expand its international flights as it starts taking delivery of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from August. The planes, which have a range of six hours and can reach destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok, will mainly be deployed on international routes. Infrastructure constraints at major Indian airports like Mumbai and Delhi, where daytime slots are hard to get, also make going international a better option as airlines can utilize night-time slots, a SpiceJet official told Reuters.

251,"Jun 08, 2018 10:30AM ET",Airbus clinches final deal to rescue Bombardier CSeries,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Rama Venkat Raman(Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) has finalized a rescue deal for Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jet and is expected to flex its marketing and cost-cutting muscle to revive the loss-making Canadian venture.Bombardier agreed in October to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its flagship commercial jet for a symbolic Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales and low production rates prevented it from keeping a lid on costs. Airbus, by contrast, will be able to offer airlines deals by packaging the CSeries with its own jets in a challenge to Boeing (N:BA) and is expected to use its industrial power to slash the price of parts, along with improving efficiencies internally.After winning regulatory approvals and agreeing the deal's fine-print in Montreal late on Thursday, the two companies said they were ready to start the new tie-up formally from July 1.They confirmed outlines of a historic shift in the aircraft industry agreed in October, with Bombardier abandoning its standalone bid to enter the main jet market dominated by Airbus and Boeing, in exchange for a stake in a stronger project.Bombardier will retain 31 percent and Investissement Quebec, run by the province of Quebec, will hold 19 percent.Announcing federal government approval, Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Airbus had committed to maintaining Mirabel outside Montreal as the primary CSeries industrial site, where more than 2,000 Quebec aerospace workers rely on the jet.Airbus also plans to expand its Mobile, Alabama, assembly plant to include a new line capable of handling four CSeries a month for the U.S. market. It said work would begin next year.The first priority will be to secure plans for production increases that include a doubling of deliveries this year. Aerospace supply chains are tight because of high jet demand.""We will be very focused on having a robust ramp-up and a steep ramp-up in the future years,"" Philippe Balducchi, head of the new CSeries partnership, told reporters.Bombardier will continue for the time being to fund the investments needed to support the production increase up to certain agreed financial levels, beyond which any cash shortfalls will be shared by the main partners.""Looking forward, I'm very confident that CSeries is going to contribute positively to the cash generation of Airbus in the future,"" said Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm.BOMBARDIER UPDATES GUIDANCEClosing the deal allows Bombardier to shed CSeries losses, while Airbus is betting that its ability to negotiate cuts in the cost of parts will help to put the program in the black.Bombardier raised its guidance for 2018 consolidated earnings before interest and tax by $100 million to a range of between $900 million and $1 billion, to reflect the separation of the loss-making CSeries.Bombardier also said it was cutting its revenue target by $500 million to $16.5-17 billion. The CSeries will no longer be consolidated in its results from July 1. The deal was first announced at a time when Bombardier was locked in a trade dispute with U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA). That dispute ended in March when Boeing said it would not appeal a ruling that overturned plans to impose hefty duties on the CSeries in the United States.Boeing is now holding its own tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).The closing coincided with the opening of a G7 summit at which Europe and Canada are expected to take a common stand against the United States on trade, but company officials denied any link between current those tensions and the plane tie-up.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

252,"Jun 06, 2018 03:40AM ET",Air Baltic's hurry for Bombardier CSeries deal foreshadows jet selling spree,nan,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Latvia-based AirBaltic hastened a deal for Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries planes before Airbus formally takes over the Canadian planemaker because it was worried about securing the right delivery slots, the carrier's chief executive said on Wednesday. Airbus (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier's troubled CSeries jetliner program in October last year after the high-tech plane failed to win enough buyers.While the Airbus backing gives the CSeries financial stability, most industry sources have said potential customers are waiting for the deal to close before placing orders.But Air Baltic's move to buck the trend suggests some assume Airbus will speed up sales once the deal closes.""We could have waited, but we were of the opinion that we better buy them now to secure these (delivery) positions, not to risk that after the takeover somebody else takes (them),"" Martin Gauss told Reuters at a CAPA-Centre for Aviation conference.""That was, for us, the rationale to say, 'Let's close it now,' because we need the first two aircraft at the end of 2019."" Air Baltic's firm order for 30 CS300 aircraft, announced last week, is part of a strategy to move to a harmonized fleet and boost traffic and revenue by 2025. The order included options for a further 30 aircraft, potentially taking the fleet to 80 jets by 2025.""If Airbus sells more in the future then they would have maybe wanted to sell the slots which we have now secured for ourselves,"" Gauss added, referring to the expected pick-up in orders once the takeover is completed.One issue for the CSeries' second largest customer is that Air Baltic doesn't know what the plane will be called after the takeover. Industry sources say Airbus is considering renaming it the A200, although a decision has not been reached. ""I have no idea what our aircraft will be called next week. They said they will send stickers to Riga,"" Gauss told CAPA delegates.The carrier mainly flies Bombardier Q400 turboprop planes and Gauss said that on routes such Riga to Brussels, operating costs are 57 percent lower with the C Series, as it can carry more passengers, fly faster and has more efficient engines. Air Baltic has not yet decided how to finance the planes.""As it is now, it will be a mixture of financed aircraft on the balance sheet and sale-and-leaseback,"" he said. ""We will decide as we go along.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

253,"Jun 06, 2018 02:21AM ET","In Cambodia, stalled Chinese casino resort embodies Silk Road secrecy, risks",nan,"By Brenda Goh and Prak Chan ThulBOTUM SAKOR, Cambodia (Reuters) - The Dara Sakor Seashore Resort seems a long way off the new Silk Road that China is building to connect Asia with Europe.A five-hour drive from Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, Dara Sakor was once touted by the Chinese company building it as a city-sized casino resort for ""extravagant feasting and revelry"".Today, it is a sprawl of mostly empty hotel buildings, deserted beach bars and the unfinished shell of a casino on a remote part of the Cambodian coast. Beyond the resort, the dusty foundations of a planned investment zone stretch down to a container port - both unfinished and idle.Despite its troubles, the resort and surrounding development has been lauded as a champion of China's Belt and Road initiative, as the new Silk Road is officially known.But the embrace of developments like Dara Sakor, whose operations are opaque and economically unclear, seems to run counter to Chinese pledges that Belt and Road projects will be open, transparent and environmentally friendly.Work began on the project in 2008 after Cambodia leased 45,000 hectares in a national park to China's Tianjin Union Development Group (UDG) for 99 years. That was long before the Belt and Road initiative was launched in 2013 by China's President Xi Jinping and gained steam with a summit he hosted in Beijing in 2017.Little information about the project and its progress is available, and it is unclear how much money has been spent on it, and which parties have benefited.The project has also resulted in extensive environmental damage as forest was cleared for construction sites, and the displacement of thousands of people, according to villagers and non-governmental groups. They say they have seen little work on the project over the past three years.UDG didn't respond to requests for comment, nor did Cambodia's environment ministry, which oversees the project for the central government.BELT AND ROAD BONDDara Sakor appears to have been adopted as a Belt and Road project around 2017. That May, the China Development Bank (CDB), told the People's Daily newspaper that it had underwritten a 100 million yuan ($15 million) ""Belt and Road"" bond  to support UDG's building of a holiday resort on Cambodia's coast. It didn't mention Dara Sakor by name.The project was also included in a 2017 Belt and Road yearbook published by an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, which called it the Cambodia-China Investment and Development Zone and described it as ""the biggest project of the Belt and Road initiative so far"".The yearbook's editor, Zhang Gaoping, said the guide had included projects chosen by the ""leading group"" that Beijing set up in 2015 to manage the initiative.However, China's National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees the leading group, said in an e-mail that it had yet to certify any Belt and Road projects.""We recommend that companies publish as much information as possible before projects are launched, and also provide known information to the public,"" it said.CDB said in an email that it had financed infrastructure such as roads, water supply and power stations. It also said the two governments agreed to cooperate on the project during a visit to Cambodia by Xi in October 2016.While tourism is often cited in Belt and Road projects, the initiative is primarily related to infrastructure that supports the development of trade routes.However, unrelated projects are being pitched with the Belt and Road label to smooth approvals and get access to funding, Belt and Road analysts and industry executives say. Jonathan Hillman, a fellow with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said a lack of quality control posed reputational risks for China. ""This has the potential to undermine the Belt and Road coherence and its ability to achieve the goals that Chinese officials actually talk about,"" said Hillman, who runs a database tracking Asian infrastructure projects.$3.8 BILLION INVESTMENT According to registration records, UDG is a subsidiary of Tianjin Wanlong Group, a Chinese property developer, and was established in 1994.UDG planned to invest $3.8 billion in the project, which also includes an airport, according to a 2013 report commissioned by Cambodia's environment ministry.UDG was to spend $45 million on the port and $76 million to build almost 110 kilometers (70 miles) of roads, according to the report, compiled by the Cambodia-based Sawac Consultants for Development. The company would also spend $1.1 million for tree-planting and environmental protection.The Phnom Penh Post quoted UDG as saying in 2014 that about $10 million had been allocated for relocation and compensation expenses for villagers.Over 1,000 families have likely been affected by the project and UDG is locked in multiple land disputes, according to rights groups and local media. In March, the Cambodian government told the environment ministry to give some of the UDG-claimed land back to villagers.Some are still protesting for more compensation, saying that UDG did not give them what they promised.UNFINISHED, FEW TOURISTSIt is unclear how much money has been spent on the project so far. UDG does not publish financial reports.""They don't give out a lot of information,"" said Soeng Sen Karuna, an investigator for Adhoc, a Cambodian group advocating for displaced villagers.On a recent visit by Reuters, access to the port, which the Sawac report said would be able to handle up to four 20,000-tonne container ships, was blocked by a Cambodian military officer. Viewed from a speedboat, parts of the port – which UDG had told local media would begin operating in 2015 - appeared unfinished. Pou Nor, a local boatman, said he hadn't seen ships dock or workers at the site in three years. Sometimes, soldiers would allow villagers to fish from the dock, he said. Work on the airport, however, was underway. UDG's website predicts that the airport will be completed in 2020. Zhou Jianning, a UDG employee who was overseeing construction, said the firm was building a 3.2 kilometer-long runway, which would be large enough for Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 planes.At the resort, a large neo-classical building, which employees said was meant to house a hotel and casino, lay unfinished amid concrete dust and broken tiles. A pool outside had no water. Across the road was a 102-room hotel and two completed 18-hole golf courses. Employees said the hotel, which opened in 2015, was focused on hosting prospective investors. ""We only cater to VIPs,"" said the manager of one of the beach bars. ""You have to be the boss' friend."" OPENNESS, SECRETS Reuters was unable to verify statements UDG made on its website about investments from other Chinese companies in the investment zone or find evidence of their presence there.Last year, UDG said it had signed agreements with Tai'an Jintai International Park Development & Management and Jilin Agricultural Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone to develop business parks that would host industries such as machinery manufacturing as well as juice and cashew processing.It said the first batch of enterprises would enter the resort in July 2017.Tai'an Jintai didn't respond to calls for comment while Reuters was unable to reach the Jilin trade zone.One resort building has been turned into a showroom with a model of the project, its walls decorated with pictures of visits by Cambodian officials. One showed former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli attending the 2008 land transfer ceremony while he was the mayor of Tianjin. Zhang was appointed to head the Belt and Road leading group in 2015.Mithona Phouthorng, the governor of Koh Kong province, where the project is located, said she didn't know which companies would be investing in the zone but that business and jobs would eventually be created there.""They have their plan but I don't remember all of it.""(Additional Reporting by SHANGHAI Newsroom; Editing by Philip McClellan)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It also has a partnership with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) to make LEAP-1B engines for Boeing's 737 MAX.Boeing has been riding on strong demand for commercial jets, selling a record number of jets in 2017.

The group represents most of the world's main airlines""We always get concerned when you start to see tensions elevate around global trade and free trade,""  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker said. American has not seen any effect yet on revenues, he said. The uncertainty could curb demand for the business travel, a key driver of profits for the airline industry, Gloria Guevara Manzo, chief executive of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).""(Business travelers) need to wait and see what happens – will their business be impacted, do they need to diversify, go some other places. War in trade is not good,"" she said.Planemakers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) echoed that the uncertainty was bad for business and said free trade helped to drive economic growth, creating jobs. Airbus said the aviation industry existed because people could travel freely and markets were open. ""We are in a worldwide industry here,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz told reporters. ""We see it in a negative way because it is putting borders and putting constraints for everybody, including our customers.""Tariffs would not have a material impact on Boeing's results, Randy Tinseth, the company's marketing vice president for commercial airplanes told Reuters.""For example, I think 90 percent of the aluminum we acquire comes domestically,"" he said. Airbus' Schulz said it was too early to say what the direct financial impact on the European company might be.Guevara Manzo also said the WTTC was concerned about tariffs because they meant less money to invest in infrastructure, such as ports, airports and hotels. ""Steel for hotels is like flour for bakeries,"" she said. The annual IATA meeting brings together about 130 CEOs and 1,000 delegates. This year in Sydney, concerns that a three-year run of unusually high returns might end as fuel, labor and infrastructure costs rise are in the spotlight.""The more you restrict trade, or migration, or travel, the less prosperity you get for this industry,"" de Juniac added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Still, we know it will be challenging,"" Airbus Commercial Aircraft President Guillaume Faury said in an interview for internal circulation seen by Reuters.""Delivering 80 to 90 aircraft every month in the second half of the year has never been done before. In the long term we must overhaul a single-aisle production system that belongs to a bygone age when high-rate production of aircraft wasn't needed.""Airbus has been hit by delays in getting engines from United Technologies (N:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, co-owned by  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE).It delivered 172 aircraft in the first four months of the year, lagging behind the pace needed to hit a full-year goal of 800 even though deliveries traditionally speed up in the final quarter.Faury was speaking to mark 100 days since taking over the European group's planemaking division from Fabrice Bregier.Echoing his predecessor, former auto executive Faury signaled a push to exploit digital techniques as Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) shift towards mass production of jet aircraft that are far ahead of standards previously seen in commercial aerospace.""Ultimately, we want to move to a position where our aircraft and the manufacturing system are designed as one,"" he said. Boeing is pioneering a new digital-based manufacturing system for a potential new mid-market jet, which could later be adapted to an eventual successor to the 737, its best-selling single-aisle model. Airbus is however expected to make the leap to the next generation in one step, starting from around 2030.In a separate interview with French newspaper Les Echos, Faury said no decision had been taken on whether to increase production of the single-aisle A320 to 70 jets a month, compared with the current level of 50 and a target of 60 set for 2019.Such levels of production are justified by strong demand from airlines, but Airbus is still studying whether its supply chain is strong enough, Faury said. Any step-up in production beyond 60 would happen at the start of the next decade, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

257,"May 30, 2018 07:40AM ET","Aerospace group Safran sticks to LEAP engine targets, no 'bad surprises' at Zodiac",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - French aerospace firm  Safran  (PA:SAF) is sticking to production targets for the LEAP jet engine, but is still unwilling to back proposals for higher output from Airbus and Boeing until it is convinced its own suppliers can keep up, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Safran co-owns the world's largest jet engine supplier, based on the number of units produced, along with  General Electric  (N:GE) and their plans for a record hike in output of LEAP are 4-6 weeks behind schedule.""I want to be virtually certain about the robustness of the supply chain before committing to higher production,"" Philippe Petitcolin said.CFM International, the joint venture that makes LEAP engines, aims to deliver around 1,100 of the engines this year, followed by 1,800 next year and hitting the 2,000 mark in 2020.Its factories are currently churning out 12 LEAP engines a week for the Airbus A320 family and 14 a week for the Boeing 737. By the end of the year it aims to raise the weekly rate by two engines for Airbus (PA:AIR) and 4-6 for Boeing (N:BA), Petitcolin said.Engine makers have been struggling to keep up with demand triggered by a new generation of fuel-saving engines. CFM has been spared most of the delays felt by rival Pratt & Whitney or technical problems seen at Rolls-Royce (L:RR), but its performance has widespread economic implications since it powers 75 percent of the world's most-used narrowbody jets.Petitcolin said CFM continues to see demand for the previous generation of engines, its decades-old CFM56, even as it switches to the new fuel-saving model. Analysts say airlines calculate that current engines are still economic on shorter trips.Safran is juggling the LEAP ramp-up against efforts to turn around French aircraft seats and cabin equipment maker Zodiac Aerospace , which Petitcolin said occupies much of his attention.Three months after taking control of Zodiac, Safran has not discovered any nasty surprises - seen as a significant fact in its own right after around 10 profit warnings from Zodiac beforehand.""There have been no major (bad) surprises but there haven't been any good surprises either,"" Petitcolin told the AJPAE aerospace media association, adding it would take 12-18 months for delayed airline seat projects currently being handled by Zodiac to work their way through the system.Petitcolin deflected questions about intermittent speculation in France of a future tie-up between Safran and French defense and aerospace equipment company  Thales  (PA:TCFP).The two companies faced pressure to merge more than a decade ago but never went through with a deal. Thales later fell into the orbit of Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), which has industrial control as part of a shareholder pact with the French state.Industry sources say the mosaic of state-influenced French aerospace companies could again come under scrutiny following the death this week of industrialist Serge Dassault.In 2012, one of his sons, Laurent Dassault, suggested a broad combination of Dassault Aviation, Thales, Safran and Zodiac as a counterweight to Franco-German Airbus group (then called EADS), but few in the industry publicly warmed to the idea.Petitcolin paid tribute to Serge Dassault as a ""great man"" of French aeronautics, but declined to be drawn on any future industry deals, saying his priority was to integrate Zodiac.Safran meanwhile hopes for an inaugural contract for its new E-Taxi electrically powered aircraft taxiing system at the Farnborough Airshow in July, Petitcolin said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The carrier had flown the marathon flights until 2013, when high fuel prices made the use of four-engine Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A340-500 jets uneconomic. It has since flown to New York's JFK Airport via Frankfurt.Singapore Airlines is Airbus' first and to date only customer for the A350-900ULR, an ultra-long range version of the fuel-efficient twin-engine A350 jet. Qantas has said it is considering the purchase of the A350-900ULR or Boeing Co's (N:BA) 777X to allow it to fly non-stop from Sydney to London from 2022, an even longer 9,200 nautical mile journey.Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that it also plans to introduce non-stop flights from Singapore to Los Angeles with the A350-900ULR at a later date.

259,"May 22, 2018 09:54AM ET",Airbus says obeying WTO subsidy verdict as sanctions loom,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Tuesday it had taken steps to comply with a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling on subsidies for its A350 and A380 jets, which has seen the United States and Europe trade legal blows on behalf of Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus.The move comes days after the United States won a partial victory against European Union support for Airbus at the WTO, clearing the way for possible U.S. sanctions in a 14-year-old dispute over claims of illegal handouts for planemakers.The EU says it expects to strike a similar legal blow later this year in a parallel WTO case about U.S. support for Boeing, raising the prospect of a tit-for-tat sanctions battle.The row threatens to exacerbate transatlantic tensions over U.S. aluminum and steel tariffs, and the impact on European firms from Washington's decision to exit an Iran nuclear pact. But both sides agree any sanctions would not happen before 2019.In a rare public face-off between key strategists behind the long-running dispute, Boeing's chief external lawyer in the case told BBC radio that the United States would be free to target any European products, not just aerospace. ""The WTO will decide what the proper number is and ... give the U.S. that authority,"" Robert Novick, co-managing partner at U.S. law firm WilmerHale, told the BBC Today program.""In parallel, the U.S. will develop a list of products on which it might consider imposing counter-measures,"" he added.Airbus's chief in-house lawyer in the case said he expected a ""devastating"" ruling on U.S. support for Boeing's 777 and 787 jets when the WTO issues its final report on those this year.LEGAL MARATHONThe dispute - Dickensian in its scope, with 5,000 pages of findings and tens of millions of dollars in legal fees - stems from claims that the world's two largest planemakers benefited from illegal aid in the form of subsidized government loans to Airbus and research grants or tax breaks to Boeing.Airbus did not say how it would comply with the WTO ruling but a European Commission document said it would repay an A350 loan to the UK government this year and reduce the drawdown of other loans. It also said the bankruptcy of Russian carrier Transaero, resulting in fewer A380 deliveries, had helped to limit the impact of subsidies, while other aid had been blunted by the passage of time - an argument previously rejected by Washington. Tuesday's pledge of compliance by Airbus does not necessarily mean the dispute is over.The two sides have been arguing since 2011 about whether they obeyed earlier rulings and while there was no immediate U.S. response to Airbus's statement, experts say there is no sign so far that this occasion will be any different.Karl Hennessee, senior vice president and head of litigation at Airbus, told BBC Today that Airbus wanted to move beyond the ""ridiculousness"" of the WTO legal marathon and forge a peace settlement with the U.S. similar to one between Canada and Brazil that set the tone for global aircraft export financing.Boeing, however, appeared skeptical about the offer.""The most important message that Europe and Airbus can send to the rest of the world about the rules of trade in civil aircraft is to comply with this decision,"" Novick told the BBC.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

262,"May 18, 2018 10:10AM ET",Airbus loses ground in bid to sell jets to United: sources,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alana WisePARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Airbus's hopes of winning an immediate respite from slow sales of its A330neo jetliner with an order from United Airlines are dwindling, leaving a gap in future production weeks before it is due to enter service, industry sources said on Friday.Airbus has been competing with Boeing to replace all or part of a fleet of some 50 Boeing 767s at United Airlines (N:UAL), people familiar with the discussions say. Others said Airbus had made an unsolicited offer to try to head off plans by United to use rights to buy more Boeing 787s.It's the latest twist in one of the fiercest recent jet market battles, pitting Boeing's 787 against the latest type of A330, with Boeing so far holding the upper hand.""Airbus doesn't have United,"" one person familiar with the matter told Reuters, though others did not exclude a chance to compete for a second tranche of business later.Sources say Boeing has an advantage in any competition because United already flies its 787 and has options for more.Airbus (PA:AIR), Boeing (N:BA) and United (N:UAL) declined comment.Airbus is keen to clinch a deal after losing to the 787 at two other U.S. carriers.It also hopes to defend planned production rates, which have only just been lowered due to weak demand.Sources said more than 15 A330 output slots remain unfilled in next year's schedule, heightening pressure to win deals.Airbus has sold 214 A330neos to around 13 customers led by AirAsia (KL:AIRA), which has been giving mixed signals over whether it plans to take the jets or switch to Boeing. AirAsia Group boss Tony Fernandes said this week the A330neo was still the ""favorite choice"" but he was delaying a final decision until he saw how the jet performed.America's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord threatens the sale of 28 A330neos to IranAir.Another reason Airbus wants to add a new marquee customer is that it would make it easier for airlines to finance A330neo purchases, and potentially hold back the tide of 787 sales under a hard-charging new Boeing leadership, financial sources said.Banks add risk factors and toughen the terms when backing thinly sold jets and the risk is that the more popular 787 could become cheaper to finance, even though the price of an A330neo is lower after allowing for market discounts.Airbus has said it is confident about long-term demand and is talking to several airlines about the 310-seat plane.""It's a big segment and we think we have the right airplane at the right time,"" Airbus Americas Chairman Jeff Knittel said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The answer is no,"" Le Maire told reporters.""Do we accept that the United States is the economic gendarme of the planet? The answer is no.""Do we accept the vassalization of Europe in commercial matters? The answer is no.""Both he and Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz had spoken to their U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin, urging him to consider exemptions or delays for companies already present in the country.Le Maire said he was seeking concrete exemptions for countries already present in Iran, including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Total, Sanofi (PA:SASY), Danone and Peugeot. Scholz had also asked for concrete measures to help German companies, Handelsblatt newspaper reported.The 2015 agreement between major powers and Iran set limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Europeans fear a collapse of the deal could intensify conflicts in the Middle East.Germany, France and Britain want talks to be held in a broader format to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional military activities, including in Syria and Yemen.""The extent to which we can keep this deal alive ... is something we need to discuss with Iran,"" said Merkel, who earlier spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue.Divisions in Iran over how it should respond to the U.S. pullout were illustrated as senior cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran University on Friday that European nations could not be trusted.President Hassan Rouhani had said on Tuesday that Tehran would remain in the deal, provided its benefits stayed in force with its remaining signatories.Iran's foreign minister will travel to Moscow on May 14 and meet his Russian counterpart, Russia's RIA news agency said, citing a Russian foreign ministry official.""DAMAGE LIMITATION""Iran said it had asked Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) to announce whether it would go ahead with a plane deal with Tehran following the U.S. pullout.That appears unlikely after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that licenses for the planemaker and rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sell passenger jets to Iran would be revoked.Le Maire said Paris would seek to strengthen Europe's ability to block sanctions and provide investment finance to companies. He called for the creation of a body to monitor the implementation of EU sanctions rules.Some fear Europe's room for maneuver is limited. ""The Europeans are in the weaker position because they are not united,"" said Peter Beyer, Germany's commissioner for transatlantic relations. Trump's strength was that he did not need unity, Beyer added.French exports to Iran doubled to 1.5 billion euros ($1.79 billion) last year, driven by sales of aircraft and automobile parts, according to customs data.Exports of German goods to Iran rose by around 400 million euros to 3 billion euros. Around 120 German firms have operations with their own staff in Iran, including  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), and some 10,000 German companies trade with Iran.""We are ready to talk to all the companies concerned about what we can do to minimize the negative consequences,"" Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio. ""That means, it is concretely about damage limitation"".The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, said firms should question the morality of doing business with Iran.""Germany, France and Britain, the 'EU3', say themselves that Iran poses a threat. Do they want to do business with a threat?"" Bild newspaper quoted him as saying.Altmaier said Germany wanted to avoid ""a spiral of escalation"" in transatlantic trade relations.Merkel said at a church event in the western German city of Muenster: ""It is in our interest to have a strong transatlantic relationship"".But she also said: ""If everybody does what they like, then this is bad news for the world."""
266,"May 11, 2018 06:06AM ET",Iran says Airbus to announce its decision on selling planes to Tehran soon: Fars,nan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday that Airbus (PA:AIR) would announce in the next few days whether it would sell planes to Tehran after the United States withdrew from an international nuclear deal and said it would reinstated sanctions on the Islamic Republic.The U.S. administration has already said it would revoke the export licenses needed by planemakers to sell commercial planes to Iran. Although Airbus is a European firm, its aircraft use U.S. components and technology.Iran has so far imported at least 11 aircraft, three of them from Airbus and eight from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR (MI:LDOF).""Airbus will announce its decision in the coming days,"" senior advisor to Iran's Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told the semi-official Fars news agency.""No down payment has been made by Iran to the planemakers for future deliveries,"" he said.U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran on Tuesday, a move that raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upset European allies and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies.The U.S. withdrawal also signals the collapse of $38 billion in plane deals between Tehran and Western companies, leaving Airbus facing greater risks than its U.S. rival Boeing, according to people involved in the deals.""During the talks with Airbus and Boeing we did not consider any possibility of such exit from the deal and it was not mentioned in the contracts,"" said Fakhriyeh-Kashan, a former deputy minister who negotiated the contracts.IranAir, the national flag carrier, had ordered 200 passenger aircraft, with 100 from Airbus, 80 from Boeing (N:BA) and 20 from ATR.All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in the planes.Other Iranian airlines had also made plane orders.Under the nuclear deal, Iran curbed its nuclear program in return for lifting most international non-nuclear sanctions imposed on the country that crippled its economy for years. Most sanctions were lifted in 2016.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

267,"May 10, 2018 06:38PM ET",Embraer breakup complications are delaying its deal with Boeing: sources,nan,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Brad HaynesSAO PAULO (Reuters) - The tricky work of divvying up the three business segments of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) has been delaying an agreement to combine operations with  Boeing Co  (N:BA), three people with knowledge of the matter said this week.The two planemakers announced last month that they were in talks to set up a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense division and possibly its business jet unit.The companies have won the support of Brazil's government for such a deal, but the maneuver has created other headaches, according to the sources, who spoke to Reuters anonymously due to the sensitivity of talks.Negotiators are picking through the details of long-term service contracts between the companies and working on how to distribute Embraer's thousands of engineers, many of whom have migrated between military and civilian projects during their careers.Asked for comment, Boeing referred to remarks by Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday, when he said talks were making progress, but the Embraer deal was not a ""must do.""Embraer representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Embraer shares in Sao Paulo erased gains after the Reuters report, closing 2.6 percent lower on Thursday.The decision to leave Embraer's defense operations separated has helped to overcome concerns about sovereign control of Embraer's military programs by the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto over the deal, but it has not produced a final agreement as quickly as some expected.""I'm quite optimistic,"" said Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna, who is responsible for the task force overseeing the deal, when asked about the negotiation. ""It is in advanced stages and should be resolved this year.""Boeing's original proposal, a straightforward acquisition, could have been wrapped up by now, but it has proven more challenging to design an offer that leaves Embraer standing as a financially robust company focused on defense, the sources said.Embraer's 70- to 130-seat E-Jets, which compete with the C-Series program designed by  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and run by Airbus SE (PA:AIR), account for about 60 percent of the Brazilian firm's revenue and nearly all of its operating profit.The company's defense division has barely turned a profit in recent years, since Brazil's government slashed military spending in an effort to close a gaping budget deficit.Embraer has also been losing money on a fresh line-up of business jets, as the executive aviation market stagnates. The companies have still not reached a final decision on whether to include the unit with the commercial jet division in the new company, in which Boeing would own a roughly 80 percent stake, according to two of the sources.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

268,"May 09, 2018 04:25PM ET","Europeans work to save Iran deal, and business, after Trump pulls out",nan,"By Yara Bayoumy and Brian LoveWASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Dismayed European allies sought to salvage the international nuclear pact and preserve their business with Iran on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran.""The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who helped engineered the 2015 deal to ease Iran's economically crippling isolation, told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that Europe had only a ""limited opportunity"" to preserve the pact, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported.""(Europe)...must, as quickly as possible, clarify its position and specify and announce its intentions with regard to its obligations,"" ISNA quoted Rouhani as saying to Macron.Macron, who like other European leaders had lobbied Trump to keep the agreement signed before he took office, urged Rouhani to keep respecting the deal and consider broader negotiations.Trump said on Tuesday he would revive U.S. economic sanctions, which would penalize foreign firms doing business with Tehran, to undermine what he called ""a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".On Wednesday, he said Iran would now either negotiate or ""something will happen."" It was not immediately clear what actions he was suggesting would take place.Iran has drafted a ""proportional"" plan to cope with the U.S. move, the official news agency IRNA quoted government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht as saying. He said budgets had been drawn up to deal with various scenarios, though did not elaborate.The fruit of more than a decade of diplomacy, the nuclear agreement was clinched in July 2015 by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran.It was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy, not least by Washington threatening to penalize businesses anywhere in the world that traded with Iran.Trump complained that the deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.His decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East, puts the United States at odds with European diplomatic and business interests, and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent touching a 3-1/2-year high. [O/R]The U.S. pullout could also strengthen the hand of hardliners in Iranian politics at the expense of moderates like Rouhani who had pinned their hopes on the deal to boost living standards in Iran, with limited success so far.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hardliner, said: ""Mr Trump, I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You've made a mistake ... I said many times from the first day: don't trust America."" ""REGION DESERVES BETTER"" France's Le Drian, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all said Iran was honoring its commitments under the accord.""The region deserves better than further destabilization provoked by American withdrawal,"" Le Drian said.Later on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to allay concerns that Washington had alienated itself from close allies with Trump's decision.""We will continue to work alongside our allies and partners to ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon, and will work with others to address the range of Iran's malign influence,"" Mattis told a U.S. Senate hearing.""The president could not affirm as required that this agreement was being lived up to,"" Mattis said. ""I think we now have the opportunity to move forward to address those shortcomings and make it more compelling.""The European Union said it would ensure sanctions on Iran remain lifted, as long as Tehran meets its commitments.The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""deeply concerned"" by the withdrawal, the RIA news agency said.Merkel said that, while the existing deal should not be called into question, there should be discussion of ""a broader deal that goes beyond it"".British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke of a ""follow-on agreement"" but said it was now up to Washington to come up with concrete proposals. Macron said he wanted a broader discussion with all relevant parties on the development of Iran's nuclear program after 2025, when key elements of the current deal expire, as well as Iran's ballistic missile program and wider Middle East issues.Iranian officials will next week meet counterparts from France, Britain and Germany. Khamenei appeared skeptical whether they could deliver: ""I don't trust these three countries.""The chances of saving the deal without Washington depend largely on whether international firms are willing and able to keep trading with Iran despite the threat of U.S. sanctions.In a sign of what may be in store, Trump's ambassador to Berlin tweeted, within hours of taking up his post, that German businesses should halt activities in Iran at once.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the United States should not consider itself the world's ""economic policeman"".Britain, France and Germany said they would do all they could to protect their business interests in Iran, yet it was unclear how far they would be able to shield firms from U.S. sanctions. Brussels has a ""blocking statute"" at its disposal that bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognize any court rulings that enforce American penalties.But the statute has never been used and is seen by European governments more as a political weapon than a regulation, because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce.British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman made the limits of potential action clear: ""UK businesses may wish to consider the implications for their business activities in Iran and, where necessary, seek appropriate legal advice.""European companies including carmaker PSA (PA:PEUP), plane manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) and engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) all said they were watching the situation.A senior French diplomat said businesses would ultimately be forced to choose between their Iranian economic interests and their potential U.S. interests, adding: ""Generally, that decision is quickly made in favor of the U.S.""""DEATH TO AMERICA!"" Hardline lawmakers in Iran's parliament burned a U.S. flag and a symbolic copy of the deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), chanting ""Death to America!"" Rouhani, whose position could be weakened by a blow to Iran's economy, struck a more conciliatory tone in a televised speech, saying Iran would negotiate with EU countries, China and Russia.""If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal will remain,"" he said.Trump's decision compounded strains on the transatlantic alliance since he took office 16 months ago. One by one, European leaders came to Washington and tried to meet his demands, while pleading with him to preserve the deal.The Trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal, but it is far from clear whether the Europeans would pursue that option or be able to win Iran over.Abandoning the pact was one of the most consequential decisions of Trump's ""America First"" policy, which has led him to quit the global Paris climate accord, come close to a trade war with China and pull out of an Asian-Pacific trade deal. It also appeared to reflect the growing influence within the administration of Iran hawks such as new National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday to prepare for a summit that Trump hopes will secure North Korea's denuclearization.COMPLYING WITH DEALIran denies longstanding Western suspicions that it tried in the past to develop atomic weapons and says its nuclear energy program has been for peaceful purposes.Senior U.S. officials themselves have said several times that Iran is in technical compliance with the nuclear pact.Renewing sanctions would make it much harder for Iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system. Iran is the third-largest member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping about 3.8 million barrels per day of crude, or just under 4 percent of global supply. China, India, Japan and South Korea buy most of its 2.5 million bpd of exports.Iran's rial currency plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar in the free market, after sliding for months because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who feared that renewed U.S. sanctions would hit Iranian exports hard.The U.S. Treasury says sanctions related to Iran's energy, auto and financial sectors will be reimposed in three and six months.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a license for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sell passenger jets to Iran will be revoked, scuttling a $38 billion deal. The ban will also hit Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), whose planes contain U.S.-made parts.Iran's growing military and political power in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq worries the United States, Israel and Washington's Gulf Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia.Among the few nations to welcome Trump's decision were Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch-foes in the Middle East, regarding it as a political victory.(Graphic showing Iran’s nuclear facilities https://tmsnrt.rs/2K9tVRX)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that licenses for  Boeing Co  and Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell passenger jets to Iran would be revoked as part of sanctions imposed following President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft: 100 from Airbus SE (PA:AIR), 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes.Regarding the Brazilian deal, Boeing and Embraer were discussing a tie-up to create a new company in which the U.S. planemaker would have an 80.01 percent stake and the Brazilian firm 19.99 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

272,"May 09, 2018 07:21AM ET",U.S. exit from Iran deal puts pressure on European planemakers,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - America's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord signals the collapse of $38 billion in plane deals between Tehran and Western companies and leaves Airbus facing greater risks than arch-rival Boeing, according to people involved in the deals.President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he was pulling his country out of the 2015 accord, and his administration said it would revoke export licenses needed by planemakers to sell commercial planes - which require U.S. components - to Iran.Tehran has ordered 200 passenger aircraft for state carrier IranAir worth $38.3 billion at list prices, including 100 from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) and 20 from smaller Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR (MI:LDOF).Airbus is more exposed on wide-body jets, for which sluggish global demand forced it last month to revise down part of its production plans. Iran has ordered 53 wide-body jets from Airbus and 30 from Boeing, which are yet to be built.Losing the order deals a further blow to Airbus's newest wide-body jet, the A330neo, which faces weak demand months before it enters service, three industry sources said. IranAir is its second-largest airline buyer after AirAsia (KL:AIRA).By contrast, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg signaled last month that his company was no longer as dependent on the Iran orders as it had been, following an aggressive effort to improve sales of its current-generation 777-300ER wide-body jets which were part of the Iran deal.Airbus and Boeing said they would study the U.S. decision, but declined to comment on the risks they faced.""We will do the right thing,"" Jeff Knittel, chairman of Airbus Americas, told Reuters.Neither planemaker will be as concerned about the potential loss of a total of around 100 narrow-body plane orders from the Iranian deals, as demand for those jets is strong and they will have no problem in allocating production slots to other buyers.Two European sources said Airbus was resigned to losing the historic Iran deals which had taken months of preparation, culminating in a Paris signing by President Hassan Rouhani in 2016. Rouhani said on Tuesday Iran was committed to the deal.AIRBUS 'COMES OUT WORSE'A collapse of aircraft deals struck under the nuclear pact would also hit Airbus's 2018 order book harder than Boeing's.A cancellation of Airbus's Iranian orders - which it booked early to pip Boeing in the 2016 order race - could wipe out its entire tally of 86 net orders for this year. Investors keep an eye on new orders as a gauge of jet market confidence.Boeing is ahead with 221 net orders for 2018, and had delayed booking the orders from its $16.5 billion Iran contract - Iran's biggest with America since the 1979 revolution.""Airbus was very aggressive about booking orders and delivering planes and Boeing were very conservative; Airbus gets hit a bit worse,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.Still, Boeing's wide-body portfolio is not without risk.""In terms of optimistic expectations, Airbus comes out worse. In terms of hoping for (wide-body) revenue that won't be there, neither feels good right now,"" Aboulafia added.The situation looks mixed for small but profitable ATR.Analysts say the turboprop maker has had a good Iran deal so far, managing to deliver more aircraft than its larger rivals with 8 already in service.It looked on course to deliver the remaining aircraft later this year and may just be able to squeeze one or two more into Iran before the end of a 90-day wind-down period in August.However, it faces potentially costly industrial decisions over the rest of the 20-plane deal. Analysts say the deadline for deliveries suggests ATR had started building some of the remaining planes, potentially leaving it with unsold aircraft.ATR was not available for comment.Trump's speech pulled the shutters down on the wider aircraft deals unexpectedly quickly and marked a sharp contrast with scenes over two years ago when plane sellers and leasing companies flocked to Tehran eager to drum up new business.Although Airbus and Boeing are arch-foes in the $120 billion annual jet market, their deals with Iran had brought them into alignment because each depended on the same U.S. licenses.But as opposition to the Iran accord mounted in the U.S. Congress, which holds the key to defense and other contracts, and as markets for its jets improved elsewhere, Boeing seemed to change its tone with the comments by Muilenburg last month.""It's not just Trump but the anti-Iran mood in Congress,"" explained a person familiar with the U.S. transactions."

All three companies declined to comment on the nature of the talks.A win in the jet production contest would be especially important for Airbus, whose struggling A330neo program has lost a number of recent bids to U.S. rival Boeing for wide-body, long-haul aircraft.Hawaiian Airlines in March chose Boeing to supply 10 new 787-9 aircraft, dropping an earlier order of the A330neo.The European planemaker was again bested last month when American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, chose Boeing to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets.The fate of an order for 28 A330neos from IranAir is also in jeopardy, on concerns over a Tuesday decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from an international nuclear deal.Airbus Americas Chairman Jeff Knittel said Airbus remained confident in the A330neo despite recent setbacks.""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told Reuters.""We are talking to a number of people as potential customers.

278,"May 08, 2018 03:05PM ET",U.S. to reveal winners of drone program that has attracted top companies,nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson(Reuters) - Major technology and aerospace companies including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) are vying to take part in a new slate of drone tests the United States is set to announce on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The wide interest in the U.S. initiative, launched by President Donald Trump last year, underscores the desire of a broad range of companies to have a say in how the fledgling industry is regulated and ultimately win authority to operate drones for everything from package delivery to crop inspection.The pilot program will allow a much larger range of tests than are generally permitted by federal aviation regulators, including flying drones at night, over people and beyond an operator's line of sight.The U.S. Transportation Department said it will announce 10 winning state, local or tribal governments to host the experiments on Wednesday. The governments in turn have partnered with companies who will play a role in the tests.Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is up for re-election in November, said in a press release the city of Reno was named one of the winners. The city is partnered with Nevada-based Flirtey, a company that has worked on delivering defibrillators by drone, as well as pizza for Domino's.At least 200 companies spanning 149 applications are vying to be part of the program, a U.S. official said. Many major U.S. companies are part of the winning submissions.Winners include projects focused on package delivery, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, pipeline oversight and integrating drones near airports, the U.S. official said. Companies such as  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have also expressed interest in the program, sources said, though it was unclear whether they had joined applications and what they would be testing.Amazon declined to comment. Airbus, Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they on one or more applications, with Airbus noting it is interested in topics like risk analysis for airspace management. Qualcomm hopes to test network connectivity along with partners  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) said it had not applied but was in talks with partners who have. Other companies did not immediately answer requests for comment.Changes to U.S. policy that result from the tests are not expected for some time. Package delivery, which can be particularly complex, might not take place until later on during the program.Earl Lawrence, who directs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s unmanned aircraft systems integration office, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that many of the other projects ""could go forward under the FAA’s existing rules, including with waivers where appropriate.""He said after ""the 10 selections for the pilot program are announced, the FAA will be reaching out to other applicants, as well as interested state and local authorities, to provide additional information on how to operationalize their proposed projects.""The FAA is also working on proposed regulations to ensure the safety of drones and their integration into U.S. airspace. The initiative is significant for the United States, which has lagged other countries in drone operations for fear of air crashes. That had pushed companies like Amazon to experiment overseas.In the United Kingdom, the world's largest online retailer already sends some packages by drone. It completed its first such mission in late 2016, taking 13 minutes from click to delivery.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That facility is an assembly site for its Q400 turboprop passenger planes and is one of four final assembly sites it uses. Thursday's sale, combined with an equity raise of C$638.4 million ($496.73 million) in March gives the company $1 billion in cash.""This (the Q400) is a product line we'll keep pushing,"" Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts on a call, allaying concerns about the plane line's future. The company has up to five years to find a new assembly site for the plane.He said the deal would allow the company to ""monetize an underutilized asset and optimize our business aircraft operations.""The Q400, with a backlog of 50 planes, has about 25 percent of the global market in small commercial planes, second to European rival ATR, the world's largest maker of turboprops.Bombardier also agreed to sell a controlling stake in its flagship CSeries jet to Airbus (PA:AIR) last year for a token C$1 after struggling for years to make the plane line commercially successful.Jerry Dias, president of the Unifor union which represents workers who assemble the Q400 and Global 7000 plane in Toronto, said on Thursday the deal means Bombardier will keep the two programs in Canada. ""My biggest concern all along has been the Q-400 and the Global program,"" he said by phone. ""Those two issues have been resolved. We are keeping all of it.""Bombardier said it would assemble business jets at a leased facility at Toronto's  Pearson  (LON:PSON) Airport, and would continue leasing space at the Toronto site for three years, with options to renew for two more. BENEFITSBombardier's first quarter results showed revenue increasing in three of Bombardier's four businesses, led by a 21-percent rise in its rail unit. But the company's loss-making commercial aircraft segment, which includes the CSeries, reported a 12-percent drop in revenue and Bombardier used $721 million of its available cash in the quarter - more than last year.Bombardier said it is on track to achieve free cash flow breakeven for the full year.""I assume they will be utilizing the proceeds (of the sale) to reduce debt at an accelerated timeframe,"" William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.In a staff memo on Wednesday, Bellemare said the company's commercial aircraft president would stay on to lead its regional aircraft business once the deal with Airbus for the CSeries is completed.Bombardier announced 15 new CRJ900 regional jets order worth $719 million from  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).""Cash flow for this quarter wasn't strong but if we hear that they are on track to break even and next year begin to reduce debt, I think the stock should do well.

Balducchi, who is well-known to aerospace analysts after a stint running investor relations at Europe's largest aerospace group, reiterated the deal should close by mid-year.""This is good news because there is a lot of appetite for this remarkable aircraft in the market,"" he wrote in one of the memos.Airbus and Bombardier both declined to comment.The companies have said Airbus' global sales network and greater bargaining power with suppliers should boost sales and lower the CSeries' manufacturing costs. Montreal-based Bombardier's stock rose 1.8 percent in late-afternoon trading, breaking a three-day losing streak.Sources familiar with the matter have said the companies have an internal target of closing the deal by the end of May after winning final regulatory approvals. Bombardier is also due to announce quarterly earnings and hold its annual general meeting on Thursday. In an effort to reassure Quebec's roughly 2,000 CSeries workers, Balducchi reiterated the partnership would remain headquartered in the Montreal area and that the 110-to-130-seat jet would continue to be built there for global customers.A separate facility in Alabama, alongside an existing Airbus plant, will be used for deliveries to U.S. buyers.In other appointments, Airbus troubleshooter David Dufrenois was named head of CSeries sales with the task of winning over more airlines to the plane, which Airbus once saw as a threat to its smallest models but which it now regards as complementary.The Airbus sales executive led a team focused on stabilizing sales of the A380 superjumbo and handled key accounts such as Qatar Airways, one of the industry's most demanding buyers.

284,"May 02, 2018 12:20PM ET",Aerospace suppliers look to blockchain for parts tracking,nan,"By Victoria BryanBERLIN (Reuters) - Aerospace suppliers are starting to explore blockchain technology to keep tabs on their supply chain, potentially tracking parts such as those identified as the cause of a Southwest Airlines accident last month.While blockchain is best known as the digital transactions technology that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin, it can also be harnessed to track, record and transfer assets across all manner of industries, potentially smoothing operations, cutting costs and improving cash management.The challenge faced by the aerospace industry in keeping track of tens of thousands of different parts came to light when it emerged after last month's fatal explosion that some airlines do not keep track of the history of each individual fan blade within an engine. In addition to the operational and cost benefits, improved parts management could speed up safety checks after an accident, industry experts said, and an increasing number of aerospace suppliers are looking at blockchain as a potential solution.Blockchain offers a secure encrypted audit trail because there is only one version of the data, meaning it can be used to ensure traceability without reams of paperwork. It is already being used to track cobalt on its journey from Congo mines to smartphones, for example. Moog, a U.S. manufacturer of flight control systems, is working with partners to create a blockchain-based solution called VeriPart, which will initially be used to track 3D printed components. Moog's technology chief George Small said the aerospace industry, like other highly regulated sectors such as the medical and nuclear power industries, was expending considerable effort on tracking parts across the supply chain to keep up with quality and regulatory demands.TRANSPARENCYSmall said the use of blockchain could increase efficiency and transparency in the sharing of data and that customer feedback has been positive so far. Though VeriPart is still in development, Moog has already had talks with customers on other potential uses for the technology. ""The solution is broadly applicable to manufactured goods and associated data that need to be tracked across supply chains from origin to delivery and on into service,"" Small said in an emailed response to questions. Advocates for the technology say transparency is ensured by the encrypted audit trail and because blockchains are open and decentralized, allowing different parties to share information.Engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is among those working with blockchain developers to establish how it could be used in the supply chain and says it is rapidly developing solutions. ""The company sees opportunities to automate records for complex products that currently require significant manual effort to ensure they are well managed,"" a Rolls-Royce spokesman said.Technology company Sabre (O:SABR), which has been looking at various uses for blockchain in the travel and aviation industries, said it could see the case for using it as a system to track components.""It's a situation where you don't need ultra fast technology, but you need to be able to trust what's in the blockchain record,"" said Philip Likens, director of Sabre Labs.Likens said the technology could be used to show who created what part on what date, when it was put on a plane and then how many hours the plane was in operation. ""You want to know that all those things are right and correct, that's the immutability part,"" he said, referring to how blockchain entries cannot be changed. Planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), meanwhile, is looking for a blockchain solution architect to be based at one of its sites in either Toulouse, Filton, Broughton or Hamburg, according to an online job posting.It has formed a working group within the company to identify business challenges worth addressing with blockchain and a spokeswoman said the supply chain seems a natural fit.""Blockchain could improve the tracking of goods and become a complement to, not a wholesale replacement of, suppliers' procurement software,"" she saidEXAGGERATED CAPABILITIES?But blockchain isn't the only technology that can be used to keep a closer eye on parts in the supply chain. Enders Analysis, in a wide-ranging note on blockchain and its use across various industries, says that a lot of the capabilities of blockchain are exaggerated or misunderstood and that existing technology can often perform the same roles. It says that while blockchain-inspired technology could be used to bring transparency to supply chain management, it could be hard to guarantee that goods really were delivered as specified on the blockchain. ""Upgrading systems to take advantage of technological progress is important and can increase efficiency,"" the analysts wrote in general advice to any company looking at blockchain. ""But those ends are much more important than the means: there is no point deploying blockchain – or a product marketed as blockchain – just for the sake of it.""In an example of other technology that can be used to improve supply chain efficiency, Airbus last week signed up aircraft structures maker Premium Aerotec to its cloud-based aviation data platform, Skywise.The platform will take order, production and quality data from Airbus and Premium Aerotec and analyze the data with a view to keeping the manufacturing process stable and providing transparency in the supply chain. ""To build the aircraft, Airbus needs to know where the parts are and when they are coming,"" Premium Aerotec CEO Thomas Ehm told Reuters, adding that the Skywise platform aims to provide much better visibility of the manufacturing process.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

285,"May 02, 2018 08:18AM ET",Exclusive: UTC set to win EU approval for $23 billion Rockwell Collins deal - sources,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) is set to win EU approval for the largest aerospace deal in history - a $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins (N:COL), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The deal, announced in September last year, would create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing (N:BA), Airbus (PA:AIR), Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and other plane makers.The takeover would give UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, more leverage to resist pressure from plane makers seeking price cuts.Rockwell Collins' software capability would also give UTC an edge in data crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.UTC has offered to sell assets to address the European Commission's concerns, the people said, declining to provide details. Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company's size and market power.The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment.UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value.A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time.Rockwell Collins' (N:COL) businesses are in avionics, seats and plane interiors. This is the second engines-to-seating supplier deal after French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) acquired seat maker Zodiac Aerospace  last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

286,"Apr 27, 2018 02:31PM ET",Better battery packaging on planes overlooks other safety concerns: airlines,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Jamie FreedMONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - New global packaging standards expected in late 2018 will allow lithium-ion batteries back into passenger plane cargo holds, pending design and regulatory approval, but some airlines say the new rule overlooks other safety concerns.It will reverse a 2016 suspension due to fire risks, but some airlines argue that packaging alone will not fully protect against cargo battery fires because battery shipments are sometimes mislabeled. Airlines and battery makers want jet designs to factor in better cargo fire-safety measures. Carriers interviewed by Reuters described finding packages of mislabeled lithium-ion batteries, often by shippers trying to avert the ban. Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, the regulator of the world's busiest air cargo hub, flagged cases of battery packages mislabeled in manifests as clothes, shoes and toys in a 2017 notice to airlines. It is not clear how many mislabeled battery packages are transported by air, or discovered, but carriers fear it could continue as some shippers try to avoid the anticipated higher costs of proper packaging. ""The sheer number of batteries produced is growing and is measured in the billions,"" said Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Director-General Andrew Herdman. ""There is a problem with false declaration or non-declaration of such items.""Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) conducts random checks to ensure packages are properly labeled, but it can't ""catch everyone,"" Rick Howell, general manager group safety and security, said at a recent Montreal safety conference.That's why Howell and others are also calling for new jet models to include better cargo fire safety protections since planes were designed before the battery threat.""Cargo holds of modern planes are lined with materials and equipped with fire suppression systems that aren't designed to contain a lithium ion battery fire,"" a spokeswoman for Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said.In January, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration identified at least 191 ""events"" involving lithium batteries producing smoke, fire, extreme heat or explosions in the air or at airports around the world since 1991.While there have been no reported passenger deaths due to a battery fire, lithium-ion batteries were a contributing factor in the crash of an Asiana Airlines Inc (KS:020560) flight that killed the two pilots of a Boeing 747 freighter in 2011, according to a report by Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board.  The source of the fire that led to the crash was not determined, but the batteries were a factor because they were so flammable, the report said.Both Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) said that they are working with industry to improve aviation safety and already meet or surpass standards.U.S.-based PRBA, the rechargeable battery association, supports ""robust"" and ""cost-effective"" packaging standards but also believes planemakers should factor into their designs ""that large volumes of dangerous goods are transported by air,"" director George Kerchner said. New models such as Boeing's (N:BA) proposed mid-market jet could include modern fire-resistant materials as added protection, airlines said.Aviation working groups are weighing new standards to improve cargo safety, but talks are at an early stage, Rudy Quevedo, the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) director of safety, said.Modernizing planes would deliver an extra line of defense against fires but add costs to an industry already investing heavily in safety.But airplane design alone is not the most effective way to prevent potential lithium-ion cargo hold battery fires, the FAA believes. ""Operations, hazardous materials and airplane design have to work as a system, with each element contributing to safety, but no one element providing all the mitigations,"" a FAA spokesman said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

287,"Apr 27, 2018 06:44AM ET","Airbus cuts A330 output, first quarter profit capped by engine delays",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) announced a 17 percent drop in planned 2019 deliveries of its most successful wide-body jet on Friday following a series of order defeats to rival Boeing, while blurring near-term production plans for the much healthier A320.Europe's largest aerospace group is simultaneously juggling a drop in demand for its A330 wide-body jet - the only one of its class on which it currently makes a profit - against record demand for bread-and-butter models like the A320.Airbus said it was reducing deliveries of the 250-300-seat A330 to around 50 aircraft in 2019, compared with 67 last year and 60 planned for 2018. That comes after an upgraded version due to enter service this year failed to sell as it had hoped.The production slowdown came as Airbus posted a slender - though better than expected - core profit in the first quarter after delays in engine deliveries for its smaller A320neo.Together, the A320 and A330 families generate most of the cash and income needed to support future developments and other activities at the maker of airplanes, rockets and fighters.While the narrowbody A320neo remains a best-seller, with Airbus recently unable to produce the jets fast enough due to engine supply problems, the upgraded A330neo has been losing ground to the newer Boeing (N:BA) 787 at carriers like American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines.""We knew (the first quarter) was going to be grisly – and it is,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris in a note.""The A330 going down to 50 (a year) is overtly bad news, but we have suspected for some time the A330's slow sales could mean A350 production moves up at some point,"" he added.A320 PRODUCTIONShares in Airbus dipped just over 1 percent on the results, which came days after Boeing beat forecasts after improving deliveries and turning the corner on 787 costs.Airbus reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros ($17 million) after a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.12 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed full-year forecasts, however, predicting that A320neo deliveries would speed up later this year after a two-month break in some deliveries due to engine snags.Analysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro quarterly operating loss on revenues of 10.21 billion.Airbus said it saw continued strong demand for narrowbody jets like the A320, allowing it to explore future production rates of ""70 or 70-plus"" a month, up from around 55 a month now.But it softened recent indications that it planned to accelerate its goal in the short term, after an Airbus spokesman earlier this week confirmed a report it planned to increase output to 63 a month in 2019, instead of 60.Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said Airbus was only asking for ""surge capacity"" of that level and the only commitment was for 60 aircraft a month, while redefining the goal as a delivery target rather than a production figure.This is a change from the usual practice for high-volume aircraft program, where manufacturers typically announce monthly production rates that hold steady while deliveries can fluctuate from month to month. For the year as a whole, they tend to focus on deliveries, which drive revenues and cash.Airbus is keen to lock in a recent advantage over Boeing in narrowbody jets by speeding up the rate at which it turns orders into deliveries, but faces pushback from its engine suppliers.The head of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) this week warned against hasty production increases as suppliers work through an unprecedented speed-up plan already in motion.Germany's MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) said on Wednesday it too was cautious, because of tight supply chains.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

288,"Apr 26, 2018 12:00PM ET",Airbus heads for dogfight with UTC over CSeries costs,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Allison LampertPARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus is preparing to cross swords with United Technologies over the price of components and services for the Bombardier CSeries in a bid to make it easier to market the jet it agreed to bail out last year, people close to the matter said. Airbus (PA:AIR) is concerned about an increased share of the Canadian project that would be controlled by United Technologies (N:UTX) after it completes its $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), they said, asking not to be named.Together, the pair will have by far the largest share of CSeries parts and systems by value, placing it at the center of efforts by Airbus to reduce the plane's cost and echoing a broader power struggle between planemakers and suppliers.A key part of the acquisition is ""muscling the supply chain down on price"", said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group.""Bombardier couldn't do that, they just didn't have the leverage. And Airbus has more than enough leverage.""Airbus and UTC declined to comment. A Bombardier spokeswoman said UTC was the largest CSeries supplier even before completion of the Rockwell Collins merger, but declined to comment further. Airbus agreed last October to buy the struggling CSeries for a token one Canadian dollar, with both sides reckoning its global sales presence and clout with suppliers would make the plane more competitive and easier to sell.The deal came weeks after United Technologies teamed up with Rockwell Collins with plans to create a new super-supplier.Among shared components,  United Tech  supplies engines for the CSeries and Rockwell Collins supplies cockpit systems. Aboulafia said pre-merger UTC supplied about a quarter of CSeries content. Items up for negotiation are likely to include the cost of parts, spares and services like repairs, sources said.MARKETING DILEMMA Costs are not the only factor as the CSeries seeks a fresh start. Airbus is also studying how to use its marketing weight.One proposal is to drop the 14-year-old CSeries name and call it the A200, indicating a smaller cousin of the Airbus product line that stretches from the A318 to the mammoth A380.But the possible change, first reported by Bloomberg News, could upset politicians in Quebec who fear losing a key brand and jars with some in Europe who say it harks back to the first A300 Airbus or even the troubled A400M.The debate over what to call it mirrors deeper questions over how Airbus will market the plane, a decision that would send a message on how it views its new Canadian partner.Airbus is trying to decide whether to integrate it into the Airbus sales force or set up a new dedicated team, sources said.A separate structure would give it strong attention but shift the emphasis away from cross-selling with Airbus models.Having one sales force would highlight the opportunity for package deals across the Airbus portfolio, but risk distraction from key priorities like reviving weak sales of the A330neo.""It doesn't much matter what you call the CSeries if you are not selling A330s,"" a senior industry source commented.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There is a very tight regulation and our view is that to partner with large U.S. companies is the preferred option, Bouvier said in an interview on the sidelines of the ILA Berlin Air Show.He said MBDA would pursue cooperation deals inside and outside the United States, but did not name potential partners.MDBA has faced stiff challenges in selling its Brimstone missiles and other equipment in the U.S. market, which constitutes about 40 percent of the world missile market, excluding Russia and China, he said. Bouvier noted that MBDA was already working closely with top U.S. arms maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) in Germany, where the two companies have formed a joint venture to hammer out an agreement with the defense ministry about a multibillion-euro missile defense system called TLVS.The head of Lockheed's missiles and fire control business on Wednesday said the two companies hoped to finalize a contract for TLVS by the end of 2018. Bouvier said that cooperation could expand outside Germany in the future, given what he called the ""huge potential for export"" of the TLVS system.

In normal circumstances we would expect a very positive share price response,"" Vertical Research Partners Robert Stallard wrote in a note.Boeing sold a record 763 aircraft last year and has already announced a rise in commercial deliveries in the first three months of the year. It raised its full-year operating cash flow forecast to $15.0 billion-$15.5 billion from about $15 billion, previously.The company also increased its 2018 core earnings per share forecast to $14.30-14.50 from its previous projection of $13.80-$14.00.Core operating margin rose to 10.7 percent from 8.5 percent a year earlier while revenue rose 6.5 percent to $23.38 billion, beating expectations of $22.26 billion. The results follow those of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased costs of material such as steel.U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel and aluminum imports, with tariffs of 25 percent for some steel products and 10 percent for aluminum products, has constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating costs of the metals. ""Trade war impact will be a topic for the call,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said.""The good thing is that Boeing tends to have multi-year contracts in place, general inflationary adjustments on sales, and raw materials are a relatively modest portion of a plane's costs."" Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) have been pressing suppliers to cut prices on aircraft parts, as they seek to stay competitive amid burgeoning demand from airlines for more capable planes at lower prices.Boeing has introduced automation in its factories, streamlined production, wound down development costs and shed jobs to dramatically improve profit and cash flow.""We believe that investors had already been modeling higher cash flow and EPS than Boeing's initial guide, but it is unlikely Boeing would stuff its last raise of the year into Q1,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities analyst Seth Seifman said.Boeing's commercial aircraft deliveries rose 9 percent to 184 in the first quarter ended March 31, due to strong demand from airlines dealing with booming passenger air travel.The company also said it planned to increase production on its 767 aircraft program from 2.5 to 3 per month beginning in 2020, reflecting strength in the global cargo market.Global freight traffic grew on average by 7.7 percent in January and February, marking the strongest start to the year since 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association.Up to Tuesday's close, Boeing's stock had risen 11.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.1 percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJI).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It's a really important moment to stabilize the European defense industry and work together in a structured manner,"" Airbus Defence and Space CEO Dirk Hoke told reporters at the Berlin air show. Germany and France have agreed on the central requirements for a new fighter jet to replace Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale warplanes beginning in 2040, and officials from the two countries will sign an outline document on the sidelines of the show, military sources said on Tuesday.The two companies want to ensure that Europe retains control over its future weapons systems, Eric Trappier, CEO of Dassault Aviation said. ""I don't feel that if other European countries buy off the shelf American products that you contribute to strategic autonomy,"" Trappier said. Whether the French and German governments decide to involve Britain in future projects would likely depend on the conditions around its exit from the European Union, Hoke said. France is working with Britain on an unmanned combat aerial vehicle, but that project has not yet progressed as expected. ""It was supposed to go up to the extent of joint demonstrator. For some reason this has not yet been decided,"" Trappier said.He said the Franco-German cooperation was different, with it being for a larger system for a manned fighter, whereas the Franco-British project was for an unmanned aircraft.The two companies have not yet announced who will lead the partnership for the Franco-German FCAS. Trappier said they would each decide who had the best skills and competencies to lead each part of the system. ""The role on both sides is to find the right compromises. If we play egos we will end up with a project that won't be successful,"" Hoke said. Airbus and Dassault said it was important for France and Germany to launch an initial joint study this year so they could get demonstrators done for 2025. The fighter aircraft will replace the current generation of Eurofighter and Rafale aircraft.Trappier said it would not be a copy of the U.S. F-35 fighter, but would be more ambitious.

We believe it's a must-win,"" Beth Parcella, who heads international sales for the Sikorsky program, told Reuters on Wednesday.The U.S. weapons maker's new Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter will make its global debut at the Berlin air show with a ""very compelling flight demonstration,"" Parcella said.The CH-53K , which the U.S. Marine Corps expects to declare combat-ready in 2019, will vie with Boeing Co's (N:BA) CH-47 Chinook to replace Germany's aging fleet of CH-53G aircraft.Sikorsky said it is adding to deals already struck with  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG), MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Hensoldt Sensors AG, by including ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH, Autoflug, Hydro Systems KG, the German unit of Rockwell Collins (N:COL), Jenoptik Germany (DE:JENG), Liebherr and Rohde & Schwarz.The German defense ministry plans to issue a request for information in the second half of 2018 and award the winning bidder a contract in mid-2020, for deliveries to start in 2023.Lockheed, in collaboration with Airbus-owned (PA:AIR) European missiles group MBDA, Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italian group Leonardo (MI:LDOF), is also negotiating with Germany's defense ministry on the TLVS missile defense system.And the company is hoping to sell Germany dozens of F-35 fighter jets to replace older Tornado fighters.Parcella said it was possible personnel changes in the German defense ministry and procurement agency could stall the program, but said it made sense to quickly replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.""The legacy fleet will only become more expensive (to maintain) as time goes on,"" she said.Some German military officials favor the Boeing CH-47, which is flown by eight other NATO countries, but others say the larger CH-53K would allow growth in future missions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""What happened today was very important for Brazil, it was a small victory,"" Celso Pereira, a Brazilian diplomat at the WTO, told Reuters in a phone interview. ""Now the game will really begin. We've overcome an important barrier.""Brazil launched the WTO dispute last year, saying the CSeries had received $3 billion in federal, provincial and local subsidies.Canada objected, saying Brazil had unfairly broadened the case by including four claims that went beyond its original complaint. Brazil said their inclusion did not change the essence of the dispute.In their preliminary ruling on the case, the three-person WTO dispute panel threw out Canada's argument.""The panel agrees with Brazil that the four measures at issue fit within the scope and essence of the dispute as described by Brazil, so that the scope of the dispute is not expanded by Brazil's panel request,"" the preliminary ruling said.Canada had also argued that Brazil had failed to identify specific payments from Canadian research and technology councils.But the panel rejected that argument too.""We conclude that Canada's and Quebec's provision of funding, technology transfer, in-kind goods and services, and other support ... is identified with sufficient particularity in Brazil's panel request and therefore falls within the panel's terms of reference,"" the panel said.The panel will now assess arguments from both Brazil and Canada over the alleged subsidies. Pereira said he expects a final decision sometime next year.The United States imposed heavy duties on the CSeries jet last year in a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (N:BA), prompting a sale of 50.01 percent of the CSeries to Airbus.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

299,"Apr 17, 2018 12:30PM ET",China to open auto market as trade tensions simmer,nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Adam JourdanBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will scrap a limit on foreign ownership of automotive ventures by 2022 in a major policy shift to open up the world's biggest car market, even as trade tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing.In a move welcomed by Germany's powerful car industry, China's state planner said on Tuesday it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and the wider car market by 2022.China imposed ownership restrictions in 1994, limiting foreign carmakers to owning no more than a 50 percent share of any local venture. Forcing foreign carmakers to work with Chinese firms was designed to help domestic carmakers compete.The latest policy move marks a new twist in a see-saw week for Chinese trade. The country slapped a temporary fee on U.S. sorghum after the United States banned American companies from selling parts to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) on Monday.Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG), which has a big stake in trade relations between Beijing and Washington as the biggest exporter of vehicles from the United States to China, welcomed the car decision.""We believe a more free and flexible business environment will benefit both Chinese and foreign companies in China and the Chinese economy. BMW will continue pursuing mutual benefit and win-win solutions with the local partners,"" the carmaker said.BMW added it remained committed to expanding a joint venture with China's BBA and was still discussing how to structure a new partnership for its Mini brand with China's Great Wall Motors.Analysts said the main beneficiaries, at least in the short term, would be manufacturers focused on new-energy vehicles, including U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (O:TSLA), which has been seeking to set up its own plant in Shanghai.Tesla chief Elon Musk said last month that China's tough auto rules for foreign businesses created an uneven playing field as scores of local and international companies compete for a slice of China's fast-growing market for ""green"" cars.Tesla declined to comment.The looser rules are likely to raise pressure on domestic carmakers, potentially hitting the likes of Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co (SZ:002594).Traditional automakers will need to wait longer for any direct impact and could face more risks than opportunities in ditching their joint venture structures, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief at consultancy IHS Markit.""Foreign companies may already be in a box (in China),"" said Chao, adding the joint venture structure was now so ingrained that many might not want to change it.""While getting a bigger share could be advantageous in terms of boosting profits, they may actually be already too dependent on their Chinese partners to sever those ties.""A spokesman for Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said: ""We will carefully analyze whether this opens up new opportunities for Volkswagen and its brands."" Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), parent company of Mercedes-Benz, said it was happy with its current business set-up in China, adding it was watching regulatory developments with interest.JOINT VENTURESA senior General Motors Co (N:GM) executive said last week the U.S. carmaker, even without ownership caps, would not cut ties with local partner SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104). The source, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter, added GM would not be as successful in China on its own.In a statement on Tuesday, GM said its growth in China was ""a result of working with our trusted joint venture partners. We will continue to work with our partners to provide high-quality products and services to consumers."" A  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said the automaker was encouraged by the announcement and looked forward to learning more. Japan's Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said it would monitor developments and plan accordingly.Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said its China business had grown on the back of strong local tie-ups. ""At the moment we have no plans to change our capital relationship,"" a spokesman said.China will also scrap limits on foreign ownership in the shipbuilding and aircraft industries in 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said.Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The highly symbolic moves in autos come after President Xi Jinping said last week China would scrap ownership limits ""as soon as possible.""China, which said the easing of autos rules was unrelated to that dispute, is keen to portray itself as open for business. Its ties with the world's largest economy, though, are becoming increasingly fraught.The United States has banned American companies from selling parts to telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years, creating a new fissure in Sino-U.S. ties.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Too expensive. Fares would go up.""AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), placed a firm order for 10 A350s in June 2009. It later ordered 66 A330neos, an updated version of the A330s it has in its current fleet. The A350-900 has a longer range but also comes with a higher list price of $317.4 million, compared with the $296.4 million price of the A330-900neo. Airlines typically receive large discounts from the list prices.Manufacturers sometimes allow airlines to swap models even though they have placed firm orders and paid deposits, meaning AirAsia X might be able to convert the A350 order to other Airbus jets like the A330neo or A320 family.The AirAsia group is one of Airbus' largest customers, but AirAsia X has also been talking to  Boeing Co  (N:BA) about buying the rival 787-10 jet, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

It's quite complex, but it's moving along. It's just not going to come out imminently,"" said one of the sources.Embraer shares, which had climbed 10 percent in two days on anticipation of the deal, fell as much as 2 percent in Sao Paulo on Thursday after the report.Embraer and Brazil's Defense Ministry, which has been heading up the government's working group on the deal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.At an event in Scotland, the head of Embraer's commercial aviation unit, John Slattery, declined to comment.Boeing referred to comments by chief executive Dennis Muilenburg in February, saying the timing was right for the companies to combine forces and a tie-up would be ""a great strategic fit, but it's not a must do.""While the broad outlines of a deal seem to have satisfied all parties' main concerns, there are finer points to settle between the companies, whose partnership in the 70- to 130-seat regional jet segment would mean stiffer competition for  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) CSeries program. For example, negotiators still need to define Boeing's final stake in a new joint venture containing Embraer's commercial aviation business, which is likely to be just over 80 percent in return for a cash payment, according to two of the sources. It was still unclear if Embraer would have a seat on the board of the new company, they added.But they said key government concerns are addressed in the plan, which ensures that Embraer, which would keep its defense and business jet divisions, retains the engineering capacity necessary to design and build new aircraft. Long-term service agreements between Embraer and the new company should also guarantee their long-term viability, sources said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Emirates is the A380s biggest backer, ordering far more than any other customer and making it the flagship of a fleet that has helped transform Dubai into a major international air hub.The airline is still evaluating which engines it will use to power its new A380s, which are due to be delivered from 2020, Clark said.The  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L:RR) on the latest deliveries.""There's nothing wrong with Rolls-Royce, but having Engine Alliance come back in again could make life interesting,"" he said. The airline is short about 100 to 150 pilots, forcing it to reduce the frequency of some routes to Florida in the United States this summer, Clark said. Chinese carriers in particular were offering extremly competitive packages for pilots, he said.He said the shortage was a short-term situation, adding that Emirates has 170 pilots going through its cadetship programme.Clark said the past financial year had been better than the previous one in terms of profit. ""The first half was good and we sustained that through the second half so we'll be considerably better than we were last year,"" he said, adding that fuel prices would be a challenge for the current year. Emirates is ""looking at all sorts of areas"" to work with Etihad Airways after the signing of a security agreement between the two rivals in January, he added without elaborating.Emirates is owned by Dubai and Etihad is owned by Abu Dhabi, both of which are part of the United Arab Emirates.Abu Dhabi and Dubai companies have recently started to collaborate after traditionally operating independently and sometimes in competition.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Britain must recognize that future investments are not a given.""His comments come less than a month after Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a transition deal with European leaders to keep existing trade ties unchanged for 21 months after Brexit, a move seen by politicians as a way of providing businesses with certainty. But Enders said Britain needed to go further. He called for Britain to remain part of the EU aviation safety certification agency, EASA, to allow Airbus's planes to gain the necessary approvals to let them fly, and said that its business depended on aircraft parts and people being able to move freely between its sites across the UK and Europe.Airbus employs 15,000 in Britain where it makes all the wings for its commercial aircraft. Enders also said that there needed to be an agreement covering security, defense and space programs between Britain and the EU, calling for deals to ""cement this co-operation"". ""It is no good making the right noises. We need a plan that comes from the UK but is also accepted by the EU27,"" Enders said. ""Within these negotiations, the EU will need to offer some flexibility but the UK must also be realistic in its demands; pragmatism must trump pride."" The transition deal, secured by May in March, pushed back the risk of disruption for companies until the end of 2020. But London and Brussels must first agree on their long-term trade ties for the period after 2020 for the transition agreement to become effective.Airbus, which has its headquarters in France, has 25 sites in Britain and spends more than 5 billion pounds ($7.10 billion) with suppliers in the country.

310,"Apr 10, 2018 09:31AM ET",Exclusive: Airbus suspends A320 revamp study amid output problems,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has shelved advanced studies aimed at improving its A320neo jet family, designed in part to fend off a mid-market plane that Boeing hopes to build, two people familiar with the matter said.The surprise decision to back away from the proposed ""A320neo-plus"" and ""A321neo-plus,"" which would lengthen and modernize both models, comes as Airbus (PA:AIR) continues to face problems in increasing output for the current versions.""The ramp-up is not going as well as hoped,"" a person with knowledge of the supply chain said. Another said Airbus had declared industrial matters top priority amid engine shortages, calling off plans to show the A320neo-plus design to airlines.""We do not comment on product policy,"" an Airbus spokesman said, asked about a decision to halt work on the A320neo-plus.The 30-year-old A320 family is Airbus's most-sold model and competes with Boeing's 737 for the bulk of airline business. Demand for both workhorse series is strong, but Airbus has won the order race since both sides carried out engine upgrades earlier this decade, particularly with the big-selling A321neo.It faces uncertainty, however, as Boeing (N:BA) ponders a new jet in the middle of the market, overlapping narrowbody jets and the wide-body sector where its position is strongest.In an effort to pre-empt that move, Airbus had been looking at stretching the A320neo and A321neo to add seats from 2022, two years before the earliest date for Boeing's proposed jet. Suppliers say this A320neo-plus would also save fuel through better aerodynamics and that the cockpit could get a facelift.The development proposal was one of the items awaiting new planemaking chief Guillaume Faury when he replaced Fabrice Bregier in February, alongside engine supply problems that have forced the company to suspend deliveries of some A320neo jets.Sources say Airbus has been building large tents outside its main factory to help accommodate undelivered jets.CAUTIOUS STANCEIn that climate, and with a new planemaking management still finding its feet, Airbus is adopting a more cautious attitude to risks and focusing on ramping up production as smoothly as possible to defend its main source of profits, the people said.An internal appeal begins this week to boost recruitment of the company's best talent for the A320-family ramp-up.Although the A320neo-plus had not been launched, work on internal studies was advanced and was expected soon to pass the stage where the aircraft could be presented to airlines.A second and more costly study, code-named ""A320neo-plus-plus,"" envisaged new wings, but not until a few years later.The decision to back off the A320neo-plus raises a second question mark over Airbus's response to the potential new Boeing jet after it lost key sales contests for the A330neo, which sits at the top end of the middle-market between 200 and 270 seats.Airbus said it was in no hurry to adjust the A321neo, implying it is content to let Boeing show its cards first.""The A321neo is an aircraft with lots of potential. It enjoys a market share of some 80 percent,"" the spokesman said, adding ""we are under no pressure.""Some sources, however, said Airbus was taking an unexpected gamble by failing to keep investing in the strongest part of its portfolio, with sales momentum and technology both at stake.For its part, Boeing has not found it simple to close the business case for its new jet, due partly to production costs. Analysts say its perceived ability to divert business from the A321neo at the lower end of the market may weigh in any Boeing decision to launch the jet, which could come this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing Senior Vice President Asia-Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar last month told media it was up to the government and the airline to take the lead on firming up the 787 deal. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment further.The provisional Boeing deal was announced during Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's U.S. visit in September. The visit, ahead of elections in Malaysia in 2018, was important for Najib as a way to show he was welcome at the White House despite a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department into a fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad that he founded.U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Malaysia's Boeing deal but steered clear of the 1MDB probe.Malaysia's election commission on Tuesday set May 9 as the poll date. Najib announced the dissolution of parliament on Friday, paving the way for a tough campaign where he faces off against rival Mahathir Mohamad, who last year questioned the merits of the Boeing deal in a blog post.Malaysia Airlines has been trying to transform its operations and return to profitability as it recovers from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.The carrier's new CEO, Izham Ismail, last month said the company had issued a request for information for new generation widebody planes, without specifying the number or model type, with a request for proposal expected to follow.The 787 deal was signed by the previous CEO Peter Bellew.""They have flexibility to not convert the 787 MOU to a firm order if they decide it makes sense to go with Airbus for the full requirement,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. ""It's best if they limit their number of widebody types as their fleet is not that big to begin with and having just six or eight aircraft of a particular type is subscale.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But for some European companies, a bit of friction couldn't hurt.European producers of aircraft, telecoms equipment and whisky could stand to benefit if U.S.-China trade tensions allow them to chip away at their American rivals' share of the massive Chinese market. Traders and investors have begun looking at which European stocks could reap rewards if the two countries impose tariffs on a long list of each other's goods.""A trade war is a battle that could create opportunities,"" said Hans Ulrich Jost, European value equities portfolio manager at GAM.China's tariff list targets U.S. aircraft imports, hurting Boeing (N:BA) and potentially opening the way for European arch-rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to fill the gap. Boeing is the main proxy in any trade war plays, according to a trader at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets, who said he had seen some investors short the stock in the past weeks. China accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. aircraft exports and all U.S. auto exports, according to UBS.Boeing's shares were punished on Wednesday but recovered at the close, while Airbus was among the best performers. UBS analysts said in a note ""the impact should be marginal for Boeing, with limited upside for Airbus."" Several traders who spoke to Reuters were pushing the ""Buy Airbus vs Boeing"" play. (GRAPHIC: April 5 Airbus Boeing - https://reut.rs/2GAsCOv)SPORTSWEAR AND WHISKYThe consumer sector could also see some rotation of Chinese demand away from big U.S. names and into European brands. German sportswear brand Adidas (DE:ADSGn), for example, could make inroads to the detriment of U.S. rival  Nike  (N:NKE).Investors emphasized that Nike, which makes most of its products in China, would likely see little price change from the tariffs, however. Any impact would likely come from Chinese consumers actively turning away from U.S. brands.One portfolio manager said he was short Nike shares as he expected Chinese consumers to shun the brand in favor of European names. U.S. companies producing to export to China, like the maker of Jack Daniels whisky in Kentucky (N:BFb), could be more directly impacted.European drinks makers' shares rose on Wednesday on speculation Chinese demand may switch to European equivalents such as Martell cognac and Chivas Regal whisky, produced by  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), or Remy Martin cognac (PA:RCOP).(GRAPHIC: Adidas overtakes Nike year to date 2018 - https://reut.rs/2q7pVtF)Nokia (HE:NOKIA) was singled out by traders and analysts as a likely beneficiary of tariffs drawing more Chinese demand to European mobile equipment makers. Its shares were steady during Wednesday's sell-off and were up 1.9 percent on Thursday.Europe's biggest export to China is telecommunications equipment, according European statistics office Eurostat. Big exporters of industrial machinery, such as ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), could also be relatively favored by higher U.S.-China trade costs because they compete directly with U.S. firms such as Honeywell (N:HON), said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). ABB and Siemens enjoyed strong price gains on Thursday. Investors also pointed to European chipmakers such as ASML (AS:ASML) and Infineon  as likely to benefit from China switching away from U.S. semiconductor suppliers. Semiconductor stocks, which have led the rally in tech over the past year, are highly liquid and therefore easy for investors to short as a proxy to the trade war theme, the Northern Trust trader said.""A TAX ON SOUTHERN GERMAN AUTO""The complicated nature of global supply chains means tariffs on U.S. imports could also negatively impact European companies.Chinese tariffs on auto imports from the United States, for example, could disproportionately hurt European carmakers which export their products to China from U.S. plants.""If China passes an incremental 25 percent tax on U.S.-specific auto exports into China (on top of the existing 25 percent tariff for all global auto imports into China), then this is essentially a tax on southern German auto,"" Evercore analysts led by Arndt Ellinghorst said, pointing specifically to BMW and Mercedes SUVs built in America and exported to China.Asked about the Chinese tariffs,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said it would not speculate about ongoing negotiations.Companies with manufacturing sites in China could also get hurt.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts pointed to the healthcare sector, where medical technology companies GN Store (CO:GN), Sonova (S:SOON) and Philips (AS:PHG) have big Chinese manufacturing facilities.They mainly sell their products domestically, elsewhere in Asia and in Europe, however, so the impact would likely be limited, they said in a note.(GRAPHIC: Most traded goods globally - https://tmsnrt.rs/2uMHRhI)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Gulfstreams are the top-selling business jet brand in China, where they compete fiercely against Bombardier's Global series and, to a much lesser extent, against the smaller Falcon models of France's Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD).The United States remains the world's largest market for business jets, but the Greater China market is expected to be the fastest-growing major market over the next 20 years, with the fleet size more than doubling, according to a Bombardier forecast.Jackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based plane broker and charter firm JetSolution Aviation Group, said Gulfstream has traditionally been the market leader in China because it entered earlier, but Bombardier had increased marketing in the last three years in an effort to catch up.""It is just like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930),"" she said. ""They keep enhancing the product niches having the new generation of the models and competing with each other. This (the higher tax rate) will definitely favor Bombardier over Gulfstream's products.""Bombardier and Gulfstream representatives said that it was ""premature"" to comment on the Chinese tariffs, while Boeing said neither government had yet imposed the ""drastic measures"" while dialogue between the countries continued.COST ADVANTAGE FOR BOMBARDIERMainland China had a fleet of 318 business jets at the end of 2016, data from aviation consultancy Asian Sky Group shows.Of the mainland China business jet fleet, 102 were made by Gulfstream, 80 by Bombardier, 37 by Dassault, 15 by Airbus and 10 by Boeing.Growth in new jet sales stalled between 2013 and 2016 due to an anti-corruption drive that some led wealthy Chinese to buy used jets or charter them instead but brokers have since reported signs of a rebound.Gulfstream's G650 jets will continue to have unmatched flight range at the top end of the pure business jet segment until Bombardier brings the competing Global 7000 long-range jet into service this year.U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said that Bombardier would benefit if the trade battle is sustained.""Adding 25 percent to the cost of a G650ER is very good news for the Global 7000, just as it enters production,"" he said. The Gulfstream G650ER has a list price of around $67 million, versus the Global 7000 at around $73 million.Bombardier has marketed the Global 7000 heavily in countries like China, Singapore and Australia because of its ultra long range reaching Beijing to New York.""China remains an important international market for business aircraft with expectations that as airspace is continued to open that demand should follow,"" said Toronto-based AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray.But Murray said he would be cautious on any near-term benefit generated for the Global 7000 by Chinese tariffs on Gulfstream, in light of its heavy backlogs.""There is such a long wait for Bombardier to deliver the aircraft,"" jet broker Wu said.

The stakes are high. The United States exported $15 billion of aircraft to China in 2016, ranking equally with agricultural products like soybeans as the biggest category of goods.Several definitions of ""empty weight"" are used in the aircraft industry and the ministry document gave no explanation.Two industry experts said the rules most likely refer to the ""manufacturer's empty weight,"" or the core aircraft structure.But manufacturers are usually shy about publishing this number because of its commercial sensitivity, while they do give estimates for the slightly higher ""operating empty weight,"" which includes airline crew and some equipment, but not fuel.Yet even this number can vary according to an airline's specific requirements, so it is seen as a guideline. Whatever category is used, the range appears comfortably to include the current-generation 737 narrowbody aircraft, which is in the midst of being replaced by the newer 737 MAX.737 MAX 8 IMPACT UNCLEARBoeing documents available online list the ""operating empty weight"" (OEW) of the 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900 well within the tariff zone at 37.6 to 42.9 tonnes.The ""manufacturer's empty weight"" (MEW) would typically be about 1-1.5 tonnes lower, two airplane appraisal experts said.In contrast, the newer 737 MAX 8 is heavier than its predecessor, with an operating empty weight of 45,070 kg, according to a Boeing document published in August 2017.Depending on how rules are applied, this leaves it hovering close to the tariff border line and potentially still exposed to sanctions if the more conservative ""manufacturer"" scale is used.""I would expect a non-variable weight (MEW) to be used as the benchmark, as OEW will vary from operator to operator,"" said Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of UK-based advisory firm IBA, adding this would pull the jet below 45 tonnes.Even if the more generous OEW weight format were used, not all 737 MAX 8s might escape as some use lighter layouts. ""A 70kg drop is pretty easy once you get into the realms of low-cost carriers or standard single-class operations,"" Hatcher added.Boeing said in a statement that while the United States and China have both outlined positions that could harm the global aerospace industry, nothing drastic has happened yet. ""We will continue in our own efforts to proactively engage both governments and build on the recent assurances by U.S. and Chinese leaders that productive talks are ongoing,"" it said. Chinese airlines have been on a buying spree from Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) as air travel grows.Boeing and China's Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) are expected to open a 737 completion center in the coastal city of Zhoushan to install interiors and paint liveries this year.The bulk of published 737 orders from Chinese that have not yet been delivered are for the newer MAX version. However, China Southern Airlines (SS:600029), Ruili Airlines and Okay Airways each have two 737-800s on order and Xiamen Airlines has four more, according to the Boeing order book. Asked if the airline's plane buying plans could shift away from Boeing, China Eastern Airlines Corp (SS:600115) Chief Executive Ma Xulun said on Wednesday ""it's too early to say, we will keep an eye on the situation of the China-U.S. trade war.""Apart from some Boeing jets, the Gulfstream G650, a large corporate jet manufactured by General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), also falls into the weight range targeted for tariffs. Gulfstream declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The wider Mumbai market (BSESN) was up 0.25 percent. The latest agreement comes as Indian airlines rush to expand fleets to meet ever-increasing demand for domestic as well as international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia's third-largest economy.Domestic passenger traffic increased 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier for the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, showed data from the International Air Transport Association.Jet Airways Chief Executive Vinay Dube last month told reporters the airline was hoping to close the latest deal by the end of March.The airline finalised a separate deal to buy 75 other Boeing 737 MAX aircraft last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We confirmed our commitment to improve our competitiveness by signing a deal for an order of up to 42 aircraft.""It is the third time in 19 years that the carrier is investing in new airplanes, Vassilakis said, ""aiming to offer our passengers the newest and most technologically advanced planes as we remain focused on quality.""Aegean signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus. It said the agreement included a firm order of 30 aircraft from the A320neo family, with an option of 12 additional jets with new generation engines offering fuel savings of 15 percent.The agreement was part of a fleet expansion and renewal program expected to take place between 2020 and 2025, Aegean said.Ten of the 30 jetliners in the firm order will be Airbus A321 neo aircraft - which are part of the A320 family of planes - while the remaining 20 would be the slightly smaller A320 neo jets, an Airbus executive said.""Airbus offers a choice of powerplant between CFM Leap and Pratt and Whitney engines,"" the executive told Reuters, declining to be named. ""Boeing's 737 Max planes come only with CFM Leap engines.""Aegean's CEO said the carrier would decide on the type of engine and the mix of planes at a later stage.""The new airplanes are just the hardware,"" said Aegean's CEO Dimitris Gerogiannis. ""It is our people who make the difference, not the metal.""Aegean, which flies domestic and international routes, also owns former flag carrier Olympic Airlines, which was privatized in 2013. Most of its current leases need to be replaced between 2019 and 2023.Last year, Aegean grew full-year net earnings by 87 percent on an improved load factor and higher sales, riding a strong tourism year.

The main internal candidate is Guillaume Faury, the Frenchman who took over as planemaking boss last month. Airbus declined to comment. The mandate of the current chairman - Denis Ranque - runs until the annual general meeting in 2020.Obermann, who served as CEO of Deutsche Telekom from 2006 to 2013, is a partner at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.Handelsblatt said he was seen as an ideal candidate because he has experience running a company with state involvement, noting he also has an excellent reputation in France, where he was awarded a legion of honour.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) delivered its first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) on Sunday, rounding out a family of lightweight jets on which the U.S. planemaker is betting its future.The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.Goh called it a ""beautiful aircraft"" and an ""unparalleled product for regional operations.""Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models. The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the-air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long-distance flight. The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kilometers). At 223 feet long (68 meters), the aircraft is 18 feet (5.5 meters) longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide-body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines (O:AAL), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.(This story corrects Boeing executive's title and first name.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

No final decisions have been made at this time,"" an American spokesman said.Other parties declined to comment.Shares of American Airlines closed down 2.5 percent, while shares of Boeing were up 0.4 percent.Boeing's expected win deals a fresh blow to the struggling A330neo, weeks after Hawaiian Airlines dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favor of the 787, leaving that particular variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers.Airbus updated its profitable A330 series in 2014 with new Rolls-Royce engines, but after an initial foray, sales have been sluggish.Recently appointed sales chief Eric Schulz has made boosting A330neo sales a top priority this year.American Airlines (O:AAL) said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A330-900neo, which is in test flights before entering service this summer.Industry sources had said American was looking for about 25-30 wide-body jets, making a Boeing deal potentially worth some $7-8.5 billion.Aircraft analysts had predicted American's decision would be important for the health of the A330neo program, because a win there could spur further sales and prevent new defections.The latest setback is expected to trigger a scramble by Airbus to prevent the A330neo's top buyer - and one of its largest corporate customers - AirAsia (KL:AIRA), changing its mind after announcing it would stick with the A330neo.AirAsia executives visited Boeing earlier this month and have said they were examining the 787.There are also growing doubts over the fate of an order for 28 A330neo jets by IranAir, part of a deal for 100 Airbus jets, as U.S. President Donald Trump strikes an increasingly hawkish tone over the future of an international sanctions deal.Between them, AirAsia and IranAir make up over 40 percent of the current order book for the A330neo.Longer-term, Airbus faces deeper unease over its wide-body position in case failure to impose the A330neo leaves it over-dependent on a single model, the newer A350-900, according to two industry sources. Airbus insists the larger A350-1000 is also ripe for an upturn in sales after a recent calm period.Airbus officials also say other airlines are looking at the A330neo. Bloomberg News reported this week that the planemaker could introduce a freighter version.UK-based Rolls-Royce (L:RR) meanwhile denied a Bloomberg report that its Trent 7000 engines, which power the A330neo, were affected by issues on the Trent 1000, which is available on the 787 and which has faced reliability problems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A Boeing spokesman did not give a reason.The decision ""represents a positive development in the longstanding relationship between Canada and Boeing,"" Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said in a statement, in a sign of warming by the country's Liberal government toward the planemaker after tensions over the Bombardier dispute.It was not clear how Boeing's decision might affect its chances in a Canadian competition to order fighter jets worth between C$15 billion ($11.68 billion) and $C19 billion.Representatives for Canada's Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough and Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan - who share responsibility for buying military equipment - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Ottawa has said bids will be evaluated in part by whether firms have caused any past economic damage to Canada - a clear reference to the U.S. planemaker.In its case against Bombardier, Boeing had argued the CSeries benefited from unfair subsidies and was sold below cost to American carriers, heightening trade tensions between the planemaker, the United States and its allies Canada and the United Kingdom. The wings for the 110-130 seat jet are produced in Belfast.""Boeing should feel suitably chastened that their bullying approach was justly and robustly rejected,"" said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, in a statement on Friday.

327,"Mar 23, 2018 03:52AM ET",AirAsia switches to digital mode as it lightens load with leasing sale,nan,"By Anshuman Daga and Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tony Fernandes, the co-founder of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), is seeking to transform Asia's biggest budget airline into an asset-light, digitally focused firm after the $1 billion sale of its leasing business, in an effort to foster sustainable growth. AirAsia, which pioneered budget air travel in Asia along the lines of Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) in Europe, is now building a sprawling empire that includes a payments company, logistics firm, food and beverages brands and a loyalty program.Leveraging the profusion of customer data from its 65 million-plus passengers, the focal point of the strategy is a digital push that exceeds in scale that of regional budget airlines like Indonesia's Lion Group and Cebu Pacific of the Philippines.AirAsia will also be going head-to-head against flag carriers such as Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) which is ramping up investments in digital technology.The goal is to offset the volatile earnings from the cyclical airline business. ""The biggest asset is our data,"" Fernandes told Reuters in an interview. ""And we're going to monetize that data over a series of joint ventures in three kinds of pools.""That includes turning its loyalty program points into a more formal currency through an initial coin offering, building a bigger logistics business and growing its content offering.LOSS OF LEASING In the near term however, analysts say the move by one of Airbus's (PA:AIR) biggest global customers to part-lease its current and ordered fleet of 500-plus planes could hurt its profits and leave it exposed to the risk of higher lease rates.""The leasing arm was a stable low risk business,"" said Ngoi Se Chai, a partner at Hong Kong-based Oaklands Path Capital Management. ""Now that that's sold, earnings will come down and become more volatile. I think they sold something they shouldn't have sold."" While the sale proceeds from the leasing business will be used to reduce debt, the bulk will be paid out as special dividends, potentially limiting the upside in a stock that has more than quadrupled since hitting a seven-year low in late 2015.""The amount of money generated from this exercise could almost wipe out AirAsia's entire debts, so it would appear a positive move,"" said Shukor Yusof, founder of consultancy Endau Analytics, but he noted it faces risks associated with higher leasing rates.Leasing had accounted for around 20 percent of AirAsia's revenue, with a similar share earned from non-ticket items like baggage fees and food sales.The aim is to lift revenue from so-called ancillaries by 12 percent this year.AirAsia plans to launch remittance and lending products in Southeast Asia, through its BigPay debit card and mobile app in Singapore after the recent launch in Malaysia, BigPay's group CEO Chris Davison said.But for now, the company's non-flying revenue lags global low-cost leaders like  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) in the United States and Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings (L:WIZZ) in Europe that receive 40 percent of revenue from ancillaries, said Jay Sorensen, president of U.S.-based consultancy IdeaWorksCompany.He said AirAsia's food, in-flight Wi-Fi and loyalty programs were good offerings but its approach in pricing add-ons was not maximizing revenue because it only offered two bundled choices rather than three.""The best practice today is to present three choices at the same time, based upon a good, better and best model."" GOING DIGITALThe digital push is front and center as Fernandes restructures AirAsia into a listed group that oversees stakes in multiple airlines in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, India, Japan and soon Vietnam and China and digital ventures rather than having the listing based on its Malaysian airline.Combined, AirAsia forecasts the digital businesses will account for 7.6 percent of revenue this year, nearly half of its ancillary sales.Former CEO Aireen Omar, who became deputy group CEO in January, is overseeing the non-airline businesses in a single entity that will ultimately seek a U.S. listing.Corrine Png, CEO of research firm Crucial Perspective said AirAsia could triple its share price if it can successfully collect and monetize its Big Data.""AirAsia's current valuations are low as investors see it as a cyclical airline,"" she said. ""However, as its long-term revenue and earnings growth prospects improve, equity investors will start to value AirAsia like a growth stock.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A Canadian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Boeing's decision was ""good news"".The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) unanimously voted in January to reject Boeing's complaint and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat Bombardier CSeries jets for five years.The ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, the world's largest maker of jetliners, which accused Bombardier of dumping the planes, or selling them below cost, in the U.S. market.However, the ITC said it rejected placing duties on Bombardier jets partly because Boeing had lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.The ITC ruled the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta and Boeing's smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete.The smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers. Airbus SE (PA:AIR) has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).The Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal. It was not yet clear how Boeing's decision will impact the planemaker's relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion.

329,"Mar 22, 2018 01:50PM ET",Boeing loyalist Ryanair to fly first Airbus with Austria deal,nan,"By Conor Humphries and Victoria BryanDUBLIN/BERLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair's (I:RYA) plan to buy Laudamotion will add Airbus (PA:AIR) planes to the Irish low-cost carrier's fleet for the first time and could herald an improvement in relations with the European planemaker.The acquisition by one of the world's biggest airlines, which now operates 430 Boeing (N:BA) 737s, marks an unusual step in the low-cost business, where carriers tend to stick to a single aircraft type to keep costs down and operations simple.The move to buy 75 percent of Vienna-based Laudamotion could also signal a shift to form a multi-airline group in the low-cost business, mirroring traditional operators such as IAG (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) that each run several carriers.But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary is starting small with Airbus, although he said he had harbored aspirations to develop an Airbus fleet at Ryanair for ""some years"".The Laudamotion deal gives Ryanair 15 Airbus A320, with plans to double that in three years. By comparison, Ryanair aims to have 570 Boeing 737s in five years, ensuring it stays one of the biggest clients for the Seattle-based firm even as it forms a new link with the European manufacturer.""This obviously gives them more bargaining power,"" said Mark Simpson, an analyst at broker Goodbody, which has a ""buy"" rating for Ryanair. ""If they are going to 600 aircraft, do you have 400 Boeing and 200 Airbus? It gives them flexibility.""To keep costs down, Ryanair could choose to operate either Boeing or Airbus out of each base but not mix them, he said.Ryanair's ties with Airbus have been strained over the years. Former Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retired at the end of 2017, was furious at O'Leary for giving the impression he was about to sign a deal for 100 aircraft in 2002 before squeezing a better deal from Boeing.O'Leary has always declined to comment on the issue.But the departure of Leahy, who refused to pitch to O'Leary for a big 200-plane order in 2009, might change the dynamics.""Airbus never wanted to play ball with Ryanair, but it could be a new start with changes to the Airbus sales team and top management,"" aviation consultant John Strickland said.""VALUED CUSTOMER"" Ryanair has ordered 40 737s and 200 737 Max aircraft, part of plans to carry 200 million passengers a year by 2024. A Boeing spokesman did not comment on O'Leary's remark that he had long aspired to an Airbus fleet, saying: ""We look forward to continuing to meet the requirements of a valued customer.""O'Leary, who has donned a Seattle Seahawks American football shirt and delivered rousing speeches to Boeing workers, is credited for saving hundreds of jobs at the U.S. planemaker when he put in the order for 100 aircraft in 2002.Airbus may yet balk at trying to win O'Leary into a big order, in a bid to avoid a price war that might anger its own top buyers, like easyJet (L:EZJ), if they believed a rival low-cost carrier was securing a better deal for aircraft.But the growing size and clout of low-cost carriers means Ryanair is not alone in building bridges beyond traditional suppliers. Industry sources say a top easyJet executive was the guest speaker at a recent internal Boeing event.""It's not about today, but it is about keeping networks intact,"" one industry official told Reuters.Building broader relationships in the industry would make sense if Ryanair or easyJet ever moved to add wide-body jets to their fleet. Ryanair has previously said it would launch long-haul routes if it secured the right aircraft at the right price. O'Leary said on Tuesday that Laudamotion would operate as a separate entity in the Ryanair group, a move he also proposed when trying to acquire former Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, another Airbus operator. The airline eventually went to IAG. An investment banker who has advised Ryanair and IAG at different times said he expected O'Leary to build up a group of several airlines, starting with Ryanair, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, which is a charter carrier based in Poland with five planes. ""You create a group of airlines to compete with each other intensely - a kind of an IAG for low-cost carriers,"" he said. Ryanair is not alone in facing more complexity with an acquisition. All-Boeing operator Alaska Airlines bought Airbus operator Virgin America in 2016 for $2.6 billion. Still, some industry experts expect Alaska to switch back to Boeing, albeit when the Virgin America leases for Airbus planes expire in about 2022-2024. Similarly, they say O'Leary is unlikely to shift to Airbus with a big deal soon.""But it serves as a reminder to Boeing,"" Strickland said, ""never to become complacent.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The difference in prices is mostly because the cost of tickets on conventional routes has been falling.After United Airlines (N:UAL) started non-stop Singapore-Los Angeles flights last October, average ticket prices on one-stop rivals fell by 15 percent relative to 2016, according to  Expedia  Inc (O:EXPE) data provided to Reuters.That meant customers willing to pay 20 percent extra to fly United and save a few hours were only paying 2 percent more than they would have paid for one-stop flights a year earlier.""There is a lot of competitive pressure and those ultra-long haul flights are adding to it,"" said James Marshall, Expedia's vice president for transport partner services. ""The overall demand seems to be there but the pressure is on the price.""NEW TECHNOLOGYThe number of ultra-long haul flights - those over 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers) - has nearly tripled to 19 over the last decade, according to travel data provider OAG, as smaller, fuel-efficient twin-engine planes like Boeing Co's (N:BA) 787 and Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) A350 have entered service.""Being able to connect the major financial centers directly is going to be the main theme that is going to drive the success of these flights,"" said Richard Johnson, Carlson Wagonlit Travel's director of its solutions group for Asia Pacific. ""There needs to be premium demand and the airline needs to be the user of the newer generation of aircraft for any of these to be viable.”Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) expects to revive the world's longest non-stop commercial flight, from Singapore to New York, in the second half of this year after a five-year hiatus due to the new aircraft technology and lower fuel prices. Most of the new ultra-long routes are flown once a day on jets with fewer than half the number of seats as A380 superjumbos and an upsized business class. Fears they would threaten the business model of hub carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways have so far proven overblown.Instead, demand is rising as prices fall. American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel said bookings on all types of flights from Singapore to San Francisco rose 12 percent last year, with Singapore Airlines and United now offering non-stop service on the route in competition with one-stop rivals like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp (TW:2618). Singapore Airlines also still offers a flight to San Francisco with a brief stopover in Hong Kong. An airline spokesman said there were markets for both types of flights with price, timing and connections among the factors. Some of the seats on non-stop flights are filled at lower prices with connecting passengers on routes like Sydney-Perth-London or Jakarta-Singapore-San Francisco.PASSENGER MIXMany seats on the non-stop flights will be filled with corporate travelers, but companies are often price conscious and want employees to select the best fare, regardless of travel time.OAG's regional sales director for Japan and Asia-Pacific, Mayur Patel, said one-stop options in business class were popular on routes like Singapore-London because of the major price difference.""A lot of people used to fly Singapore Airlines, but because of the pricing the Gulf carriers are gaining share,"" he said.The average business-class ticket from Hong Kong to New York on non-stop flights with Cathay and United costs $8,600, compared with $7,200 on one-stop options, according to Carlson Wagonlit data, with Qantas achieving a $1,600 premium to rivals on Perth-London flights.""That might be the distinction where ultra-long-haul non-stop becomes the preserve of the senior exec or those who maybe have more time-critical business,"" Johnson said.Qantas (AX:QAN) International's chief executive, Ali Webster, said Perth-London flights that originate in Melbourne were also proving popular with corporate customers like mining companies BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO), which have big offices in all three cities.""It works very well for business travelers who can stop in Perth on their way from the east coast for meetings before carrying on to London,"" she said. ""That's exactly what a lot of our resources customers are doing.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The U.S. plane maker last year received 912 net orders after cancellations, while rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) received 1,109. Xiamen Airlines operates an all-Boeing fleet of more than 160 jets and the new airplanes will be used with subsidiaries including Hebei Airlines and Jiangxi Airlines, Boeing said in a statement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

332,"Mar 20, 2018 09:10AM ET",Pratt & Whitney to deliver spare A320neo engines soon to India's IndiGo: source,nan,"By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney will soon begin deliveries of spare engines to India's IndiGo airlines, which was forced to ground eight of its Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo aircraft last week after engine problems, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.P&W, owned by United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), will deliver two engines on Wednesday and the remaining within the next 40 days, said the source who did not want to identified.A series of in-flight engine failures prompted India's aviation regulator to ground 11 aircraft last week fitted with certain P&W engines and operated by IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier by market share, and rival GoAir.That led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and about a 5 percent fall in the share price of IndiGo's parent, InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), over the past week.A string of problems has clouded the rollout of P&W's new engines, with the U.S. aviation regulator warning in February that some engines fitted on the narrow-body A320neo planes posed a shutdown risk.IndiGo and GoAir have hundreds of A320neo planes on order but they, among other carriers, are facing delivery delays due to problems with the engines.IndiGo did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment, but said in a statement earlier on Tuesday it had canceled no more than 35 to 45 flights a day, which is around 3 percent of its schedule.""We are mindful of the inconvenience that some of our customers have had due to the cancellation,"" IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said in the statement. ""We are actively engaged with the engine manufacturer on getting all our aircraft back in the skies in the coming weeks.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

333,"Mar 16, 2018 07:44PM ET",Boeing moves to keep 777X on track after engine snag,nan,"By Tim HepherSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has scrambled to reorganize testing of its new 777X to avoid being delayed by engine snags, while robots and mechanics are starting work on the fuselage, the executive who heads efforts to build the world's largest twin-engined jet said in an interview.Engine supplier  General Electric  (N:GE) began flight trials of its new GE9X jet engine on Tuesday after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor. But to put the engine development back on track it must build a new component.During that time, Boeing will place two temporary engines on the first flight-test aircraft that is gradually beginning to take shape, starting with its lightweight carbon wings and now the fuselage, which Boeing says is on schedule.The engines, identical in every other respect to the ones that will go into service, will be swapped for fresh ones with the new part before the first 777X carries out its maiden flight next year. The temporary engines will not be fired up, but having them in place will allow other tests to go ahead.""Honestly, when this happened I thought 'this is going to be bad' and we just kept grinding and grinding at it, and we came up with some pretty creative things to test where we could, build where we could,"" 777X Vice President and General Manager Eric Lindblad told Reuters.""To put engines on and then take them off - that is all to protect the schedule,"" Lindblad said.The hurried rejig reflects the fact that after years of planning, production has begun in earnest - something evident from activity inside Boeing's new high-tech wing center.""We are at the point where it is time to start scaling up the speed that we build things here,"" Lindblad said inside the 1.3 million-square-foot (120,800-square-meter) fabrication plant where machines weave and bake major parts of the carbon wings.The engine swap is also an example of how Boeing is trying to avoid eating into the 'buffer' traditionally built into development schedules. That's because it faces a challenging two years before the latest version of its 777 enters service.""We are now in the thick of it ... There is no more waiting until later to solve problems,"" Lindblad said. ""There are still two years left. You cannot give away your buffer."" The 777X aims to maintain Boeing's grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market by leapfrogging Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) 365-seat A350-1000. Boeing has sold over 300 jets, though activity has slowed.'MORE OPTIMISTIC'So far, Boeing says it is on track to meet a 2020 target for delivering the first 406-seat 777-9 model to Emirates Airline.But although the engine snag marks the first significant public slippage, Boeing has already faced a number of teething problems in building carbon wings and other components.""Everything is hard at this point where you start building an airplane. When you ask me how wing assembly has been going, it's been hard,"" Lindblad said.One of the problems involves fitting the carbon panels to the skeleton of spars and ribs, with the light but strong carbon-fiber material less forgiving than traditional aluminum.""Assuming we continue to march our way through the plan that we have laid out, I feel pretty optimistic about (the engine) and I think that wing assembly is a matter of incorporating the learnings,"" Lindblad said.Six months ago, Lindblad says something else was making him feel ""queasy"". Integration of aircraft systems in a special demonstration lab was not happening as quickly as planned.""I am more optimistic today,"" he said. He added that he would be ""cautiously guarded"" until the first flight, due in the first quarter of 2019.Another headache has been producing enough wing stringers: reinforcing strips that go outwards from the fuselage.""I feel confident we have got a plan for that so we are tracking basically back to schedule.""Now Boeing must marry together the various wing parts and produce the long metallic fuselage.Fuselage panels arriving from Japan have been loaded into a ""Fuselage Automated Upright Build"" (FAUB) machine used to fasten them. Boeing had delays when the machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777, but Boeing says the system is now running at full speed of five planes a month.Drawing on experience of the smaller 737 MAX, which has absorbed production increases on a larger scale, Lindblad said the 777X production system had been set up to handle a targeted speed but would not disclose capacity.""We are planning for world demand,"" he said.The first task is to get flight trials under way so that ambitious fuel-saving goals can be tested.""Will we get four airplanes in the flight test on schedule? We'll see. I think we have a pretty good shot at it.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

334,"Mar 16, 2018 05:04PM ET",Boeing 737 Max 7 narrowbody jetliner makes maiden flight,nan,"By Tim HepherSEATTLE (Reuters) - The smallest member of Boeing Co's (N:BA) upgraded narrowbody jetliner range, the 138-seat 737 MAX 7, began a maiden flight on Friday, the start of several months of trials before entering service next year, the company said.The shortened 737, designed for hot and high conditions or longer journeys than larger narrowbody jets, took off in sunny weather near Seattle at 10:17 a.m. (1717 GMT), watched by Boeing workers and media. The plane was expected to fly for about three hours over Washington state.The aircraft is the third and smallest member of Boeing's 737 MAX line-up, but has posted relatively modest sales with fewer than 100 estimated orders out of 4,000 for the MAX family.Even before taking to the skies, the 737 MAX 7 was thrust into an international dispute when Boeing argued its future was being placed at risk by aggressive discounting by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), straining U.S.-Canadian trade relations.A U.S. trade tribunal in January overturned steep duties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on the Bombardier CSeries, saying Boeing had not been harmed by CSeries prices.Most analysts say demand for such jets, including the competing Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A319neo, is limited as airlines tend to switch to higher-capacity versions to keep up with demand.""I want to put a yet on that,"" Boeing product marketing regional director Jeff Haber said when asked why the aircraft had not sold as well as larger models.There are about 2,500 aircraft of its size flying that will need to be replaced in future, Haber said.""We see a significant market in Asia ... and South America,"" he said.Boeing, which does not break down 737 MAX sales by variant, declined to say how many MAX 7s it had sold but said it had eight customers including Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and Westjet Airlines Ltd (TO:WJA).The company is increasing narrowbody production to meet record overall demand for the 737, which last week celebrated its 10,000th aircraft since the 1968 debut of its now largely upgraded design.It faces another milestone when the first 737 MAX 9 is delivered to its first customer next week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

336,"Mar 13, 2018 07:33AM ET",New Boeing jet to accelerate services shake-up,nan,"By Tim Hepher(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes.Unlike Boeing's last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board.But it will give the world's largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft’s decades-long lifespan.Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet.""If we decide to launch, it's a big investment and it's an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters.""So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,"" he said.Until recently, Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops.Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011), which supplies the 787's carbon wings - in command of key components.While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators.""That seems a little out of balance, doesn't it?"" said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part's design.""We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,"" he said. The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins. Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade. The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems (N:UTX), a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts.ENGINEERING DEPTHThe aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is banking on maintenance.But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016.To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue.""It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,"" Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers.Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing's designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket. Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters.""It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,"" Muilenburg commented.The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources.Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation. While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years. Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets.Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing's cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income.""The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,"" he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute raised questions over jobs at Northern Ireland's largest industrial plant and drew warnings to Boeing over its UK ties from Prime Minister Theresa May, who depends on a Northern Ireland party for her majority.Although Bombardier receives some UK development funding, UKEF had long resisted Canadian requests to finance CSeries exports that partly compete with those of Airbus (PA:AIR), the European plane giant which employs 12,000 people in the UK.The decision to provide support reflects a power shift in the aerospace industry after Airbus agreed to buy a majority of the struggling CSeries last year, and is viewed by some experts as a reminder of ongoing UK interest in the CSeries' future.""It is a small amount of money but a signal to Boeing,"" a European trade source said, asking not to be identified.For its part, Boeing has signaled it would sue Bombardier again if provoked to do by what it regards as unfair pricing of CSeries jets. But there are signs it is trying to defuse the row as it highlights investments in Canada and Britain. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters last week Boeing was still examining whether to appeal the International Trade Commission decision to overturn CSeries duties.APPEAL DEADLINEHowever, trade analysts say an appeal looks increasingly unlikely, ahead of a March 12 deadline, as Boeing seeks to smooth over a row which soured relations with Canada and Britain and resulted in the loss of a Boeing fighter sale to Canada.""We are very mindful of the relationships that we have in Canada and ... we do about $4 billion of supply chain work in Canada every year,"" Muilenburg told Reuters.""But we also want to make sure that we continue to set a standard for a fair playing field and that we all play by the same rules, and that will be our consistent theme."" Other potential obstacles to UK CSeries aid were lifted when UKEF eased a two-year ban on Airbus funding, resulting from misleading bids that triggered an Anglo-French corruption probe.Airbus said last month it had reached agreement allowing the funding to resume on a case-by-case basis. Korean Air took delivery of its first CSeries in December, becoming the first Asian operator. Its order for 10 jets, with options for at least another 10, suggests the main beneficiary of UKEF support will be Airbus rather than Bombardier. The Airbus CSeries tie-up is expected to be approved in a matter of months.Last July, Boeing itself became an indirect recipient of UK export support when UKEF said it was backing two Boeing 787s to Poland's LOT Airlines. However, the aid is tied mainly to Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines rather than the airframes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We are committed to ensure that new airports are built, better air space management services are provided, so that there is no congestion in the skies,"" Choubey said at the Wings India airshow.Indian airlines are scrambling to add more jets to meet demand for more domestic and international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for jet manufacturers Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA).""The growth of the domestic Indian (aviation) market is the highest in the world,"" Boeing Senior Vice President Asia Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar said. ""Every segment of traffic in and out of India is going to grow for the next 20 years.""Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia's third-largest economy.Jet Airways hopes to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its CEO Vinay Dube told reporters on the sidelines of the airshow. The airline last year finalised a deal to buy a separate 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and said it was in ""serious talks"" for 75 more. Dube said it would finalize the deal with one of the plane manufacturers, alluding to Boeing or Airbus. AirAsia India is looking to expand its fleet to 60 jets from the current 14 over the next five years, a spokeswoman said. The airline's parent, AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), said in January it was considering an IPO of the Indian arm.Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet said in July it had signed a provisional deal to buy 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is aimed at replacing the Patriot air defense system fielded in the 1980s.Dietmar Thelen, the top MBDA executive in the venture, said its formation was the next natural step for the long-time business partners. He said the move did not mean a contract was imminent but the two sides were making progress.""We're getting closer every day,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.The German defense minister announced in 2015 that it had chosen the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) -- developed with $4 billion in funding from Germany, Italy and the United States -- over Raytheon Co's (N:RTN) Patriot system.However, the two sides have been struggling to work out the details and terms of the program ever since.Discussions between the companies and the government were complicated by new procurement guidelines aimed at increasing the transparency of the process and reducing the risk of technical delays and cost overruns endemic on new projects.Government sources said the initial proposal submitted by MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), also lacked the required detail and specificity. Gregory Kee, who will lead the venture from the Lockheed side, said the ministry's procurement arm was expecting a single prime contractor to deliver the new weapons system.""This formal registration of the joint venture is intended to provide that capability to act as a single prime contractor to ensure that our German customer receives the most advanced system in the world,"" he said.Both executives declined to forecast when the contract could be finalised.""We continue to support the process and are responding to the government’s requirements. We respect that process. Until that process is complete, we can't talk about the price or the timetable,"" Kee said.The TLVS program was initially slated to cost about 4 billion euros ($4.96 billion), but sources familiar with the proposal say the final cost is likely to be several billion euros higher.The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States, though the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The city, home to more than 15 million people, must depend on the ""fighting spirit"" and diligence of its cadres, he said. Seeking to ease possible concerns that such measures would imply lesser efforts to hit economic targets, Li added: ""Higher-quality growth does absolutely not mean small amount of development and low-speed growth."" The city is aiming for a 5 percent GDP growth in 2018.To ensure officials are doing their work, Discipline Inspection Chief Deng said Tianjin will treat the campaign as a ""revolution"" that would involve constant self-inspection, open investigations and secret interviews and background checks.Looking to be a high-tech manufacturing and logistics hub, it currently hosts production centers for foreign aviation giant Airbus (PA:AIR) and data storage centers for Chinese technology firms such as Tencent (HK:0700).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

346,"Mar 06, 2018 10:01AM ET",Aero engine maker Safran planning for worst-case cliff-edge Brexit,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - French aeronautics supplier  Safran  is contingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit that disrupts cross-border supply chains and could lead to divergence in British and European Union regulations, a senior company director said on Tuesday.Marie de Saint-Cheron, Safran's (PA:SAF) director for European Affairs, said she considered the proposed transition too short a period to negotiate new treaties and added that a hard Brexit, whereby World Trade Organisation rules apply, could not be ruled out.""It's a scenario we are preparing ... hoping that what we get is not as severe,"" Saint-Cheron told a panel discussion, sat beside a British official from the Department for Exiting the EU.British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday said Britain will not join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, worrying businesses such as Safran, whose British activities include the production of landing and transmission systems for jets.May also said Britain would explore how it could remain a member of a handful of specialist institutions like the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Safran's LEAP engine, made in a joint venture with GE Aviation (N:GE), powers all Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.Saint-Cheron described regulatory divergence as the ""key risk"", despite May's attempts to reassure concerns felt in the aviation industry.""What we worry about is that after the transition period ... regulatory divergence begins. And in that case it will be very difficult for us to work together,"" she said.Saint-Cheron said Safran did not envisage for now moving any of its subsidiaries out of Britain. In the event of a hard Brexit, she added, Safran would likely start by repatriating operations that do not require heavy investments, such as its maintenance operations.Aviation industry players are pressing May for more certainty over the way borders will work.Under a 1980 agreement among 32 members of the WTO, civil aerospace parts are not subject to duties. But the aerospace industry is concerned that extra paperwork caused by new customs borders may introduce expensive delays.Chris Hobley, director for market access at Britain's Department for Exiting the EU, said London wanted a ""strong, deep and ambitious"" relationship with the EU.He also reiterated May's pledge of a ""strong commitment"" to regulatory standards that remain as high as those of the EU.Airbus (PA:AIR), which manufactures its wings in Britain, said last week it might have to stockpile parts to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the EU. Saint-Cheron said customs data shows Safran makes some 70,000 France-to-Britain cross-border operations annually. ""We're thinking about putting people in place, and an IT system, to manage customs clearing,"" Saint Cheron told Reuters after the event. ""One or two additional days (at the border) will be costly so we're trying to put in place a system which would be smooth enough to avoid such delays in the supply chain.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

347,"Mar 06, 2018 08:39AM ET",IAG's Walsh calls for cheaper A380s as it considers fleet plan for Level,nan,"By Sarah YoungBRUSSELS (Reuters) - IAG (L:ICAG) could consider buying more A380s from Airbus (PA:AIR) if the superjumbo was cheaper, CEO Willie Walsh said, adding that he was also looking at planes for the airline group's new carrier Level.IAG operates the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus airlines, as well as Level, a low cost unit launched last year which flies between Europe and the United States.IAG already operates 12 A380s, and could be interested in buying more if Airbus improved the pricing, Walsh said, although the airline was not currently negotiating with Airbus. ""The pricing that Airbus has offered in the past is unacceptable to us,"" Walsh said on the sidelines of a conference hosted by industry body Airlines for Europe. ""We've said very clearly to Airbus if they want to sell A380s they need to be aggressive on pricing and when they work out how to sell the aircraft, knock on our door and we'll talk to them."" Airbus secured the future of the superjumbo when it agreed a deal with airline Emirates in January for up to 36 A380s worth as much as $16 billion at list prices.For Barcelona-based Level, Walsh said he would need to buy planes to meet a plan to grow the fleet to 30 aircraft by 2022, and would consider a number of different aircraft. ""I think in five years' time, I think there might be opportunities for a different aircraft type,"" he said, suggesting that Level would not just stick to the A330s it currently operates.""There are Airbus options with the A330-neo or the A350 and as I said more and more we'll see Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s becoming available at that stage,"" Walsh said, noting that 787s may become an option in the coming years, if their price comes down or second-hand planes become available. Those decisions may fall to Level's new chief executive. Walsh said IAG was in the final stages of interviews to appoint a CEO for Level.Among Walsh's other concerns is the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport in London, where IAG's biggest airline British Airways is based.IAG would be interested in running terminals at Heathrow, Walsh said. The company already runs a terminal at JFK airport in New York and Walsh cited the example of Munich's terminal 2, run as a joint venture between airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and the airport, as a ""good example"" of how this can be done. ""Would I like to run Terminal 5? Absolutely,"" Walsh said when asked about his interest in running parts of Heathrow. Walsh has long-complained about the cost of a proposed new runway at Heathrow, and a lack of competition at the airport, and has recently called for Britain to allow other operators to build facilities and run terminals at Heathrow. ""We know how to do it (run terminals) and we know the benefit that that can bring so we're open to doing it,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

348,"Mar 05, 2018 02:30PM ET","Exclusive: Airbus sets services goal, targets productivity gains",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenues from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said. It also targets measures worth 450 million euros ($555 million) in 2018 to improve productivity and has told staff reducing recurring costs on its newest jets - the A320neo and A350 - remains a battle, they said, citing internal postings.The latest sign of competitive pressures comes as Airbus (PA:AIR) prepares to announce possible job cuts due to slower production of its largest aircraft - the A380 superjumbo and theA400M military air lifter - at a staff meeting on Wednesday. Airbus said earlier it would address implications of the slowdown at a works council meeting, but described reports of3,600 jobs cuts or redeployments as ""excessive"". Like rival Boeing (N:BA), Airbus is driving down manufacturing costs while branching into more profitable services, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties who traditionally control the market for repairs and services. However it has so far given little detailed guidance on targets by business activity. An Airbus spokesman, in response to a Reuters query, confirmed the $10 billion service revenue target for the main jets division. He said the company has for some years had a rolling productivity target, but declined to give details. ""Like any leading company ... year-on-year we strive for continuous improvements, unleashing further efficiencies in every business area, strengthening our competitiveness and focusing on our customers,"" the spokesman said. DIGITAL SERVICES Chief Executive Tom Enders told analysts last month the total services business across Airbus's jetliner, helicopter, defense and space activities was worth 9-10 billion euros. He said Airbus mainly aims to improve that through internal growth, striking a different tone from Boeing which has been more explicit about eyeing acquisitions on its way to a goal of more than tripling services revenues to $50 billion by 2027. ""...certainly, we don't exclude other measures but the focus is not on M&A. The focus is on organic growth of the services business,"" Enders told analysts. Airbus Commercial made up 76 percent of revenue in 2017. Enders has put emphasis on new digitally based services such as its new Skywise predictive maintenance system, following deals with AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways. But while setting its sights on the after market, Airbus has been wrestling with delays and sporadic reliability problems, which it blames partly on engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX). A number of planes have been forced out of service temporarily to switch engines, but the internal targets suggest Airbus is also concerned about quality problems that fall more directly under its control, two industry sources said. Airbus aims to reduce the number of ""aircraft on ground"" incidents by at least 30 percent over the next two years. It also aims to cut by 20 percent the amount of time it takes to come up with a fix for a problem when it is identified after a plane has entered service. Inside its factories, it aims to reduce the amount of costly outstanding or out-of-sequence work and ensure that 85 percent of quality checks known as ""green quality gates"" are successful. The cost-and-quality drive comes as Airbus accelerates record output to meet demand - a trend that can quickly create headaches if productivity lags behind. Airbus aims to boost deliveries by 11 percent to 800 aircraft in 2018, including 30that it could not hand over last year due to engine problems. Reaching that goal and ensuring over 80 percent of jets are delivered on time is essential, Airbus staff have been told.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Temer must ultimately approve any deal. ""Nothing has been decided on the partnership between the two companies,"" Temer's top spokesman Marcio de Freitas told Reuters. ""The Defense Ministry received the proposal and sent it to the president, but it still has to be studied and there are still some doubts about the matter,"" he added, without providing further details. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said this month the company has been working on a deal for years, but added it was not essential. Boeing spokesman Phil Musser reaffirmed that stance in an email on Tuesday, calling a combination with Embraer ""a win-win for all."" Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker, said in a securities filing that no details of the talks have been set in stone, which was echoed by Temer's office. Questions remain about each company's stake, however.Brazilian business newspaper Valor, citing sources close to Temer, reported Embraer would take a substantial 49 percent of the new company. But people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters Boeing would only agree to a joint venture in which it held 80 percent to 90 percent of the company and had full operational control.The potential deal has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems.The Brazilian government holds a ""golden share"" in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in controlling interest.Boeing has worked to overcome the Brazilian military's objections with alternatives that would preserve the government's strategic veto rights and ensure safeguards for its defense programs, sources have told Reuters.

356,"Feb 26, 2018 08:30PM ET",JetBlue talks pick up with planemakers over replacing jets,nan,"MONTREAL/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Jet Blue  Airways Corp (O:JBLU) met with Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and also had plans to meet with Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) this month, according to an internal email reviewed by Reuters, in a signal that talks are picking up for the U.S. airline's closely watched sales campaign.Low-cost carrier JetBlue has previously said it is weighing whether to replace its fleet of about 60, 100-seater E-190 jets, in a campaign pitting Bombardier's CSeries against its Brazilian rival's latest model, the E190-E2.JetBlue officials also met Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare at the company's Montreal-area plant on Monday, said an industry source, confirming earlier media reports. The source said JetBlue had not finalized a deal with either planemaker. A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment on a sales campaign.JetBlue said in a statement it is ""exploring a full range of options from maintaining the current fleet to a full replacement with an alternative aircraft type."" Embraer is determined to keep JetBlue as a key customer, while Bombardier wants to grow sales in the United States after a trade agency ruled the Canadian plane-and-train-maker could sell its 110-to-130 seat CSeries to American carriers duty-free following a dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA).The Feb. 17 email says ""the Bombardier team was in to discuss product support and maintenance for its C Series. And later this month, we’ll have a chance to take a close-up look at the Embraer E2."" It was not clear whether JetBlue already saw the E2 and a spokesman for Embraer could not immediately answer Monday night.In January, JetBlue said it would prolong an internal review over the future of its fleet at a time of an evolving landscape for commercial aviation. Embraer is now holding tie-up talks with Boeing and Bombardier is working to complete a deal giving a majority stake in the CSeries to Airbus SE (PA:AIR).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Boeing has sought Brazilian government approval of the partnership with Embraer that would create a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense unit, Reuters reported three weeks ago.The Valor Economico newspaper later reported that Boeing's proposal would give it an 80 percent to 90 percent stake in a new commercial jet business with Embraer.Embraer is the world's third largest planemaker and the leader in the 70-seat to 130-seat regional jet market.With the proposed tie-up Boeing would be the market leader in the smaller passenger jet market, creating stiffer competition for the CSeries aircraft program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).Boeing's initial plan to buy Embraer was rejected by the Brazilian government because it did not want a foreign company to control its defense unit for strategic security reasons.The government maintains a so-called golden share in Embraer, a former state enterprise, that gives it veto power over strategic decisions, including Boeing's push for a tie-up.On Thursday Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann told reporters that Boeing had understood Brazil's refusal to give up control of Embraer. He said negotiations on the creation of a third company were advancing well.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

360,"Feb 21, 2018 07:40AM ET",Pratt may revert to previous engine seal for A320neo: sources,nan,"BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Engine maker Pratt & Whitney is likely to return to a previous seal as a way of temporarily dealing with the latest issues on the geared turbofan engine for the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo, according to several people familiar with the matter. Some A320neo jets were grounded this month and deliveries were halted after problems arose in January and safety authorities warned of the risk of inflight engine shutdown. Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), has said the latest problems stem from an engineering change the company made last summer to the ""knife-edge seal"" in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine.The people said the most likely option for now was a return to the old seal, which was removed over durability issues. An Airbus spokesman referred technical questions to Pratt. The U.S. company was not immediately available for comment.Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said last week that deliveries to customers should resume in April.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is believed to have gone down in a mountainous area near the town of Semirom.No one is expected to have survived.The deputy governor of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province was quoted by state media as saying the wreckage was found near Dengezlu city, in Semirom county, in Isfahan province.A few minutes later, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation said it could not confirm the wreckage had been discovered.""We are facing a total enigma. We do not know anything about the crash,"" Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency shortly after his arrival in Semirom.Iran asked European countries and China to help the search with satellite imagery, Iranian Space Agency deputy head Mojtaba Saradeghi was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.A member of the Red Crescent rescue team was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency that ""a dark spot"" had been seen near Dengezlu village that ""might be a trace to the crashed plane"".ISNA did not elaborate. GLACIAL TEMPERATURESGlacial temperatures and mountainous terrain hampered rescue teams.Helicopters and mountain rescue personnel from the armed forces and the Red Crescent, as well as local volunteers, were involved in the search, state television reported""Five units started the search operation in the early hours of the morning, in -16 degrees,"" a local Red Crescent official was quoted as saying by IRNA news agency, reporting minus 16 degrees Celsius or 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit.Military reconnaissance drones were also searching the area.The twin-engined turboprop ATR 72 was just over 24 years old. According to data cited by the Flight Safety Foundation’s aviation-safety.net website, it had been restored to service just three months ago after being in storage for six years.Planemaker ATR said the cause of the accident was not yet known. Based in the French city of Toulouse, ATR is a joint venture between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF).Iran has suffered several plane crashes in the past few decades. Tehran blames U.S. sanctions for preventing it from importing new aircraft or spare parts. A deal with world powers on Iran's nuclear program has lifted some of those sanctions, opening the way for Iranian airlines to update their fleets.Aseman signed a deal last year to buy at least 30 Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX jets. National carrier Iran Air has ordered 80 planes from Boeing and 100 from Airbus.A Boeing 727 plane crashed in northwestern Iran in 2011, killing 78 people, and a Caspian Airlines Tupolev bound for Armenia crashed in 2009, killing 168.In February 2003, an Ilyushin-76 troop carrier crashed in southeast Iran, killing all 276 Revolutionary Guard soldiers and crew.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

363,"Feb 16, 2018 02:50PM ET",Airbus sees initial details of Franco-German fighter in second half 2018,nan,"By Andrea Shalal and Sabine SieboldMUNICH (Reuters) - Initial details of a planned Franco-German program to develop a next-generation fighter jet should emerge in the second half of 2018, the head of Airbus's (PA:AIR) defense unit told Reuters on Friday.Dirk Hoke said France and Germany would work out in coming months how to proceed with the program, including whether to bring in an additional partner country, such as Britain.""We expect basic issues, such as how the project will be structured, to be discussed in the second quarter, so that the initial contours will be set in the second half of the year,"" Hoke, chief executive of Airbus Defence and Space, said in an interview during the Munich Security Conference.He said Airbus supported bringing other countries into the program, which is envisioned as a family of systems rather than just a single new aircraft, noting that other countries could bring their expertise to bear on various aspects.No decisions had been made on which company would lead the new program, he said, noting that different firms could lead different segments of the broad project. Much would also depend on the level of investment pledged by participating countries, he added.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in July announced plans to jointly develop a successor for the Eurofighter Typhoon.The new combat system could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft and would eventually replace the Rafale and Eurofighter, rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales, as well as the older Panavia Tornado.Hoke said it was imperative to avoid mistakes made in the last big European military program, the troubled A400M military transporter, which has been plagued with cost overruns and technical challenges.""It's important that the specifications (for the new fighter jet program) are developed with a sense of proportion,"" he said. He said it was important to ""prevent requirements that are too comprehensive and that cannot be delivered by industry.""Airbus this week took a further 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) charge on the A400M program for 2017, bringing total charges on the project to over 8 billion euros. But it said agreement by NATO buyers to stretch out the delivery schedule and accept certain changes would limit future losses.Hoke lauded an agreement reached this month by NATO buyers, Airbus and the OCCAR pan-European procurement agency to negotiate a new delivery schedule for the aircraft.He said he was confident that agreements with individual countries could be finalised by the end of the year, and said the declaration of intention had helped repair frayed relations with A400M buyer nations.""It was a very constructive cooperation, and there was strong support from all participants,"" he said. ""I believe we have significantly improved relations.""Hoke said Airbus expected to release details about the next steps on a European program to develop a drone by late April at the Berlin air show.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I am hopeful we can bring that deal to a successful conclusion... We have some work to do, but we are making clear progress,"" Muilenburg told CNBC.Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer would give it a leading share of the smaller passenger jet market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries aircraft program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR). Both Boeing and Airbus are raising production rates for new commercial aircraft to record levels as they compete with each other for orders amid strong demand for air travel. Muilenburg told CNBC the company was ramping up capital expenditure as a percentage of its revenue, with help from recent cuts in the U.S. tax rates.Boeing expects to makes more than 900 aircraft a year, up from the record 763 in 2017 and 810-815 aircraft deliveries expected in 2018, Muilenburg said, adding that higher production would drive cash flow.""Last year, our operating cash flow was a little over $13 billion. This year we're guiding to $15 billion of operating cash flow,"" Muilenburg said.When asked about the possibility of a trade skirmish between the United States and China, Muilenburg said he was keeping a close eye on dialogues between the two countries.""We've had very good dialogue with the administration, as well as with our Chinese customers and the Chinese government.

The main European stock index was still down 6.5 percent from its 2 1/2-year peak hit as recently as Jan. 23.Cyclical sectors drove the market higher, with basic resources, industrials, banks and technology stocks the best performers, recovering from their sharp drop last week.The rapid recovery from a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation reported on Wednesday took some by surprise, and investors said the bounce back indicated underlying strength in the market. ""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.""Earnings took center stage once more, with strong results driving the top gainers Airbus,  Ipsen  (PA:IPN),  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).Airbus (PA:AIR) shares jumped 8.8 percent after Europe's largest aerospace firm beat profit and earnings expectations, though it booked a new 1.3 billion euro charge on its A400M military plane.Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) was a top CAC 40 gainer, up 5 percent after the electrical equipment producer reported a strong profit margin despite headwinds from the rise in the euro.Shares in Dutch insurer Aegon (AS:AEGN) gained 3.7 percent after the firm reported a doubling of quarterly net income and raised estimates for future earnings, thanks to a tax cut in the U.S. where it does around 60 percent of its business.Insurer  NN Group  (AS:NN) fared less well than its rival Aegon. The Dutch firm's shares fell 3 percent after it reported profit undershooting analysts' expectations. Another notable faller was Nestle (S:NESN) whose shares hit a 10-month low, down 2.4 percent after the Swiss food giant reported last year's organic growth was the weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996.Meanwhile bank and insurance firm  Old Mutual  (L:OML), and mining company  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose to the top of Britain's FTSE 100 after President Jacob Zuma resigned in South Africa, sending the rand to near three-year highs.Both firms derive a high proportion of their revenue in South Africa, where the parliament was set to confirm Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president later on Thursday.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm, embroiled in an accounting scandal, said it would hold its annual shareholders' meeting on April 20.Overall fourth-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the previous year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.""Earnings estimates have also been raised, so that's definitely one of the supporting factors of the rally,"" said Robeco's Daalder.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

370,"Feb 15, 2018 05:00AM ET",Electric airplane start-up Eviation aims to enter service in 2021 after battery deal,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Electric airplane start-up Eviation Aircraft Ltd is aiming for its 9-seat commuter aircraft to be flying passengers by 2021 after signing up South Korea's Kokam as its battery supplier, the Israeli company's chief executive said on Thursday.Venture capital-backed Eviation is one of a number of companies looking to develop small electric aircraft that would incur lower energy and operating costs, release less emissions and be quieter than their conventionally fueled counterparts.Airbus SE (PA:AIR),  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Uber Technologies Inc are also investigating electric and hybrid aircraft technology.Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay said his firm signed a deal with Kokam last week because, as a smaller supplier, Kokam was able to make batteries more specific to his company's needs.""If I would go today to Samsung (KS:005930) or Panasonic or LG Chem or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for that matter and say I need a different cell size, they will probably laugh because the number of cells we are going to buy is not significant enough to start the design process,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview.The battery will have 9,400 cells distributed throughout the aircraft including the ceiling, floor and wings, weighing 3.8 tonnes, or 60 percent of the maximum takeoff weight.Electric airplanes are reliant on improvements in battery technology, which is why smaller aircraft are likely to be electrified years before large commercial jets.Batteries are heavy and store far less energy per kilogram than jet fuel, but the ratio is improving gradually each year, allowing electric cars and airplanes longer ranges than they had previously.Eviation's ""Alice"" airplane is expected to have a range of up to 650 nautical miles (1200 kilometers), compared to 1000 nautical miles for a similar-sized conventional Cessna Caravan. It will cost $2 million-plus, on par with the Cessna, but have far lower fuel and maintenance costs, Bar-Yohay said.Eviation hopes to fly the Alice demonstrator for the first time by the end of the year, with the first public display at the Paris Airshow in mid-2019, he said. Moving to commercial production after that would require raising around $100 million of capital.Given the advantages of going electric, major manufacturers are also investing in electric and hybrid aircraft technology.Seattle-area startup Zunum Aero, backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), announced plans in October to bring a 12-seat hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.Airbus is working on the CityAirbus concept, a four-passenger electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoffs and landings, with the first demonstrator flight expected later this year. Ride-hailing firm Uber is exploring a similar concept with Uber Elevate."
371,"Feb 14, 2018 08:25PM ET","U.S. ITC details why it rejected CSeries duties, says Boeing not hurt",nan,"By Allison Lampert and Lesley WroughtonMONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An independent U.S. trade body on Wednesday said it rejected hefty U.S. duties on Bombardier's CSeries jets partly because Boeing lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.The International Trade Commission published its reasoning three weeks after announcing the decision.The ITC said the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta (N:DAL) and Boeing Co's (N:BA) smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete. It also said Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries sale to Delta did not come at Boeing's expense as the planemaker did not offer any new aircraft to the No. 2 U.S. carrier.""Boeing lost no sales or revenues,"" the ITC said in its 194-page ruling.""The higher standard seating capacity of the 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 limits competition between those models and the CS100 for some purchasers,"" it said.It was not yet clear whether Boeing will seek to appeal the ITC's decision, a move that could generate uncertainty at a time when the U.S. planemaker's European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) plans to take a majority stake in the CSeries program. The ITC determined on Jan. 26 in a 4-0 vote that the CSeries did not harm Boeing and discarded a U.S. Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of Bombardier 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets for five years.Spokesmen for both Boeing and Bombardier said the companies are studying the ITC's decision and did not have an immediate comment.Former ITC chairman Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said the cost to appeal the decision would be marginal compared with what Boeing has already spent. “Boeing has put a whole lot of money into law firms for this case. They’ve got millions of dollars invested,” Pearson said by phone.Boeing has the option of appealing the decision at the Court of International Trade in New York, or a trade dispute settlement panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).However, in negotiations to modernize NAFTA, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has pushed to scrap NAFTA's process to settle trade disputes, which he says is biased against the United States. Pearson said he believed the commission’s decision will likely improve U.S.-Canadian trade relations, which have been complicated by disputes over tariffs on Canadian lumber and U.S. milk and President Donald Trump’s desire to renegotiate or even abandon NAFTA. “It does help the bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States, and I hope both sides see it this way.”In its complaint, Boeing had alleged it was forced to discount its 737 narrow-bodies to compete with Bombardier, which it said used government subsidies to dump the CSeries during the 2016 sale.But the ITC said the CSeries is not likely to depress prices of U.S.-made jets and that Bombardier is unlikely to offer other prospective buyers the same discounts provided to Delta.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Federal Aviation Administration's formal warning follows a similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9, and cites a ""knife edge seal fracture"" in the engine that could lead to an engine stall ""and consequent inflight shutdown and rejected takeoffs,"" the FAA said in an airworthiness directive.The warnings mark the latest in a string of issues that have clouded the rollout of Pratt's new engines, which compete with market-leader CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France. A total of 98 engines could be affected, with 43 confirmed to have the problem and the rest possibly affected, Pratt said. The company declined to comment further.Pratt has not halted production or delivery of the engines, and the Connecticut-based company plans to submit a proposal to European regulators on Friday detailing how to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with the situation. It wasn't clear how quickly the European Aviation Safety Agency could approve the plan.The problem affects only PW-1100 series engines, not similar Pratt engines for Bombardier, Embraer or Mitsubishi jets, the source said. Airbus halted delivery of A320neos after delivering 113 of them. It was not immediately clear which airlines had the largest fleet.

377,"Feb 12, 2018 11:13AM ET",Exclusive: Europe's A400M army plane may see some features axed,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Andrea ShalalSINGAPORE/BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's new troop transporter may never go into battle with all the promised military capabilities after buyers of the A400M agreed to let Airbus (PA:AIR) negotiate an opt-out for features deemed too difficult to build.A document signed last week between Airbus and seven NATO nations, and seen by Reuters, allows the planemaker to negotiate deals with the individual buyers so that some of the complex add-on features can be removed from the official specifications.The new ""declaration of intent"" appears to mark the first time the buyers have recognized that not all the features designed to outdo competing U.S. aircraft will be available.The agreement also recognizes that Airbus needs more time to deliver the plane than originally planned and paves the way for negotiations over a new delivery schedule.In return for these concessions, the planemaker has pledged to provide ""all necessary support and resources to the A400M program"" after chronic delays and glitches with Europe's largest defense project, which have pushed it well beyond the original budget of 20 billion euros ($24.5 billion).The agency representing buyers Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey did not respond to a request for comment. Airbus said it could not comment on confidential negotiations.It was unclear what complex add-on features - known as ""permanent non-compliance"" items - could be removed from the plane's specifications as they were not listed in the document.A source briefed on the agreement, who asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of the matter, said countries had reasoned that it was better in some cases to accept partial progress towards a specific capability than to press for 100-percent achievement. ""This means there will be compromises. Certain capabilities will not be delivered,"" the person said. ADVANCED SYSTEMSThe A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military or humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (N:BA) C-17. A 3.5-billion-euro bailout from buyer nations in 2010 rescued the program from cancellation, but problems remained with some of the plane's classified defensive systems, as well as some types of paratrooper drop and helicopter refueling. Industry officials privately blame some of the project's problems on an over-ambitious wish list from buyer nations, designed in some cases to support local jobs. But the largest buyer Germany has criticized Airbus for failing to do what it promised.Despite being a transporter plane, designers say the A400M's advanced systems such as ground-hugging technology make it one of the most complex military aircraft ever built in Europe. France has praised its performance on operations in Africa.Under last week's deal, Airbus has re-committed to bringing new deliveries up to the final operational standard, known as ""SOC3,"" which includes flights at low level. It must also retrofit earlier planes in two stages by April 2027.Airbus must meanwhile pay or give credit notes for all damages for delays due as of last week, when the agreement was signed: a move that underscores likely fourth-quarter charges.Airbus warned last week it may post new provisions for losses on the A400M in its Feb. 15 annual results. It has already written off almost 7 billion euros on the project.The agreement calls, however, for an easing of key cash-retention clauses which had allowed buyers to freeze payments to Airbus because of equipment problems. Instead, these will be modified to introduce ""suitable incentivization mechanisms"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is in the midst of increasing output and last week said it may speed up further.A prolonged delay could have a financial impact for the planemaker, as it waits for payments that usually fall due on delivery, and for leasing companies, who start receiving rent on aircraft allotted to airlines as soon as they enter service.""It is too early to determine financial implications, but the fact that it impacts a limited population of engines is a potentially mitigating factor,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell said before the delivery freeze emerged.""Still, this will put GTF (geared turbofan) execution issues back in the spotlight after a smooth few months when news flow was mostly focused on solid orders and ramping production.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus said it had informed affected A320neo customers and operators, adding there are currently 113 Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo aircraft flying with 18 customers.Pratt & Whitney said in a statement the issue affected a ""a limited subpopulation of engines,"" without elaborating.Airbus said the two companies were assessing the situation and the European Aviation Safety Agency had published an Emergency Airworthiness Directive. Such a directive is issued when an unsafe condition exists that requires immediate action by an aircraft's owner or operator.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

382,"Feb 09, 2018 02:17PM ET",Airbus ordered to pay $99 million fine in Eurofighter case,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have ordered Airbus (PA:AIR) to pay 81.25 million euros ($99 million) to settle one of two investigations into alleged corruption surrounding the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003, the two sides said on Friday.The settlement includes an administrative fine of 250,000 euros and ""disgorgement"" - which legal experts broadly define as the recovery of ill-gotten gains - of 81 million euros.Munich prosecutors have been investigating whether Airbus issued bribes to win the $2 billion contract: charges it denies. In a statement, prosecutors said they had not found evidence of bribery but that Airbus had been unable to account for over 100 million euros in payments to two shell companies.EADS, as the main Airbus parent group was known at the time, sent funds totaling a triple-digit-million euro amount to Vector Aerospace LLP and City Chambers Limited, they added.Most of these funds, by evading internal control mechanisms, had been used for what the prosecutors said were ""unclear purposes"", adding it could not be finally determined what the funds had been spent on.Airbus said in a statement the penalty, which it had agreed to pay, related to the ""negligent breach of supervisory duties"" by unidentified members of Airbus Defence and Space’s former management. The former managers failed to ensure proper controls that would have prevented payments to ""business partners"" without the company getting proven services in exchange.Airbus regularly uses the term ""business partners"" to refer to foreign sales agents or intermediaries. It is being investigated separately in France and Britain over the handling of agents in the sale of commercial jets.While Friday's settlement ends the Munich investigation, Airbus and individuals including Chief Executive Tom Enders, who headed the company's defense business from 2000 to 2005, face an ongoing investigation in Vienna into the Eurofighter deal.Airbus and Enders have denied wrongdoing and accused the Austrian government of playing politics with the investigation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

383,"Feb 09, 2018 01:20PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/INFLATION GYRATIONS Whether world markets settle down now or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave may be determined by next week's consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States.They are expected to show U.S. consumer prices rising at the 2.1 percent year-on-year rate they grew at in December but any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes, potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds - don't forget this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2 U.S. jobs data showed the strongest year-on-year wage growth since 2009.If U.S. inflation does accelerate, markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3 percent level that several investment banks had set as their year-end target.U.S. inflation is not the only game in town though. British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England's recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation.(Graphic: Market inflation expectations on the rise - http://reut.rs/2BlqSVJ)2/VOLATILITY DON'T PULL YOU THROUGHMarket volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded this week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history. Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wall Street's near 10 percent drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War.Have we now moved to a ""high vol"" regime from a ""low vol"" regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues next week. Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is.(Graphic: S&P 500 fall vs historical average - http://reut.rs/2Bl8MDd)3/CAN EUROPEAN EARNINGS TEMPT BACK THE BULLSAnother heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent vol jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region's stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back.So will the results will stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts' predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago.What's more, the earnings ""beats"" in Europe are currently 48.2 percent - compare that to 78 percent for the S&P500 index. Even in Europe, ""beat"" levels in an average quarter run at 50 percent.Companies due to report next week include Heineken (AS:HEIO),  Kering  (PA:PRTP),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Airbus (PA:AIR), Nestle (S:NESN), Allianz (DE:ALVG),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Eni (MI:ENI). One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those who fall short of expectations. In the end though it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings.(Graphic: Fading earnings enthusiasm - http://reut.rs/2Bhj1Z7)4/HAPPY (LUNAR) NEW YEAR It's a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays. Even though the People's Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth. It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year - and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week. That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks' cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with. Longer term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January and haven't kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening. Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese new year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC's gift.(Graphic: China keeps cash conditions easy - http://reut.rs/2Eui4ys)5/SUBMERGING MARKETS?Emerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak out leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up.EM dollar debt spreads -- the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries -- have been rising but it hasn't been earthshaking and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017.That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch the resistance could be broken.One of the long-running EM issues - Jacob Zuma's departure from South Africa's Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn't want interest rates to go up.(Graphic: EM Spreads - http://reut.rs/2BOuSiu)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

384,"Feb 08, 2018 05:21AM ET","Maritime patrol aircraft seen as key in Asia, but buyers elusive",nan,"By Gerry DoyleSINGAPORE (Reuters) - When Boeing's P-8A Poseidon first arrived at the Singapore Airshow two years ago, it caused a stir. Defence buyers around the region were intrigued by the new aircraft, which was touted as reliable, capable and absolutely necessary in a region abundant with naval tension, both above and below the water.In 2018, the need has grown. China has spent the last few years building up military installations around the South China Sea and its submarines are prowling farther afield, stoking Asian interest in planes that can sweep large swathes of ocean.The number of offerings on the market has grown too, but the cost of such specialised aircraft has kept the purchases relatively small for now.""Special-mission aircraft are a strategic asset,"" said Avishai Izhakian, Israel Aerospace Industry's (IAI) deputy general manager for airborne systems and radars, explaining why sales of such planes have remained elusive. ""As such, the procurement process is very lengthy.""Among those joining Boeing (NYSE:BA) in trying to address the market are Saab (ST:SAABb)'s Swordfish Maritime Patrol Aircraft, based on the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) Global 6000 business jet; the Kawasaki (T:7012) P-1; the Airbus (PA:AIR) C295 MPA and proposed maritime patrol variant of its A320neo; Leonardo's (MI:LDOF) ATR 72MP; and IAI's ELI-3360 Maritime Patrol Aircraft, based on the Bombardier Global 5000 business jet.The Swordfish is not yet in production, however, and the Japanese Self-Defense Force is the sole customer for the P-1. India and Australia are so far the only Asia-region buyers of the $175 million P-8.No big sales of maritime patrol aircraft were announced at this week's Singapore Airshow, the biggest regional aerospace and defence event.Still, planemakers at the airshow said that Asia remained a promising market.""There is a requirement need out here in the Asian region for P-8s,"" Matt Carreon of Boeing said at a media briefing on Tuesday. He cited the large volume of shipping traffic, the amount of piracy and the ""current political climate"" as reasons why maritime patrol would be important to Asian militaries.Two P-8s were on display at the airshow, one flown by the U.S. Navy - the aircraft's biggest customer by far, with 98 ordered and 64 delivered - and the other by the Royal Australian Air Force, which has ordered 12. Britain and Norway are the only other two announced buyers.Gene Cunningham, Boeing's vice president of global sales for defence, space and security, said the company was in advanced discussions with South Korea over a P-8 sale. There might be a decision by the end of 2018, he added.On Thursday, South Korea's defence procurement agency confirmed it would buy a maritime patrol aircraft from a foreign company. The Yonhap news agency, citing an unnamed military source, said the decision would be between the P-8 and Saab's Swordfish for a deal expected to be worth about $1.75 billion.TARGET MARKETThe moneymaking potential for sales in the Asia-Pacific region is clear. The U.S. State Department gave permission last year for a nearly $1.5 billion P-8 sale to New Zealand, although no deal has been announced.Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea are among others in the region shopping for maritime patrol aircraft, several planemakers said.""If they are concerned about the proliferation of submarines, we are talking to them,"" said Robert Hewson, Saab's head of communications for Asia Pacific.Hewson suggested the Swordfish would be as little as half the cost of the P-8 over its lifetime.IAI's Izhakian, speaking on the sidelines of the airshow, said the P-8 was better suited for large militaries with bigger budgets than for most potential Asian countries, leaving an opening for smaller aircraft with advanced sensors.""This is our niche, to provide a more affordable solution with more capability,"" he said.Like Saab and IAI, Boeing designed its aircraft around the bones of a civilian plane, in this case the ubiquitous 737 passenger jet. Carreon said the aircraft's familiarity, plus the ability add in third-party or local systems, made it attractive to even smaller customers.""They are shocked at the value they're getting,"" he said.DEFENCE SPENDING RISINGBoeing is marketing its jet as a natural upgrade of the older, propeller-driven Lockheed (N:LMT) P-3 Orion, which performs the same mission. Only one buyer, India, had not flown P-3s before purchasing P-8s.Kawasaki was displaying a model of its four-engine P-1 jet, which replaced Japanese P-3s, but Hideki Yamaoka, associate officer and project manager of the company's Advanced Aircraft Export Project, said it was generally ""too high-end for the requirements"" of Asian customers.Unmanned drones are another option. Joseph Song, vice president for international strategic development at General Atomics Aeronautical, which makes the MQ-9 Reaper, said he saw potential for growth in Asia.""I think the maritime mission is going to be as big as the land mission in the future, driven by Asian customers like Australia, India, Japan, Korea, and I think Singapore and other countries will certainly play a role,"" he said.After a meeting of Southeast Asian defence ministers this week, Singapore defence minister Ng Eng Hen said the country was spending more all around, including on ways to keep an eye on the seas around the island city-state.""Defence spending on the whole, not only maritime surveillance, has gone up,"" he said. ""That's a fact."""

The program was initially valued at 20 billion euros but its cost has ballooned to well over 30 billion, sources told Reuters last year.""Since its inception in 2003, this program has suffered not only from a number of operational issues but, more importantly, under a flawed contractual set-up and insufficient budget which resulted in significant losses for Airbus,"" Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in the statement.""We have a good chance to stop or at least reduce the bleeding now and deliver the capabilities our customers need,"" he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

387,"Feb 06, 2018 06:31AM ET",Planemakers look at higher output to meet demand,nan,"By Jamie Freed and Tim HepherSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The world's largest planemakers signaled a possible increase in output of their most popular passenger jets on Tuesday, highlighting their confidence about growth in demand for air travel.Although new orders have dwindled following a seven-year boom, executives at the Singapore Airshow suggested Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) have enough business in their bulging order books to speed up their already-record production of narrowbody jets.""The success of the product is forcing us to look at any opportunities we have to improve the rate. We have not come to any conclusion yet but this is something we are looking at very closely,"" Airbus sales chief Eric Schulz told a news conference.Schulz, making his first appearance since being recruited from Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) to replace retired sales chief John Leahy, shrugged off concerns about the ability of the supply chain to keep up with higher production rates.""I think the supply chain will be able to cope and we will be able to raise rates as needed in the market,"" he said.His comments match confidence from rival Boeing as the industry responds to growing demand for medium-haul jets. In an interview with Reuters, a senior Boeing official said the U.S. company was confident in demand for its 737 MAX jet, the latest version of which was rolled out on Monday.""There is upward pressure (on production rates) because we are oversold,"" Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said.""If you want a (737) MAX today, we are talking 2023,"" he added, referring to long waiting times for new jets.Just as airlines overbook seats, planemakers typically sell more aircraft than they plan to produce to protect themselves from airlines going bankrupt or failing to take delivery.These comments show both planemakers are confident they can preserve an adequate buffer, even with higher output.Engine maker CFM International, which supplies both Boeing and Airbus, said last month that planemakers had begun asking about its ability to support higher production.Boeing currently produces 47 of its 737 narrowbody aircraft per month and is heading toward 57 per month next year. Airbus is increasing production to 60 per month by mid-2019.Industry sources have said both companies are looking at increasing production to as much as 70 single-aisle jets a month. But the head of the world's largest aircraft leasing company is yet to be convinced that markets can support such levels.""Can both of them go to 70? I don’t think so. 140 a month, I don't think that is possible at the moment,"" AerCap (N:AER) Chief Executive Aengus Kelly told Reuters when asked whether the market could support such levels of production.Even so, he expected Airbus and Boeing, who make up the bulk of the $140 billion a year jet market, to exercise restraint.""If the market can take it, they will give it. If the market won’t take it, they won’t,"" he said. ""What is much more important for the manufacturers is not what they say they do, and not what the orders are but what they are delivering,"" Kelly said. ""If you look back over the last 20 years what you see is a very strong correlation between traffic growth and deliveries,"" he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A Boeing representative in Brazil said the structure of a possible deal with Embraer was ""still being studied.""Government sources told Reuters it was too early to say if the latest suggested structure of a deal would pass muster with all ministries concerned and, importantly, with the military. Some did say that the latest structure would seem to meet the main government demands, especially regarding the protection of Brazilian defense programs.Representatives at Brazil's Defense Ministry, which set up a committee to make recommendations to the government on a partnership, declined to comment immediately.Brazil's Air Force repeated on Friday that they ""consider Embraer to be fundamental for the country's security and any decision has to take into account national sovereignty."" Embraer shares, which surged as much as 9 percent after a report by Globo media suggested that Embraer had accepted a proposal from Boeing, pared gains to around 4.5 percent in afternoon trading. Boeing shares were down about 1.5 percent.Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) last year.An unexpected U.S. trade ruling last month scrapping tariffs on CSeries jets added to pressure on Boeing and Embraer to pull off a tie-up of their own. Brazil's government has openly pushed for a partnership between the two companies focused more narrowly on commercial aviation, rather than an outright acquisition, due to concerns about the independence of Brazilian defense programs.The government, which holds about 10 percent of Embraer shares through public-sector funds, still has veto power over its military programs and any takeover attempts due to a golden share in the former state enterprise.Boeing has sought ways to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer and previously proposed safeguards for defense programs in Brazil along the lines of its subsidiaries in Britain and Australia, sources have told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

393,"Feb 02, 2018 09:49AM ET","No Samsung phones, Nike uniforms for North Koreans? Sanctions cloud Olympic perks",nan,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Christine KimSEOUL (Reuters) - All of the almost 3,000 athletes competing at the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are set to get perks including the latest $1,100 Samsung (KS:005930) smartphones, top of the range new equipment to take home and sleek  Nike  (N:NKE) uniforms.All except perhaps the 22 athletes from North Korea.Tough international sanctions including travel restrictions and a ban on the sale of luxury goods and sports gear have complicated South Korean Olympic organizers' efforts to provide their northern neighbors with the same benefits available to other Olympians.For months, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has sought North Korea's participation in the hopes it will ease tensions between the still officially warring nations and prevent the kind of violent incidents which have plagued previous major events hosted by the South.Officials have rolled out the red carpet and are keen to make sure the visits go off without a hitch.North Korean female ice hockey players and their South Korean teammates, who will compete as one nation in the Games for the first time, have been living and training together this week, even sharing a birthday cake. Other members of the North Korean delegation, such as the cheer squad, will be housed in luxury hotels.Overshadowing those efforts, however, are a host of U.S. and U.N. Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang over its efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.At almost every turn, South Korea has had to go great lengths to make sure its hospitalities don't run afoul of sanctions or other laws, according to several South Korean officials. Just raising the North Korean flag alongside other national banners in the Olympic Villages required an exemption from South Korean laws banning praise of the North Korea regime, a Pyeongchang organizing committee official told Reuters.The officials all declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter. NO GALAXY NOTE 8, NO NIKE?Samsung Electronics, an official sponsor of the Winter Games, is offering 4,000 Galaxy Note 8 smartphones specially designed for the Olympics to ""all"" of the participating athletes. The International Olympic Committee will distribute them, a Samsung Electronics spokesman told Reuters. But South Korea is not sure if North Korean athletes will be eligible for the treats because of U.N. Security Council sanctions, an Olympics organizer told Reuters.The official declined to elaborate, but experts say providing the $1,100 Samsung phone could violate U.N. sanctions that ban the sale of luxury items and electronics with a potential ""dual"" commercial and military use.Meanwhile, the joint women's hockey team will wear uniforms made by a Finnish company instead of official sponsor Nike, because of concerns about U.S. sanctions, another South Korean government official told Reuters.Unilateral U.S. sanctions go far beyond the U.N. sanctions, effectively banning U.S. companies and individuals from trading with North Korea.""We are trying to figure out ways to live up to the sanctions,"" the official said.Nike said it would comply with U.S. sanctions.""The Korean women's hockey team will not compete in Nike uniforms,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters.North Korean athletes will also have to return Finnish hockey sticks, skates and other equipment the IIHF has ""rented"" for them when they leave South Korea, the official said.The federation was not immediately available for comments. FLIGHT RISK South Korea's unification ministry said it had sought and received temporary permission from the United States to fly an airliner to North Korea this week. The flight took South Korean athletes for training in a ski resort in the North on Wednesday, and brought North Korean athletes to the South on Thursday.Any aircraft or ship visiting North Korea is banned for 180 days from entering the United States. The exemption granted this week only applies to the latest flight, meaning U.S. approval is needed any time North Korean officials visit during the Olympics by airplane or ferry.A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Washington was in ""close contact with the Republic of Korea on our unified response to North Korea.""A U.S. Treasury official said the department evaluates applications ""for certain prohibited transactions and activities, which can include those related to the upcoming Olympics"", without giving more detail. For this week's flight, an Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft was used rather than one made by U.S. Boeing (N:BA) due to stricter U.S. sanctions, South Korean broadcaster Channel A reported. Asiana Airlines (KS:020560), who operated the plane, declined to comment.To comply with South Korean military rules, the airliner had to fly some distance out to sea to avoid flying over the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone, the unification ministry said.FIVE-STAR HOTELThe North Korean Olympians are staying at the athletes' village in Gangneung with athletes from other countries. The Olympics organizing committee was unable to say whether they are being given any special treatment, such as beefed up protection.North Korea's 230-member cheering squad is expected to stay at Inje Speedium, according to a unification ministry official, a four-star hotel surrounded by forest. Rooms there cost 242,000 won ($226) to 715,000 won per night. Its taekwondo performance team will stay at the five-star Grand Walkerhill in Seoul, which overlooks the Han River and previously hosted American stars such as Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton.The spending is not unprecedented. When North Koreans visited the South for the Asian Games in 2002, the Seoul government spent 1.3 billion won hosting them. But now, even paying for routine things such as medical treatment or providing souvenirs can run into problems, said Yoo Ho-yeol, a professor at Korea University in Seoul.""Benefits provided to North Korean delegation, which were in the past were not subject to sanctions, can now become a controversy, since sanctions have become much more comprehensive in recent years,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

394,"Feb 02, 2018 02:11AM ET",German industrial workers stage third day of full-day strikes,nan,"By Maria SheahanFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Industrial workers in Germany started a third day of 24-hour strikes over pay and working hours on Friday, downing their tools at companies including carmakers Mercedes-Benz and Porsche and airplane maker Airbus (PA:AIR).The full-day walkouts, which are due to end late on Friday, are labor union IG Metall's last warning shot before votes are cast on whether to take extended industrial action that could cost German companies hundreds of millions of euros in lost production.Both the union and employers have said they are open to resuming talks on Monday next week, but they have each insisted that the other side show more willingness to make concessions.Citing Germany's fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise over 27 months for 3.9 million metal and engineering workers across Europe's largest economy.The union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and to be able to return to full time after two years.This is IG Metall's first major push for a change in hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help secure a cut of the working week to 35 from 40 hours.Employers have offered a 6.8 percent wage increase, but rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers' hours when necessary.They have also dismissed the idea that they should make up some of the pay shortfall for workers who cut their hours.Nearly 200,000 workers at more than 100 companies including truckmaker MAN and carmaker Ford (N:F) staged rolling 24-hour strikes on Wednesday and Thursday, according to IG Metall.By the end of Friday, that number is expected to rise to around 260 companies.The DIW economic institute has estimated the strikes could cost companies a total of 62 million euros ($77 million) a day in lost revenue, assuming around 50,000 workers, or on average 200 per company, stop working for one day each.In a separate dispute, IG Metall has also threatened to cripple car production at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) if top executives continue to block noticeable pay increases for German staff at Europe's biggest carmaker.After three rounds of fruitless bargaining, more than 20,000 workers at VW's core Wolfsburg factory had walked off their shifts for two hours on Thursday, staging the first warning strikes at VW since 2004.

395,"Jan 31, 2018 05:20PM ET",U.S. ruling boosts airline confidence in Bombardier's CSeries: Air Lease CEO,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - A recent trade decision allowing Bombardier (TO:BBDb) to sell its newest jets in the United States without hefty duties will boost airline confidence in the program, but the Canadian planemaker still faces challenges to win over lessors,  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) Chief Executive John Plueger said on Wednesday.Bombardier and European planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which plans to take a majority stake in the CSeries this year, still must convince leasing heavyweights that the 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets has a vast enough customer base to preserve their value and competitive pricing to win orders, Plueger.Air Lease Corp is a major leasing firm with about $15 billion in total assets.Last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission handed an unexpected victory to Bombardier against  Boeing Co  (N:BA). ITC commissioners voted 4-0 that Bombardier's prices did not harm Boeing and discarded a U.S. Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the company's CSeries jets for five years. The ITC did not give a reason immediately for its decision.The decision ""removes that very, very large question mark on the CSeries (imports) into the United States,"" Plueger said by phone. ""Bottom line: It's a big positive for U.S. carriers, but I think it goes beyond U.S. carriers."" Having an adequate customer base is vital for lessors, which want to make sure there is sufficient demand by airlines for multiple leases. The CSeries has a backlog of 372 firm orders.Air Lease Corp did not order the CSeries in the past because ""the price and the risk was not a good tradeoff,"" when compared to Boeing's 737 MAX line and Airbus's A320 NEO family, Plueger said. ""Those two things have been a challenge,"" Plueger said of the CSeries. ""To the extent that Airbus's ownership can help on those two points - customer base and price - that will be a positive. It remains to be seen on both of those points.""Earlier on Wednesday, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts during a conference call that Boeing is waiting to see the reasoning behind the ITC's ruling before deciding whether to take further steps in the trade case.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

396,"Jan 31, 2018 02:48PM ET","Boeing forecasts rising profit, sees end to job reductions",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday forecast full-year profit well above Wall Street estimates as it looks forward to its busiest year ever for plane deliveries, sending its shares up almost 5 percent.The world's biggest plane maker also said it would end years of job cuts in 2018, but would not now start hiring more people because of the recent reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate.""More of an employment plateau in the near-term,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. Boeing has shed 20 percent of its workforce, or about 34,000 jobs, since employment peaked in 2012, in a bid to reduce costs and improve profits. Several U.S. companies have promised to boost hiring after December's new tax law slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.Although Chicago-based Boeing delivered more aircraft to customers than Airbus SE (PA:AIR) last year, and is much more profitable, it is still in a dogfight to win orders after its European rival sold about 22 percent more planes last year. ""Our focus is to make Boeing ever tougher,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing said it aims to ship between 810 and 815 commercial aircraft in 2018, as much as 7 percent more than the industry-record 763 jets it delivered in 2017, putting it ahead of Airbus for the sixth year in a row. Airbus delivered 718 jetliners last year.Both companies are speeding up production at their factories to chip away at the large backlog of orders for new jetliners, created over the past few years as airlines want new, fuel-efficient planes to cope with a surge in demand for air travel.Helped by the hunger for new jets, Boeing forecast core profit would rise to $13.80 to $14.00 a share in 2018, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $11.96, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Boeing's core earnings nearly doubled to $4.80 per share from $2.47 a year earlier, buoyed by rising plane output and a $1.74 per share gain from changes to the U.S. tax law.Boeing shares, which have more than doubled in the past 12 months, rose 4.7 percent to $353.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. SETTING THE TABLEBoeing's commercial planes unit posted an 8 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter to $15.47 billion, while operating profit rose 50 percent to $1.78 billion.The company's smaller defense business grow more slowly. Revenue for the unit rose 5 percent to $5.54 billion while operating profit rose 6 percent to $553 million. Boeing's new services business - which maintains and overhauls planes for their owners - posted a 17 percent increase in revenue to $4 billion in the fourth quarter while operating profit rose 9 percent to $617 million. Boeing is aiming to hit $50 billion in revenue in that business by 2027. However, profit margins at the unit narrowed slightly to 15.4 percent, and Boeing said it expects margins near that level this year.""Margins weren't as good as I thought,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies LLC in New York.Boeing also forecast at least $12.8 billion in free cash flow this year, encouraging Wall Street analysts, who generally view the company's early targets as conservative.""Actual results could ultimately be higher,"" Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said in a note to clients. ""As a result, we expect the stock to outperform despite its recent run now that management has set the table for a solid 2018.""By raising production while holding down costs, Boeing and Airbus generate more profit and cash. Despite the rising output, their order backlogs have kept growing. Boeing said its total backlog, which includes military aircraft and other products, rose to $488 billion at year-end, compared with $474 billion at the end of the third quarter.Excluding the gain, Boeing reported earnings of $3.06 a share. On that basis, Wall Street had been expecting $2.89 a share.Muilenburg said Boeing still expects to increase operating profit margins to the mid-teens by 2020, from 9.6 percent last year, with most of the gain coming from reducing the cost of making 787 Dreamliners, while holding costs of its workhorse single-aisle 737 steady.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

399,"Jan 31, 2018 07:15AM ET",Airbus A321LR long-range jet takes maiden flight,nan,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - The A321LR, a long-range version of Airbus's (PA:AIR) largest and newest single-aisle jet, made its maiden flight on Wednesday as the European planemaker looks to retain part of the market where it has been aggressively outselling rival Boeing (N:BA).The reconfigured version of the 185-230-seat A321neo is capable of carrying up to 240 people. It took off from Airbus' Hamburg factory in northern Germany shortly after 11 a.m. (1000 GMT), witnesses said.Airbus says the jet is the world's longest-range single-aisle aircraft, capable of flying up to 4,000 nautical miles when configured with 206 seats including lie-flat beds.That makes it a contender to replace long-serving Boeing 757s that are nearing retirement. But Boeing is studying proposals to leapfrog the plane with a compact new twin-aisle jet, designed to serve a broader market from 200 to 270 seats.A decision on whether to launch the so-called middle-of-the-market passenger jet is expected this year.Airbus has been outselling Boeing in the market for large single-aisle jets by a margin of four to one and says the new A321LR version - with an improved takeoff weight of 97 tonnes - will meet demand to replace elderly 757s and some 767s. Boeing says the opportunity stretches beyond the 757 replacement market all the way up to planes with 270 seats and would be better served by a completely new airplane. It has meanwhile introduced a larger version of its 737 MAX, and last year outsold Airbus three to one in long-haul wide-body jets.Boeing officials concede the A321LR flies further but say it relies on three, space-absorbing auxiliary fuel tanks, instead of one for the 737 MAX 10 in its longest-range version.In an effort to pre-empt the possible launch of a new Boeing jet, Airbus is working on further enhancements to the A321 even as it stages the first test of the A321LR, industry sources say.A person familiar with the Airbus plans told Reuters last week that it is studying a further increase in the A321neo's take-off weight to 100 tonnes with the help of tweaks to the existing wing and stronger landing gear, requiring more engine thrust.A second option would include a lighter and larger new wing: something that saves on engine thrust but costs more to develop. Both options would involve stretching the aircraft slightly to accommodate one or two extra rows of seats, the person said.Airbus has declined to comment on the plans.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

400,"Jan 30, 2018 06:10PM ET","Low-cost, long-haul flights from India to boost leisure travel: report",nan,"By Aditi ShahMUMBAI (Reuters) - The launch of low-cost, long-haul flights by Indian airlines will boost outbound leisure travel and open a multi-billion dollar opportunity for carriers, a report released on Wednesday showed.The analysis by aviation consultant CAPA India and online travel agent  Expedia  Inc (O:EXPE) comes as large budget airlines IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) draw up plans to fly as far as Europe and the United States. The carriers have so far focused on shorter-range destinations such as Sri Lanka and Thailand.Only 0.3 percent of Indians currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million who could potentially afford to do so, CAPA's analysis of household income shows. Most Indians travel for education, business or to visit friends and relatives.Tourism spending by Indians could rise to as much as $40 billion by 2027 from about $16.4 billion in 2016, CAPA said, ranking it sixth in the world ahead of Canada, South Korea and Australia.""If there is any market where low-cost, long-haul can work it is India,"" CAPA India CEO Kapil Kaul said at an aviation conference in Mumbai on Tuesday, citing its geographic location and a large order pipeline for new long-range narrowbody jets. SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said on Tuesday low-cost long haul flights will be introduced as early as this winter.IndiGo is exploring long-haul operations and seeking rights to routes, parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (NS:INGL) told analysts last week.The low-cost flights would compete against full-service Indian carriers Air India and Jet Airways (NS:JET) as well as global rivals such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).BUDGET GROWTHLow-cost carriers, launched in the early 2000s, already dominate domestic air travel with a two-thirds market share. The share of budget airlines in the international market rose to about 23 percent in the fiscal year 2016/17 from 14.5 percent five years earlier, CAPA estimates.That is expected to rise as Indian airlines have placed orders for nearly 800 re-engined aircraft, such as Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neos and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX narrowbodies. The jets, with longer ranges than predecessors, will enable low-cost carriers to launch non-stop routes to Asian destinations such as Phuket, Manila, Hong Kong, and Hanoi that are otherwise unviable today.By 2025, Indian budget carriers will operate close to 40 wide-bodied aircraft, which could deliver an additional 2 million annual outbound leisure travelers to places such as New York and Sydney, CAPA said.Low-cost carriers AirAsia India and Vistara, a full-service joint venture between Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) and India's Tata Group, are expected to launch their first international flights later this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Qatar Airways has in the past refused to take delivery of aircraft over what it said were quality issues, and has also canceled some deliveries. Airbus looks ""forward to delivering the world's first A350-1000 to Qatar Airways in the coming weeks,"" Airbus' Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said in a press release issued by the airline.The ""complex seat configuration"" of Qatar Airways' Qsuite, business class which features seats that face each other, and lie-flat double beds, had delayed the delivery of the A350-1000, until February, Baker said on Monday without detailing a specific date. The A350-1000 will be the first Airbus jet to feature the Qsuite, which was unveiled last year and has been installed on Qatar Airways' Boeing (N:BA) 777 jets, Baker said.The A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350 series, and was launched to compete against Boeing's 777s in the up to 400-seat market.Baker, speaking to reporters on board one of Airbus' A350-1000 test aircraft, said the airline expected to receive four of the twin-engined jets this year. ""This is contractually and I am confident that Airbus will deliver them to us,"" he said.Qatar Airways plans to initially fly its first A350-1000 on long haul routes before adding it to ultra long-haul routes in a few months time, in case of any potential technical issues with the new jet. Baker said the airline hoped to take delivery of its first Boeing 777x by the first half of 2020.The airline has ordered 60 the new 777x jets, according to data on Boeing's website.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

405,"Jan 24, 2018 11:31AM ET",France's Daher pursues its American Dream with drive to boost aerospace sales,nan,"By Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - French aerospace supplier Daher is targeting earning a third of its revenues in the Americas within five years, buoyed by its first contract with Boeing (N:BA), its managing director told Reuters in an interview.Didier Kayat said the family-owned firm, which makes the landing gear hatches for Airbus' (PA:AIR) A350, projects sales of 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in 2022 compared with 1.1 billion in 2017, of which 500 million would come from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.Currently, 17 to 18 percent of Daher's revenues comes from the Americas.Daher's rivals in its area includes the likes of GKN (L:GKN), Spirit Aerosystems (N:SPR) and Stelia, but Kayat felt his company was too centered on Europe at present.""We are a bit too European, and for us to get 40 percent of our market ... we need to be Americans, so that in five years' time, Daher will be as well-known in the United States as it is in Europe,"" Kayat said on Wednesday.Daher announced a contract to provide various parts for Boeing 787 planes on Wednesday. Daher, which also supplies engine-maker Pratt & Whitney Canada, U.S. jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb), expects to start delivering thermoplastic parts to Boeing in September.Kayat said the company had ample capacity to take on debt for its development.He did not rule out either selling a stake -- France's state-run investment bank Bpifrance already owns 12.5 percent -- or an eventual initial public offering (IPO), although he expressed wariness about going public.""But this (IPO) isn't very smart in aeronautics because there's an incompatibility between publishing quarterly results and 20-year strategy plans,"" he said.Kayat said Daher was also targeting more work in the software sector, mirroring moves by other leading engineering and aerospace groups, such as  General Electric  (N:GE) which last month raised its stake in Swedish 3D printer firm Arcam (ST:ARCM).($1 = 0.8098 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing Co  (N:BA) said earlier this month it delivered an industry-record 763 jetliners in 2017, and both it and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) reported gross orders for more than 1,000 planes last year.Sales in United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit, which makes aircraft engines, were up 11.7 percent, while aerospace systems sales, which include engine parts and aircraft lighting, rose 5.7 percent.Even as it gains from the surge in aircraft demand, the company is trying to speed up production of its fuel-saving turbofan engines that power Airbus' newest narrow-body jet, the A320neo, and Bombardier's CSeries aircraft.The production ramp is expected to result in $1.1 billion worth of engine margin losses in 2018, the company said.The company, which also makes Otis Elevators, forecast full year adjusted earnings in the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share, up 3 percent to 6.8 percent from a year earlier. The midpoint of that range came in slightly below analysts' average estimate of $7.00 per share.Its sales forecast of $62.5 billion to $64.0 billion, while analysts' were expecting $63.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares, up 23.3 percent in the past 12 months, were little changed at $135.75 in premarket trading.Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters on Wednesday that the company expects to quickly repatriate $2 billion in overseas cash under the new U.S. tax law.The latest quarter included a 90-cent charge related to the new U.S. tax law. UTC expects to make net cash payment of $1.5 billion through 2026, and use the tax windfall partly to reduce borrowing for its acquisition of Rockwell Collins (N:COL).For the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7 percent to $15.68 billion, topping Wall Street's expectation of $15.40 billion.The company's income from continuing operations attributable to common share owners fell to $397 million, or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, UTC earned $1.60 per share, higher than the $1.56 per share expected by analysts.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

United Airlines (N:UAL) is expected to accept the first 787-10 with GE engines in the second half of the year.""We are complete with all flight testing required for the first deliveries to Singapore and the Rolls-Royce family,"" Boeing 787 programme chief project engineer Bob Whittington told reporters on a conference call, speaking from Seattle.""There is a little bit more testing to be done for the GE-powered airplanes a little bit later on.""The 787-10 has 95 percent of its parts in common with the mid-sized Dreamliner, the 787-9. The main differences are in the environmental control system, which is larger due to the longer length of the airplane and higher number of passengers, and in the landing gear, Whittington said. The smaller 787-8 model, the first Dreamliner, has roughly 80 percent commonality with the 787-10 and has been a slower seller as Boeing considers whether to launch a ""New Mid-Sized Airplane"" with 220-260 seats targeting the market between the 737 MAX 10 and the 787-8.The 787-10 seats around 330 passengers and has a shorter range, at 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kms), than the other Dreamliners, but Whittington did not rule out extending the range over time.""We will continue to look and see if the market needs a couple of thousand more pounds take-off weight and we will continue those studies,"" he said.The 787-10 has received 171 firm orders from nine customers, the largest of which is Singapore Airlines. It is similar in size to the rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-900 model, which seats around 325 passengers but has a longer range.

He expects the new flying car curriculum, which opens in late February and begins taking applications on Tuesday, to draw at least 10,000.Udacity is offering two 12-week terms, at $1,200 each, including a course in Aerial Robotics and one in Intelligent Air Systems, that provide an online certification in a fraction of the time of a traditional degree course.In an interview, Thrun said his motivation in creating the flying-car program was similar to what drove the school's widely publicized self-driving car course.Thrun said ""it's almost impossible to hire qualified people"" to design and engineer future vehicles - both terrestrial and aerial - that employ advanced technology, including robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.""There is a huge shortage of engineers. There are plenty of smart people - the missing link is education,"" said Thrun, who headed the team that launched Google's self-driving car project, since renamed Waymo.Thrun remains an advisor to Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and retains close ties to Alphabet CEO and co-founder Larry Page.Page is an investor in Kitty Hawk Corp, a two-year-old startup based in Mountain View, California, whose stated mission is ""to make the dream of personal flight a reality."" Thrun is chief executive of Kitty Hawk and a co-owner.Kitty Hawk's first prototype, dubbed the Flyer, is not exactly a flying car, but more of a one-person drone that is capable of vertical takeoff and landing and does not need wheels.""'Flying car' might be a bit of a misnomer - more of an attention grabber,"" admits Thrun, who said he has been working with Page and others to develop autonomous aerial vehicles.""It feels like science fiction now,"" Thrun said.

409,"Jan 23, 2018 03:10PM ET",Bombardier risks losing contested U.S. trade dispute with Boeing,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Bombardier (TO:BBDb) risks losing a hotly-contested U.S. trade dispute on Thursday which would effectively bar its CSeries jet from the United States for at least a year, a potential setback as the Canadian plane-and-train maker races to meet its 2018 delivery targets and attract sales from American carriers.The International Trade Commission's (ITC) ruling this week is unlikely to put an end to months of wrangling between  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the world's largest maker of jetliners, and Bombardier, along with Canada and the United Kingdom, which have sided with the smaller planemaker.The Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute has cast a shadow over the ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) modernization talks, which entered its sixth round this week in Montreal.The ITC, which oversees U.S. trade remedy laws and sides more often with American companies, is expected by some experts to back the U.S. Commerce department's recommendation to slap Bombardier's CSeries with a near 300-percent duty on sales to American carriers. Boeing has argued that its business was hurt because Bombardier received illegal government subsidies and dumped the CSeries in the United States through the 2016 sale of 75 jets at ""absurdly low prices"" to Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).For Bombardier to win, at least three of the body's four commissioners would have to rule for the Canadian planemaker.""A tie vote goes to petitioners,"" said U.S. trade expert William Perry who believes Boeing will win the case.But former ITC chairman Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said he would not rule out a Bombardier victory in what's an ""unusual"" case for the commission.""If I was there still, I'd be looking skeptically at Boeing's claims,"" he said.The trade case has left Bombardier seeking delivery alternatives to Delta, which was supposed to start taking its CSeries orders this year.One option under consideration includes AeroMexico (MX:AEROMEX), which is 49-percent owned by Delta, taking an unknown number of CSeries, Reuters reported last year.. But no decision has been made and AeroMexico could still buy jets from Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), said a source familiar with the matter Reuters earlier this month.AIRBUS-BOMBARDIER DEALA win for Boeing would not deter Bombardier from continuing to target U.S. airline customers. Bombardier has struck a deal with Airbus SE (PA:AIR), expected to close this year, giving the European planemaker a majority stake in the CSeries and the ability to assemble the planes in Alabama starting in 2019 for delivery to Delta.While Bombardier says CSeries assembled in Alabama would be duty-free, Boeing has challenged those plans. The two planemakers have clashed on whether the case that mentions aircraft and ""partially assembled"" aircraft from Canada, would lead to duties on parts used in the CSeries. Pearson said by email that foreign parts, like a wing made in Belfast, should not face a duty, but there could be charge on Canadian-made parts. ""This week's vote by the ITC is an opportunity to restore a level playing field and recommit to the global trading rules we have all agreed to,"" said Boeing spokesman Dan Curran on Tuesday. But Bombardier called Boeing's trade case self-serving after the U.S. planemaker revealed on Dec. 21 it was discussing a ""potential combination"" with Embraer.""This case is nothing more than Boeing's transparent attempt to misuse the U.S. trade laws to create an artificial market advantage for itself, including its recent move to acquire Embraer – the CSeries’ true competitor – while simultaneously trying to block the CSeries from the U.S. market,"" Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email. Boeing spokesman Curran denied that the company's ongoing conversations with Embraer have anything to do with its case against Bombardier.Embraer declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

413,"Jan 18, 2018 04:25PM ET",Exclusive: Boeing willing to preserve Brazil's 'golden share' in Embraer deal,nan,"By Brad Haynes and Anthony BoadleBRASILIA (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is working to overcome the Brazilian military's objections to its proposed tie-up with  Embraer SA  (SA:EMBR3) with alternatives that would preserve the government's strategic veto rights and ensure safeguards for its defense programs, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The U.S. planemaker was forced back to the drawing board after Brazilian officials balked last week at the idea of turning Embraer into a subsidiary such as those that Boeing operates in Australia and Britain, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the negotiations freely.""Boeing came to buy Embraer, not for a partnership or a joint venture that we are open to, but to take control of the company. This was rejected,"" said one of the sources, a government official. ""It is up to Boeing to come back with a new proposal."" Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and run by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) since last year.Since the news broke last month that it was in talks with Boeing, Embraer's shares are up 22 percent in New York, where 51 percent of its stock is listed, bringing its market capitalization to $4.6 billion.Boeing's proposal would value the company at $5 billion to $6 billion, a person familiar with the negotiations said. New York-listed shares in Embraer (N:ERJ), which were down 1.6 percent in afternoon trading, erased losses after the Reuters report to gain as much as 0.5 percent.Boeing's plan has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems.The Brazilian government holds a 'golden share' in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest.Boeing would be willing to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer, the people familiar with the matter said, but that may not be enough to win support.Embraer and Boeing declined to comment on the matter.Representatives for the Defense Ministry, which is coordinating talks with the government, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.AIR FORCE RESISTANCEOfficials at the Finance Ministry and development bank BNDES, which owns 5 percent of the planemaker, have been supportive of the deal, but military officials are far more skeptical, according to the sources. The BNDES declined comment and the ministry did not respond to a request for comment.""The Air Force is the main source of resistance,"" said an aide to President Michel Temer. ""The military oppose any split up of Embraer."" The aide said Jungmann has not yet made a recommendation on the Boeing deal to the president.In an emailed comment, the Air Force said it ""considers Embraer a strategic company that is fundamental for our national sovereignty, so a possible partnership with Boeing should also be studied from this point of view."" Air Force commander Lt Brig Nivaldo Luiz Rossato joined Defense Minister Raul Jungmann last week in Brasilia at a meeting with senior Boeing executives including Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, which failed to sway the Brazilians.Embraer's special relationship with Brazil's Air Force dates back to its creation in the 1960s as part of a government push to create a domestic aviation industry. The planemaker was opened to private capital in 1994 and fully privatized in 2006, but it still works closely with the Air Force, which is now financing development of the KC-390 military airlifter.Boeing, which struck a joint sales and services agreement on the KC-390, has underscored to officials that a tie-up would help to market Embraer's defense products globally and bolster Brazil's nascent space program, one person said.Yet government officials are steering Boeing toward a more narrow joint venture with Embraer focused on commercial aviation — an idea Boeing has dismissed because it would limit long-term flexibility, according to two people familiar with the talks.Neither the government nor the companies want to entirely split off Embraer's commercial or defense operations, given the integration of their technology and engineering resources, the sources said.With a presidential election looming in Brazil this year and airlines delaying orders until the shape of the industry is clear, all sides of the negotiations are eager for a resolution. Still, government officials are keen on pressing their hand.""We think Boeing will end up agreeing to a partnership or a joint venture because they have been weakened by the Airbus-Bombardier deal,"" said the official familiar with the talks. ""They have no other possible partner and need a quick fix.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

414,"Jan 18, 2018 09:18AM ET",Emirates hands Airbus A380 superjumbo a lifeline with $16 billion order,nan,"By Tim HepherNANTES, France (Reuters) - Emirates announced a deal for up to 36 Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 aircraft on Thursday worth as much as $16 billion at list prices, saving the world's biggest passenger jet from death row and securing its future for at least another decade.The European planemaker said Emirates [EMIRA.UL] had placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos, with an option for 16 more. Deliveries are due to start in 2020.The agreement hands a lifeline to the slow-selling aircraft, in service for just 10 years, and rescues one of Europe's most visible industrial symbols overseas.""The A380 is good to go,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters. Airbus shares rose more than 3 percent after the announcement to touch a record high of 92.56 euros. The deal ends months of tough-fought negotiations. Talks between Airbus and Emirates about a fresh A380 order broke down at the last minute at the Dubai Airshow in November, when the Gulf carrier placed an order for 40 smaller Boeing (N:BA) 787s.Earlier this week, Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that the A380's survival lay with Emirates, saying it would have ""no choice"" but to close production if the Emirates deal fell through despite interest in smaller orders from others.Emirates and Airbus both said the deal would bring stability to the A380 production line.The deal marks a final flourish for veteran Airbus sales chief John Leahy, one week before he retires after more than 20 years as the driving force of European aircraft exports.""Emirates is committing to the program for the long term and plans to take six airplanes a year for 9-10 years,"" the 67-year-old New Yorker told Reuters from onboard an A380 on his way back to France from Dubai.Calling time on the A380 would not have caused major financial damage to Airbus, but would have been ""emotionally expensive,"" a company source said.SUPERJUMBO VS TWIN-ENGINESLeahy said he was now convinced the A380 would be built well into the 2030s.Sales of the A380 have fallen short of expectation and rival Boeing says the future lies with smaller, twin-engine models like its 777 and Dreamliner that offer more flexibility and are at least as efficient. But Airbus believes its 544-seat superjumbo still has a role as air traffic rises and airports become ever more congested. The Emirates deal also means a potential revival for one of the world’s largest aircraft engines, co-produced by  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX). Their Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it has lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L:RR) on the latest deliveries.Emirates has, however, appeared unhappy with the performance of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. It has invited the two engine makers to compete for the new A380 order, two industry sources said.Rolls-Royce had no immediate comment. Emirates said it had yet to make a decision on engine supplier.Emirates' commitment to take six A380s a year for a decade fills a gap in planned production as Airbus touts business from other airlines. ""That provides a base allowing the program to continue so that Airbus can sell two or three planes here, four there,"" Leahy said.Analysts say Airbus is unlikely to break even on the A380 at such production levels, but that the losses will not make a big impact on the company's accounts, which are dominated by sales of smaller jets worth tens of billions of dollars a year.Emirates is by far the largest operator of the A380 with 101 in service today and a backlog of 41 superjumbos on order before Thursday's announcement. The last order by another airline for the A380 was in 2015 when Japan's ANA booked three.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

415,"Jan 15, 2018 10:13AM ET",Airbus wins 2017 order race after last-gasp sales spree,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Frenetic selling in the closing weeks of 2017 saw Airbus (PA:AIR) overhaul Boeing's (N:BA) recent lead in the global jet market to win their annual order contest for a fifth year in a row, though doubts remain over the future of its flagship A380.The European planemaker said net orders after cancellations rose 52 percent to 1,109 jets in 2017, vaulting past Boeing's 912. Without the cancellations adjustment, Airbus gross orders were 1,229 compared with Boeing's 1,053After peaking in 2014, Airbus says jet demand is growing faster than expected, reflecting busier traffic as global economies kick into a higher gear.""The market is just stronger everywhere,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters.Airbus confirmed it had met its core 2017 target of more than 700 deliveries by releasing 718 jets to customers in 2017, up 4 percent from the previous year.Boeing remained the world's largest jetmaker for the sixth year running, however, with a record total of 763 deliveries.December's surge in commercial and industrial performance allowed Airbus to meet or exceed targets that had seemed elusive a few months ago and caps a turbulent year for the company after rows over corruption investigations and management tensions.Analysts described it as a robust farewell performance by two of the company's dominant figures: record-holding salesman Leahy, who retires this month after more than 20 years at the helm, and chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier, who steps down in February after losing a corporate succession battle.""We beat Boeing one last time ... we just went for it,"" Leahy told Reuters.Both bequeathed challenging targets to their successors as Leahy predicted that orders would exceed deliveries in 2018 for the ninth year in a row, while Bregier predicted ""close to 800"" deliveries this year as output accelerates after engine delays.That figure includes 30 aircraft already built and waiting for engines from United Technologies' (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney, but Bregier said he was confident the U.S. business had turned the corner after delays on new engines.The underlying production target is therefore closer to 770, implying 7 percent growth, which is closer to recent trends.Oddo Securities analyst Yan Derocles said the more confident tone regarding engines for the A320neo gave more credibility to the target of 800 jets.TARGETING TOP DELIVERY SPOTBregier also predicted a record order pipeline of more than 7,000 jets would allow Airbus to lift deliveries beyond those of Boeing in 2020. Both are neck-and-neck in planned production.Boeing has questioned whether all of the aircraft sold by its rival will be delivered.December's sales breakthrough focused mainly on the bread and butter of the Airbus portfolio - the medium-haul A320 family, which competes with Boeing's best-selling 737. Some in the industry have been left wondering how far Airbus was forced to cut prices to grab deals such as the 430 jets sold to four budget carriers via U.S. investor Indigo Partners.Leahy, however, said the Indigo deal and other year-end activity reflected fundamental demand.""It is a very serious deal with some very serious airlines,"" he told Reuters.But in the wide-body, long-haul segment, Airbus lost about half its market share last year, with no new orders and two cancellations for the A380 superjumbo, though Boeing also suffered cancellations for its competing 747.Airbus is locked in make-or-break talks with main A380 customer Emirates about buying 36 more superjumbos.Leahy confirmed a Reuters report that the future of the A380 lies with Emirates, even though other airlines are interested in smaller numbers of the 544-seat jets. If the deal falls through, Airbus would have ""no choice"" but to close production, he said.Reuters reported in December that Airbus had drawn up plans to phase out A380 production if those talks collapsed, without waiting for other potential buyers.""There is some hope. Whether it means we soon conclude an agreement with Emirates? I hope so. There is a joint interest in achieving that, but we are not there yet,"" Bregier told Reuters.Airbus confirmed it plans as part of any possible Emirates deal to reduce A380 output to six aircraft a year from 15 last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The scandal around French arms sales to the island in the early 1990s was one of a series of cases that underpinned accusations of widespread corruption during the final years of late French president Francois Mitterrand.Airbus said in a statement that its subsidiary behind the missile contract, Matra Defense, was ""reviewing the award before evaluating the next steps to take"".The arbitration fine comes three months after Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), radar supplier  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) said they had been fined a combined 227 million euros ($276.80 million) in Taiwan to settle the 25-year-old dispute over the wrongful use of commissions in the sale of 60 Mirage fighters to the island.""This was a commercial dispute and not a corruption allegation,"" said an Airbus spokesman.In a separate case, Airbus said it was in talks with Munich prosecutors that could lead to the termination of their investigation into alleged corruption in the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003.That investigation is one of several corruption cases still facing Europe's largest aerospace company. Airbus did not mention the status of a parallel Austrian investigation into the same arms deal.The company and individuals including CEO Tom Enders are being investigated in Vienna over industrial deals that were built into the Eurofighter sale and have denied any wrongdoing.Separately, Airbus faces UK and French investigations into the use of middlemen in commercial airliner sales.($1 = 0.8201 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""And we also have ambitions on A350 and A380 mid-range and large carriers in the weeks or months to come,"" Macron said.The A320s would be delivered in 2019 and 2020, a French presidency official said on condition of anonymity.Ahead of Macron's trip, sources had told Reuters that Airbus was in talks about an order for 100 or more jets. New jet orders have historically featured during such tours by French leaders. While no deal has been finalised over the current official visit, Macron said China had assured him it would respect market-share parity between Airbus and Boeing (N:BA).China regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing (N:BA), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year.China, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by Xi last July.Airbus signed a provisional deal on Tuesday to boost the number of A320 family jets assembled in Tianjin to six a month by 2020 from four at present.Airbus declined to comment on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

424,"Jan 09, 2018 01:46PM ET",Boeing set to top Airbus with record 763 jets in 2017,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it delivered an industry-record 763 jetliners in 2017, likely beating European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) to retain the title of world's biggest plane maker.Boeing also booked 912 net new aircraft orders worth $134.8 billion at list prices last year, compared with 668 worth about $94 billion in 2016.Airbus was on track last month to rack up more than 1,000 gross new orders for the year, excluding cancellations, compared with the 1,053 gross orders Boeing announced on Tuesday. The tallies confer more than just bragging rights; they show the companies' ability to run factories smoothly, make sales and generate profit.Boeing shares were up 2.9 percent at $319.16 on Tuesday afternoon. The stock has nearly doubled in the past year.Industry sources say Airbus, which will report 2017 orders and deliveries on Jan. 15, met its target of delivering more than 700 jetliners, despite problems with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) Geared Turbofan engines.Airbus' total is still unlikely to match Boeing's. The European firm cut its forecast from more than 720 jets in October due to delays in engine deliveries.Boeing's orders and deliveries confirmed the plane maker's ability to hit rising production rates. This could mean an additional ""$350 million in revenues versus our forecast,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, analyst at Jefferies.Boeing also said airlines likely will need more aircraft in 2018, keeping production rates rising.The company expects airlines to boost passenger capacity by 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said on a conference call. With airlines already flying very full airplanes, more aircraft will be needed. ""We're expecting growth to be driven by new deliveries, not by more capability out of the existing fleet,"" he said.Price targets for Boeing's stock are rising. The median is now $310 a share, up from $293.50 in October. Some targets are as high as $380. Still, 12 analysts rate it a ""hold"" compared with 13 with ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.Meanwhile, air cargo traffic is rising, but a sustained gain could arrive too late to rescue Boeing's 747 aircraft.Boeing has 12 backlogged orders for 747s, about two years' production. Tinseth said air cargo companies are interested. ""The question is when will they be in a position to buy,"" he said. ""They want to make sure that (demand is) sustained.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

426,"Jan 08, 2018 01:29PM ET",Airbus to boost China output as nears jet deal during Macron trip,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is set to boost production of narrowbody jets in China as it nears a new multi-billion-dollar deal to supply the world's fastest-growing aviation market during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, industry sources said.The deal is expected to be unveiled together with a package of agreements coinciding with the French leader's visit, and could include orders for around 100 jetliners, they added.The final number of jets to be sold has not been determined. China is also said to be shopping for larger jets like the A330.Airbus declined comment on Monday.Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) compete for large-scale orders in China and such package deals are typically rolled out during major diplomatic events, but not without last-minute negotiations on the quantity and price of jets.Boeing announced a deal for 300 aircraft during a visit to China by President Donald Trump in November.About one in every four planes that Airbus produces is delivered to China, but fewer than 8 percent are assembled at its Tianjin facility outside Beijing - one of four A320 assembly plants including two in Europe and one in the United States.Airbus is likely as part of any new airplane order to agree to lift the number of aircraft assembled in Tianjin from the current level of around 50 a year, the sources said.NO A380 DEALThe European planemaker is not, however, expected to announce a breakthrough in Chinese support for the 544-seat A380 superjumbo, whose future is threatened by poor sales.The Financial Times reported earlier that Airbus was offering an industrial partnership on the world's largest airliner as part of Macron's visit to China.Macron is accompanied by industry leaders, including Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier, on his visit.Industry sources said that Airbus has studied the possibility of selling China a stake in the A380 superjumbo program, but no immediate deal is on the table.The idea, which has been on the back-burner in Toulouse for some time, would resemble Airbus's decision to take a stake in the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries, but so far there has been little traction and no deal is imminent, one source said.""It's not tomorrow,"" another source added, while others stress the A380's fate hinges instead on ongoing talks to sell 36 of the jets to Dubai's Emirates.An Airbus spokesman said, ""We don't comment on speculation"".Airbus believes that if the A380's future can be secured into the next decade, then China is likely to come into the picture because of its frenetic demand growth.Airbus sees untapped demand for 100 Airbus A380s in China, while Boeing argues that traffic is better served by smaller jets. The U.S. firm is meanwhile expected to confirm its position as the world's largest planemaker when it announces 2017 deliveries on Tuesday. It has targeted 760-765 deliveries.Despite a record December that saw Airbus hand over more than 700 jets for the first time last year, the first delivery of its newest model - the A350-1000 - slipped into 2018 and should happen ""early this year,"" a spokeswoman said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

432,"Jan 03, 2018 02:34AM ET",Boeing-Embraer talks have not settled question of control: sources,nan,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Tie-up talks between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) have not settled key questions such as control of the Brazilian planemaker or the possibility of a more narrow joint venture, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters, pushing back against a newspaper report on Tuesday.Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico had reported that the talks have focused on joint ventures and joint business agreements to share costs and revenue or develop new products without changing control of Embraer.Such an arrangement could ease approval from the Brazilian government, which holds a 'golden share' giving it veto rights over strategic decisions at Embraer and has expressed reservations about a foreign company taking control.However, a joint venture may not be an effective way to combine engineering resources, explore new business opportunities and satisfy Boeing's interest in Embraer's portfolio of regional passenger jets, defense programs and business aircraft, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of talks. Boeing has worked around concerns in foreign markets before, structuring defense subsidiaries in Australia and Britain to satisfy sovereignty demands, and those cases may serve as a reference in Brazil, the sources said.Neither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment.On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a ""potential combination,"" in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly.The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets. Less than three months ago, Boeing's European arch-rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership.The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer's defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said.In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil's government that it could safely operate in Brazil's defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

433,"Jan 02, 2018 01:23PM ET","Airbus delivered over 700 jets in 2017, met target: sources",nan,"By Tim HepherLONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, breaking company records and meeting its core industrial target for the year, industry sources said.Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) over late engines for the company's fastest-selling jet.It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month's deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for ""huge collective efforts"" that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019. Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year's production.Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce (L:RR) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world's largest planemaker, Boeing (N:BA), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

438,"Dec 22, 2017 05:51PM ET",Boeing seeks to salve Brazil concerns over Embraer approach,nan,"By Ricardo Brito and Tim HepherBRASILIA/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) sought to calm Brazilian concern about a potential tie-up with Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) after President Michel Temer and other officials warned they would veto any full takeover bid for the regional jet maker.While Temer said he would welcome an injection of foreign capital into Embraer, his warning was the latest reminder that the company, which also makes some military planes and was one of the more successful products of Brazilian industrial policy, remains a focus of national pride.Boeing said talks with Embraer on what the companies have called a ""potential combination"" were ongoing and insisted that it fully respected the need to safeguard the company's defense and other state links. ""As we noted, discussions are ongoing, but we have always had deep respect for the role of the Government of Brazil, as well as their important defense and security concerns,"" Boeing spokesman Phil Musser said.Earlier, Temer told a news conference he would study any decision the companies take on an alliance, emphasizing that his government could use its 'golden share' in the company to block foreign control of the formerly state-run company, fully privatized in 2006.""When a decision arrives, I will examine it,"" Temer said. He added: ""The purpose of the golden share is for the government to take such a decision.""Defense Minister Raul Jungmann said the government welcomed a commercial alliance with Boeing.""We are in favor of this and other partnerships,"" Jungmann said at the same news conference with Temer.But he also said foreign control of the company was out of the question, citing Embraer's central role in Brazil's defense industry.'STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT'""The moment that control of Embraer passes to a company from another country, it will control strategic decisions"" for Brazil, Jungmann said. ""No country would give up control of that."" He mentioned the Gripen fighter jets Embraer will build with Sweden's Saab AB (ST:SAABb) and the KC-390 cargo jet project with which Embraer plans to dominate the military transport market long dominated by the U.S.-made workhorse Hercules C-130.Boeing and Embraer last year signed a deal under which the U.S. planemaker will help market the new military cargo jet but also provide maintenance services once they are sold.The government's opposition to a full sale does not preclude a more targeted deal, according to a source familiar with the matter. ""If the government persists with its objections, one structure that could be proposed is for the government to keep control of its defense business, and that Embraer sells its commercial business to Boeing,"" the source said. ""The deal is strategically important for Boeing because it will fill out its commercial line with regional jets.""Some kind of commercial jet joint venture between the two jet makers would ""make a lot of sense,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""Even some kind of military joint venture such as military transports would make sense - but an acquisition of Embraer makes no sense.""Embraer shares, which soared 20 percent on Thursday, fell 1.4 percent on Friday. Boeing shares edged up 0.24 percent.It would be harder to quantify the gains to shareholders from a more limited joint-venture deal than with an outright acquisition, said Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr.""I honestly think Boeing knew all along that it would be a joint venture or partnership,"" he said. ""But just like with Airbus-Bombardier, you can still set up something along those lines that's clearly a win-win.""The Boeing-Embraer talks come just two months after Airbus SE (PA:AIR) struck a deal to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jetliner program.Potential gains for Embraer would include Boeing's greater sales clout with major airlines, as well as with servicing existing jets and potential savings with suppliers, he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

439,"Dec 21, 2017 06:00PM ET","Big Boeing, Airbus strategies drive small plane deals",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Brad HaynesPARIS/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing are pairing with smaller regional rivals to add sales at the lower end of their $100 billion-a-year commercial plane duopoly, but the two market leaders are also laying the foundation for a longer-term strategic contest against more powerful threats such as China.U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) said on Thursday they were discussing a ""potential combination"" widely assumed to focus on jetliners, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.News of the talks comes just two months after Boeing's European archrival Airbus (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) 110 to 130-seat CSeries jet, the Canadian rival of Embraer's biggest E-Jets.""This seems initially to be about blunting the offering of the CSeries,"" said consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group, one of the first industry-watchers to predict the move. ""One of the things the CSeries brings to Airbus is the ability to offer a broader product line."" Both Embraer's E-Jets, which generally range between 70 and 130 seats, and to a greater extent Bombardier's CSeries, overlap at the margins of the big-airplane portfolios of Airbus and Boeing, but the products are mainly seen as complementary. Boeing and Airbus smaller planes start at around 125 seats.Such commercial tie-ups allow planemakers to offer package deals and expand opportunities for generating revenue and profit, a person familiar with the CSeries deal said.Boeing now appears to be a convert to this approach after initially - at least in public - dismissing the deal between Airbus and Bombardier, several analysts said on Thursday.But the proposed alliances, neither of which is finalised, are not simply about tacking on revenue and cash flow, analysts and industry sources said.First, they could quickly lead to technical overlap.""If Boeing begins to collaborate with Embraer, you could imagine them creating commonality in the Boeing cockpit,"" Lundquist said. Others see similar benefits at Airbus.More importantly, they broaden the battlefront for the next round of developments in 2030 and beyond: one in which Western jetmakers will be up against growing competition from China and Russia and could rely on their new partners to spread the risk.PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATIONBoeing and Embraer had already prepared just such a tryst in confidential talks over a decade ago. In October, Reuters reported that the template for a possible Boeing-Embraer response to the Airbus-Bombardier deal already existed in dormant plans for a new generation of single-aisle planes, for which there had been a previously unreported collaboration between Boeing and Brazil.Plans for an all-new plane were put on hold while Boeing and Airbus focused on engine makeovers for existing models, cashing in on fuel savings that were considered strong enough to hold off Chinese and Russian competitors for another 10 or 15 years.But the blueprint for deeper co-operation between Embraer and Boeing remained in place and by breaking the status quo, Airbus's Bombardier deal may have brought it back to life.""Embraer gives Boeing access to technology for smaller jets for application on a next-generation narrowbody aircraft,"" Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins said in a research note.A source with knowledge of the matter said Boeing had already approached Embraer twice about a potential deal in 2002 and 2006. At the time, the Brazilian government vetoed any deal, saying Embraer was a ""strategic"" company for the country.Brazilian President Michel Temer, who took office last year, has pushed a more market-friendly agenda than predecessors.Deals with their smaller cousins may give Airbus and Boeing more options when they develop the successors to the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, perhaps allowing them to offer a trio of large jets coupled to a pair of smaller ones.For Boeing, however, there may be another gamble at play.The American firm is considering launching a twin-aisle 220 to 260-seat jet in the so-called middle of the market, challenging Airbus in the segment where it began life over 40 years ago.The timing of the talks leaves open the possibility that any core technology Embraer has to offer could be considered for the ""new mid-market airplane (NMA),"" people familiar with the matter said.To some, that only increases the chances that Boeing will kick-start the project next year, taking pains at the same time to shore up the lower end of its market with an Embraer tie-up.""Boeing would apparently prefer to do the NMA and taking on two major developments at once may be considered too ambitious,” Lundquist said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

440,"Dec 21, 2017 04:56PM ET",Boeing in talks with Embraer; Brazil backs jetliner alliance,nan,"By Brad Haynes and Rodrigo Viga GaierSAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Planemakers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) are discussing a ""potential combination,"" they said on Thursday, in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly provided Brazil's government gives its blessing.Embraer's shares soared more than 20 percent in New York and Sao Paulo to close with a market capitalization of $4.5 billion after the statement, which did not give details of how a tie-up might be structured. Boeing shares slipped nearly 1 percent.The Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer, would support a partnership in commercial aviation with Boeing but would block any takeover attempt, a senior government official told Reuters. The news comes just two months after Boeing rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jetliner program, a direct rival of Embraer's biggest E-Jets. Reuters reported at the time that the CSeries deal could push Boeing and Embraer closer together.For decades, Canada's Bombardier and Embraer have faced off in the 70- to 100-seat regional jet segment just below the radar of Airbus and Boeing's larger commercial jet line-ups, but the CSeries alliance may have tipped that delicate balance.Boeing has approached Embraer about a deal twice before, more than a decade ago, but was rebuffed due to the government's veto, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. ENDING GOLDEN SHARES Any tie-up involving Embraer requires approval by Brazil's government, which holds a 'golden share' in the planemaker, a formerly state-run company fully privatized in 2006. Brazil's President Michel Temer took office last year with a market-friendly agenda focused on privatizing state utilities and reducing political influence in state firms such as oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4).In September, Brazil's Finance Ministry asked an audit court to study how the government could exit the golden shares it holds in former state monopolies.Temer's policies contrast with those of the Workers Party that governed from 2003 until 2016, placing an emphasis on state-led development and 'national champions' in strategic industries.Still, foreign control of the planemaker at the apex of Brazilian industry appears to be a stretch even for Temer.""Embraer will never be sold in my government,"" he told military aides in a meeting on Thursday, according to a report by Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo.Folha, which did not say how it obtained the information, said the meeting was called after a report in The Wall Street Journal that Boeing was in talks to take over Embraer.A spokeswoman at the Defense Ministry, which works closely with Embraer on military programs, said it was premature for the government to say anything that could upset the talks. ""They still have to consult the government. We are following closely but there is nothing concrete yet and anything we say now could be imprudent and harm the talks,"" said spokeswoman Adriana Fortes. ""Not even the companies have agreed on anything concrete.""The two planemakers already work on projects including runway safety and alternative jet fuels. Their partnership intensified recently to include Boeing's commitment to joint sales and support of Embraer's KC-390 military airlifter.""Although Boeing would look like a good fit with Embraer's Regional Jet business, this is not the case for the company's Executive Jet and Defense divisions,"" said Rob Stallard, aerospace analyst at Vertical Research Partners in a note.Boeing is willing to take steps to protect Embraer's brand, management and jobs to help entice the government and is also willing to structure a deal to protect the government's interest in Embraer's defense business, the WSJ reported.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

441,"Dec 21, 2017 10:10AM ET","Ballooning French corporate debt rattles regulators, but not lenders",nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - French corporate debt has ballooned to record levels as other euro zone countries have seen their firms cut debt, unsettling the central bank and prompting a cap on bank lending to the most indebted corporate borrowers.Yet, while the surging debt is stressing regulators, senior bankers, ratings agencies and some economists say it is not so much a case of reckless borrowing as of clever financial engineering in which companies by take advantage of low interest rates to cope with high taxes.France's financial stability council, which includes the finance minister and central bank governor, has taken the unprecedented step of limiting a bank's exposure to highly indebted firms to five percent of its capital. It was essentially a shot across the lenders' bows a bit over-exposure.French corporate borrowing has grown at more than six percent this year, and closer to eight percent for big companies with easy access to the bond market, Bank of France data shows. That compares with forecasted economic growth of 1.8 percent.In fact, 60 percent of the recent increases in euro zone corporate borrowing came from French firms even though France represents only 20 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, also according to the French central bank.That has left French corporate debt at a record 134 percent of GDP, data from the Bank for International Settlements show. Stripping out intra-group loans, the Bank of France pegs the figure at a more manageable but still record 72 percent.""We consider that there is a risk that big companies in particular are going too far,"" Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said.The central bank is particularly worried that, thanks to cheap credit, some firms are overpaying for acquisitions and could find themselves nursing painful losses should they have to book big writedowns on takeover values in the future.The council says the lending cap, which will take effect in mid-2018, applies to about 10 firms which it is has not identified.Villeroy said it concerned firms with net debt over 100 percent of equity, which could cover companies like Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), Suez (PA:SEVI), Airbus (PA:AIR), EDF (PA:EDF) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), according to Thomson Reuters data.Companies not based in France but with big operations there could also be affected, which could include highly indebted Dutch-registered telecoms group Altice (AS:ATCA).The companies either declined to comment or were not immediately in a position do so when contacted by Reuters.While debt levels are manageable now, a return to historic norms for interest rates could cut profits by more than 20 percent, Natixis chief economist Patrick Artus calculates.""The corporate credit situation in France is very highly dependent on what happens to interest rates,"" Artus told Reuters. ""There's a real problem with corporate debt in France.""RISKS CONTAINEDVilleroy acknowledges there is no imminent danger and the lending cap is for now more bark than bite.""It gives an extremely strong signal that we don't want certain exposures to be increased,"" Villeroy said, adding that it could be tightened if necessary.Economist Marion Amiot of Oxford Economics, meanwhile, says that high levels of debt are not a major cause for concern as the borrowing was put to good use.""Companies have used the money to invest and improve their profitability, even in the face of a high tax burden and rigid labor laws,"" she wrote in a research note.Even though French firms' profit margins are among the weakest in the euro zone, they have maintained above-average investment rates, according to national accounts data.Also, rather than returning cash to shareholders or buy back shares, French firms have retained earnings, keeping balance sheets relatively healthy despite the additional debt.While regulators are uneasy over record debt, investors so far seem content to oblige borrowers.When utility Veolia (PA:VIE) tapped the market for a three-year bond last month, not only did it secure a negative interest rate, but investor bids reached four times the amount offered.Moody's analyst Guillaume Leglise said that credit quality and companies' ratings were on average stable, even though some firms had leveraged up.""Everything is on track, there isn't a short-term liquidity risk, most companies are taking advantage of exceptional market conditions to refinance or to finance acquisitions with debt,"" Leglise said.Indeed, Moody's forecasts French corporate bond issuance to rise next year as the economy picks up. Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) co-head of corporate debt origination Felix Orsini said issuers were being cautious, even if the temptation to take on debt was rising after years of low interest rates.""It's true that after a while management asks, can we take advantage of these financing conditions to make acquisitions or investments, hence the upturn in M&A,"" he said.But he added: ""corporate finance directors, and especially those in France, are among the most cautious people I know.""For a graphic on global corporate debt, click http://reut.rs/2z4LgpdFor a graphic on French corporate debt, click http://reut.rs/2z4qXrJFor a graphic on French profit/investment, click http://reut.rs/2B6NIwZ(Reporting and Graphics by Leigh Thomas; editing by Richard Lough/Jeremy Gaunt)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

442,"Dec 21, 2017 05:30AM ET",U.S. tax cuts mix pleasure and pain for Europe's dollar earners,nan,"By Alasdair PalLONDON (Reuters) - A slate of U.S. tax reforms could provide a lift for European companies that sell into the country. For others, it may yet turn out to be a threat. Proposals passed by lawmakers on Wednesday will see the corporate tax rate in the United States fall to 21 percent from 35 percent, a dramatic cut that is likely to boost the profits of American corporations.The change is likely to benefit some European companies, too, and investment banks have been quick to point that out: JP Morgan has introduced a basket of 41 European stocks it believes will benefit most for its clients to buy. More than a sixth of companies in the pan-European Stoxx 600 index (STOXX) derive more than a third of their revenues from North America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Thirty-one stocks generate more than half their turnover in the United States. Nineteen of those are UK-domiciled, with construction and defense companies well-represented: Ashtead (L:AHT),  Cobham  (L:COB), Ferguson (L:FERG),  Meggitt  (L:MGGT) and  Melrose  (L:MRON) are all heavily exposed, according to the data. Equipment rental firm Ashtead, whose U.S. Sunbelt arm made up 86 percent of 2016 revenues, should see a “material impact” from the tax reform, according to analysts at Liberum. The company has told analysts it expects its effective tax rate to fall from 34-35 percent to 23-25 percent -- an uplift of 15 percent to Liberum’s current profit estimates for 2020.Building and plumbing supplier Ferguson, with 78 percent of its revenues from the United States, could also benefit according to analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), though the company said in its quarterly results in early December the reduction of its tax rate would be less than four percentage points.InterContinental Hotels (L:IHG) (58 percent U.S. revenues) said on Thursday its tax rate would reduce by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points, as well as benefiting from an ""exceptional"" tax credit in the year the bill is signed. Share prices of many U.S.-exposed European companies have seen strong gains as the tax bill edged towards the finish line. But Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said analysts have been quite slow to factor it into their 2018 company earnings estimates. ""It would not be that surprising if we see that with P/E having expanded already, as those earnings upgrades come through that potentially takes (share prices) even a little bit higher,"" he said. But not all firms that earn in dollars will gain an advantage. Boeing (NYSE:BA) N>, whose main commercial planemaking rival is Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), said it would now pay tax at rates closer to those of global rivals, helping it compete better.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said French catering company Sodexo (PA:EXHO), which makes 61 percent of operating profit (EBIT) in the United States, could see 6 percent EBIT upside from the reforms, but the investment bank believes British rival Compass already has a lower U.S. tax rate than Sodexo and would see ""little benefit"". Daniel Ekstein, an analyst at UBS, said the broker has received a number of questions about whether Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) would benefit. Despite deriving 62 percent of revenues from the United States, the retailer’s tax rate is already low at around 24 percent, meaning its U.S. peers could benefit more and leading to deflation in the retail sector.“If the U.S food retail industry were to benefit from, say, an average 5 percent reduction in tax rate we believe that in the mid-term you'd see shelf-edge prices 5 percent lower, rather than margins 5 percent higher,” he said in a note to clients.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus has a big pool of talent ... and will power on with new leadership,"" Peter Bellew, chief operations officer at Ryanair (I:RYA) and former CEO of Malaysia Airlines, told Reuters.Airbus officials sought to dampen speculation that Enders had a hand in his deputy's departure and presented the move as the work of an independent board.But analysts said the push for a fresh start had curtailed the ambitions of both executives, ending a longstanding but troubled partnership at the helm of Airbus. Even so, many saw Enders as a clear winner.COLLATERAL DAMAGEEnders in 2014 froze payments to middlemen and later shared an audit revealing misleading filings with UK authorities, but has seen his authority challenged as the discovery triggered UK and French fraud investigations and a backlash in France.""It means two things: that despite his wishes, Enders could be replaced, and it would not automatically be Bregier,"" a senior source with close links to the company said.The overhaul is not directly connected to investigations but both men appear to have suffered collateral damage from the probes, which made their differences clearer, one source said.The company said the board had acted to secure an orderly succession at the world's second-largest planemaker.During 2018, the board will look both inside and outside for a successor to 58-year-old Enders ""in good time"" for confirmation at the 2019 annual shareholder meeting, it said.The shake-up came after Bregier, a 56-year-old who has long been seen as the natural heir to Enders, told the board he did not intend to be part of the selection process for 2019 and would therefore step down in February to ""pursue other interests"" - widely viewed as code for not being short-listed.Enders said he would work to ensure a smooth transition.However, both scarcely tried to mask tensions as Bregier recalled changes of title - a pointed reminder of a bitter feud with Enders - while Enders said he agreed with Bregier's decision ""and frankly, I would not have done differently"".Some sources said Bregier had sought support from the French government and Airbus's French chairman, prompting the board to show its muscle. But the selection process will remain under scrutiny from investors worried about any return to past efforts by shareholders France or Germany to tilt appointments.""We believe the worst thing that could happen at Airbus in the coming 12-24 months is for evidence of political considerations coming to the fore,"" Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

447,"Dec 14, 2017 06:54PM ET",Airbus planemaking chief Bregier to leave in February: sources,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier plans to leave the aerospace group after the board intervened to resolve tensions over the future succession to Chief Executive Tom Enders, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Bregier will be replaced in February at the helm of the main planemaking division by Guillaume Faury, the 49-year-old head of Airbus Helicopters, who is not, however, expected to inherit Bregier's broader title as chief operating officer, they added.Airbus declined to comment.The shake-up, to be announced before markets open on Friday, was agreed at a board meeting on Thursday following weeks of tensions inside Europe's largest aerospace group.It comes a day after a source told Reuters a change of governance could not be excluded before end-year.On Wednesday, Bregier said he was ""surprised"" by reports that his position was under threat and said his sole priority was to ensure Airbus met targets. Bregier, 56, is credited with stabilizing industrial problems at the world's second largest planemaker and is in charge of delivering on a record order backlog that underpins near-record share prices. He also oversaw a key sale to Japan and negotiated a recent deal to rescue an order from Qatar.Despite a long-running personal rivalry, Bregier was long assumed to be the heir apparent to Enders, whose own future in Airbus is uncertain amid indications that he has changed his mind about seeking a third mandate beyond 2019.But following a board-commissioned review of potential candidates and a spike in management tensions, Bregier's long-awaited promotion appeared to be in question and the usually cautious engineer appeared frustrated, two insiders said.Others saw a more deliberate move by Enders to oust BregierCHANGING OF GUARDTensions between the two men came to a head this year in a row over who should control the powerful jet sales department, first reported by Reuters. But the fate of the two executives, long seen as the power duo in European aviation, is said by many to be intertwined.""This is the first step in the changing of the guard at Airbus: Bregier leaving must also signal the beginning of the end for Enders,"" an industry source said.In the shorter term, it may be seen as a respite for Enders, whose position had been weakened by media coverage and the departure of unpopular former technology chief Paul Eremenko.Bregier could not be reached for comment. He has been linked with energy firm Engie, where he is on the board (PA:ENGIE). His departure comes as Airbus braces for the retirement of sales boss John Leahy, who bookended his career on Thursday with the sale of 100 jets to Delta, 31 years after his first deal to sell 100 to what is now part of the same airline.The management row has played out in a febrile climate caused by international fraud investigations over commercial and military sales and fears of a slew of further departures.Two sources said Frenchman Bregier had sought support from the French government, mirroring recent backing from Berlin for German-born Enders, or appealed to Airbus' French chairman, Denis Ranque.The Airbus board has been under pressure to demonstrate its independence following a backlash in France over the handling of a compliance crackdown. Recent turmoil has tested a 2013 deal to tame the influence of European governments, one of whose authors, Emmanuel Macron, is now France's president.A spokesman for the French government, which like the German government owns 11 percent of Airbus, declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

448,"Dec 14, 2017 09:32AM ET",Delta Air Lines to place order for Airbus jets,nan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Thursday it will place a firm order for 100 Airbus (PA:AIR) A321neo jets and an optional order for 100 of the aircraft. Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2020, with new aircraft arriving through 2023.CNN and Reuters reported yesterday that Airbus had beaten out rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) for the order, boosting Airbus' leading share of the market for narrowbody models, while highlighting the increasingly fraught relationship between Delta and Chicago-based Boeing. The two U.S. companies' relationship began to fray in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from Canada's Bombardier Inc.The carrier declined to say whether the disagreement between the two planemakers had any effect on its decision to go with Airbus. ""This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a statement. Delta's decision also gives lift to United Technologies (N:UTX) subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, which the carrier said had won the contract for the engines that will power the A321neo aircraft.In the same SEC filing, Delta also said it now expects operating margin of 11 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with the 11 percent to 13 percent it had previously forecast Delta Air Lines' shares were up 2 percent in premarket trading. Up to Wednesday's close, Delta's stock had risen 9 percent this year, compared with a 20.7 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Travel & Leisure index (DJUSCG).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

449,"Dec 14, 2017 05:56AM ET","Airbus executive says considering cuts to A380 production, still undecided",nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Airbus SE (PA:AIR) is considering cutting production of its A380 superjumbo to six or seven planes a year, but has made no final decision on the matter, a top executive said on Thursday amid growing question marks over the future of the double-decker jet.The A380 has battled against sluggish sales, squeezed by smaller, more efficient twin-engined jets. Airbus has previously announced plans to lower output to 12 aircraft in 2018 and eight in 2019, compared with an annual peak of 30.""We believe we can produce this aircraft at 6-7 a year in an industrial way,"" Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier told Reuters after the first Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) A380 featuring a new cabin configuration landed in Singapore.""It is a way to be able to go through I would say are low tide years... The A380 will find its way progressively.""The comments come ahead of a board meeting on Thursday where directors are seeking to contain damage from international fraud investigations over commercial and military sales, while getting a grip on what could become a chain reaction of departures, people familiar with the matter have said.Bregier, who dismissed on Wednesday a report in France's La Tribune newspaper that he had agreed to leave Airbus in February next year, said on Thursday he hoped to remain at the firm.""You can see I am quite relaxed about it,"" he said. ""I don't need to be outside the door to listen to what will happen but I think they were clear that all of this buzz in the French press is probably a bit premature.""Festering animosity between Bregier, who is not a board member, and CEO Tom Enders boiled over earlier this year in a row over who should control the powerful jet sales department.Analysts say ongoing negotiations over a deal with carrier Emirates will be decisive for the future of the A380.Emirates, which held off signing an order for an estimated 36 aircraft at last month's Dubai Airshow, wants guarantees Airbus will produce the A380 for the next 10 years.Reducing output to six a year would help to bridge that period and support key second-hand values while Airbus looks for other buyers, but could leave the program losing money for at least part of the period.Following a clampdown on costs, Airbus has said the A380 can break even at production levels of 20 a year, while Bregier has previously said he is pushing the breakeven level as low as possible to sustain low production.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 2 to read ""eight in 2019"" instead of ""eight in 2018"")"
450,"Dec 13, 2017 05:27PM ET",Lockheed Martin may top Boeing in race to supply Canada jets: experts,nan,"By David LjunggrenOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's decision to make it harder for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to win a major jet order hands rival plane maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) an advantage in capturing the contract, defense experts said on Wednesday.That would mark a reversal in Lockheed's fortunes after Liberal leader Justin Trudeau campaigned in 2015 on a promise not to buy the firm's F-35 stealth fighter.Ottawa on Tuesday scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets and made clear the company would not win a contract for 88 jets unless it dropped a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).Officials estimate the cost of the jets at between C$15 billion ($11.7 billion) and C$19 billion and say it is the biggest investment in the air force in 30 years.Last week Boeing made clear it would not back down in its fight against Bombardier, which it accuses of trying to dump airliners on the U.S. market.The firm may not even launch a bid for the 88 jets, the first of which are due to be delivered in 2025.That leaves the F-35, a new aircraft, up against two European rivals which first flew in the 1990s: the Eurofighter Typhoon (PA:AIR) (L:BAES) (MI:LDOF) and Dassault Aviation SA's (PA:AVMD) Rafale.One defense source noted that the European jets were likely to become obsolete by around 2040, at which point they could no longer incorporate the latest technologies.""The longer this process plays out, the narrower the government's options become, and the prospects for a European jet become even dimmer,"" said the source, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The Super Hornet first flew in 1995.A second defense source said Boeing now had little chance of winning the 88-plane contract and noted Canada's air force had long sought an American jet so it could operate easily with the U.S. military.Neither source works for a company that might make a bid.The official opposition Conservative Party accused Trudeau of bungling the matter. ""Will the prime minister take responsibility and admit we are never going to get new jets?"" Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said in the House of Commons.Lockheed Martin said it was confident the F-35 was superior to older competitors. Boeing described the Super Hornet as ""the low-risk, low-cost approach"" which could serve Canada's needs well into the future.Canada belongs to the nine-nation consortium that helped fund development of the F-35, which has been hit by years of delays and cost overruns.Trudeau initially opposed the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but Ottawa has since softened its line.Officials insist the competition will be open and say no company will be excluded. Yet in a clear swipe at Boeing, ministers say any bidder deemed to have harmed Canada's economy will be at a distinct disadvantage.Boeing accuses Bombardier of imitating Airbus by trying to muscle into the U.S. market. People familiar with Boeing say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the fighter dispute.Jerry Dias, president of the Unifor union, said in a phone interview he did not think Boeing would react by cutting jobs. Unifor represents 1,300 workers at a Boeing plant in Winnipeg.Boeing says its operations support 17,500 Canadian jobs.($1=1.2865 Canadian dollars)(Addtional reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Delta's decision to side with Airbus jets over the Boeing model came as no surprise to people in the industry, who have for months watched as tensions continued to escalate between the two U.S.-based companies.Their relationship began to strain in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from rival planemaker Canada-based Bombardier Inc.Boeing had alleged that Bombardier received illegal subsidies from the Canadian government, allowing the planemaker to dump the 75 jets at ""absurdly low"" prices. ""Boeing had a double disadvantage here.

Delta's CSeries deliveries, scheduled to begin in spring 2018, face a possible 300 percent U.S. duty stemming from a trade dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA).In October, Bombardier gave a controlling stake in the CSeries program to Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which would enable assembly in the United States in a move it says will help bypass potential import duties.Under the proposed Aeromexico deal, the single-aisle jets would be sold to Aeromexico and fly under the banner of the Mexican carrier which would not have to pay a U.S. duty, one of the sources added.""It's not a way for Aeromexico to fly for Delta,"" the same source said. ""But it keeps the planes within the Delta family.""Aeromexico is now reviewing its fleet, a third source said, which is composed of Boeing and Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) jets. The carrier received a presentation about the 110-to-130 seat CSeries last week, and is expected to receive another from Bombardier's Brazilian rival, the source said.Sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the talks are confidential. They cautioned that no final decision has been made and Aeromexico could still buy planes from Embraer.Embraer and Bombardier both declined to comment. Aeromexico referred questions to Delta. Delta did not comment on any specific deal, but spokesman Morgan Durrant referred to recent remarks by the company's CEO who said the carrier would not pay any duties, but still intended to ""take the aircraft."" An Aeromexico deal would offer a short-term solution to Bombardier and Delta in the trade dispute. A U.S. trade agency is expected to decide in early 2018 on Boeing's complaint that the Canadian company benefited unfairly from subsidies and dumped the 110- to 130-seat CSeries jets in the U.S. market below cost.The case has fueled trade tensions between Canada and the United States and comes as the two countries, along with Mexico, are engaged in tense negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Bombardier has said it would assemble the CSeries jets destined for U.S. airlines at Airbus' Alabama plant, which the two companies say would exempt them from duties.Boeing has countered that the CSeries should still be subject to duties, even if the planes are assembled in the United States.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

460,"Nov 26, 2017 09:42AM ET",Exclusive: Airbus set to poach Rolls exec to head jetliner sales - sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is poised to hire the head of Rolls-Royce's civil engines unit, Eric Schulz, to lead its commercial jetliner sales, after months of uncertainty over the successor to sales kingpin John Leahy, three people familiar with the matter said. Schulz, president of the civil engines division at the British engineering firm, has been recommended for the post to bring in outside blood as the company faces turmoil over the impact of UK and French corruption investigations.Christian Scherer, chief executive of turboprop maker ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace firm Leonardo (MI:LDOF), had also been considered for one of aviation's highest profile roles.Scherer, an Airbus veteran of 30 years before joining ATR, was seen by many as a leading candidate and enjoys close ties to Chief Executive Tom Enders. But although Scherer has not been linked to the compliance investigations, industry sources said the board is insisting on a break with the past.A final decision will be taken by the Airbus board based on a panel's decision to put forward one name, that of Schulz.Airbus and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) declined to comment. Schulz and Scherer could not immediately be reached for comment.Leahy has been in the post since 1994 and is a dominant figure in the $100 billion-a-year aerospace industry, making his succession one of the sector's most closely watched moves.He is expected to retire around Jan. 25 after deferring his departure for several months when his hand-picked successor, deputy sales chief Kiran Rao, pulled out of the race.CLOSE TIESSchulz, an affable 54-year-old French engineer, began his career at one of Airbus's founders, France's former state-owned Aerospatiale, before working at aerospace supplier Goodrich via a stint at two French airlines: UTA and Air Liberte.He is part of a relatively new management team that pulled Rolls-Royce out of its own compliance scandal and financial problems and has been running civil engines since January 2016.His experience reinforces close ties between Airbus and Rolls-Royce on wide-body jets, mirroring last year's decision by rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) to recruit a top executive from its own top supplier,  General Electric  (N:GE), to run its commercial unit.""Rolls-Royce and Airbus are joined at the hip so they must know him well, and he them,"" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham, adding Schulz came across as ""open and realistic"".But he will inherit a Toulouse sales organization unsettled by recent defeats against Boeing and widely seen as desperate for stability amid the probes, which center on a now defunct Paris-based unit of Airbus headquarters.""They have chosen a clean break but that is not without risk,"" a senior industry source said.If, as expected, he is confirmed by the Airbus board, Schulz will need to act quickly to restore staff morale and rebuild bridges with customers following a wobbly Dubai Airshow this month, industry sources said.But although he has twice worked for firms linked to Airbus, Schulz's independent career path may give him a freer hand to shape a marketing machine urgently needing a fresh spark after prolonged uncertainty over Leahy's succession.""He is very straight; not political,"" said a person who has negotiated with Schulz.Analysts say investors are for now playing down the probes and loss of order momentum because Airbus, like Boeing, is cushioned by record backlogs of jets waiting to be produced.But the choice of sales boss is a decision that many say will influence the direction of the aerospace giant for years.Airbus shares have risen 18.5 percent in the past six months, outperforming an almost-flat French CAC40 (FCHI) index.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Enders was interviewed in early October by anti-corruption investigators in Nanterre, close to Paris, as was Chairman Denis Ranque, Mediapart, France Inter and Der Spiegel reported. Authorities are probing an alleged suspect payment linked to the satellite deal, Mediapart reported, adding that Enders and the other executives were not alleged to have any role in it.""We have no comment to make other than that we are fully co-operating with authorities,"" a spokesman for Airbus said.

Slattery said at the time that Avolon was considering Boeing's 737 MAX 10.Bohai, part of aviation-to-shipping conglomerate HNA Group, said Avolon expected to take delivery of the aircraft between 2021 and 2024. Avolon was sold to Shenzhen-listed Bohai Capital Holding Co in 2015.Bohai and other state-backed Chinese firms are expanding in the aircraft financing and leasing business as customer airlines open routes at home and abroad.The announcement comes after Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing recently reported orders for a total of around 100 jets from China Development Bank Financial Leasing (CDB Leasing) (HK:1606).Airbus publicized the deal for 45 jets last week during the Dubai Airshow, bolstering a show tally dominated by a record preliminary order for 430 jets but no firm business.However the Airbus order from CDB appeared to correspond to a pre-show announcement by Boeing of an order for 56 jets from the same company, or a net 52 after conversions.Both deals were approved on Nov. 8, company filings show.

465,"Nov 17, 2017 07:20PM ET",Business jets risk U.S. pilot shortage on competition from airlines,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Business jet operators, already offering double digit raises to attract pilots, could face a labor shortfall in North America as they compete with U.S. airlines for talent, executives and analysts said. Competition is intensifying from airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and better benefits and are taking delivery of new aircraft at a fast pace, U.S.-based aviation consultant Rolland Vincent said.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) left the Dubai Air Show this week with around 700 provisional orders for narrowbody commercial jets, potentially adding to already hefty backlogs. It is expected that the world's rapidly growing commercial aviation industry will need an additional 255,000 pilots by 2027, according to training specialist  CAE  Inc (TO:CAE). U.S. legacy carriers are recruiting employees to fly new aircraft and replace retiring staff, with American Airlines (O:AAL) expected to hire 900 mainline pilots in 2018, up from just over 500 in 2017, said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots' Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots.""It's really a buyers' market and the buyer is the pilot now,"" Tajer said in a telephone interview on Friday. ""If you don't pay pilots the market rate you're going to lose them.""By contrast, in Europe corporate jet operators did not lose many pilots this year to commercial aviation because carriers had an adequate supply of pilots after Air Berlin (DE:AB1) and Britain's Monarch Airlines ceased operations, said Adam Twidell, chief executive of PrivateFly, a global private jet charter broker.According to the 2017 pilot salary survey from the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), a captain flying a midsized corporate plane like the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) Challenger 350 made about $130,000 on average. In 2017, an American Airlines captain flying the B737 or A320 narrowbody earned just over $268,000, according to an APA compensation document.Don Haloburdo, vice president and general manager of flight services for business aircraft management and charter company Jet Aviation, a division of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), said corporate pilots' salaries rose 20 percent this year on an annual basis. Haloburdo expects the higher salaries to slightly increase operating costs for business jet companies, but that could be absorbed. He does not think they would hurt sales since owners' largest expense, fuel, is relatively low. Although business jet sales are flat, Haloburdo expects demand for corporate pilots and maintenance technicians to pick up after 2018 as airlines boost recruiting efforts and popular new planes hit the market from Bombardier and Gulfstream, also a division of General Dynamics.""When Bombardier starts delivering the Global 7000 in significant numbers, Gulfstream starts delivering their G500 and G600 in significant numbers, that's where our industry is going to have a very significant challenge finding qualified crew members,"" he said.Most buyers of the Global 7000, which lists for about $73 million, already own corporate jets and have their own pilot crews, Bombardier Business Aircraft President David Coleal said in an interview.But the new jets could attract less well-paid corporate pilots who work on contract and fly smaller aircraft. It can already be difficult for companies without full time crews to schedule last-minute flights, said Warren Peck, president of Phoenix Rising Aviation, an Oklahoma-based maintenance and repair operation specializing in Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD) Falcoln jets. A former U.S. military pilot, Peck offers to fly at a discounted rate for his maintenance customers who cannot find a pilot. ""A lot of my customers, operators don't have full-time, in-house pilots,"" he said. ""For them, it's very helpful.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Any successor would want to review major weapons programs like the heavy-lift helicopter.Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) is also challenging the ministry's plans, arguing that German firms should get a big share of the maintenance and management of the project. The ministry has pushed back, saying it would be too unwieldy to award separate contracts for production and sustainment of the planes.Bringing the CH-53K helicopter to Berlin will allow military officials to compare the two aircraft on site.Two Boeing CH-47 helicopters were brought to a conference in Germany in July, but the Lockheed aircraft, just entering production for the Marine Corps, was not on site.Eight other NATO countries already use the CH-47 Chinook, while Germany currently flies the CH-53G, an older version of the CH-53K that Lockheed will offer.Some German military officials favor the CH-47 which they say is combat-proven and cheaper, but others say the larger CH-53K would allow growth in future missions.The U.S. Marine Corps expect to declare the CH-53K ready for combat use in 2019. They have said the average cost of the huge aircraft will be around $88 million a copy. The cost could drop somewhat if Germany, Israel and Japan also buy the planes. Experts say it would cost less to buy the Chinook, but it will require several upgrades in coming years that could add cost. It also carries less, so it takes more flights to accomplish the same mission.Beth Parcella, in charge of Lockheed's drive to win the German contract for the CH-53K, told Reuters she thought the helicopter still had good chances in the German competition. ""The price differential is not going to be anywhere as significant as it's being portrayed,"" she said. ""It's a larger, heavier aircraft, so it's going to cost more. But it's going to be a lot closer than people think.""She said the new aircraft would also cost far less to service given its on-board diagnostic system.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

470,"Nov 15, 2017 08:16AM ET",Biggest deal yet for Airbus as Franke ups bet on budget airlines,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) - Airbus landed its biggest ever airliner deal on Wednesday with an agreement to sell 430 planes worth up to $50 billion to U.S. budget airlines investor Bill Franke.The preliminary deal for A320neo narrowbody jets was signed at the Dubai Airshow and offers a major boost to Airbus, which has lagged arch rival Boeing (N:BA) in deals this year.It also ensures veteran sales chief John Leahy retires on a high in the coming months. But Boeing immediately hit back with a provisional agreement to sell 175 planes to budget airline flydubai. Including options to buy a further 50 planes, that deal could be worth $27 billion at list prices.The deal between Airbus and Franke's Indigo Partners is the industry's largest ever by number of aircraft. Indigo plans to supply the A320neo narrowbody jets to four airlines in which it has stakes: Frontier Airlines, Mexico's Volaris, Chilean carrier JetSmart and Hungary's Wizz Air (L:WIZZ).Airbus (PA:AIR) said it expected to finalize the transaction with the 80-year-old Franke in the coming weeks. Its shares were up 2.5 percent to 85.59 euros at 1150 GMT. The agreement, along with flydubai's deal for Boeing's 737 MAX narrowbody jets, underscores how budget carriers are rewriting the industry rule book by combining bargain fares with optional services and upgrades for which passengers pay extra.According to some delegates at the air show, the deals also suggest airlines are taking advantage of a recent slowdown in demand for new jets to negotiate competitive prices.SWAN SONGThe Franke deal marks a dramatic swan-song for Airbus sales chief Leahy, who is due to retire in the coming months after holding the job since 1994.The 67-year-old has overseen the sale of jets worth $1.7 trillion at list prices and helped engineer a rise in Airbus's market share to a par with Boeing from just 18 percent.This year, however, Airbus's share of the order tally had dropped to 35 percent prior to the Dubai show, as a rejuvenated Boeing management made advances in Singapore and elsewhere.Airbus management, meanwhile, is dealing with investigations by British, French and U.S. authorities after the company uncovered inaccuracies in sales documents.Airbus also aims to sell more of its A380 superjumbo, with main customer Emirates seeking guarantees on keeping production lines open. ""I think both sides will take stock and see if something can be agreed later this year,"" an industry source told Reuters.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It agreed to buy 75 737-8 MAX aircraft at the Dubai Airshow four years ago.""We try to grow as fast as we want,"" Chief Executive Ghaith al-Ghaith told reporters. Delivery of flydubai's 175 planes will begin in 2019 and be spread across 10 years with some overlap with the delivery of its 2013 order, al-Ghaith said.The current fleet of flydubai, which started flights in 2009, is all Boeing. It currently only operates 737-8s.The provisional deal is worth $27 billion, including purchasing options for an additional 50 planes.Al-Ghaith told Reuters the airline was interested in the new mid-sized jet that Boeing is studying whether to develop, but that it had not been discussed during the 737 negotiations.Boeing is looking at potentially filling a market gap between narrow and widebody jets with a new aircraft that could seat 220 to 270 passengers.Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister told the news conference that flydubai's 737 commitment would be good for jobs in the United States and in the Middle East.Gulf customers are keen to stress the importance of their orders for U.S. jobs as they are locked in a trade dispute with three major American carriers.Sheikh Ahmed said the airline had picked the 737s after also looking at Airbus' (PA:AIR) similar-sized A320s, echoing comments he made this week in his role as Emirates [EMIRA.UL] chairman when he said the 787 had been chosen over the Airbus A350.Dubai-based Emirates this week committed to buying 40 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.Emirates and flydubai are both owned by the government of Dubai, which has pushed the two airlines to work more closely.McAllister said the flydubai and Emirates deals were negotiated separately.Also on Wednesday, Airbus reached a preliminary deal for a record 430 of its A320neo-family jets from U.S. investor Bill Franke's Indigo Partners.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

472,"Nov 15, 2017 05:58AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, November 15:1. European and Asian stocks on longest losing streak in a yearAsian equities ended Wednesday in the red as concerns about U.S. tax reform continued to weigh on equities. Japan’s Topix closed lower for a fifth straight day, its longest bearish run since September 2016, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.6%, a sixth consecutive day of losses and its longest losing streak since May 2016.European bourses on Wednesday were on track for their longest losing streak in more than a year as buyer exhaustion began to weigh on stocks with traders taking protective positions ahead of fears of a correction. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was off around 0.8% by 5:54AM ET (10:54GMT), its seventh consecutive losses in what is its worst streak since October 2016.U.S. futures also pointed to a lower open on Wednesday although the Dow closed a day earlier in what was only its second day of losses. At 5:55AM ET (10:55GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures fell 132 points, or 0.56%, S&P 500 futures lost 14 points, or 0.55%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 33 points, or 0.53%.2. U.S. inflation and retail sales to set the moodThe Commerce Department will publish October inflation figures at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT) Wednesday. Market analysts expect consumer prices to rise 0.1%, while core inflation is forecast to inch up 0.2%.On a yearly base, core CPI is projected to climb 1.7%. Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates.At the same time Wednesday, the Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for October. The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales increased 0.1% last month. Core sales are forecast to gain 0.2%.Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.3. Dollar hits 3-week low with Fed hike fully priced inThe dollar fell to its lowest level in three weeks on Wednesday, pressured lower by a stronger euro and increased concerns that Republicans will not be able to push through a tax overhaul this year.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.27% to 93.47 by 5:56AM ET (10:56GMT), after hitting an intraday low of 93.36, matching its lowest level since October 26.Uncertainties over tax measures have hit the dollar in recent sessions, sending it down by more than 1% since last week.The recent weakness has occurred despite the fact that markets have fully priced in a rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its December meeting. The odds pass the 50% threshold for an additional increase next year in June, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.4. Oil slumps 1% as faith in market rebalancing wanesOil prices fell by around 1% on Wednesday, continuing Tuesday's slide after the International Energy Agency cast doubts over the past few months' narrative of tightening fuel markets, while investors kept a close eye on developments in the Middle East.U.S. crude oil futures slid 1.15% to $55.06 at 5:57AM ET (10:57GMT), while Brent oil traded down 1.17% to $61.48.Traders were also wary ahead of weekly supply data later in the day. The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended November 10 at 10:30AM ET (15:30GMT).After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 6.5 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of around 2.2 million barrels.5. Airbus lands record $50 billion orderAirbus (PA:AIR) landed a deal for a record 430 of its A320neo-family jets, worth around $50 billion on Wednesday as U.S. investor Bill Franke raised his bet on budget airlines in an order placed at the Dubai Airshow.U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) also obtained its own $27 billion order at the airshow from flydubai for 175 of it 737 Max jets, as well as purchasing options for 50 more aircraft.In other company news to watch,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) will report earnings ahead of the opening bell Wednesday while Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) will be up to bat after the market close."
473,"Nov 15, 2017 04:45AM ET",Weaker commodities drag European shares to eight-week low; Airbus rallies,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - A fall in commodity stocks and continued profit taking sent European shares to an eight-week low on Wednesday, but Airbus rallied after winning its biggest order.Crude oil's price slide on worries over the outlook for demand and weaker metal prices weighed on mining and energy stocks like  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa).Their falls helped send the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) down 0.6 percent to its lowest level since Sept. 20.The index was on track or its seventh session of straight losses, its longest losing streak since October 2016 when markets fell in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections. The UK's top share index FTSE 100 (FTSE) declined 0.4 percent and Germany's export oriented DAX (GDAXI) index fell 0.6 percent, weighed down by a stronger euro.Banks (SX7P) were also among the biggest losers, down 1 percent, but falls were spread across sectors as investors continued to take profits following this year's rally. The STOXX 600 is still up nearly 6 percent so far this year. Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists led by Sebastian Raedler expect the STOXX 600 to end the year at 395 points, 3 percent above current levels, before falling back to 375 in the first months of 2018.""We remain tactically neutral near-term, but expect a pull-back... We are underweight European cyclicals versus defensives - and expect European equities to continue underperforming US equities over the coming months,"" they said.Some investors have reduced their exposure to European equities to position themselves for a correction even though they do not expect the underlying positive trend to change, given continued strength in economic data.On the earnings front, data from Thomson Reuters IBES data show that 48 percent of companies listed on the euro zone MSCI EMU index have beaten analyst expectations while 40 percent have missed them. Earning beats stand at 53 percent for the broader MSCI Europe index and at 72 percent for the U.S.'s S&P 500.Germany's  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG) was among the biggest fallers on the STOXX on Wednesday, down 3.2 percent, after its earnings update did not provide any positive surprise.""Third quarter numbers are okay whereas the portfolio change and the execution of Lanxess’ strategy is going as planned,"" said Baader Bank Helvea analyst Markus Mayer in a note.The company also lifted the lower end of its earnings guidance range for 2017 after strong demand for speciality chemicals but UBS said the increase was not enough to allow upgrades to consensus estimates.On the positive side, Airbus (PA:AIR) rose 3.4 percent.Airline pioneer Bill Franke placed a historic order for 430 A320neo-family jets in a deal worth $49.5 billion at list prices that marks a dramatic turnaround for Airbus, which had been lagging behind Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the contest for orders. The deal is one of the industry's biggest deals by volume and the most planes sold by Airbus in one batch.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Bloomberg News earlier reported the potential contract involved 430 jets.The deal marks a dramatic turnaround for Airbus, which had been lagging behind Boeing in the contest for orders so far this year and had started the Nov 12-16 air show on a backfoot.With Boeing so far dominating the show, delegates said all eyes were on Airbus where sales chief John Leahy, a veteran of last-minute air show surprises, was plotting a blockbuster climax to a more-than-20-year stint as marketing boss.Leahy is due to retire in coming months after serving as sales chief for the European planemaker since 1994.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

475,"Nov 14, 2017 09:04AM ET",Emirates believes Airbus can bow to demands on A380 programme,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates [EMIRA.UL] believes Airbus can meet demands from the Dubai government to guarantee development of the A380 jet programme, as it challenges the planemaker to see who will blink first in talks over a new $16 billion superjumbo plane order.""I am sure that if we get closer to a further order, the Airbus board will make that undertaking,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters on Tuesday at the Dubai Airshow. An anticipated order for A380 superjumbos worth $16 billion failed to materialise at the last moment on Sunday, forcing state-owned Emirates and Airbus (PA:AIR) into further talks.Clark declined to speculate when a deal might be reached, but hinted on Monday it could be a matter of weeks or months.Airbus CEO Tom Enders left the air show on Monday, though sales chief John Leahy stayed locked in Dubai meetings.Delegates said the chances of a deal during the Nov 12-16 event had faded after the two sides failed to agree in time for Sunday's grand opening, but one did not exclude a last-minute patch-up that would bring Enders back for a signing.Airbus declined to comment.In the meantime, Clark stressed the Dubai government was serious about asking for guarantees that Airbus should keep the A380 in production for at least 10 years before Emirates placed a new order for the plane. The conditions were first set out in an interview with Reuters on Monday.""The ownership of the business, the government of Dubai, the shareholder, needs absolute, absolute certainty,"" he said.Asked why this had become so important, he said, ""because there has been a lot of talk"" about the future of the A380, the world's biggest passenger jet.Emirates will take the 42 A380s it has on order after taking delivery of 100, he told reporters. However, he was sceptical about proposed efficiency improvements known as ""A380plus"".NEW BOEING JET INTERESTSince late 2014, there has been on-off speculation over the A380's future as production twice had to be cut because of weak demand. Airbus is, however, lowering production costs in order to try to keep assembly running at reduced rates.Clark said the question of guarantees at the centre of the latest negotiations remained separate from the economic case for the aircraft itself, which continued to be the ""poster"" model for the Emirates network and a major profit-earner.The giant jet generates new demand wherever it is used and pours traffic into Emirates' Dubai hub from Europe, for example, to feed dozens of destinations to the east and south, he said.On new aircraft developments, Clark suggested that either Emirates or discount carrier flydubai, which is also owned by the Dubai government, could be interested in a mid-sized jet that Boeing (N:BA) is considering developing.""Whether it is in flydubai ... or in Emirates, with the carriers working far closer than they have been for a long time, would it fit? Yes, I think possibly in certain routes,"" Clark said.Designed to reduce drag by shaving cargo space in the belly while carrying 225-275 passengers, the proposed jet would not work on routes where Emirates carries significant cargo.But Clark said global aviation would welcome the new plane.""I can see a place for it in Europe. I can see a place in transcontinental USA and Asia,"" he said, adding it would suit markets with congested airports but relatively low freight traffic, where airlines may not be willing to bet on a traditional twin-aisle jet sitting more than 250 people.""Looking at it from an industry point of view, I think there is scope for that,"" he said.Clark, 67, an influential industry figure who was knighted by his native Britain in 2014, deflected questions about whether he planned to retire, saying ""I am still here"". He scoffed at a suggestion he might like to do anything as leisurely as golf.But he said his eventual succession at Emirates would be assured and that the airline had a strong executive team.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

478,"Nov 13, 2017 11:30AM ET",Airbus looks at more capacity for A350 with new layout,nan,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is working on increasing the capacity of its A350-900 aircraft as airlines look to reduce their operating costs per seat, industry executives said on Monday.The plans were presented to Emirates airline last week, they added, but did not sway the Dubai carrier in its eventual decision to buy Boeing's (N:BA) 787-10 at this week's Dubai Airshow.Billed as Europe's answer to the 787 Dreamliner, the A350-900 is designed for airlines that want long range.But for carriers prepared to settle for less range on certain busy routes, the recently introduced 787-10 carries more passengers and is therefore potentially more efficient per seat.The proposed A350 layout would help to close the seat gap, by moving the pressure bulkhead back by two and a half feet and changing the rest of the layout to leave more space for seats.Plane manufacturers have already been steadily adding more seats to their existing aircraft models by improving the way the cabins are set out, or by providing denser configurations.Airbus says the A350-900, which was originally marketed for 317 passengers, now holds 325 in standard layout.The Boeing 787-10 is a stretched version of the earlier 787-9 Dreamliner and was originally designed to carry 323 passengers. Boeing now says it carries 330 people.Airbus said it was constantly looking at improvements but declined to discuss details.""As with all programs, we are also studying new cabin improvements on the A350 as it offers a versatile and flexible platform,"" a spokeswoman said.""As a leading aircraft manufacturer we always consider future improvements in line with market and customer needs.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

479,"Nov 13, 2017 10:59AM ET",Dubai pressures Airbus as A380 order hopes fizzle,nan,"By Tim HepherDUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai wants a guarantee that Airbus (PA:AIR) will keep production of the A380 superjumbo open for at least 10 years before state-owned Emirates places a new order for the world's largest jetliner, the airline's president said on Monday.Speaking to Reuters at the Dubai Airshow, Tim Clark also said the largest Middle East carrier would probably stick with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 for its mid-sized fleet needs after ordering 40 of the jets on Sunday, and could order more in future.Airbus's hopes of a new order from top customer Emirates for the slow-selling A380 were thwarted on Sunday when the airline unveiled a surprise order for 40 Boeing 787-10 jets worth $15.1 billion at list prices, but no European contract.Delegates said Airbus may be willing to meet Dubai's conditions to steady A380 output, but hopes of an announcement during the rest of the Nov 12-16 air show all but evaporated on Monday as Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders left empty-handed.""We continue to have a dialogue with them,"" Clark said.""If that comes to some kind of fruition during the course of the week, or the next few months, is very much down to them.""Delegates said an air show order was not impossible but now looked unlikely.Airbus has been scaling back production plans for the A380, which was launched as the solution to ever-rising air travel between major international hubs but has been outflanked by improvements in the efficiency of smaller jets.With 100 A380s already in Emirates' fleet, Clark made plain the concerns about Airbus' commitment to the project were being felt as high as the Dubai government, which owns the airline.""I think the ownership here are concerned about continuation (of the A380). They need some copper-bottom guarantees that if we do buy some more, then the line will be continued for a minimum period of years and that they are fully aware of the consequences of cancellation and leaving us high and dry.""""Those assurances I am sure will come. Quite when, I don't quite know.""Asked what would be a reasonable commitment to unblock a deal, he said: ""A minimum 10 years. These are vast capital investments for us and we can't afford to have anything less than 10 years; hopefully it would be 15. But it is their call"".Airbus declined to comment.GUARANTEESEmirates is by far the biggest customer for the A380, which entered service in 2007 during the financial crisis and never generated as many sales from other carriers as Airbus had hoped.Emirates has ordered 142 of the jets, worth $436 million each at list prices, and last week took delivery of its 100th.Scrapping production would raise concerns about future support and the value of jets in Emirates' portfolio.Dubai's demand for industrial guarantees raises the stakes in negotiations and would be a matter for the Airbus board.""There has to be a fleshing out of the undertakings. My own view is that Airbus are ready to make those, but whether it is today or tomorrow or next week or in the next few months, I don't know,"" Clark said.Airbus has been driving down A380 costs in an effort to ensure the line can stay open and break even, even if Emirates remains the only significant buyer of new jets, something that would help it to give the carrier assurances over its future.Emirates' tough negotiating position also reflects growing concerns about management uncertainty at Airbus, whose veteran sales chief John Leahy is about to retire.""We know management is likely to be structured slightly differently. On the basis of that we wish to know that irrespective of what the management does, that once that commitment is made and signed for ... that they will honor it and nobody will change it,"" Clark said.Clark, who is also seen as approaching retirement, squashed suggestions that Emirates may still buy A350s as well as 787s.Asked whether Emirates' plans still left room for the A350, Clark said: ""No. I would say that once we have gone for the 787 we will stay with the 787, but I can never say never.""He also played down reports that Emirates, which had previously said it was seeking 50-70 twin-engined jets, had taken a more conservative tack by ordering only 40 787-10s.""Will it stop at 40? My own view? No, it will grow,"" he said, adding that Emirates may take some smaller 787-9s."
480,"Nov 12, 2017 10:51AM ET",Boeing takes head start in Dubai with Emirates Dreamliner order,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates unveiled a preliminary order worth $15 billion for 40 Boeing (N:BA) jets on Sunday, but kept Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) waiting for a lifeline order for A380 superjumbos as the Dubai Airshow opened amid worries over tensions in the Middle East.The largest Middle East carrier signed a draft deal for the largest version of Boeing's Dreamliner, the 787-10, watched by Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, credited for the launch of Emirates more than 30 years ago.Reuters earlier reported Boeing was close to clinching a deal for 787-10s, upstaging expectations of an early Airbus deal for the larger A380.Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said the carrier had chosen the latest version of Boeing's mid-sized wide-body jet after comparing it with the Airbus A350.Delegates said that comparison delivered a blow to Airbus which had been competing to win back Dubai's endorsement for its mid-sized A350 after Emirates canceled an order for 70 in 2014.Its problems did not end there as an anticipated order for A380 superjumbos worth $16 billion failed to materialize at the last moment, forcing it into further talks to finalize a deal.Airbus has been looking for a boost to the A380 superjumbo, which after a decade in service has seen sales decline in favor of smaller but highly efficient long-haul jets.Emirates had been expected to announce deals worth $30 billion shared between Airbus and Boeing, whose envoys unusually found themselves rubbing elbows while waiting for deals to pop.But in a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the $100 billion industry, some Airbus officials stepped into the packed room for a joint announcement, only to see Boeing take the honors.Top Airbus executives extended their stay as talks continued.""Emirates are still talking to Airbus about it. There are no promises,"" a Gulf source said.TRADE-INSA key to the deal could be the extent to which Airbus is prepared to buy back A380s due to leave the Emirates fleet.""A few trade-ins will be involved,"" a person familiar with the matter said.Day one of the show brought $17 billion of civil orders even as business confidence in the region wobbles, but business remained relatively modest compared to the show's peak in 2013.A rift emerged in the summer between Qatar and Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates.That dispute has kept Qatar Airways, which four years ago ordered planes jointly with Emirates, away from the show.Tensions deepened this month when Saudi Arabia, the region's biggest economy, detained dozens of top officials in an unprecedented, sweeping corruption crackdown.But Sheikh Ahmed said the Emirates 787 deal was proof that the region's hub aviation model was working.He highlighted the impact on jobs in the United States, where Gulf airlines are engaged in a dispute with domestic carriers who accuse them of using subsidies: a charge they deny.""This is a long-term commitment that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, not only at Boeing but throughout the aviation supply chain,"" Sheikh Ahmed said.""Our announcement today also speaks to our confidence in the future of aviation in the UAE and the region.""In a sign of confidence in demand from premium travelers, Emirates unveiled first-class suites developed in co-operation with luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz.Azerbaijan Airlines announced an order for five Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jets and two freighters.In exhibition halls, defense firms were bullish about their ability to bag contracts with the UAE and its Gulf Arab neighbors given rapidly escalating tensions with Iran.""We have good chances of closing more contracts with forces here,"" said Gabriel Ducroizet, sales manager with French firm Rafaut -- which produces racks connecting bombs to warplanes.The UAE announced a $1.6 billion deal with  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) to upgrade 80 F-16 jet fighters."

""A few trade-ins will be involved,"" a person familiar with the matter said.An Airbus spokesman said, ""We do not comment on our contractual agreements"".Asked at a news conference on the launch of a new first-class cabin whether Emirates would place an A380 order at the show, Emirates president Tim Clark said, ""maybe, maybe not"".The decision by Airbus to buy back aircraft to facilitate the anticipated deal comes as the aviation market struggles to absorb some of the first A380s, which entered service a decade ago.A German asset manager is trying to place four aircraft being returned by Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), which was the first to offer superjumbo services in 2007, financiers say. Industry sources say at least one of the ex-Singapore jets will be operated by Portugal-based HiFly. The company, which rents out aircraft on a 'wet lease' basis complete with crew, was not immediately available for comment.Placing the rest of the aircraft is no easy task as demand for the double-decker aircraft remains thin, aircraft financiers say.Airbus is seen as keen to support the second-hand market to avoid having to break up one of the planes, a potential public relations setback as it tries to breathe new life into the iconic European programme following recent production cuts.Securing the new order from Emirates, which is by far the largest customer for the A380, clears a major hurdle to extending production towards the middle of next decade.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Emirates and Airbus (PA:AIR) both declined to comment.The order is expected to be one of the highlights of the Nov. 12-16 event at which Gulf carriers - minus Qatar Airways which is absent due to a rift between Arab nations - are expected to put a brave face on fragile business confidence in the region.It comes as Airbus and Boeing chase deals to prop up recently softening demand for wide-body passenger jets.Emirates is by far the largest buyer of the world's largest passenger jet, the A380, with 142 on order and 100 already delivered.The 544-seat jet entered service amid huge fanfare in 2007, but its future has been thrown into doubt by sluggish sales as airlines turn to efficient smaller jets like the Boeing 777, of which Emirates is also the largest buyer.An A380 sale would bring respite to Airbus which has fallen well behind rival Boeing this year, with 35 percent of their combined new orders.Aerospace manufacturers were pitching for other deals on the eve of the show, one of the largest business gatherings in the Middle East.Boeing (N:BA) sought earlier to dispel concerns about a slowdown in the growth of Gulf airlines as the aerospace industry gathered on Saturday for the Dubai Airshow.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Pan-European purchasing agency OCCAR, which oversees Europe's largest defense project on behalf of the seven core buyer nations, could not be reached for comment.Airbus received a 3.5 billion euro bailout from the seven nations in 2010, but it has suggested the funds did not go far enough in limiting the company's financial exposure.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

State-run China Aviation Supplies, which leases planes to Chinese airlines, said the order was for 260 B-737s as well as 40 B777s and B787s. The breakdown between firm orders and non-binding commitments was not immediately available.Analysts said, however, that some of the orders may be among the more than 300 from undisclosed buyers posted this year and that it was not yet understood how much of the China deal would be entirely new business.Boeing had 334 orders by unidentified customers as of Oct. 24, of which 290 were for its 737 narrow body family. A spokesman for the planemaker declined to comment on what proportion of the China deals were new or existing orders.Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have been jostling for market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country.China's owned aircraft fleet is currently quite equally split between Boeing and Airbus, but going by orderbook trends, Boeing seems to have gained a big lead in terms of the number of aircraft orders from China, said Corrine Png, chief executive of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.China Aviation Supplies has also played a prominent role in deals announced during previous government exchanges. In July, it agreed to buy 140 aircraft from Airbus in a deal worth $23 billion at list prices during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Germany. In 2015, it was among three Chinese companies that agreed to buy 300 planes from Boeing during Xi's visit to the United States.. Boeing's latest signing in China follows an order for 39 wide-body jets from Singapore Airlines last month. Earlier on Thursday, aircraft engine marker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) said it had signed deals worth $3.5 billion in China, including an agreement with Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd (SS:603885) and ICBC Leasing, the leasing arm of state bank Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (SS:601398).Aircraft orders are often announced at list prices, but buyers usually get discounts.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Dirk Hoke, chief executive of Airbus Defense and Space, said the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet could be an option for further collaboration with Bombardier, although he did not specify further.""We will definitely also look at additional potential further cooperation with Bombardier beyond just the CSeries,"" Hoke told Reuters on the sidelines of an Ottawa aerospace conference, adding that he was ""very optimistic and positive about us entering this competition.""Airbus last month agreed to take a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jets program, bolstering the Canadian plane's sales and giving it a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and U.S. regulators. The CSeries trade dispute has muddied a potential interim military contract between Boeing and Canada for 18 Super Hornet fighter jets, creating new opportunities for rivals like Airbus, Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD) and  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT). Boeing and Canada had initially discussed purchasing the fighters as a stop-gap measure while the country prepared an open five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of 77 Boeing CF-18 fighter jets. Canada has halted talks with Boeing because of the dispute.Hoke said Airbus is not considering jumping into the interim bid for fighter jets and is waiting to see the specifics from the Canadian government on the open competition.""Right now, we have a very positive feeling about it but of course we have to see ... what (are) the specifications that have been finally defined and confirmed.""In 2016, Canada selected Airbus C295W aircraft for its fixed-wing search and rescue program, estimated at C$3 billion ($2.36 billion).Boeing has accused Bombardier of receiving illegal subsidies and dumping the CSeries at ""absurdly low"" prices in the U.S. market to win a key April 2016 order from Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL). The U.S. Commerce Department has notched up proposed trade duties on U.S. sales of CSeries jets at nearly 300 percent, in a case that will be decided next year at the International Trade Commission.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It has 65 percent so far this year of a market usually shared roughly equally with its European rival.The U.S. planemaker is expected to extend its lead with a significant order announcement from China on Thursday as President Donald Trump visits Beijing, coming on top of an order for 39 wide-body jets from Singapore Airlines last month.However, analysts said some of the orders may be among the more than 300 from undisclosed buyers posted this year, and that it was not yet understood how much of the anticipated China deal would be entirely new business.Boeing's orders also include 28 aircraft for its military division and 5 from collapsed Monarch Airlines, which a UK judge said on Wednesday was unlikely to fly again..After supplier problems, Airbus deliveries picked up in October when it handed over 63 planes including 22 A320neo-family aircraft recently hit by engine problems, and 8 A350s.That brings the total to 513 for the first 10 months. Airbus maintains an official target of 700 deliveries, but told analysts last week that its de facto target of 720 aircraft, given verbally to investors, was no longer achievable.Qatar Airways took delivery in October of three out of four aircraft it had previously canceled over supplier issues. The largest A350 customer has reduced its order to 76 aircraft but agreed to reshuffle upcoming delivery slots. This means Airbus will eventually get less revenue than originally planned from the sale of 80 jets to Qatar, but its cashflow will not take a hit as aircraft that have already been built will be delivered, preventing a build-up of inventory.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It will be a sizeable order,"" he said, declining to provide estimated numbers.Callegari said Aeroflot wanted to retain both Airbus and Boeing narrow bodies in its fleet because it used them in different seating configurations and did not want to be reliant on a single manufacturer.Aeroflot, which has an average fleet age of just 4.1 years, increased capacity across its premium and low-cost carriers by 16.2 percent in the nine months ended Sept. 30 and still filled a higher percentage of its seats than in the prior year. It expects the growth rate to slow slightly in the fourth quarter, with a full-year capacity forecast of 12-14 percent growth, Callegari said. Russian aviation market conditions were particularly challenging in 2015 and 2016, after sanctions by the United States and Europe, along with weak oil prices, hit the Russian economy and the rouble, killing consumer demand. Demand started to recover along with the economy and Aeroflot has benefited from its scale and the bankruptcies of Russian carriers Transaero in 2015 and VIM Airlines this year.""The market is proving us right and offering us the possibility of growing,"" Callegari said. ""Others don't seem to have such a successful approach.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.GECAS has a fleet of roughly 1,300 planes worth an estimated $25 billion, ranking behind only U.S.-listed AerCap Holdings NV (N:AER), which is estimated to have a $30 billion portfolio, according to data from industry consultancy Ascend Flightglobal. AerCap has a market value of $8.3 billion.Some 40 percent of the airline industry's aircraft is leased to avoid the fixed costs of owning planes.Both GECAS and AerCap trace their roots to the collapsed (Guinness Peat Aviation) (GPA) leasing empire of Irish leasing baron, Tony Ryan, over two decades ago.GE Capital bought $1.3 billion of prime GPA assets and struck a deal to manage most of the rest to form GECAS – coupling GPA's hardware with GE's balance sheet. The remaining core of old GPA was later acquired by AerCap, which is now the main competitor to GECAS.RISE OF ASIAN LESSORSConsolidation in the leasing sector has intensified in the last few years, as Asian competitors chip away at the market shares of GECAS and AerCap. GECAS has also been trimming its fleet in the last few years.""I believe that GECAS sees opportunity in the market to sell aircraft with leases attached to new emerging lessors which allows them to generate profit on these specific transactions whilst also managing their asset and customer concentration risk,"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend Flightglobal.Avolon Holdings, owned by China's shipping-and-airline giant HNA Group, has vaulted to become the world's third biggest lessor after acquiring U.S. rival CIT Group Inc's (N:CIT) plane leasing business this year.Bank of China-owned Bank of China Aviation Ltd (HK:2588) and subsidiaries of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398), China Development Bank and Bank of Communications (SS:601328) have emerged among the list of top 15 lessors after placing multi-billion dollar orders for Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) aircraft.In June, GECAS struck a partnership with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada's second largest pension fund, to create a new company focused on leasing high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft.

I'm not going to walk out the door after all these years at Airbus,"" Leahy said, speaking after Airbus delivered Emirates' 100th A380 jet.He said he had spoken with Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders on Thursday evening and that Enders was ""determined to make a decision within the next week or something"", with one leading internal and one leading external candidate in the race. Industry sources said the main internal contender is thought to be Christian Scherer, chief executive of turboprop maker ATR, which is co-owned by Airbus but lies outside the main perimeter of Europe's largest aerospace company.His appointment would bring relative stability but could irk ATR partner Leonardo (MI:LDOF) since Scherer has only been in the job for a year, coming on the heels of a premature decision by Airbus to recall his predecessor.Some on the board are calling for a complete outsider following turmoil over compliance investigations, and Airbus is also taking a close look at the recently overhauled management team at Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), industry sources said.Leahy was initially preparing to retire in September but said Enders had asked him to stay on until the end of the year, because a lot of things were happening, such as the deal to take a majority stake in the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries programme. Leahy added he expected the new manager to be on board by the end of the year, so that he could hand over in January or February. Commercial revenues drive three-quarters of the Airbus business, which also includes satellites, helicopters and a stake in the Eurofighter combat jet.The board will have the final say on the sensitive decision over who succeeds Leahy, who has been in the post for 23 years.Whoever succeeds him must help steer Airbus out of its current crisis and fill a vacuum left by Leahy and the U-turn over the appointment of Rao: heavyweights able to run ""game-changing"" campaigns in a sales war with Boeing (NYSE:BA), insiders said.Boeing has been winning back market share from Airbus under recently appointed Ihssane Mounir, inflicting a rare defeat on the European company at this year's Paris Airshow in June.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He has stood in for Leahy since July as the New Yorker prepared to retire, initially in September.The search for a new successor extends outside the core part of Airbus but will include affiliates such as 50-percent owned turboprop maker ATR, where CEO and former Airbus commercial strategy chief Christian Scherer is seen as a leading contender.ATR said Scherer was not available for comment.BROKEN MORALESeveral outside candidates are being considered and Airbus could go head-hunting at suppliers, such as the recently overhauled management team at Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR).Planeview Partners founder Henri Courpron has been widely mentioned but the former Airbus executive is said to have no plans to leave his U.S.-based consulting firm after helping negotiate a recent deal for Airbus to buy Bombardier's troubled CSeries jet programme. Courpron couldn't be reached for comment.The handover is happening as Enders comes under mounting French pressure over the conduct of a compliance campaign, which widened this week to flawed paperwork in the United States.While German-born Enders has bet his future on overhauling the company, insiders worry the crackdown will stymie risk-taking and swing the pendulum too far towards bureaucracy just as a resurgent Boeing (N:BA) is aggressively winning orders. Enders' own future is increasingly questioned, a source of uncertainty that sources say may put off some contenders.He has called for modernisation and fresh blood, but the change of policy on the key sales post underscores how the company's ability to set its own direction has come under mounting pressure as investigations ripple through the group.Whoever replaces Leahy will face the job of repairing poor morale and absorbing the CSeries without upsetting demand for bread-and-butter larger jets offered by Airbus and Boeing.But his replacement is unlikely to enjoy the same latitude as Leahy in negotiations or influence over industrial moves.Airbus's market share against Boeing has fallen to 35 percent so far this year - a gap likely to widen as U.S. President Donald Trump visits China with Boeing sales in view - but it aims to bounce back with at least one major deal in coming months. It may announce orders for the struggling A380 at this month's Dubai Airshow.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Engine delays, which reduced CSeries deliveries from 30 to an expected 20 to 22 this year, are a ""short-term issue"" that supplier Pratt & Whitney is ""actively addressing,"" Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts. Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), said in October it was resolving issues with the geared turbofan (GTF) engines that power the CSeries and Airbus A320neo to make them more durable.Bombardier said the delays would raise its free cash flow usage for 2017 to about $1 billion, at the higher end of its forecast range.Shares were up 4.7 percent in morning trading to C$2.92.The Canadian plane-and-train-maker also said it received a letter of intent from an unnamed European customer for 31 firm CSeries orders.European planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR) recently agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1, in a deal expected to improve CSeries sales and reduce costs.Bellemare told analysts the Airbus venture, while boosting ""sales momentum"" for the CSeries, isn't directly ""linked"" to the order which the company was already working on and would be valued at about $2.4 billion based on list prices, with an additional 30 options.Some analysts were anticipating orders because of increased confidence in the CSeries from the Airbus deal, which closes in 2018. A European customer won't face potential duties stemming from a trade dispute with  Boeing Co . (N:BA)""We'll have to see who the new airline is, but it certainly sounds promising, particularly since it isn’t subject to the US duty,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.Bellemare said the company was weighing strategies like forming partnerships to boost volumes of its smaller aerostructures division, which makes components for planes like the CSeries.Bombardier reported third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and special items (EBIT) that surged 90 percent to $165 million and a loss in line with analysts' expectations. It expects full-year EBIT of at least $630 million, which is at the high end of its forecast of $580 million to $630 million. Bombardier, which is in the middle of a five-year turnaround plan after facing a cash crunch in 2015, delivered 31 business jets in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 36 in the same period last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This is about defense equipment and services related to it,"" he told reporters.Airbus has been badly shaken by the existing corruption probes, which have already clipped aircraft sales.Wilhelm declined to say whether the latest disclosure could lead to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has so far stayed out of the European bribery probes.The unexpected disclosure overshadowed third-quarter earnings which showed a sightly narrower-than-expected four percent decline on lower aircraft deliveries.Airbus, the world's second largest planemaker after Boeing (N:BA), posted quarterly core operating earnings of 697 million euros ($811 million) as revenues rose 2 percent. It took a further small charge for the troubled A400M military program and warned of further changes later in the year.Airbus reaffirmed its 2017 guidance but acknowledged it would miss an informal goal of 720 jet deliveries that was higher than the official target of 700. Airbus has given different written and verbal delivery targets for several quarters in a row.The shortfall is chiefly the result of engine delays for the A320neo. Airbus now expects to deliver fewer than 200 of the aircraft this year, compared with a target of ""around 200"".Markets had expected a weak quarter due to delays in commercial aircraft and a build-up of inventory.Analysts on average expected third-quarter adjusted operating profit down 5.6 percent at 690 million euros on revenues up 1.8 percent at 14.2 billion, according to a Reuters survey.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

503,"Oct 29, 2017 08:10PM ET",Flood of Chinese capital seen shaking up aviation finance,nan,"By Anshuman Daga and Tim HepherHONG KONG/PARIS (Reuters) - A flood of low-cost Chinese funding is shaking up the global aircraft leasing market, with Chinese capital now accounting for 28 percent of the $261 billion deployed by leasing firms worldwide, a study suggested on Monday.That is up from 5 percent nine years ago.The influx of more than $70 billion to the leasing industry from Chinese banks and other investors over the past decade is helping airlines expand their fleets. But it is also curbing returns to be made by traditional players in a sector fast emerging as a significant new asset class.""In the last cycle (2003-2008), lease rates went up significantly whereas in this cycle they haven't. That's partly because there are more people looking for the same deals,"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Flightglobal Ascend.Record interest from China, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, will be evident in meetings of 1,500 financiers in Hong Kong at two major conferences this week.For years, some experts have warned that record production by Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) and over-ordering by some airlines would burst a demand 'bubble' for jetliners.But Morris sees a greater long-term threat from the supply side as new investors pour money into aviation. He predicts much of that capital is in the industry to stay, pressuring rivals.In a study coinciding with the Airline Economics conference, Flightglobal Ascend said Chinese capital will account for over a third of the aircraft leasing industry within five years. Many such investors are willing to accept lower returns and that is a warning sign for other players, Morris said.""If this money is resetting the rules, you have to learn to play by the new rules or you lose the game.""Some market veterans disagree, saying new money will retreat as quickly as it arrived when the market turns lower, making it hard for inexperienced players to redeploy unwanted jets.So far signs are that the market is holding up, although there has been turbulence in the market for some long-haul jets.Recent bankruptcies of Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines in Europe angered passengers but the aircraft were absorbed relatively quickly due to high demand, bankers say.Another key test will be expected interest rate rises and a rollback in stimulus from central banks who have pumped money into the economy, a chunk of which found its way into aviation.Historically, aircraft investors sought double-digit returns and many now have to settle for mid-to-high single figures, Morris told Reuters. ""Those figures may be acceptable in a low-interest-rate environment, but as interest rates start to increase can people start to increase their returns? That may not be possible"".The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again in December.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

504,"Oct 27, 2017 03:11PM ET","After CSeries deal, Bombardier aero unit faces uncertain future",nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) secured the future of its struggling CSeries jet but still needs to find ways to spur growth in other units that have aging products or face larger rivals, industry players and analysts said. A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE (PA:AIR) that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier's commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines. Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and now faces off against China's merged rail company CRRC Corp (SS:601766) and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom. Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales. While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier's small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are ""mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,"" according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray. Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions. Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody's this week downgrading Bombardier partly on ""longer-term concerns"" about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its ""future in the commercial aircraft space."" Bombardier said Moody's action was ""ill-founded.""Bombardier's CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, ""Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft."" ""I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,"" U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. ""But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.""Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA (MI:LDOF). Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said. Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there. ""I'm sure they'd love to sell the Q400 if they could get a serious buyer,"" said an industry source specializing in the prop market.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Morgan aerospace analysts said in a note after the results.""The stock has performed well into the print, however, and so it is not clear that modestly higher guidance will drive much outperformance today.""Boeing has streamlined production, shed 8,200 jobs and wound down development costs this year to dramatically improve profit and cash flow, as it competes with European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) amid burgeoning demand from airlines for more capable planes at lower prices.Core operating margin rose to 9.8 percent in the third quarter, from 9.2 percent a year earlier, and the company raised its forecast for operating cash flow for the full year to $12.5 billion from a previous $12.25 billion.Boeing said it now expects 2017 core earnings per share of $9.90-$10.10, compared with its previous forecast of $9.80-$10.00, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.A year ago Boeing included a tax gain of 98 cents per share in the third quarter, driving a dip in core earnings for the same period this year to $2.72 per share from $3.51 per share.Core earnings for the quarter still beat the average analyst estimate of $2.66 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while revenue rose 1.7 percent to $24.31 billion, beating the estimate of $23.92 billion.The company is moving into the production phase on the KC-46 and says it has identified most of the issues that need to be addressed ahead of the delivery of the first 18 tankers in 2018. Muddying the waters on the results was Boeing's new services business, which the company broke out for the first time in the third quarter.The unit, launched in July, is aimed at offering maintenance, technical and analytical support to customers, as the company looks to capture more of the higher-margin services spare-parts revenue after a plane is sold.The company hopes it will generate $50 billion a year in revenue within the next five to 10 years. It yielded $3.57 billion in the third quarter and an operating margin of 14.2 percent, down 0.7 percentage points compared with a year earlier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He did not provide names of specific suppliers. Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490), which was to take delivery of its first Bombardier CSeries in the coming weeks, has had the order of five jets delayed.""The detailed schedules to introduce the models have not been decided,"" said a spokeswoman for Korean Air Lines in Seoul who declined to give a reason for the delay. ""We are in continued talks with the manufacturer."" Two sources familiar with the matter said Pratt & Whitney was delayed in producing a corrected engine liner required for the Korean deliveries.In April, Bombardier said Pratt would issue the liners for the engines in Korean's order for delivery this past summer. At the time, Bombardier instructed CSeries operators Swiss International Air Lines and airBaltic to inspect their engine combustion liners after 2,000 flight hours. Pratt & Whitney said it had added a combustor lining inspection to its regularly scheduled maintenance of the engine.A Pratt spokesman referred questions about Korean's deliveries and the engine liners to the carrier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

512,"Oct 23, 2017 01:40PM ET",Tensions ease over Pratt engine supplies to Airbus: sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is more confident in the ability of Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to speed up delayed engine shipments, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday, in a sign that supply-chain gridlock affecting European aircraft deliveries may soon reach its peak.Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in July that Pratt & Whitney's performance was ""unsatisfactory"" but a person familiar with the situation said on Monday the company had seen evidence the engine maker was overcoming its technical difficulties.""The level of confidence is improving,"" a person close to Airbus said.Airbus declined comment ahead of Oct. 31 earnings.Its shares closed up 0.8 percent.Pratt & Whitney declined comment.Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine is one of two types of powerplant offered on the A320neo and its fuel-saving performance is tied to the sale of more than 5,000 Airbus jets. A trio of technical problems has left over two dozen semi-completed jetliners parked without engines in Toulouse, driving Airbus profits down sharply at mid-year. Pratt & Whitney has fixed two of the problems - concerning fan blades and an oil seal - and may report progress on a third one related to the combustion chamber on Tuesday when its parent reports quarterly earnings, industry sources said. Airbus planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier said last week he expected engines with redesigned parts and a full service life to be delivered from end-year. He said Airbus's 2017 target of 200 A320neo deliveries was reachable but tough. Any breakthrough would not come in time to help Airbus's third-quarter earnings, however. Total Airbus deliveries fell 1.7 percent in the first nine months but those of single-aisle aircraft like the A320neo, which generate most Airbus profit and cash, fell 7.9 percent. ""We expect a weak third-quarter update with slow progress on the A320neo the key driver,"" Berenberg analysts said. Pratt & Whitney has repeatedly reaffirmed its target to build 350-400 engines this year. But within that total, more engines than expected have been diverted from airplane production to a pool of spares for airlines needing to swap engines for premature checks. The problem has been especially severe in India. Airlines can also choose engines from CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF). Airbus can alter the mix of aircraft powered by each type of engine on its production line, but needs four months' notice to decide which engines go on which airframe, meaning it has been left with aircraft for Pratt & Whitney customers but no engines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

513,"Oct 22, 2017 08:53AM ET",Airbus turmoil overshadows bid to rescue CSeries,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus's (PA:AIR) coup in buying a $6 billion Canadian jetliner project for a dollar stunned investors and took the spotlight off a growing ethics row last week, but internal disarray has raised questions over how smoothly it can implement the deal.The European planemaker secured the deal for Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) CSeries program by pledging to throw its marketing might behind the loss-making jets, just as the Airbus sales machine reels from falling sales and internal and external corruption investigations.Chief Executive Tom Enders has urged staff to keep calm in the face of French reports describing payments to intermediaries and growing concern over fallout from the investigations.But the mood at the group's Toulouse offices remains grim.""Bombardier asked for an ambulance and Airbus sent a hearse,"" said one person with close ties to the company.French media attention on the growing scandal helped to camouflage talks to buy the CSeries. Rumors circulated in late August that Enders and a colleague were visiting Paris to meet investigators. In fact, they were holding the first of several secret dinner meetings with Bombardier.But the same affair, which first came to light in 2016, has begun to cloud sales momentum. In the first nine months of the year Airbus accounted for only 35 percent of global jet sales in its head-to-head battle with U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA).The Airbus sales operation is demoralized and in disarray, multiple aerospace and airline industry sources said, with some blaming Enders for turning the company against itself.Two people said the situation is so tense that some employees have begun to shy away from selling in problematic countries, rather than risk being drawn into the investigation.Soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy has been asked to stay until the end of the year to help steady the operation, but his successor has not been officially confirmed, adding a sense of vacuum that has also sapped morale.Leahy designated his deputy Kiran Rao as his successor earlier this year but the chaos engulfing Airbus means now is not considered the right time for major new announcements.POST-BOOM SLOWDOWNA spokesman for Airbus, which has long predicted a slower year after an order boom, dismissed reports of instability.""We have a great sales team ... but it is fully understood that they cannot repeat records every year; and the year is not over,"" he said.Enders has strongly defended his decision in 2016 to report flawed paperwork to UK authorities, which prompted UK and French investigations focusing on a system of sales agents run by a separate Paris department that has since been disbanded.Airbus says no evidence of corruption has been uncovered, but Enders has pledged to continue the overhaul of sales practices historically shared between Toulouse and Paris.A source close to Bombardier acknowledged disruption at Airbus but predicted things would settle down by the time the deal for Airbus to sell the CSeries closes next year.At that point Airbus will face a second challenge in marketing the CSeries, which for years it dismissed as a weak upstart. Now it must offer the aircraft side by side with the older A320.Airbus plans to refresh the A320 further after adding new engines and this will bring it closer to the smaller CSeries in performance, two people close to the plans said. It may also make some CSeries features more compatible with its own A320s.That comes on top of plans to enhance the larger A321neo in response to Boeing's launch of a new mid-market plane, which industry sources expect to happen next year.(Story refiles to add dropped word ""Airbus"" in fourth paragraph.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

514,"Oct 20, 2017 02:22PM ET",Airbus sees CSeries jets grabbing major global market share: CEO,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus SE (PA:AIR) expects to sell ""thousands"" of Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) new CSeries aircraft, capturing half the global market for smaller single-aisle commercial jets, Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Friday.Speaking at a business event in Montreal, he also said the lightweight, carbon-composite jets, which seat 110-to-130 people, would create new jobs in Canada and the United States.Europe's largest planemaker on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1, a move expected to reduce costs while bolstering the plane's sales and giving Canada's Bombardier a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and U.S. regulators.""I see no reason why we should not be able to capture 50 percent of that market,"" Enders said. ""I think we will sell thousands.""The jets, which cost $6 billion to develop, have won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months. On Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the Airbus deal boosted confidence in the CSeries program, but was unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales. The leasing executive said potential customers were likely to remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.The CSeries faces a potentially crippling 300 percent duty on sales to U.S. customers due to a complaint from Boeing that the plane was unfairly subsidized and sold below cost in a 2016 deal with Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL).The case will be decided by U.S. trade officials early next year, but Airbus has said any CSeries jets intended for the U.S. market would be built at its production facility in Alabama, potentially allowing the planes to avoid punitive duties.Enders said the deal between Bombardier and Airbus should be supported by the U.S. government because it would create more American jobs.""That's what President (Donald) Trump wants. How can he be against it?"" Enders said. Some analysts have suggested that Airbus's 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries could reverberate throughout the aerospace industry, triggering a competitive response from other planemakers, including Boeing itself.Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.Brazil’s Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and Canada’s Bombardier compete in the market between 100 and 150 seats as well as in the market for smaller regional jets.Enders, who addressed Montreal's business leaders with Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare, said the CSeries deal could foster other new partnerships but did not elaborate.""New alliances will be formed,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

516,"Oct 20, 2017 03:05AM ET",Singapore Airlines to finalize $13.8 billion Boeing order next week,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said on Friday it will finalize an order for 39  Boeing Co  (N:BA) aircraft worth $13.8 billion at list prices when Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visits Washington D.C. next week.The airline said in February it would order 20 777-9 and 19 787-10 widebodies as part of plans to modernize its fleet over the next decade, but the deal is yet to be finalised and placed in Boeing's order book as a Singapore Airlines order.The deal was viewed as a major blow to Airbus SE (PA:AIR) as it battles against Boeing in the widebody market. Airbus has lagged Boeing in net orders in the first nine months of the year, with 271 at the end of September versus 498 for its U.S. rival. Lee told CNBC television on Thursday that he hoped an agreement would be signed with Boeing to buy more aircraft for Singapore Airlines during his U.S. visit from Oct. 22 to 26.More details about the order would be revealed after the signing ceremony in Washington, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said.The airline in February said it had also acquired options to order six more aircraft of each type.Boeing in June booked orders for 20 777Xs and 19 787-10 aircraft for an unidentified customer or customers, making it possible the Singapore Airlines aircraft are already counted in this year's net orders. Boeing declined to comment.Singapore Airlines is investing in modern, fuel efficient aircraft while at the same time undertaking a strategic review designed to help cut costs amid growing competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals.While the Boeing order is worth $13.8 billion at list prices, airlines typically get discounts on jet orders. Jefferies in February estimated the deal's value at closer to $6.5 billion, or about a tenth of the U.S. plane maker's annual volume.Singapore Airlines is the launch customer for the 787-10, a stretch version of the Dreamliner, having made 30 firm orders in addition to the 19 announced in February. Boeing completed final assembly of the airline's first 787-10 earlier this month ahead of delivery in the first half of 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

517,"Oct 19, 2017 05:00PM ET",Airbus CSeries deal unlikely to spur quick boost in sales: Air Lease CEO,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus SE's deal with Bombardier (TO:BBDb) boosts confidence in the CSeries jet program but may not spur many new sales until it is finalized and a U.S. trade dispute is resolved, the head of a major aircraft leasing firm said on Thursday.Airbus (PA:AIR) on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program, securing the plane's future and giving the Canadian firm a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (N:BA) and U.S. regulators.The lightweight, carbon-composite jet, which cost $6 billion to develop, has won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months. ""People are feeling better about the CSeries but it's all on the expectation that Airbus concludes the transaction,"" said John Plueger, the chief executive officer of  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL).The deal is subject to Canadian government approval.Bombardier is counting on the agreement to help trim costs and boost CSeries sales. Its strategy to remove the ""cloud"" of uncertainty that has weighed on CSeries orders, is dependent in part on making jets for American customers like Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) at Airbus's Alabama production facility, instead of in Canada where Bombardier is based. That could avoid potentially punitive duties stemming from its dispute with Boeing over alleged unfair trade practices.""That cloud is still there until the transaction concludes.(but) that cloud is perhaps not as dark or as ominous,"" Plueger said.He declined to say whether Air Lease Corp, which has total assets of $15 billion, would now consider buying the CSeries. But he noted that leasing companies would likely hold off until the CSeries had enough orders to ensure strong resale value for the plane. ""Part of the life and blood measurement of any airplane is how deep is the operator base,"" Plueger said in a phone interview from New York.Plueger also said the deal with Airbus may drive Boeing to take another look at the 100 to 149 seat space and at least contemplate an alliance with an existing planemaker, to ratchet up competition. Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) which competes with Bombardier in the smaller regional jets market, is one strong possibility, he said.""The question is does Boeing rethink Embraer?"" Plueger asked. ""It will depend upon their assessment of how much additional market presence this brings to Airbus.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

518,"Oct 19, 2017 05:33AM ET",Airbus A330neo takes off on maiden flight,nan,"By Tim HepherTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Thursday began the maiden flight of its A330neo jetliner, an upgraded version of its profitable A330 line designed to sharpen competition with the latest version of Boeing's (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner.The wide-bodied, long-distance jet took off from the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters under overcast skies, watched by top executives from Airbus and Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), which supplies the engines.In service since the 1990s, the A330 family is Airbus's biggest-selling wide-body jet but the arrival of Boeing's composite-body Dreamliner has eroded that advantage.Airbus hopes the A330neo's refreshed design will help it defend its position in the lucrative 250-300 seat market. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus had decided to improve the plane's maximum take-off weight by around 4 percent to 251 tonnes so the A330neo can serve longer routes such as Kuala Lumpur to London.Separately, Bregier said the company still expected to deliver around 200 A320neo aircraft in 2017, but added that reaching the target would be tough in the wake of delayed engine deliveries.Bregier said Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), whose industrial problems have delayed deliveries of jets at Airbus plants, was testing re-designed parts for its engines and expected to start delivering the modified version at the end of this year.The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney’s new Geared Turbofan engine. CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), is also supplying engines for the A320neo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Where alternative suppliers are available, it is recommended to suspend use of Kobe Steel products until the legitimacy of the affected parts can be determined,"" EASA said in a Safety Information Bulletin (SIB) dated Oct. 17.EASA said the concern was not serious enough at this stage to warrant any compulsory measures.A Kobe Steel spokesman declined to comment on the EASA statement. SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNSThe admissions that Kobe Steel's supply chains have been tainted, affecting about 500 companies across the world, has sent its shares into freefall. The tampering went back more than 10 years, a source told Reuters earlier this week.The scandal puts another stain on Japan's manufacturing prowess after similar cases including automakers Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).""All organizations that may have specified or used Kobe Steel products should do a thorough review of their supply chains in order to identify if, and when, Kobe Steel products have been used in their product designs and fabrications,"" the SIB said.Because the period of the data tampering has not been ascertained, the focus should be on ""current production,"" the agency said.The world's two largest planemakers, Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), have already said they are conducting a review.Kobe Steel will hold a first round of bidding on Friday in the sale of a real estate unit, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.The company has hired Mizuho Securities, the brokerage arm of Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411), as an advisor for the sale of more than two-thirds of Shinko Real Esate, Bloomberg said, citing unidentified sources.The Nikkei newspaper reported last week the sale may raise about 50 billion yen ($444 million).Kobe Steel and Mizuho Securities declined to comment.Mitsubishi Motor also said on Wednesday it is investigating how components from suppliers containing Kobe Steel parts have been affected by the data tampering.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

522,"Oct 16, 2017 10:27AM ET","Fake paperwork, poor parts challenge China's aerospace boom",nan,"By Brenda GohSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese suppliers to U.S. flight control systems maker Moog (N:MOGa) sold it poorly made parts, faked paperwork and outsourced work to a factory not approved by the company, according to an internal report by U.S. aviation regulators.In a 9-page report dated Nov. 4, 2016 obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) said 273 affected parts were installed in an unspecified number of Boeing 777 wing spoilers, which help slow a plane when coming in to land.It did not identify the parts or say when they were installed. The FAA, Boeing (N:BA) and Moog said in the report and in emails to Reuters they posed no safety risk.Moog supplies flight control systems for commercial and military planes - an industry where supply chain traceability and material quality are highly regulated and crucial for flight safety.The episode does not raise immediate safety issues. However, it highlights the pressure on Chinese suppliers and regulators as the world's fastest growing aviation sector seeks to be less reliant on foreign manufacturers.To be sure, it's not just a Chinese issue. Shares in Japan's Kobe Steel (T:5406), a supplier of aluminum and copper products used in aircraft and cars, plunged last week after it found numerous cases of data falsification, sending customers scrambling to check product safety. Supply firms have flocked to China's booming aerospace sector, which is looking to supply parts faster and cheaper in a competitive global market. China's exports of parts to the U.S. aerospace industry have trebled to $1.2 billion since 2009, U.S. trade data show.The demand has fueled the rise of smaller makers of airplane parts in an industry that has been dominated by state-owned firms.China's aerospace industry isn't just a supplier to foreign plane makers. Its airlines are among the biggest buyers of Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) planes, but China is now building its own passenger jets, flying its first narrow-body C919 plane in May.Mao Pingzhou, a program and quality manager at Airbus, who previously worked at Moog, says China still needs to improve the management of its supply chain.""There are a lot of procedures, but supervisors and workers don't strictly implement them,"" he told Reuters. In an emailed response to Reuters, the FAA said it investigated safety concerns raised by a whistleblower, Charles Shi, and substantiated two of his allegations. One was addressed and closed, and the other ""remains open until the corrective action is fully implemented by Boeing and verified by the FAA."" It did not elaborate.Boeing said it and Moog ""had already assessed these two issues and taken all necessary corrective actions."" It stressed that ""the safety of the flying public is our primary concern.""Moog said it ""promptly and properly investigated"" the irregularities. ""The suspect parts - none of which are flight safety critical - were determined to meet specifications,"" it said.According to the FAA report, more than 720 hours of stress-testing the parts at Moog showed no failures, and it was agreed with Boeing to leave them on the planes.WHISTLEBLOWERThe FAA began investigating Moog parts in March 2016 after Shi, a former Moog supply chain manager for Far East Asia, contacted its whistleblower hotline, according to Shi and copies of emails between him and the regulator. Shi had previously raised concerns at Moog about Suzhou New Hongji Precision Parts Co Ltd (NHJ), a supplier he said had faked certificates, outsourced work and used substitute material without Moog's knowledge, according to copies of emails between Shi and his colleagues seen by Reuters.Reuters was unable to independently verify Shi's claims.Prompted by Shi's concerns, Moog's Shanghai-based supplier quality engineering (SQE) team carried out an internal probe into NHJ in August-September 2015, and found NHJ tried to fake a certificate for parts supplied to Moog, and outsourced manufacturing to a second-tier supplier, without telling Moog, internal emails show.It was not clear from the company emails which parts the certificate was for. Reuters could not determine why NHJ would do this.""This is desperately frustrating and really means that one of the target growth suppliers in China cannot be trusted,"" an SQE manager wrote in an Aug. 25 email.In its report, the FAA concluded that NHJ outsourced parts to an unapproved supplier, and a subcontractor fabricated production records and did not follow required manufacturing processes. The FAA did not concur with Shi's allegations that NHJ used unapproved substitute material to make parts for Moog.The FAA report also said the subcontractor, Nantong Shenhai Industrial Technology, which was responsible for coating parts with cadmium, baked parts for half the time it should have, and fabricated a production record.NHJ general manager Li Jian denied the company committed the violations detailed in Moog's internal emails or the FAA report.""They never mentioned these things to us during the check,"" Li told Reuters. ""Moog should have used official means to notify us, but we've not received any notification from Moog or the FAA.""Moog says it doesn't comment on its communications with suppliers. The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.Cheng Daoguang, executive director at Nantong Shenhai, told Reuters: ""Shenhai did not fabricate production process records and did not receive any visits or audits from the FAA."" He said the company processed parts for NHJ between February-June 2015.Cheng said neither NHJ nor Moog gave clear instructions on which standards to follow, and Shenhai only learned it should have baked parts for longer during a subsequent visit by Shi in August 2015.NHJ's Li declined to comment on the issues at Shenhai.COMPLAINTShi said he approached the FAA after he was laid off by Moog. The company says Shi's employment was ended as part of a ""previously communicated global reorganization"", and was not related to him raising issues about the supplier's quality.""Mr. Shi did not expose anything that others within Moog's supply chain organization were not or had not already responded to as part of the normal supply chain management process,"" it said.Shi says he has filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration against his dismissal by Moog on the grounds he was a whistleblower. A U.S. judge turned that down last month, saying he lacked jurisdiction. Shi says he is appealing that ruling.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

524,"Oct 16, 2017 03:50AM ET",Cheaper rivals target Singapore's aviation maintenance sector,nan,"By Cindy Silviana and Chayut SetboonsarngJAKARTA/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Singapore, the dominant hub for aircraft maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) in southeast Asia, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, is under threat from low-cost rivals in nearby Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.As the cheaper challengers look to muscle in on a lucrative market - with annual output of S$8.9 billion ($6.57 billion), Singapore accounts for a quarter of all Asia's MRO business - Singapore-based MRO firms are having to scramble higher up the value chain.With government backing, the maintenance arms of national carriers Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA), Thai Airways International (BK:THAI) and Malaysia Airlines are looking to follow the example of Singapore Airlines' (SI:SIAL) SIA Engineering Co (SI:SIAE) and boost revenues from providing services to rival carriers.""This is a real threat for the Singapore-based MRO companies,"" said Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective. ""The lower end and more labor-intensive heavy maintenance work for the more common aircraft models will face more competition from these locations given their much lower labor costs.""SETTING UP NEXT DOORShares in Garuda Maintenance Facility AeroAsia Tbk (GMF AeroAsia) (JK:GMFI) began trading last Wednesday after the company raised $95 million from an IPO. The shares fell 9 percent in the first three days of trading, though Png noted liquidity was hampered by Garuda selling only 10 percent to the public.The maintenance offshoot of Indonesia's national carrier wants to raise another $200 million by selling a 20 percent stake to a potential strategic partner - to help it expand existing operations and build a new maintenance facility on Batam Island - just 31 km (19 miles) off Singapore's coast. GMF AeroAsia has a longstanding partnership with Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance, which said last month it signed a letter of intent with GMF AeroAsia to ""move up"" that partnership. It declined to say whether it planned to buy a stake.GMF AeroAsia CEO Iwan Joeniarto told Reuters the company aims to be a global top-10 MRO provider by revenue from 2021 - it currently ranks 13th - citing a strategic location and manpower costs a fifth lower than Singapore as its competitive advantages.He said revenue from the Garuda Group currently makes up close to two-thirds of GMF's total, and he wants to switch that to 40 percent, with the rest coming in from new customers.The $50 million Batam facility, targeted to open in 2019, will seek U.S. and European regulatory certifications that would give it a broader customer base, Joeniarto said.In Thailand, the government wants to turn U-Tapao airport near Pattaya into a maintenance hub with help from investors including Airbus (PA:AIR), which signed a memorandum of understanding with Thai Airways in March to develop a major MRO facility.Kanit Sangsubhan, Secretary-General of Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor Office, said he expected a formal joint venture agreement would be signed in the first quarter of next year. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the timing.Thai Maintenance, the MRO arm of Thai Airways, does 70 percent of its work for the national carrier, but that could drop to 50 percent over time as it attracts outside customers, Kanit said.""There are plans to eventually spin off Thai Maintenance as its own company,"" he added.Malaysia Airlines, which this month gained European approvals to perform major modifications and repairs in avionics, aircraft structure and cabin interiors, intends to take on more third-party contracts over the next 18 months, CEO Peter Bellew said.Last week, Airbus bought the 60 percent of Malaysia's Sepang Aircraft Engineering it didn't already own for an undisclosed price. The Kuala Lumpur-based facility, which has opened a second hangar that can handle two A320s at a time, serves several southeast Asian airlines including Singapore-based low-cost carriers Scoot and Jetstar Asia.SINGAPORE MOVES HIGHERSIA Engineering, which now earns only a third of its business from Singapore Airlines, has set up a joint maintenance center with Philippine low-cost carrier Cebu Air (PS:CEB) near Manila - a cheaper location than Singapore. And rival Singapore Technologies Engineering (SI:STEG), the world's biggest MRO firm, has a large facility in Guangzhou, China.As the threat grows at the low-end, the Singapore government is looking to move up the value chain, focusing on research and development and high-tech aerospace manufacturing work in partnership with companies like Rolls-Royce Holdings (L:RR).Rolls-Royce, SIA Engineering and the Singapore government are investing up to S$60 million in a joint laboratory to work on advanced manufacturing technologies involving 3D printing and robotic solutions.Professor Tan Sze Wee, executive director of Singapore's Science and Engineering Research Council, part of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, said the city-state had in the past competed for MRO work based on productivity and cost.""But the MRO sector as a whole, which leverages on the larger Asia aerospace sector, is a growing pie,"" he said. ""There are more players coming in from low-cost sites. We will be starting to segment this not just because of productivity or costs but for the more advanced technology. You need the talent to do that, which will take a while for regional countries to catch up.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

According to the report, Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR) is among the prospective buyers.Bombardier declined to comment on the report. Airbus said it did not comment on market rumors.Bombardier, which is now in the middle of a five-year turnaround plan after considering bankruptcy in 2015, has previously weighed strategic options for parts of its aerospace division. In 2015, it held talks with Airbus for a majority stake in the company's CSeries jet but those discussions were called off, Reuters reported in October 2015. https://tinyurl.com/yd79r76aAviation industry sources Reuters spoke with on Sunday, however, cast doubt over Airbus' interest in the Q400. The European planemaker is a stakeholder in ATR, which already controls 75 percent of the turboprop market and such a deal would likely raise anti-trust concerns. Bombardier's aerospace division, nevertheless, has been under pressure because of lackluster demand for its turboprops and regional jets, and more recently because of a trade dispute with U.S. planemaker Boeing Co. (N:BA) over the CSeries narrow-body jets. Earlier this month, the U.S. Commerce Department notched up proposed trade duties on the 110 to 130 seat CSeries jet to nearly 300 percent, following Boeing's complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and sold the planes to American carriers for ""absurdly low"" prices.While Bombardier is now in a stronger financial position than it was in 2015, the company has held informal talks in recent months with potential Chinese companies with the goal of delivering an investment in the CSeries jets and improving the aircraft's sales through better access to the fast-growing Chinese aviation market, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this fall.But those talks have been complicated, among other reasons, by the agendas of various stakeholders, including the Quebec provincial government, which owns a 49 percent stake in the plane program.

But for now, I don't think we're at this point,"" Enders told Handelsblatt, according to a pre-released version of its Monday edition. Airbus' board expressed full confidence in Enders on Thursday, but two people familiar with the matter said it only did so after commissioning its own study of top management.The investigations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office and later its French counterpart were triggered by Airbus in 2016 when it reported itself to UK authorities after uncovering flawed documents over the use of intermediaries in airplane sales.It also faces an Austrian probe over a 2003 fighter sale.Enders and legal counsel John Harrison have come under fire from within Airbus and in the French media for opening the floodgates to widening investigations and for overseeing what several insiders have called a witch-hunt.Enders reiterated on Friday the group could face significant fines as the result of the UK and French probes.Airbus is conducting its own internal investigation in the hope of being offered a deal by UK prosecutors as a reward for co-operation and sharing results with investigators.Enders told Handelsblatt he had no knowledge of illicit funds at Airbus used to bribe potential customers.""I do not have any (slush funds) and don't know of any,"" he said, adding that unless the contrary was proven he would assume that no such funds exist at Airbus.

531,"Oct 13, 2017 04:32AM ET",Kobe Steel's cheating engulfs more divisions; shares resume slide,nan,"By Yuka ObayashiTOKYO (Reuters) - Crisis-hit Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406) said on Friday its steel division has also falsely labeled products, the latest in a string of revelations confirming widespread cheating at the firm that has engulfed its global customers. The bombshell admissions by Japan's third-largest steel maker sent its shares plummeting again, with the scale of the misconduct dealing a body blow to the nation's reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination. Investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, have wiped out about $1.8 billion off Kobe Steel's market value this week after the firm said about 200 companies were affected by its cheating. On Friday, the company said it found data tampering in its steel wire products. Customers have said there are no problems with the safety or function of the products, the spokesman said. Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki will brief media at 0800 GMT, as the crisis ripples through supply chains across the world after the firm admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment. Boeing Co (N:BA), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, but stressed that the world's biggest maker of passenger jets does not as yet consider the issue a safety problem. More than 30 non-Japanese customers including Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) had been affected by the firm's data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (T:9501) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly. The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.Faulty parts have also been found in Japan's famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel. The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.CREDIBILITY 'ZERO' No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio. Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.The steel maker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company's stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer said (does this lawyer specialize in any area?) ""It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,"" said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.""We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.""Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan's manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who said the credibility of the firm ""has plunged to zero."" Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (T:7201), Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) and Takata, which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries. In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (T:5105) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (T:6502) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.""It will likely continue to be extremely difficult to make judgments on creditworthiness and investment until the safety of the products and the extent of damages are clarified,"" SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

533,"Oct 11, 2017 07:40AM ET",Emirates willing to cooperate with rival UAE airline Etihad,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Emirates [EMIRA.UL] is open to cooperation with rival Etihad Airways in areas including procurement, its president Tim Clark said on Wednesday, adding a full merger between the pair was unlikely but up to the owners.Based in the United Arab Emirates, Emirates and Etihad have competed to build global networks from their respective hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, even as they battled overcapacity, security concerns and a fall in regional business travel.""I think there is value to be had working more closely with them,"" Clark told Reuters by phone, adding there might be concerns from regulators in some foreign markets.""There are many areas that the airlines could work together on like procurement. But we have to go the first jump first to understand what it is we could do and I'm simply the manager of one of the businesses,"" he said. ""It is my superiors who have to make that call, not me.""When asked if the pair could pursue a merger along the lines of Europe's Air France and KLM, Clark said: ""I don't think that will be the case but it is not my call, really. It is whatever (the shareholders) may do in the future.""Emirates is owned by the Dubai government while Etihad is owned by the Abu Dhabi government. Etihad, which has been hit by loss-making investments in Air Berlin (DE:AB1) and Italy's Alitalia [CAITLA.UL], said in response to Clark's remarks that it was common for airlines to leverage in-country expertise and economies of scale.""We constantly seek opportunities for innovative collaboration with other organisations, where it makes business and commercial sense,"" an Etihad spokesman said in an emailed statement. Last month, Etihad announced it would appoint Tony Douglas, former boss of Abu Dhabi's airport and London's Heathrow, as its CEO from January as it rethinks its expansion strategy.EMIRATES ORDER PLANSEmirates, a bigger airline than Etihad, is the largest customer for the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A380, a plane facing slowing production rates due to a lack of sales.Clark said an order for more was under consideration, adding that any A380 order would help replace 25 A380s due to be retired in the mid-2020s.He did not give any details on the likely volume of any order or whether a deal would be signed at the Dubai Airshow next month.""Airbus would love us to do that but we've got a few things to sort out first so I'm not sure that we’ll get there for the airshow,"" he said.The airline is separately looking at the Airbus A350 and the Boeing Co (N:BA) 787 to meet its needs in the 250-300 seat market, Clark said. Last month he told Aviation Week magazine that a planned order was ""off the table for now"".In 2014, Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s. Clark said Emirates' procurement and operational groups were engaging with both manufacturers about potential orders.""I don't want to focus on the Dubai Airshow,"" he said of the timing. ""The important thing is to get the right deal for the company at the time that suits us, not driven by a guillotine of the middle of November.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Enders wrote to staff as fresh reports emerged over a separate investigation into alleged fraud in the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003.Enders is among individuals placed under investigation in Austria over the case, which is also the subject of a lengthy probe in Germany. He has denied any wrongdoing and criticised the Vienna probe as an abuse of the legal system.Munich prosecutors said on Friday they expected soon to complete their investigations into the $2 billion deal, but declined to comment on a report by German weekly Der Spiegel that they would file charges soon.French publication Mediapart said on Friday a vehicle allegedly used to funnel payments in the Eurofighter case had also served as a conduit for wider payments to obscure jurisdictions. Such payments are being investigated in the investigation over Airbus's use of middlemen in foreign deals.Airbus has denied any wrongdoing in the Austria case. It had no immediate comment on the Mediapart story.Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a probe into the use of agents in commercial jet deals in 2016, followed this year by France's fraud police.The SFO acted after Airbus alerted UK authorities to inaccurate statements it had itself made over several years on the use of intermediaries in applications for support for jetliner exports.Airbus has meanwhile launched a sweeping internal investigation in the hopes of obtaining a deferred prosecution agreement from the UK, which could lead to a costly settlement such as one Rolls-Royce (L:RR) agreed with UK authorities earlier this year.The use of outside U.S. lawyers and robust questioning of staff has raised hackles inside the company and led to French media speculation of a backlash against German-born Enders.But in the letter, Enders spoke of attacks by vested interests and urged staff to ignore ""simplistic and nationalistic bluster"" and to focus on industrial priorities.He called on staff to support the top management and the board in tackling the compliance issues and predicted Airbus would emerge stronger from the affair.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

538,"Oct 05, 2017 03:08PM ET","Boeing-backed, hybrid-electric commuter plane to hit market in 2022",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Seattle-area startup, backed by the venture capital arms of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) announced plans on Thursday to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.The small airliner is the first of several planes planned by Zunum Aero, which said it would seat up to 12 passengers and be powered by two electric motors, dramatically reducing the travel time and cost of trips under 1,000 miles (1,600 km).Zunum's plans and timetable underscore a rush to develop small electric aircraft based on rapidly evolving battery technology and artificial intelligence systems that avoid obstacles on a road or in the sky.In a separate but related development, Boeing said on Thursday it plans to acquire a company that specializes in electric and autonomous flight to help its own efforts to develop such aircraft.Several companies, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), are working on electric-powered self-flying cars.Zunum does not expect to be the first to certify an electric-powered aircraft with regulators. Rather, it is aiming to fill a market gap for regional travel by airlines, where private jets and commercial jetliners are too costly for many to use.Zunum's planes would fly from thousands of small airports around big cities to cut regional travel times and costs. ""Airlines are very keen to know how to fly a shorter distance and make money on it,"" Matt Knapp, co-founder and chief aeronautic engineer of the Kirkland, Washington-based company, said in an interview. A flight from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, for instance, would leave from Palo Alto, San Carlos, Hayward or Reid Hillview airports and arrive in Santa Monica, Burbank, Hawthorne or San Gabriel Valley airports. The cost would be about $120 one way, the company said.The travel time of over four hours would be cut in half by avoiding the crowds and security lines at big hubs that are required for larger planes. About 96 percent of U.S. air traffic travels through 1 percent of its airports, leaving thousands of small airports virtually untapped, Knapp said.Electric-vehicle batteries, such as those made by Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Panasonic Corp (T:6752), would power Zunum's motors, although Zunum has no commitment with either company. A supplemental jet-fuel engine and electrical generator would be used to give the plane a range of 700 miles and ensure it stays aloft after the batteries are exhausted, Knapp saidZunum plans to make a larger plane seating up to 50 passengers at the end of the next decade, and the range of both would increase to about 1,000 miles as battery technology improves, Knapp said.The planes eventually would fly solely on battery power, and are being designed to fly with one pilot and to eventually be remotely piloted, he added.Recent advances in battery technology, lightweight electric motors and carbon composite airframes would cut the cost of flying Zunum's aircraft to about eight cents per seat-mile, about one-fifth that of a small jet or turboprop plane, Knapp said.""We're getting airline pricing down on a small plane and doing it for short distances,"" Knapp said. ""That kind of aircraft doesn't currently exist.""Zunum first announced its plans for hybrid-electric aircraft in April, and revealed that Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures had invested in its initial round of venture funding. On Thursday it disclosed specifications and a timetable for the vehicle entering service. Zunum says the plane would cruise at about 340 miles an hour and at altitudes of about 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) - slower and lower than conventional jets. The motor, which Zunum is designing, will drive a fan similar to the bypass fan on a jet engine, but without a jet's combustion. Zunum has started talks with plane makers about building the airframe, and it is building non-flying prototypes of the powertrain to test batteries, the electrical system, software and other components, Knapp said. Current battery technology can only power the plane for about 100 miles so a gas-powered engine would be used to generate electricity to power the motors for additional range.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

539,"Oct 05, 2017 11:37AM ET","Prepare now for over-the-cliff Brexit, German industry says",nan,"By Michael NienaberBERLIN (Reuters) - German firms active in Britain should make provisions now for a ""very hard Brexit"", Germany's biggest industry group said on Thursday, because the government in London does not know what it wants.The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said British Prime Minister Theresa May's government lacked a clear strategy on how to exit the European Union following last year's referendum.""After four rounds of negotiations, German industry looks with concern at the progress of the Brexit negotiations,"" BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang told reporters in Berlin. ""The British government is lacking a clear concept despite talking a lot.""To prepare for a disruptive British departure from the EU, the BDI said it had set up a task force including major companies, which trains-to-turbines group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) said it was part of.This week's annual conference of May's Conservatives showed her party remained deeply divided over Brexit and that a lack of strategy was complicating the negotiations with the EU about Britain's divorce talks, Lang said.""German companies with a presence in Britain and Northern Ireland must now make provisions for the serious case of a very hard exit. Anything else would be naive.""A hard Brexit would mean no agreement with the EU, and Britain falling back on World Trade Organization rules rather than being in a tariff-free single market and customs union with the bloc.Britain is Germany's third most important single export destination and its fifth biggest overall trading partner.""The aim of the task force is to identify potential and acute risks arising from Britain's departure and to present constructive proposals for solutions,"" Lang said.Sources told Reuters in September that big players such as Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) were participants.Siemens, which employs more than 15,000 people in Britain including a wind-power joint venture Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN), said it was joining too. ""Obviously we're very interested in this whole endeavor,"" a spokesman said.Germany's VDA automobile association, which represents major manufacturers such as BMW (DE:BMWG), is also involved, a VDA spokeswoman said.The UK is the second-biggest export market for German car manufacturers with a value of nearly 29 billion euros ($34 billion). German carmakers and suppliers also employ roughly 9,000 people at 95 production sites in Britain.The BDI and VDA did not name individual companies taking part in the task force meetings.GROWING UNEASEThe industry preparations are the result of growing unease after slow and acrimonious negotiations so far between Britain's Brexit minister David Davis and his counterpart at the European Commission, Michel Barnier.In Europe's biggest economy, companies are now preparing for the worst, including the imposition of tariffs and the risk of a loss of access to London financial markets.Foreign direct investments from both sides amount to some 140 billion euros and German companies employ roughly 400,000 people in the UK, according to BDI.The task force, established in early summer, is accelerating its work in regular meetings in Berlin, Lang said. It is expected to present conclusions in December and this could also help shape the position of Germany's next coalition government.Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly made clear that she regrets the British decision to leave the EU but that London should not expect a special deal and that keeping the remaining 27 member states together was more important for her.Dampening hopes among some Brexiteers that London could succeed in driving a wedge between governments and companies in other European countries, Lang said German industry fully backed the EU's negotiation strategy.""To make it clear: Yes, German industry wants to keep a very close relationship with Britain. But have no doubt: We prioritize the further development of the EU,"" Lang said.""The ball now lies in Britain's court. The speech by the British prime minister in Florence two weeks ago by no means brought the clarity that had been hoped for,"" Lang said, referring to May's attempt to speed up negotiations.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday that the fourth round of negotiations did not produce enough agreement for the EU to yield to May's demands for immediate talks on a free trade deal and a transition to it after Brexit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

540,"Oct 05, 2017 10:45AM ET",Bombardier eyes Asian markets amid U.S. trade spat with Boeing,nan,"By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is betting on fast-growing markets like India to boost sales of its Q400 and CSeries narrow-body planes, a senior executive said on Thursday, at a time when the Canadian planemaker faces a trade row over sales to the United States.""The company is very focused on expanding into Asia, as we see Asia, and India for sure, as the growth engines of the sector,"" said Francois Cognard, head of Asia Pacific sales at Bombardier, adding this would be its focus region irrespective of how a heated trade spat with larger rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) pans out.Cognard said he saw India's regional connectivity scheme as ""well designed"" and likely to boost demand for its aircraft in the country.India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets and the government's launch of the regional connectivity scheme last year to boost air connectivity to smaller towns and cities, is seen as a boon for small planemakers such as Bombardier and its European rival ATR.Bombardier last week finalised a deal to sell up to 50 Q400 planes to India's SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) valued at $1.7 billion by list prices, its largest single order to date for the turboprop plane which will boost its presence in the country.Rival ATR, the market leader in turboprops, has also secured a provisional order for 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft, worth over $1.3 billion at list price, from Indigo, India's biggest airline by market share.In turboprops, Bombardier still trails ATR, which controls about 75 percent of the market and is co-owned by Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and Leonardo SpA (MI:LDOF). Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) has also said it would consider returning to the prop market.""There are still a lot of markets where you can't beat a turbo in terms of economics,"" said Cognard, adding Bombardier's move to increase the number of seats on the Q400 gave the plane a cost edge in the category. BOEING SPATThe focus on Asia comes at a time when Bombardier is locked in an acrimonious trade spat with U.S. rival Boeing.The U.S. Commerce Department last week slapped preliminary anti-subsidy duties of 220 percent on Bombardier's new jets, after a complaint from Boeing, which could effectively triple the price of the aircraft and shut it out of the U.S. market if upheld.""We see this as an abuse of trade laws by Boeing to attempt to block us from penetrating the U.S. market,"" Cognard said. The U.S. jetmaker alleges the CSeries would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from the province of Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015.The Commerce Department's penalty against Bombardier will only take effect if the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) rules in Boeing's favor.""We expect the final ruling on this early next year,"" said Cognard, adding that its customers were not concerned about the spat and more focused on the economics of the jet, which boasts impressive fuel efficiency.(This story corrects to planes from jets in paragraph 1)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

541,"Oct 05, 2017 06:37AM ET","Exclusive: Airbus defense unit freezes capex, may miss cash goals - memo",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Defence and Space has frozen capital spending and urged its 34,000 staff to take ""drastic measures"" to save cash as it faces the prospect of missing 2017 cash targets by hundreds of millions of euros, according to a memo seen by Reuters.""With the risk of missing our full-year cash targets by hundreds of millions, we need to do something extraordinary together,"" divisional finance chief Julian Whitehead told an internal forum, according to a summary distributed to staff.Airbus (PA:AIR) has said it expects 2017 group-wide free cashflow to be similar to 2016, before mergers and acquisitions and customer financing. It does not publish cash targets for divisions. Due to the bumpy patterns of cashflows in aerospace, it often faces a dash to meet targets in the fourth quarter.Airbus Defence & Space, which has warned of continued cash pressures from the troubled A400M military aircraft program, plans to set up a ""Cash Crisis"" team to improve the situation by end-year, with all its programs expected to participate.Until those plans become clear, all capital expenditure is being frozen with immediate effect across all the division's activities and across all its subsidiaries, the memo said.Airbus shares stumbled from record highs and fell as much as 1.6 percent. They were down 1.3 percent by 0945 GMT, making the stock the worst performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 (FCHI) equity index.Airbus' stock price remains up around 30 percent since the start of 2017 on buoyant demand for passenger jets, although rival Boeing's (N:BA) shares are up 64 percent.Asked to comment on the memo, an Airbus spokesman said: ""We are currently in the traditional year-end race in the commercial and government business.""He added: ""It is key to remind our troops at this important time of a business year on the importance of meeting our cash objectives. That's the current ongoing effort at Airbus and it is rather standard procedure to achieve our quarterly and yearly divisional targets at Airbus Defence and Space without deviation.""ALSO FACING PRESSURE FROM A400M DELAYSAnother person close to the group said the language used in the memo was typical of the purely internal battle cry used by managers at this time of year to focus on reaching targets.On Wednesday, however, Airbus reminded European governments that the delayed A400M would continue to ""weigh significantly"" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018, especially.It has been squeezed as Germany withholds some 15 percent in cash owed for the transport plane because of what it regards as systems failing to do what Airbus had promised. The company earlier this year entered talks with buyer nations to try to ease the penalties and get a new agreement on schedules.At a group level, cash and profits have further been hampered by delays in delivering A320neo jetliners because of delays in receiving engines from U.S. supplier Pratt & Whitney.Late deliveries delay payments from airlines and prevent workers learning through experience as quickly as planned, which drives up cost and eats up cash for inventory on assembly lines.Airbus as a whole had 7.9 billion euros of net cash at end-June, down from 11.1 billion at the end of 2016.While freezing spending, Airbus Defence & Space is also in the midst of a strategy overhaul that has involved selling its electronics activity and now puts faith in the growth of digital services to help it grow faster than the rest of the industry.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

544,"Oct 03, 2017 10:14AM ET",Exclusive: AfDB to decide fate of $296 million Ivorian Airbus purchase,nan,"By Joe BavierABIDJAN (Reuters) - The African Development Bank [AFDB.UL] is expected on Wednesday to decide the fate of a $296 million financing package for Ivory Coast national airline Air Cote d'Ivoire's purchase of five new Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s, a bank document seen by Reuters showed.While the Abidjan, Ivory Coast-based lender has participated in loan packages to commercial airlines in the past, some board members have raised questions about the deals and whether the loans fulfil the AfDB's development vocation. Air Cote d'Ivoire, which aspires to become West Africa's premier airline and make Abidjan a regional travel hub, ordered three A320neos and two A320s last year. Using a stop-gap loan, it took delivery of the first aircraft in July, bringing its total fleet to 10 planes. ""It's to finance the purchase of the five Airbuses, the training of the crew and mechanics and the maintenance center,"" the company's General Manager Rene Decurey told Reuters of the loan request.The size and structure of the package have not been made public, and Decurey declined to confirm the amount. But according to an AfDB document seen by Reuters, it includes a $60 million sovereign loan from the bank to the Ivorian state, which owns a 65 percent stake in the airline. The bank would also provide $55 million in non-sovereign loans and a $20 million partial risk guarantee.Specialist bank  Investec  (L:INVP) will contribute $30 million, with other commercial banks providing loans totaling $81.5 million. Air Cote d'Ivoire will bring equity of over $50 million to the deal. In addition to the Ivorian state, the airline's other shareholders are Air France (PA:AIRF) with a 20 percent stake and private Ivorian investor Goldenrod, which holds 15 percent. The airline, which boasts service to 20 African and five domestic destinations, has previously said the expansion will help grow its business. Its proposal argues that the request is in line with the AfDB's goals of supporting improved transportation and infrastructure in underserved markets.The bank has lent to airlines before, most recently contributing nearly $93 million alongside Delta (N:DAL) to finance Ethiopian Airlines' (ETHA.UL) investment plans.However, Wednesday's board meeting could prove contentious, Abidjan-based diplomats said. Some board members have questioned whether financing Air Cote d'Ivoire's aircraft acquisition fits with the AfDB's stated mission of reducing poverty in Africa by spurring ""sustainable economic development and social progress"". Others have been critical of the deal's unique structure, which would create a special vehicle allowing the Ivorian state to transfer its sovereign loan to the airline with an AfDB guarantee.The bank's rotating board of directors is composed of 13 representatives from its 54 African member countries as well as seven from the 27 non-African nations that contribute to its capital. France, Germany and Spain, whose governments hold stakes in Airbus, currently sit on the AfDB board.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

545,"Oct 02, 2017 07:28AM ET","Britain's Monarch Airlines goes bust, stranding thousands",nan,"By Alistair Smout and Polina IvanovaLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Monarch Airlines [MONA.UL] collapsed on Monday, stranding more than 100,000 travelers abroad after it fell victim to intense competition for flights to holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal.The failure of Monarch, the largest British airline to go bust, will affect nearly 900,000 passengers in total and prompted the country's biggest peacetime repatriation effort.Its demise added to turbulence in the European airline industry after Air Berlin (DE:AB1) and Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] filed for insolvency this year. Ryanair (I:RYA) has also been forced to cancel thousands of flights because of problems finding enough pilots to fly them. Shares of Monarch's rivals, easyJet (L:EZJ), Ryanair (I:RYA) and Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) rose on Monday on the prospect of reduced competition and the chance to acquire some of its assets.Monarch, based at Luton Airport north of London and in business since 1968, canceled about 750,000 future bookings and apologized to customers and staff.""I am so sorry that thousands now face a canceled holiday or trip, possible delays getting home and huge inconvenience as a result of our failure,"" Monarch Chief Executive Andrew Swaffield told employees in a message. ""I am truly sorry that it has ended like this."" Monarch's finances deteriorated in 2016, after security concerns deterred travel to Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt and brought increased capacity for routes to Iberia. The decline in the value of the pound has also compounded its problems.The airline was bailed out by its owner Greybull Capital a year ago.""Monarch has really been a victim of a price war in the Mediterranean,"" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told Sky News.Grayling added that he expected many of Monarch's more than 2,000 staff to get jobs elsewhere.""Monarch's problem was it was it was neither one thing nor the other. It was not really... a package holiday airline, nor was it really a low cost airline. I think it got rather squeezed in the middle,"" he added. The British government has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to charter more than 30 aircraft to bring home about 110,000 Monarch customers currently overseas, the CAA said. RIVALS STAND TO GAINMonarch has seen market share slip in recent years with the rise of budget carriers. It was Britain's fifth largest airline, and according to Euromonitor International, held 1.7 percent of the UK airlines market in 2017, down from 2.6 percent in 2012.The collapse of Monarch could benefit its rivals.""While we wait to see what comes out of the administration process there is no doubt that the pace of restructuring across Europe will be beneficial to yields as surplus capacity is reduced,"" analysts at Goodbody said in a note to clients. Monarch had previously said it was talking to potential partners after a report that parts of its short-haul network would be sold.Analysts at broker Cantor Fitzgerald said that it was likely that easyJet would bid for some of Monarch's assets.""Monarch appears to be a good potential fit and we think that EZJ needs a new source of growth,"" the analysts said in a note.The collapse will be a headache for some of the world's largest leasing companies, which financed its current fleet of 36 mainly Airbus (PA:AIR) jets, and for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which has sold the airline 32 of its 737 MAX aircraft. None of the planes has yet been delivered.Monarch had been a regular pawn in the global battle for market share between planemakers as it shifted its loyalties between Airbus and Boeing.Boeing secured Monarch's agreement to revert back to its jets in 2014 following a fierce contest against Airbus and Bombardier (TO:BBDb). ""NOT A TEXT, NOT AN EMAIL"" Monarch's last flight landed in Manchester from Tel Aviv at 3:19 a.m (0219 GMT) according to flight tracking service Flightradar24.The website also showed 25 aircraft had been lined up to start repatriating passengers by 0600 GMT on Monday, including 10 from Qatar Airways already based in Europe on behalf of British Airways. An easyJet (L:EZJ) airplane and several charter aircraft were also part of the operation.Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air said it was offering to fly stranded Monarch passengers home from Tel Aviv for 119 pounds ($159) each.Accountants KPMG were appointed as administrators for the airline, and said that 860,000 passengers would be affected in all. Monarch said its companies that entered into administration include Monarch Airlines, Monarch Holidays Ltd, First Aviation Ltd, Avro Ltd and Somewhere2stay Ltd. ""We are working with the joint administrators and the CAA to do everything we possibly can to help minimize disruption where we can, but are under no illusion as to the problems this will cause,"" Monarch's Swaffield said.While customers are being taken back to Britain, some who were due to travel out from Luton Airport said that the communication from the airline had been poor.""I've had nothing from Monarch at all. It's absolutely, completely disgusting. Not a message, not a text, not an email,"" said Mary Quist from Milton Keynes in central England.She had been sitting at a cafe in the airport for 6 hours, having been due to fly to Portugal.""We can't even get to duty free to get some medicinal alcohol,"" she added.($1 = 0.7488 pounds)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Qatar Airways announced on Thursday it had acquired a 49 percent stake in Meridiana's new parent AQA Holding, with previous sole owner Alisarda retaining 51 percent. [nL8N1M95QA]Qatar Airways will ""massively grow"" the Italian airline, including a relaunch with new aircraft and new branding and an expansion of its European and international network, Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told Reuters in Doha.Meridiana, Italy's second biggest airline, will ""over the next six months"" start taking delivery of widebody Boeing 787s or Airbus (PA:AIR) A330s, and narrowbody Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAXs ordered by Qatar Airways, he said.He did not say how many aircraft Merdiana would take. Qatar Airways has 26 A330 passenger jets in its fleet and 30 787s, with a further 30 787s on order, according to its website. It has also ordered 20 737 MAXs, and al-Baker said on Sept. 26 that the airline would confirm options for 40 more. [nL2N1M61P2]The Middle East carrier made its third airline investment after more than a year of negotiations.Contract terms for Meridiana employees, including salaries, benefits and working hours, were renegotiated as a condition of the deal, al-Baker said. He did not say how those terms had changed, but said the changes followed a ""a very frank talk with the unions,"" which had been ""very accommodating.""""They realized we are not going to just shrink the airline in the beginning, but that we are going to massively grow the carrier to become the real national carrier of Italy,"" al-Baker said. Italy's number one airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] filed for administration in May after management was unable to reach an agreement with employees over its latest bailout plan. Minority owner Etihad Airways, a Middle East rival of Qatar Airways, subsequently said it would no longer financially support the Italian carrier.Al-Baker said that Meridiana ""should make sure that the Italian public is properly connected"" as Alitalia goes through its bankruptcy proceedings. State-owned Qatar Airways is also a minority shareholder in British Airways parent International Airlines Group (L:ICAG) (IAG) and South America's LATAM Airlines (SN:LAN).Qatar Airways has previously expressed interest in Morocco's Royal Air Maroc (RAM.UL), and al-Baker said it would soon apply to launch a domestic airline in India, which he has said would involve sovereign wealth fund the Qatar Investment Authority.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

547,"Sep 29, 2017 01:54PM ET",U.S. shocks WTO with a novel take on trade dispute rules,nan,"By Tom MilesGENEVA (Reuters) - The United States surprised a meeting of the World Trade Organization on Friday with an interpretation of dispute settlement rules some said was a bid to boost President Donald Trump's plans to reform the global body. Its view, expressed by the U.S. WTO representative, was seen as opening the door for individual WTO member states to block appeals rulings in certain cases, undermining a trade dispute system that is highly regarded by many trade experts. ""It's power politics,"" one trade diplomat who attended the meeting said.Under the WTO's arcane rules, the global trade body has seven appeals judges, three of whom sign off on each trade dispute appeal ruling.The current problem is that two of the seven judges have left in recent months and another has a term that expires in December, which will leave only four.The United States has been blocking recruitment of new appeals judges for several months, exacerbating the risk that the WTO could effectively run out of judges, and piling pressure on other WTO members to accept U.S. plans for reform.At Friday's meeting, the U.S. representative said two of the judges in a recent dispute between Indonesia and the European Union had left by the time their ruling was published, so their ruling would only be official if there was unanimous agreement at the meeting.The United States did not object in this instance, citing ""particular and exceptional circumstances"", but said there should normally be ""positive consensus"" at the meeting to adopt a ruling with too few judges, according to a written U.S. statement provided to Reuters.""I think it's the first time somebody said you need positive consensus. It means that any member can block the whole thing,"" said the trade diplomat who was in the meeting.The already congested system is facing a huge backlog of work, and a risk that there will not be enough judges to rule on appeals in disputes such as the long-running spat over subsidies for planemakers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR). Earlier this week China's ambassador to the WTO, Zhang Xiangchen, said he was concerned that the dispute settlement system and other basic functions of the WTO were at risk from trade protectionism.“Frankly speaking, the WTO is experiencing the most difficult time,"" Zhang told a panel discussion.""And some even challenge the existing rules in the dispute settlement mechanism. Of course any mechanism needs to keep pace with the times and be constantly improved. But if the core values, the fundamental principles are abandoned, the organization will face a crisis of survival.”  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shi said that the plane was in the second, design-focused, stage of its development.The two companies' joint venture, which was set up in May, will be called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation (CRAIC), they said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

549,"Sep 28, 2017 04:00AM ET",China's COMAC says C919 jet completed second test flight,nan,"By Brenda GohSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's domestically developed C919 passenger jet completed its second test flight on Thursday, the jet's maker said, but the duration and near five-month gap since its first flight have raised questions over whether its latest delivery target can be met.The narrow-body C919, which will compete with Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 and the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320, is a symbol of China's ambition to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.However, the program has faced lengthy delays and missed its original target of delivery to customers by 2016 - a date reportedly pushed back to 2020. Sales to date have been restricted largely to its home market because it has yet to be certified by regulators in the United States and Europe.Thursday's flight was the second for the initial C919 test model, whose maiden flight was on May 5. The second of six planned test aircraft, which achieved power-on of its systems in July, has yet to fly.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet during a flight that took off from Shanghai's Pudong Airport at 07:22 a.m. (2322 GMT) and landed at 10:08 a.m. ""Various elements of the test flight, including with the raising/lowering of the landing gear, were all completed smoothly,"" COMAC said in a statement.The 166-minute flight time was more than double the maiden flight of 80 minutes, but 54 minutes shorter than plans detailed in an article published by state-backed news website ThePaper.cn earlier on Thursday. COMAC did not immediately reply to questions from Reuters on whether the flight was shorter than planned.Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher and reporter at Aviation Week, said the five-month interval between the aircraft's two flights was ""extraordinary"" and COMAC's reported delivery target of 2020 appeared not to be firm.""The conclusion must be that COMAC was not really ready for flight testing in May,"" Perrett said in an article published on Wednesday. ""A common view is that the C919 was put into the air so early for strictly political reasons, although there is no suggestion that doing so was unsafe."" Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Industries Ltd's (T:7011), Mitsubishi Regional Jet - Japan's first passenger aircraft - took its second flight eight days after it first flew in 2015 while the gap between the first and second flight for the Airbus A350 was five days, Perrett said. Strongly backed by China's government, COMAC has so far announced orders for 730 C919 planes from 27 customers, many of which are Chinese leasing companies.Though billed as homemade, the C919 relies on overseas technology from firms including  General Electric  Co (N:GE), France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).COMAC also said its ARJ21 regional jet was in the air at the same time as the C919 on Thursday, marking the first time two types of domestically made passenger jets have taken to China's skies simultaneously.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

550,"Sep 27, 2017 06:30PM ET",Little-known U.S. trade commission faces test in Boeing-Bombardier case,nan,"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The best hope for shielding Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and its CSeries jetliner customers from massive trade duties imposed by the Trump administration is a little-known commission tucked away next to an expressway in Southwest Washington, DC.The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday slapped preliminary anti-subsidy duties of 220 percent on the jets, which could effectively shut Bombardier out of the U.S. market if upheld, after rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) launched a trade challenge accusing Canada of unfairly subsidizing the aircraft.The U.S. International Trade Commission could effectively throw out the Commerce Department's anti-subsidy duties against Bombardier if it finds that Boeing did not suffer the injuries it has alleged.The case is outside the parameters of disputes normally handled by the ITC and could test the bipartisan panel's ability to withstand political pressure, U.S. trade experts say.The preliminary duties imposed by Commerce were far above the 79 percent sought by Boeing and more in line with duties against Chinese state-owned enterprises. The department has more leeway in determining duties against nonmarket economies such as China. ""This should be seen in the context of an administration that really likes protectionism, so the higher, the better,"" former ITC chairman Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said of Commerce duty finding against Bombardier. ""They decided to pile it on.""The ITC has rarely ever heard an aircraft case and not one of this magnitude. Normally, the commission deals with trade enforcement cases where a pattern of below-market pricing and injury has been well-established, such as through a flood of dumped imports and lost revenue or closed factories, such as in the steel sector.""It's very far out of the norm. You're deciding this case on the basis of zero imports,"" said Georgetown University law professor Jennifer Hillman, a former ITC commissioner and World Trade Organization Appellate Body member. In the Boeing-Bombardier case, the aircraft in question have not been imported into the United States yet - only ordered by U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL).A key question the ITC will need to answer is whether the 108-133 seat CS100 competes directly with Boeing's 737-700, which seats 126-149 passengers. Bombardier and Delta argue that Boeing did not offer the 737 for the Delta order.But the larger 130-160 seat CS300, for which Delta holds options, is closer to the capacity of Boeing's 138-172 seat 737 MAX7 jetliner, according to literature from both companies.The ITC is normally seen as immune from political influence, with a total of six commissioners who are equally split between Democrats and Republicans. However, the panel currently has only four members, who are scrambling to cope with a bigger workload this year. The Commerce Department notes in its press releases that it has launched 48 percent more anti-subsidy and anti-dumping investigations under the Trump administration this year compared with last year.A PANEL OF SPECIALISTSAll the commissioners are seasoned trade lawyers appointed by former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Chair Rhonda Schmidtlein, a Democrat, and two other commissioners have experience working at the U.S. Trade Representative's office, while Republican David Johanson was the international trade counsel with the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.President Donald Trump has nominated Jason Kearns, a USTR veteran who is now trade counsel to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, to the ITC for a term expiring in 2024, but no confirmation hearing has been scheduled yet. Kearns had been previously nominated by Obama late last year. Pearson, a trade consultant who recently left the libertarian Cato Institute, said the commissioners will hear arguments from Boeing that he believes will be ""pushing the limits"" of the ITC's authority. Past aircraft trade dispute cases have been brought to the World Trade Organization, including years-long fights between Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and Bombardier and Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).""This is outside the normal way of dealing with trade friction in the aircraft sector, where all of the major producers have gotten subsidies,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""It kind of escalates the need for a grand bargain between companies and countries to limit international aircraft subsidies.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

552,"Sep 27, 2017 09:00AM ET",Britain's easyJet aims for electric short-haul flights,nan,"By Alistair SmoutLONDON (Reuters) - British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) could be flying electric passenger jets on short-haul routes within a decade in a push to cut plane pollution, the company said on Wednesday.The airline said in March it would partner with U.S. startup Wright Electric to develop electric passenger jets and is aiming for planes with a range of up to 335 miles (540 km), which could fly about 20 percent of easyJet's routes.EasyJet said its support for electric planes was part of a broader strategy to reduce carbon and nitrous oxide emissions in the aviation sector, following the lead taken by the rail and automotive industries.""For the first time, our industry can envisage a future which isn't wholly reliant on jet fuel and its harmful CO2 and NOX emissions,"" CEO Carolyn McCall said in a statement.The airline is already targeting a 10 percent cut in emissions per passenger per kilometer by 2022 by using more fuel-efficient jets, such as the new Airbus A320neo. The airline has two so far and 98 are on order for delivery by August 2022.Fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines and they have been investing in ways to reduce the amount they use, including by buying new aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines.Airlines such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL) have also been researching alternative fuels. Airbus (PA:AIR) has been developing electric planes and flew its two-seater E-Fan across the channel in 2015, but it expects hybrid fuel systems to come in first for commercial jets - until the batteries needed for electric-only planes become lighter.EasyJet also said it was partnering with French company  Safran  (PA:SAF) to trial a zero-emissions taxiing system for its aircraft, while electric tugs will be introduced at Gatwick.Peter Duffy, easyJet's chief commercial officer, told reporters at London's Gatwick airport that new technologies could ""entirely remove the use of carbon fuels and noise from all our airport operations"".British Airways (L:ICAG) said this week it was now using remote-controlled electric tugs to push its short-haul aircraft away from departure gates.Investors and analysts were also focused on an easyJet capital markets day being held at Gatwick. While easyJet was not providing any trading updates, analysts at broker Goodbody said, ""despite this, we still think the market will be pleasantly surprised by details behind the group's ancillary revenue streams and innovation on this front"".One such move to boost revenues is a trial of inflight entertainment, which will be introduced on five aircraft in easyJet's Swiss operations in autumn. Rather than seat-back screens, the system will allow customers to watch TV shows on their own devices, a model used by others including Lufthansa's Eurowings (DE:LHAG). EasyJet said the service would earn the airline extra revenue, despite being free for the customer to use.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

553,"Sep 27, 2017 08:38AM ET","European rail deal fulfils Macron vision, French fear for jobs",nan,"By Cyril Altmeyer and Georgina ProdhanPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A merger of the rail businesses of Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), billed as creating a European champion, was welcomed by investors but criticized in France as giving away control to Germany and risking job cuts.The tie-up, set to help the European companies counter the rapid rise of China's state-owned CRRC <601776.SS>, represents an industrial win for Macron, who is proposing sweeping reforms for Europe including deeper trade cooperation. While his government said on Wednesday the deal would preserve ""strategic interests"", others accused him of neglecting national concerns.""It is bound to bring a restructuring and no doubt the culling of hundreds of jobs,"" said Olivier Kohler, a trade union official in the eastern French town of Belfort, where Alstom makes the high-speed TGV trains that travel the length and breadth of the country.Alstom shares jumped as much as 8.5 percent and Siemens rose 2 percent as analysts focused on the cost savings.French and German leaders have for years called for the creation of ""European champions"" such as Airbus (PA:AIR) to capitalize on the strengths of Europe's single market and create the scale needed to compete with U.S. and Asian rivals.Yet discussions have often run into difficulties as politicians vie to protect local jobs and retain national influence over an industrial sector.Under the rail deal announced on Tuesday, Siemens will have a small majority of the Paris-based and listed combination, which promises eventual annual cost savings of 470 million euros ($552 million) a year, while Alstom boss Henri Poupart-Lafarge will become its chief executive.While Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens, acknowledged there would be job losses, he said they would be in support functions such as human resources rather than in engineering. ""Of course there will be redundancies, that's part of the synergies,"" told a news conference.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Paris he hoped Europe could now go on to create a leading naval company at a Franco-Italian summit in Lyon. That would be part of a deal between Paris and Rome over the STX France shipyards.COST SYNERGIES""What makes this deal attractive are the targeted cost synergies,"" wrote  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst James Stettler, who rates Alstom ""overweight"" and Siemens ""neutral"". ""If successful, this deal should in our view create significant value for both parties.""Baader Helvea Equity Research analysts described the Siemens-Alstom agreement as ""a strategic move that has to be seen against the backdrop of increasing international competition over the past decade"". Siemens will control Siemens Alstom, with 50 percent of the combination plus a few symbolic shares. It will also get warrants allowing it to eventually acquire another 2 percent.Alstom's shareholders, meanwhile, are set to receive two special dividends from the tie-up. ANTI-TRUST QUESTIONSSome analysts were not convinced that squeezing costs out of the combined business would be easy and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) kept a ""hold"" rating on Alstom shares.""Politicians will also likely try to ensure some form of jobs protection in France and Germany ... making cost synergies difficult to extract,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note.The Siemens and Alstom transport businesses have combined sales of 15.3 billion euros and earnings before interest and tax of 1.2 billion euros, raising questions over whether the deal could fall foul to European anti-trust regulations.But Alstom's Poupart-Lafarge said the two had done their homework, adding he was confident of finding a solution.""Of course this is a large deal so no surprise it will be looked quite closely by the European Commission,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The firms had signed an agreement to set up the joint venture with registered capital of $55 million, the state-run newspaper said on Wednesday. Boeing would take a 60 percent share, while COMAC would invest $40 million for the remainder. Construction of the factory in the eastern city of Zhoushan began in May. It would install interiors and paint liveries.Boeing had not previously disclosed how much it would invest in its first overseas completion and delivery center outside the United States. It aims to deliver 100 planes a year.The China Daily, citing COMAC, added that the Chinese planemaker would participate in the completion tasks with Boeing employees, but how the two sides would share the work was still unknown. The delivery center would be owned by Boeing.Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) are expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the world's fastest growing aviation market.

555,"Sep 26, 2017 05:50PM ET",Bombardier would not pick up tab for duties on CSeries jet: sources,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Allison LampertLONDON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is unwilling to swallow the extra cost for airlines if the United States slaps duties on its CSeries jet and is keen to press ahead with the deal that provoked a North American trade spat, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The stance gathered momentum as the United States prepared to issue a preliminary ruling on whether Bombardier used subsidies to bankroll a sale of 75 new jets to Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), which U.S. rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) claims took place at unrealistically low prices.Tuesday's expected ruling is one step in a process that could lead to U.S. import duties being levied on the CSeries, forcing Delta and other potential U.S. customers to pay millions more for each jet, on top of the agreed purchase price.That has prompted some aerospace analysts to speculate the deal could fall through unless Bombardier agrees to soften the blow for Delta, whose support for the CSeries rescued a programme beset by delays and cost overruns.Although Bombardier cannot legally skirt the measure by agreeing to pay any duty directly on Delta's behalf, trade lawyers say it could technically import the jets itself through a local subsidiary in a way that would be neutral for Delta.But doing so could significantly depress the net amount Bombardier receives and could be seen as legitimising Boeing's complaint on prices, which Bombardier has rejected.""The economics won't make sense,"" a person familiar with the company's thinking said this week. Secondly, Bombardier would not readily allow Delta to walk away from the deal because it might risk other buyers asking for an ""out"" which could prompt an unravelling of its commercial recovery plan.""Delta may ask to cancel; Bombardier will say no,"" another person familiar with the case predicted. None of the sources agreed to be named because of the matter's sensitivity.LEGAL FIGHTBombardier's decision to tough it out seems designed to encourage Delta to take up cudgels against Boeing and the U.S. government. It could have ramifications for the large jet market where the same airline is expected to choose between Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and Boeing for a big single-aisle jet order in the coming year.""I think they (Delta) will send a signal and look closely at Airbus,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia.Delta has said it wants the CSeries soon, but has not said how it will respond if forced to pay potentially large duties.A Delta spokesman said it was too early to comment.People close to the case said it could lead to months if not years of contractual and legal wrangling, with Bombardier likely to appeal any negative finding and Canada ready to take the case to the World Trade Organisation in the absence of a settlement.""I think it will go to legal territory whatever the number (in import duties) because Canada wants to make it a point of principle,"" one of the people familiar with Bombardier's thinking said.But many of the legal options are covered in dust. Industry veterans say it is the first time in memory duties have been considered on aircraft, following a 1980 agreement to free aircraft trade among 32 of the world's leading trading powers.How this plays out could depend on the size of any import duty. A small duty might allow all sides to declare victory and let Bombardier and Delta negotiate a smooth delivery of the planes, but many analysts say a hefty import fee is more likely.Seattle-based trade lawyer Bill Perry said Bombardier could appeal, but only after a final decision is made by the U.S. International Trade Commission next February.Delta or any nominated importer would still have to pay duties as cash deposits during that process, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Those planes will likely come from Air Berlin, with Lufthansa saying the purchase or lease of the planes is ""partly dependent"" on a successful conclusion of talks to take over assets from Air Berlin (DE:AB1). Lufthansa has made an offer for Air Berlin's holiday airline Niki, which flies 21 A320 family jets, regional unit Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter, which flies 20 Dash 8 turboprops, plus some additional A320 planes, Air Berlin's administrator said on Monday.Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr said last week that even if Lufthansa were unsuccessful with the Air Berlin bid, it would still expand Eurowings on its own. Lufthansa has bid around 200 million euros for parts of Air Berlin, plus offer another 100 million euros to meet operating costs during a transition phase, a source has said. Air Berlin, however, does not own its planes, but instead rents them from leasing companies, meaning any investor has to fund the planes separately. Lufthansa has already purchased 20 A320 planes from Air Berlin as part of a lease deal agreed last year. Currently 33 crewed Air Berlin planes fly for Eurowings under the deal. Lufthansa expects to need an additional 3,000 staff for Eurowings as a result of the expansion. ""We have a big opportunity to take a decisive step forward with Eurowings in Europe. The supervisory and management boards have agreed that we should seize this opportunity,"" Spohr said in the statement.The investment in Eurowings, which comes on top of Lufthansa's planned capital expenditure of 2.7 billion euros this year, will be funded from available liquidity.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

For British-based easyJet (L:EZJ) the figure is 450 and in all cases these are their highest ever levels of pilot recruitment. ""The low cost airlines are arguably more vulnerable to a pilot shortage because of their growth, which is now compounded by their size,"" said Gerald Khoo, an analyst with Liberum.""Normally, in a tight labor market I would assume slightly higher staff costs or the airline could trim its capacity growth,"" he said. ""Not getting the balance right results in the situation we have seen at Ryanair in the past week.""Ryanair has disrupted plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers with the cancellations this month due to the pilot shortage.The carrier put its problems down to too many pilots taking leave at the same time. But the shortages are being felt across an industry where the budget airlines are flying tens of millions more passengers each year, driving an increase in European short-haul capacity of around seven percent.Norwegian is particularly jostling Ryanair for senior talent. Both have Boeing (N:BA) fleets, meaning that when pilots defect they fly similar aircraft, lessening training time and expense. Norwegian says it has poached more than 140 pilots from Ryanair; Dublin-based Ryanair puts the number at less than 100. Ryanair is increasing wages for its pilots based in Frankfurt and Berlin in order to steal staff from Air Berlin (DE:AB1), even though the insolvent German carrier flies Airbus (PA:AIR) jets rather than Boeings, making this a more expensive exercise.Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) budget unit Eurowings is also making a bid for Air Berlin's experienced pilots.Mark Simpson, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, said he didn't see a significant risk that Ryanair would have to curb its expansion plans. ""This is a pinch they are facing,"" he said. ""But it hasn't reached a crisis point.""Aside from Air Berlin, Italy's Alitalia, Latvia's Air Baltic and Romania's Tarom were all struggling and could to shed pilots, easing the shortage, he added. HIGHER GRADESThe pressure is being felt acutely in senior roles, according to the British Airline Pilots' Association, which says around 500 of its more junior members are unemployed.""We've seen huge recruitment drives .... in recent years. However, this recruitment tends to be for experienced pilots,"" said BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton.Recruitment web site Indeed.com said pilot vacancies in Britain were 60 percent harder to fill than other jobs, as measured by the number of positions still vacant after 60 days.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said captains have been targeted since the cancellations with a 10,000 euro sign-on bonus. ""We may have got pilot pay a little on the low side,"" he told investors at Ryanair's annual general meeting this week.He insisted the problems were localized and that certain parts of Europe had a surplus of experienced pilots.Ryanair this week also announced wage increases in Dublin, where it says it believes Norwegian Air is trying to hire 40 of its pilots, and in London where it says pilots are being targeted by a number of rivals. A spokesman for Norwegian Air said it saw significant competition for pilots, but was offering competitive conditions and the prospect of flying to destinations in southeast Asia and the United States that Ryanair could not match.EasyJet declined to comment on whether it was struggling to attract senior pilots. JOB SATISFACTIONRyanair is widely regarded to pay competitive wages to senior pilots. Captains earn 150,000-180,000 euros a year, while first officers get 80,000-120,000. But it has been criticized by some current and former staff about working conditions and the way the blunt-speaking O'Leary talks about his staff.Pilots are often employed via agencies and do not enjoy standard benefits for sick pay, pensions or health insurance.O'Leary insisted at the AGM he had a good relationship with his pilots, but said: ""I would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job,"" expressing doubt that anyone could be fatigued after what he said was a maximum of 18 hours of flying per week.Ryanair gets a rating of 2.4 on employee-review site Glassdoor, against 4.0 for easyJet. ALWAYS GETTING BETTERFour years ago Ryanair was berated by investors for treating its customers badly, forcing a promise from O'Leary to stop ""unnecessarily pissing people off"" and launching its successful Always Getting Better customer service drive.But unlike the current crisis, poor customer service never threatened the airline's core operations. Investors remain skittish, with its shares down 5.5 percent since the crisis broke to close at 16.44 euros on Friday. There are signs that pilots are using the shortage to assert themselves. While Ryanair doesn't recognize trade unions, staff at a number of bases wrote a joint letter to management with a series of demands including the implementation of permanent local contracts under local employment law.The European Cockpit Association said Ryanair may now have to treat its staff better as well as its customers.""The Always Getting Better program could have been applied to staff too,"" ECA Secretary General Philip von Schöppenthau told Reuters. ""It would certainly be welcomed by the crew and contribute to the success of the company.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That is up from last year's forecast of 3,750 aircraft valued at $550 billion.""Look at countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia - that infrastructure has to grow and will grow,"" said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing's vice president for Asia-Pacific and India sales. ""Aviation is the biggest source of tourism for the countries, it is the biggest source of moving people and moving cargo.""Southeast Asia, home to rapidly growing low-cost carriers like Indonesia's Lion Air, Vietnam's Vietjet and Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), is taking on greater importance for Boeing and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) as North American and European markets are more mature with far lower growth rates.Keskar said single-aisle airplanes like the 737 MAX and Airbus SE A320 were set to account for more than 70 percent of new deliveries as most travel in the region is expected to be short-haul.China is also trying to compete in this market. The C919 narrowbody, which took its first test flight in May, has received 730 orders to date.""Certainly we watch that, we watch our competition,"" Keskar said of the C919. ""We try to bring products which are superior with lower seat mile cost, better fuel burn and a better passenger experience.""The Boeing forecast does not include any deliveries to Myanmar, Cambodia or Laos, which have less developed aviation sectors than neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam.Airbus has not released a specific order forecast for Southeast Asia but a spokesman said the European manufacturer expected annual passenger growth of 7 percent a year over the next 20 years.Boeing sees worldwide demand at 41,030 new airplanes over the next two decades. While it sees demand jumping the most in Southeast Asia, it has not yet given breakdowns for each global region.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

563,"Sep 20, 2017 01:10PM ET",No proof of bribery in Eurofighter deal: Austrian parliament report,nan,"VIENNA (Reuters) - A parliamentary inquiry into Austria's $2 billion Eurofighter deal found no indications of bribery or that Airbus (PA:AIR) and its partners illegally influenced Austrian politicians, according to the final report on the matter. Lawmakers launched their inquiry in March to check whether politicians might have accepted bribes from the makers of Eurofighter to approve the deal. Vienna prosecutors are pursuing a separate investigation into allegations of fraud against Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium (l:BAES) based on earlier complaints from the defense ministry, which is seeking up to 1.1 billion euros in compensation. Airbus and the consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), rejected the accusations as politically motivated and, on Monday, threatened Austria's defense minister with legal action. Allegations that decision-makers pocketed money for their approval of the Eurofighter deal surfaced almost immediately after the original purchase was agreed in 2003. Legislators investigated a settlement Austria reached with Eurofighter in 2007 to reduce the order to 15 jets from 18 as well as the volume of so-called offset deals meant to provide business for the local economy to 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion) from 4 billion. MPs said they did not have enough time to clarify the circumstances of the initial order.Former Defence Minister Norbert Darabos, a Social Democrat who negotiated the settlement with Eurofighter, was one of the politicians strongly criticized for allegedly having allowed Airbus to outwit him. But the parliamentary report said no indications were found ""that there would have been unacceptable influence on Darabos and his entourage in the context of the settlement negotiations"".Airbus declined comment on the report.It was not immediately clear if the report would have any impact on the separate criminal investigation. ""A parliamentary inquiry is no substitute for the prosecutor and not a criminal court, but it can deliver valuable hints for the prosecutor's investigation,"" said Karlheinz Kopf, who chaired the lawmakers' inquiry. While dismissing bribery allegations, the report also repeated a Defence Ministry complaint that the Alpine republic appeared to have been ""deceived"" regarding its partners' ability to deliver certain jets as initially agreed. It also highlighted findings from a decade ago that Airbus had provided millions of euros in sponsorship money in connection with the Eurofighter deal to a soccer club that is seen as close to Austria's Social Democrats.The parliamentary report further assessed that Darabos did not liaise sufficiently with other ministries and agencies while negotiating the settlement and was not transparent enough to allow a court audit of the deal. The legislators wound up their investigation earlier than planned because Austria called snap elections for Oct. 15, a year ahead of schedule. Airbus has clashed with other European governments, notably Germany, before, but the row with Austria is unique in its fury. The defense ministry said this week said it was open to an out-of-court settlement with Airbus and the consortium. But if no agreement were possible, it would also consider filing a lawsuit based on U.S. rules.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

565,"Sep 19, 2017 07:20AM ET",Airbus looks to China for A380 jumbo amid sluggish global sales,nan,"By Brenda GohBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese airlines could need between 60 and 100 Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 jets over the next five or so years as passenger traffic grows, the plane maker's China head said on Tuesday, amid rising questions over future demand for the super jumbo.Strong demand in China - if translated into orders - would be a major boost for the A380, the world's biggest jetliner, which has faced sluggish demand as airlines shift focus towards a generation of nimbler, more fuel-efficient long-haul planes such as the A350 and rival Boeing Co's (N:BA) 787.China is the world's fastest growing aviation market and is a key battleground for Airbus as well as Boeing which recently predicted the country would spend over $1 trillion on planes over the next 20 years.""When I look at the market flow, the passenger flow, route by route and the economics, I'm fully confident that the Chinese carriers will need a minimum of 60 A380s over the next 5 to 7 years,"" Airbus China Head Eric Chen said at an event in Beijing.Airbus has sold five A380s to China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) but has otherwise failed to penetrate the market with the double-decker jet despite its robust demand forecasts.The aircraft manufacturer believes the A380 will come into its own in markets that face booming tourism and congestion like China, but the aircraft has struggled to compete with smaller and more flexible twin-engined models.In July, Airbus signed an agreement to sell 140 A320 and A350 planes to China in a deal worth almost $23 billion. China represents around 22 percent of Airbus global deliveries.""What I can say is that if one airline takes the lead to order a large number of A380s, the others will follow. I would expect a domino effect and I'm working on it to produce that domino effect that has not happened yet,"" Chen said.He admitted though that it would not necessarily be an easy task to win over Chinese buyers.""A lack of confidence to operate the A380, that is something to work on continuously with the airlines in China,"" he said.Europe's largest aerospace company will on Wednesday inaugurate a completion and delivery centre for its A330 jet in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. The facility is Airbus' first for wide-body aircraft outside Europe and is expected to deliver its first A330 aircraft this year.Francois Mery, chief operating officer at Airbus China, said that there was talk of placing more higher-value work in China, as the company has set a target of doubling its industrial cooperation activity in the country to $1 billion by 2020. ""It's not only about the figure, it also about the content,"" he said.""They have the ambition of getting into the business, making their own aircraft, they need to develop all kinds of things. And so without being naive, of course we are working with them.""Airbus' comments came as the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], which is leading China's efforts to become a key player in the global civil aerospace market, on Tuesday announced 130 in orders for its C919 jet.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

569,"Sep 15, 2017 05:07PM ET","Exclusive: Canada sought to resolve Boeing military, trade disputes at meeting - sources",nan,"By David Ljunggren and Allison LampertOTTAWA/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada last month attempted to end a deepening dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) by suggesting it could withdraw a threat not to buy Super Hornet jets if the U.S. firm dropped a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The informal proposal would have created an unusual link between trade and arms deals, which are typically separated in international negotiations, trade analysts said, and showed the lengths Canada is willing to go to protect Bombardier jobs.Ottawa froze talks on a planned purchase of 18 F-18 Super Hornet jets for more than $5 billion after Boeing in April launched a trade challenge accusing Bombardier of dumping its new CSeries airliners into the U.S. market.Senior Canada government officials and Boeing met last month to discuss the disputes, officials said.One of the sources familiar with the discussions said Ottawa's proposition to Boeing had been ""if we resolve the challenge, that will allow us to resume our discussions on the F-18,"" but said Boeing dismissed the idea of linking the two disputes. Boeing walked away with none of the issues resolved, Canada's ambassador to the United States told reporters this week, without elaborating.A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.One industry source said Boeing sees the alleged CSeries dumping as a long-term threat to its civilian airliner business and has shown little interest in a compromise, even at the risk of losing the military contract.""The Canadian government is trying to link the F-18 file with the Boeing-Bombardier dispute. The position of Boeing and the U.S. government is that they are not linked,"" said a second source directly familiar with the matter.The office of Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who has overall responsibility for relations with the United States, said it could not confirm the sources' account.Time is running out for Canada to end the dispute. The U.S. Department of Commerce is due to hand down its initial ruling on Sept. 26 on whether to impose countervailing duties on the CSeries, a decision that could dampen airlines' demand for the 110-130 seat jets in the key U.S. market.That decision could also boost Boeing's leverage in any future talks with Canada, though the duty would only potentially apply after a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in 2018.Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said on Friday the company is focused on the 2018 ruling and noted Boeing did not take part in the Delta competition that the CSeries won.""It's really hard to see how they are harmed,"" he said in an email.Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a former ITC chairman, said it was likely the Commerce Department would determine preliminary duties against Bombardier, giving Boeing leverage in any negotiations.Boeing has accused Bombardier of imitating European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) by trying to muscle into the U.S. market with cut-rate pricing to win a key April 2016 order from Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL). The first source said Canada ideally still wanted to buy the F-18s rather than looking for other options. ""(Boeing has) put us in a situation where they're forcing us to make hard choices ... we can't do business with someone who is actually killing our industry,"" said the source.

570,"Sep 15, 2017 12:04PM ET","Airbus faces lengthy probe, no quick fine: sources",nan,"PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) faces years of investigation by French and UK authorities into allegations of corruption over jet sales, people familiar with the case said on Friday, playing down a newspaper report of a potentially rapid settlement.The London-based Evening Standard reported British and French prosecutors met last month to discuss the terms of a settlement deal known as a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) following a probe into the use of middlemen to sell jetliners. That could result in a ""1 billion pound-plus"" fine, the report said, but experts said it was premature to talk about a settlement in an inquiry widely expected to drag on for years.The report quoted a source close to Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) as saying SFO head David Green hoped to agree a DPA with Airbus before leaving in April next year. The SFO and Airbus declined to comment on the report which comes as questions hover over the SFO's future, following proposals to fold it into another crime agency.France's Parquet National Financier (PNF) fraud police were not available to comment.The investigations began after Airbus drew the attention of regulators to inaccurate declarations it had made to Britain's export credit finance agency over payments to sales agents.The SFO launched its investigation in August 2016, followed seven months later by the PNF, which legal experts say makes it a relatively young investigation for such a complex case.Airbus has said the process may be a long one.One expert said the French investigation could slow down the process as the two agencies co-operate for the first time.Some analysts say the company could nonetheless face a record fine once the proceedings have played out.It cannot enter into negotiations over a DPA but can be offered one at the end of official investigations, depending on its level of cooperation. It has embarked on a sweeping internal investigation, hampering sales efforts and fuelling tensions with third parties whose payments have been frozen.In January, the SFO struck a DPA with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) forcing the company to pay a record 500 million pound ($680 million) fine for a UK settlement of this type. That followed what was then the SFO's largest ever investigation.The scope of the Airbus case is widely seen as larger with dozens of sales contracts and over a billion euros worth of business under the spotlight, according to one source.Airbus is meanwhile preparing to hit back in a row with Austria over allegations of fraud in a fighter deal, which targets individuals including Chief Executive Tom Enders.The company is expected to issue a defense in coming days and has not ruled out taking the unusual step of legal action against one of its national customers, sources said.Airbus declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It is important to emphasize that Embraer is far from any decision to launch a new turboprop program and the process is in the evaluation phase,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""This is an early, but key step, in establishing if there is a business case for a modern turboprop platform.""Embraer took a similar stance earlier this decade, but chose to hold back. The company will roll out the next generation of its commercial E-Jet lineup in the next few years, freeing up research and development resources for a new family of products.Between Bombardier's Q400 and the market-leading ATR, co-owned by Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and Leonardo SpA (MI:LDOF), there are about 100 turboprop airliners made each year.Embraer's head of commercial aviation, John Slattery, told the Aviation Club in London that existing passenger turboprops were ""decades old,"" creating an opening for an entrant with a new airframe and engines, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news on Thursday.ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer told reporters in Paris on Wednesday there was limited room in the market for a third Western turboprop manufacturer. Demand was strong in Asia and Latin America and picking up in the United States, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

She also plans to discuss the issue with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when they meet next week, a source close to the matter said.A U.S. trade court is due to give a preliminary ruling on Boeing's complaint on Sept. 25.""Our priority is to encourage Boeing to drop its case and seek a negotiated settlement with Bombardier,"" a British government spokesman said in a statement.""This is a commercial matter, but the UK government is working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier's operations and its highly skilled workers in Belfast.""A spokesman for May said Bombardier's jobs were ""of huge importance"" to Northern Ireland.May is likely to find it difficult to convince Trump, who has made 'America First' a theme of his administration, to get one of the titans of U.S. industry to back off from defending what it views as its trade rights.But the DUP is certain to maintain its pressure on her.""The engagement at governmental level with Boeing and with the U.S. has been significant over the course of the summer because this is pivotal to the Northern Ireland economy,"" DUP lawmaker Gavin Robinson told the Irish national broadcaster RTE.""We’re not there yet, and the work still has to continue.""PLANE FIGHTBoeing this year asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing at Bombardier, accusing it of having sold 75 of its CSeries medium-range airliners to Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) at well below cost price.Bombardier makes the aircraft's state-of-the-art carbon wings at plant in Belfast.""Boeing had to take action as subsidized competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come, and we could not stand by given this clear case of illegal dumping,"" Boeing said in a statement.""We believe that global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that’s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our aerospace industry.""Bombardier called the allegations absurd.""Boeing’s petition is an unfounded assault on airlines, the traveling public and further innovation in aerospace,"" a Bombardier spokesman said. ""We are very confident the UK government understands what is at stake and will take the actions necessary to respond to this direct attack on its aerospace industry.""Industry sources said Boeing was unlikely to back down in the case, which mirrors a wider row with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) over subsidies that it perceives as a strategic threat.The row could also reopen a debate over Britain's own support for Bombardier in Northern Ireland. In 2008, the UK provided 113 million pounds in development loans plus other local aid for the production of CSeries wings, prompting a complaint from Brazil's Embraer. The European Union rejected the claim.(This version of the story corrects paragraph four to show May to visit Ottawa next week, not next month)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The United States was Malaysia's third-largest trading partner in 2016. The meeting with Trump is critical for Najib, who is looking to raise his standing globally, and in Malaysia, where he is expected to call general elections in the coming months. An international graft probe by the United States and several other nations into state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) has hurt Najib's popularity. With the U.S. visit, Najib is hoping to put the 1MDB scandal behind him. Najib is scheduled to witness a memorandum of understanding signing ceremony between Malaysia Airlines and Boeing, according to a schedule of the Prime Minister's events in Washington reported by Malaysian media outlets.The two sources said Malaysia Airlines considered buying Airbus (PA:AIR) A330neos before settling on the 787 order. Aircraft manufacturers typically give discounts to list prices.Malaysia Airlines said it would not comment on reports that are speculative in nature. Boeing and Airbus declined to comment. The sources did not want to be named because the discussions were private.Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at independent aviation research firm CAPA Centre for Aviation, said the timing of the order alongside Najib's visit raised concerns of potential political influence over the purchase. ""This has happened before with Malaysia Airlines - and other airlines in this region for that matter - where the government has decided to buy an airplane that wasn’t really required,"" Singapore-based Sobie said. ""I think in this case the 787 is required anyway. But now that it is a political thing there are questions.""Malaysia Airlines has been transforming its operations under two consecutive non-Malaysian bosses as it recovers from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine. The carrier is targeting a return to profit next year.Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Peter Bellew said in June the carrier was in early negotiations with Airbus and Boeing for the purchase of 35-40 new long-range jets.CAPA analyst Sobie said the airline needed widebodies for growth, as well as to replace ageing A330 aircraft over the next several years, making eight aircraft a smaller than expected order.In the eight months ended August 31, Boeing announced 426 net orders compared to 215 at Airbus.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

579,"Sep 06, 2017 03:58AM ET",China to spend over $1 trillion on planes over next 20 years: Boeing,nan,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese airlines are likely to buy more than 7,000 planes worth $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years, as they grow their fleets to meet robust demand for domestic and international travel,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said in a bullish forecast on Wednesday. Its latest estimate of 7,240 aircraft purchases for the period to 2036 is 6.3 percent higher than the U.S. planemaker's previous prediction of 6,810 planes last year. ""China's continuous economic growth, significant investment in infrastructure, growing middle-class and evolving airline business models support this long-term outlook,"" Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president of marketing, said.""China's fleet size is expected to grow at a pace well above the world average, and almost 20 percent of global new airplane demand will be from airlines based in China,"" Tinseth said in a statement.Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have been jostling for market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country. Both firms have profited heavily from the aggressive fleet expansion plans of Chinese airlines, which are now experiencing falling passenger returns on routes, thanks to stiffer competition and capacity increases. The U.S. firm said it expects three-quarters of the 7,240 plane orders to be for single-aisle aircraft, thanks to strong demand for travel within China and throughout Asia. The widebody fleet would require 1,670 new planes, it added. Tinseth said he expected more demand for widebody aircraft, adding that the falling returns now being experienced by airlines was temporary.

580,"Sep 05, 2017 01:23AM ET",United Tech to buy Rockwell Collins for $30 billion,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Mike Stone(Reuters) - Aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) has struck a $30 billion agreement to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL), the companies said on Monday, in a deal that bulks up UTC's power with plane makers by creating one of the world's largest makers of civilian and defense aircraft components.Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies will pay $140 per share for Rockwell Collins, split between $93.33 per in cash and $46.67 in stock, according to the companies. The price represents a 17.6 percent premium to Rockwell's $119 share price before news of the talks emerged on Aug. 4.Shares of Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins closed at $130.61 on Friday. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday. The acquisition price implies a total transaction value of $30 billion, including Rockwell Collins' debt, and a total equity value of $23 billion.  United Tech  said it plans to fund the cash portion through debt issuances and cash on hand. Under the deal, the companies said that Rockwell Collins and UTC's aerospace systems segment will be combined to create a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems. ""This acquisition adds tremendous capabilities to our aerospace businesses and strengthens our complementary offerings of technologically advanced aerospace systems,"" UTC's chairman and chief executive officer, Greg Hayes, said in the statement.""Together, Rockwell Collins and UTC Aerospace Systems will enhance customer value in a rapidly evolving aerospace industry by making aircraft more intelligent and more connected,"" he said.SUPPLIERS VS PLANEMAKERSThe creation of a new giant in the top echelon of aircraft parts makers comes as planemakers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) are trying to capture more of the profits earned by their suppliers. Both are pushing suppliers to lower prices and are moving into the high-margin aftermarket arena for parts and services that suppliers now enjoy.In a move seen as a threat to Rockwell, Boeing said in July that it would build up its own avionics business.Last week, Airbus urged supplier UTC to stay focused on fixing industrial problems that have delayed new aircraft deliveries.If plane makers ""are going to take more of the aftermarket or demand more of the aftermarket, we're going to have to think about how we price our products,"" Hayes told analysts in July.By making more of the components needed on each aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies likely will gain some leverage to resist such pressures.The deal also follows a wave of consolidation among smaller aerospace manufacturers in recent years that was caused in part by the need to invest in new technologies such as metal 3-D printing and connected factories to stay competitive. A combined United Technologies and Rockwell Collins could similarly invest, and their broad portfolios have little overlap.United Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines used by Airbus,  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and other plane makers. It supplies engines for  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It also supplies such key components as landing gear, air conditioning systems and engine covers to a wide range of jetliners.Rockwell Collins is a major avionics supplier to Boeing and Airbus and other plane makers. In April it added passenger seating, cabin interiors, lavatories and galleys through its $6.4 billion acquisition of B/E Aerospace.The two companies have spent a month trying to reach an agreement, and their combined sales would be more than $62 billion, compared with about $95 billion for Boeing.United Technologies expects to close the purchase in the third quarter of 2018. The company, with a $94.2 billion market value, also owns Otis Elevator and air conditioner maker Carrier.

581,"Aug 24, 2017 12:41PM ET",First Airbus A380 parked amid search for new operator,nan,"By Jamie Freed and Tim HepherSINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - The first Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 superjumbo to fly passengers almost a decade ago has been taken out of service by Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), highlighting a debate over the future of the world's largest airliners.Singapore Airlines has already said it plans to hand back its first A380 to a German leasing company rather than extend its 10-year lease.The move focused attention on slack demand for the 544-seat double-decker and raised the prospect that some could be headed for the breakup yard, casting a pall over celebrations to mark the airliner's 10 years of service in October.Confirming a report in flightglobal.com, Singapore Airlines said it had parked the aircraft ahead of the transfer back to its owner. Its last commercial flight was to London in June.""It is correct that the aircraft has been removed from service ahead of its return to the lessor in October,"" a spokesperson for the airline said by email. ""We are not in a position to comment on what is planned for the aircraft after it is returned to the lessor.""The owner of the aircraft, Dortmund-based Dr Peters Group, and Airbus both declined to comment on the move.The German owner says it is in talks with several entities who may be interested in the first aircraft, one of four due to come back from Singapore Airlines up to June next year.In total the asset manager owns nine superjumbos including five leased to Air France (PA:AIRF). These have been financed through the Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) market, a tax-efficient system best known for its appeal to high-income individuals.Singapore Airlines continues to take delivery of new A380s which will be fitted with upgraded cabins.But the problems in finding a new airline willing to operate the giant aircraft as they come off their initial leases have highlighted the lack so far of a fluid second-hand market.That in turn weighs on fragile demand for new aircraft, which has twice forced Airbus to reduce production.The race to find a new home for the first jet comes as Airbus tries to maintain confidence in the programme and negotiate deals for new jets at the Dubai Airshow in November. While most airliners have an economic life of 25 years and are built to last even longer, the first A380 faces an uncertain future less than 10 years after it went into service in 2007, marking what European leaders hailed as a new era in air travel.If Dr Peters cannot find a new operator, it is widely expected to break up the first one or two aircraft for parts.Airbus insists the A380 does have a future due to congestion and predicts 5 percent of aircraft delivered over the next 20 years will be in the same category.U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) disagrees and stopped forecasting demand for very large four-engined airplanes such as the A380 and its own 747-8 in June.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

582,"Aug 24, 2017 10:10AM ET",Australia's Qantas firms up plans for world's longest commercial flight,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) is set to formally announce plans to offer 20-hour non-stop flights from Sydney to London by 2022 if Airbus SE (PA:AIR) or  Boeing Co  (N:BA) can deliver aircraft that meet the distance, a source familiar with the matter said.The flight from Sydney to London will on most days take a northern polar route rather than the usual western crossing over Asia and Europe, said the source, who did not want to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.An announcement is expected alongside the airline's annual results on Friday, the source added. The polar route is longer than the 9,200 nautical miles (17,038 kilometers) western route but has the benefit of strong tailwinds rather than fierce headwinds. The route could vary depending on the time of year, but the return flight will likely follow the traditional route, the source added.""The smart way is not to fight the winds. Use them,"" Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a note to clients speculating about a 10,000 nautical miles polar route in June.A non-stop Sydney-London route that is three hours shorter than flights involving stops would allow Qantas to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. Analysts estimate Qantas could price its tickets at a 20 percent premium in return for delivering business travelers to their destination more quickly. It will cut a current stop in Dubai, the hub of Qantas partner Emirates.To improve passenger experience during what is slated to be the world's longest-ever commercial flight, cutting across 10 time zones, Qantas has said it will work with the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre on research projects including strategies to counteract jetlag, on-board exercise and movement, and cabin environment including lighting and temperature.Chief Executive Alan Joyce has previously told Reuters the Airbus A350-900ULR and Boeing 777-8 are contenders for non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York, but Qantas has not yet placed an aircraft order. Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, there are concerns of missing that target if Qantas wants to avoid a fuel stop on the challenging Sydney-London leg. The new aircraft, which will replace retiring 747s, would sit alongside A380s and 787s to form the backbone of the airline's international fleet servicing medium and long-haul routes and help it maintain its competitiveness.Qantas has already announced plans for 17-hour non-stop Perth-London flights from March 2018 with 787-9 aircraft. Rival Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) on Wednesday said it was considering an order for A350 and 777X aircraft that would allow it to fly non-stop from its Auckland hub to New York and Brazil by 2021, targeting Australian transit traffic in competition with Qantas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

583,"Aug 24, 2017 04:00AM ET","Regulator, Airbus issue software fix for A350 on explosion risk",nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European aviation safety authorities have issued an emergency directive for operators of the Airbus (PA:AIR) A350-900 long-haul aircraft to upload a software fix to prevent potential overheating of the hydraulic system and a risk of explosion.Airbus has delivered over 100 of the aircraft so far, which is flown by airlines including Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) and Qatar Airways.In the directive, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said that an overheat failure mode of the hydraulic engine driven pump had been found, which could cause the temperature of the hydraulic fluid to rise fast.If that is not noticed and corrected, it could, if combined with an inoperative fuel tank inerting system, lead to the fluid overheating uncontrollably, which could then in turn lead to the fuel-air mixture in the affected fuel tank igniting, EASA said. Airbus said it had informed operators of the short-term software fix and was investigating whether further action was needed. A spokesman for Lufthansa said the German flagship carrier was complying with the directive and did not expect any impact on its A350 fleet or operations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

584,"Aug 23, 2017 09:35AM ET",Israel's El Al counts on new Boeing 787s to lure back customers,nan,"By Steven Scheer and Miriam BergerBEN GURION AIRPORT, Israel (Reuters) -  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) took delivery of its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft on Wednesday in a $1.25 billion investment aimed at renewing its long-range fleet, halting a drop in its market share and winning back business customers.In all, Israel's flag carrier will receive 16 787-8 and 787-9 planes -- both bought and leased -- by 2020. It expects one more 787 by year-end, a total of seven by the end of 2018 and 14 by the end of 2019.They will initially fly from Tel Aviv to Newark starting on Oct. 17 and then Hong Kong, London and New York's JFK airport.At a ceremony on the tarmac at Ben Gurion International Airport following the airplane's flight from Seattle, CEO David Maimon said the fleet renewal was new era for El Al, helping it better compete in a fiercely competitive market.El Al was once the go-to airline for most Israelis thanks to the kind of stringent security that equips planes with missile defense systems. But it has frustrated customers -- particularly business travelers -- over the past decade with an ageing fleet that compares poorly with competitors offering newer jets fitted with the latest in hi-tech entertainment and comfort. Last week, it reported a 53 percent drop in second-quarter net profit due to higher salary and jet fuel costs. Its market share at Ben Gurion Airport fell to 29.5 percent from 34.2 percent a year ago.""I am sure (because of) this aircraft, most of our passengers will be back, especially the business segment,"" Maimon told Reuters on Wednesday. The average age of El Al's 19-strong long-haul fleet of Boeing 767s, 747s and 777s is about 19 years, and 14 of them are more than 21 years old. El Al in recent years has renewed its short-haul fleet with 23 Boeing 737 aircraft.""We have old aircraft. But in two years from now we will have a new fleet. The average age will be about five, six years,"" Maimon said, noting the 747s and 767s will be retired.The new aircraft are expected to cut fuel costs by at least 20 percent.El Al, which is expanding into North America with nonstop flights to Miami starting in November, retains an all Boeing (N:BA) fleet. In a tender, it opted for the 787s over the Airbus A350s (PA:AIR). Towards the back of the new aircraft is inscribed ""Proudly all Boeing"". ""This relationship is almost 70 years old and we don't have a lot of all-Boeing customers anymore,"" said Ray Conner, Boeing's vice chairman. ""The relationship between our company, Israel and El Al is one of the more precious ones we have.""Graphic on El Al's market share: http://tmsnrt.rs/2gk2Bo5   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The aircraft would be operated mainly by Cathay Dragon, the sister airline of Cathay Pacific, it said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The aggregate consideration for the Airbus aircraft, as a result of negotiations between the two parties, will be lower than the list price, it added.The news comes a week after Cathay Pacific said it did not see operating conditions improving over the rest of 2017, although analysts said they believed losses had bottomed for Hong Kong's flagship carrier which has been hit by fierce competition from lower-cost rivals.The struggling airline is in the middle of a three-year reorganization plan, the benefits of which Chairman John Slosar has said would begin to surface in the second half of 2017.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

586,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), owner of India's IndiGo airlines, and GoAir airlines have been facing delays in receiving planes from Airbus (PA:AIR) due to ongoing problems with engines developed by Pratt & Whitney.IndiGo, which on Monday warned the delays were affecting its margins, has been forced to ground as many as nine of its planes on certain days due to the engine problems.The concern around grounding of planes affecting flight schedules of the airlines was raised on Thursday by India's aviation regulator in a meeting attended by executives from Pratt & Whitney, Airbus, Indigo and GoAir, an official at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said. ""P&W (Pratt & Whitney) assured that by Sept 2017, they will ensure that there is no grounding of aircraft,"" said the official, who did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The regulator has been investigating issues that have arisen with the Pratt & Whitney engines in Airbus Group's A320neo narrow-body jets brought into service over the past year by the two local carriers.The model accounts for only a small part of the IndiGo and GoAir fleets, but numbers are set to grow rapidly with IndiGo having over 400 of the jets on order and GoAir set to add over 100.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

588,"Jul 31, 2017 09:46AM ET","Boeing expects India to order up to 2,100 aircraft over 20 years",nan,"By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Monday it expects Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia's third-largest economy.The planemaker said it expected single-aisle planes, such as the next generation 737 and 737 Max, to account for the bulk of the new deliveries, with India likely to take 1,780 such planes.India is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, with domestic passenger traffic growing at around 20 percent in the past few years.""The increasing number of passengers, combined with a strong exchange rate, low fuel prices and high load factor bodes well for India's aviation market, especially for the low-cost carriers,"" said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India sales at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.The world's biggest maker of jetliners said it expected passenger growth of about 8 percent in South Asia, dominated by India, over the next 20 years, compared with the world average of about 4.7 percent.Last year, India overhauled rules governing its aviation industry, liberalizing norms for domestic carriers to fly overseas and incentivising air travel to smaller cities by capping air fares and opening airports.Boeing could increase its demand forecast next year depending on how quickly India's plan for regional connectivity takes off, Keskar added.The U.S. planemaker dominates the wide-body aeroplane market in India, with Jet Airways (NS:JET) and state-owned carrier Air India among its biggest customers, while competitor Airbus (PA:AIR) sells the bulk of small planes preferred by low-cost carriers such as InterGlobe Aviation's (NS:INGL) IndiGo.Low-cost carriers dominate Indian skies, accounting for more than 60 percent of flights in the country.To plug this gap in its portfolio, and following runaway sales of Airbus' A321neo, Boeing launched the 737 MAX 10 single-aisle jet at an air show in Paris in June. India's SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) airline has already placed a provisional order for 40 737 MAX 10 aircraft.Boeing also expects Indian carriers to order its new 777X family, comprising the 350-375 seat 777-8 and the 400-425 seat 777-9, due to enter service in 2020, but said it would take several years for this to happen.Air India still has to take deliveries of three of its 777-300ER and Jet Airways is on the 787-9, Keskar said, adding that when these planes need to be replaced after a few years the airlines could look at the 777X family. Boeing has won 326 orders for the latest version of its 777 but apart from an order from Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) earlier this year, demand for the world's largest twin-engined airplane has been relatively slow since it was launched with a barrage of orders mainly from Gulf carriers in 2013.The planemaker expects worldwide demand for 41,030 aircraft over the next 20 years, putting India's share of the total at about 5 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But those cuts were planned, and through reduced spending -- by streamlining production, shedding 6,500 jobs and winding down development costs -- Boeing dramatically improved profit and cash flow.The company aims to generate $50 billion a year in revenue within the next five to 10 years from a services business it launched July 1. That business, drawn from Boeing's defense and civil units, currently has annual revenue of $14 billion.The company isn't planning further restructuring but will keep cutting costs aggressively, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call.""We're going to be relentless on driving our cost structure down ... to invest in future innovation,"" he said.The company's cash from operations, at nearly $5 billion in the quarter, was roughly double estimates of about $2.5 billion.The 787 Dreamliner contributed $531 million of the increase, the second-largest amount in the six years since Boeing started delivering the carbon-fiber planes. Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said investors can expect at least that level of cash in the future. Boeing shares rose 7.9 percent to $229.20 in midday trading. The stock has soared 37 percent this year.""Monster cash flow,"" said analyst Robert Stallard at Vertical Research. The results were ""about as close to perfect as it gets from Boeing,"" he added.Military aircraft sales fell 4 percent to $6.8 billion, but profit jumped 50 percent and margins widened 4.6 percentage points, another sign of cost-cutting.The extra cash allowed Boeing to add $1.5 billion to its 2017 operating cash flow forecast, now about $12.25 billion. Boeing will increase share buybacks this year by $3.5 billion, to about $10 billion. And it will make $3.5 billion in additional pension contributions this year to reduce future costs.Boeing said it will cut full-year capital expenditure by $300 million, but that was expected since the company has made most of the big investments in its 777X wing factory and the 737 MAX and 787-10 programs, said analyst Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group.Muilenburg said the capital spending cut reflected declining 777X costs and was a sign that the program remains on track for the first aircraft to reach airlines in 2020.The company lifted its full-year forecast for core earnings, which exclude some pension costs, by 60 cents to between $9.80 and $10.00 per share.Boeing swung to a profit of $1.76 billion, or $2.89 per share, in the second quarter, from a loss of $234 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier that reflected charges related to the 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs. Revenue fell to $22.74 billion.Analysts expected core earnings of $2.30 per share on revenue of $23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

594,"Jul 25, 2017 09:40AM ET",Norwegian Air under pressure to boost finances,nan,"By Gwladys Fouche and Simon JessopOSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), the fast-growing budget airline trying to crack the transatlantic market by undercutting established rivals, faces mounting pressure to control costs and shore up its balance sheet to weather fierce competition.The airline has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan buying more than 200 new fuel-efficient jets yet investors worry its drive to put more passengers on more planes is pushing up costs quickly without producing higher returns.Doubts are creeping in because Norwegian's fate rests on the still unproven strategy of adapting the success of low-cost short-haul travel to long-haul routes, as well as making a parallel bet on leasing out jets to rival carriers pay off.Its shares have dropped 38 percent in 2017 bucking the industry trend and, according to Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority, investors have taken out bets on price falls with 5.35 million of its shares, or 14.9 percent of its capital.The so-called short-selling increased after Norwegian said the outlook for both its revenue and costs was worse than expected, its chief financial officer of 15 years abruptly quit and operational glitches left it short of pilots at the start of the peak summer season.""The company's ambitious growth plan is putting pressure on costs due to training of personnel and new bases,"" said Jomar Kilnes, a portfolio manager at Forte Fondsforvaltning, a Norwegian Air shareholder. ""It is a great logistical challenge to make this run smoothly and we believe the recent high costs reflect that,"" Kilnes told Reuters. ""Operational improvements are important in order to maintain shareholders' confidence.""TRAILBLAZINGNorwegian Air, which began operating as a low-cost carrier in 2002, has led the charge for low-cost long-haul flights, especially across the Atlantic, forcing rivals to take action to protect profits and encouraging others to try their hand. Carriers such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) have set up low-cost brands Eurowings and Level for long-haul routes and U.S. carriers have introduced fares stripping out extras. ""They have been opportunistic and in some ways it's worked out. They've definitely had an impact on the market, people have followed where they've led, as we've seen with Eurowings and Level,"" Jonathan Wober, an analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said of Norwegian Air. New airlines are also taking on the transatlantic market such as Nordic budget carrier Primera Air and Iceland's Wow air which has grabbed headlines with cut-price tickets. Others are wary, though, with doubts over whether the low-cost long-haul model can produce reliable profits in all regions.While airlines can copy some short-haul tricks such as sticking to one aircraft type and charging for extras, there are challenges around keeping long-haul planes in use and staff costs - because overnight crew stops cannot be avoided.Ryanair (I:RYA), Europe's largest low-cost airline, has shunned transatlantic routes because it says it can't get planes at a price to make it work. AirAsia X (KL:AIRX), which flies long-haul mostly within Asia, is not introducing European routes because of fierce competition from Gulf carriers. RISING COSTSTo serve its ambitions, Norwegian has led a procession of blockbuster orders from budget airlines in Europe and Asia. In the last five years, it has ordered more than 200 efficient new jets including 110 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAXs, with options for another 90.But it doubled up by ordering 100 of the similar Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo jets to support its foray into the plane leasing business, as well as more than 20 wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliners for its transatlantic routes. In the second quarter, Norwegian's operating expenses jumped 45 percent with increases across the board, a rise it put down to new routes and hubs. The airline also said the roughly 2,000 staff it is recruiting in 2017 was, ""a significant cost driver but also a necessary investment for future growth"".Its costs for every seat per kilometer flown rose 9 percent to 0.43 of a crown. The commonly used measure of airline costs is now expected to be about 0.42 this year, up from a previous estimate of 0.39-0.40 crown. However, revenue for each seat offered fell 3 percent to 0.41 crown.The carrier ended up with a second-quarter operating loss of 863 million crowns. That translated into a net profit of 1 billion thanks only to its 17.5 percent stake in Norwegian Finans Holding (OL:NOFI), a bank it launched to offer customers credit and to run its loyalty program.One banker who declined to be named said the performance was the result of ""increased interest expenses, huge capital expenditure, yields under pressure and aggressive commercial growth based only on market share versus profitability"".The banker said he stopped looking at potential financial exposure to Norwegian Air one to two years ago, partly because the airline did not have enough capital backing its expansion.Norwegian's ability to meet its short-term debt obligations is ranked second-worst among European carriers after Croatia Airlines , according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. Norwegian's so-called quick ratio, a commonly used indicator of short-term liquidity, is 0.42, less than half the average of regional rivals. Its interest coverage ratio, a measure of how easily it can service outstanding debt, is just 3.2 while the ratio for Ryanair is 25.2. ""What gets me with Norwegian ... is the balance sheet could be better. It is so low on equity, so high on debt, it would be safer if they had a bit more equity behind it,"" said James Halstead, a managing partner at consultancy Aviation Strategy.""This is a cyclical industry and if something goes wrong it can go drastically wrong,"" he said.Norwegian Air Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos defended the airline's capital levels, saying it relied more on national export-import banks.""Our financing is a little different from the usual bank financing. We use these state institutions and we have always fulfilled their requirements,"" he told Reuters. TEETHING PROBLEMSNorwegian Air has also been hit by operational glitches as it launches more transatlantic routes.It did not book enough pilots for its summer schedule this year and had to cancel flights for the second time in two years. It also leased more planes, which can be more costly, to ensure it had enough capacity after Boeing delayed deliveries of its upgraded 737 MAX planes. ""They should improve their back-up plans to avoid the enormous extra costs when they experience delays on new planes and technical or personnel problems,"" said Leif Eriksroed, head of Norwegian equities at asset manager Alfred Berg, the 11th largest investor in the airline with a 0.91 percent stake.Norwegian Air said a pilot shortage at the start of the summer was due to the training of pilots for the new Boeing 737s taking longer than expected. It said Boeing 737 MAX delays also affected its plans.""The operational hiccups hardly affected our intercontinental service but rather our intra-European routes,"" it said, adding that operations had been running ""fairly smoothly"" in recent weeks with very limited cancellations. Norwegian has also said it would control some costs better from the fourth quarter by ending so-called wet lease deals in which it rents planes with crews from other airlines, and by getting more fuel-efficient engines for its Dreamliners.""There is a lot that we can do. We will end the wet lease arrangements and the Dreamliners that will burn 3 percent less fuel ... Fuel is 40 percent of our costs. The new engines will help a lot,"" Norwegian's Kjos told Reuters.AIRLINE ALLIANCE?The 787 Dreamliner is a new-generation jet that was seen slashing fuel bills by some 20 percent. But Norwegian is under pressure to squeeze even more from its fleet.""The balance sheet of Norwegian Air is admittedly stretched, but considering its valuable and sought-after assets consisting of the most modern airplanes, the company has a lot of financial flexibility,"" Kilnes, the portfolio manager, said. ""It is also very important that the company continues to find and close the best financing sources for its new aircraft orders,"" Kilnes said.Eriksroed at Alfred Berg agreed on the importance of controlling costs. ""It is important to open new routes at a pace that doesn't dilute the overall margins too much,"" he said.Karl-Johan Molnes, head of research at Norne Securities, said Norwegian Air's best option would be to join the SkyTeam alliance with Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Delta (N:DAL). However, low-cost airlines generally shun such alliances as they can eat into their efficient standalone business models, adding scheduling constraints and costly bag transfers.Still, Norwegian is pondering cooperation with European short-haul budget airlines, in which they would fly passengers to feed Norwegian's long-haul routes.""This industry needs innovators like this,"" said Halstead at Aviation Strategy. ""Not always the first one survives, and we hope this one will.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

595,"Jul 21, 2017 07:10AM ET",UK sidelined as Europe looks beyond Brexit in aerospace,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Britain risks losing clout in the aerospace industry, one of its largest skilled employers, due to concerns over its departure from the European Union, a corporate overhaul at Airbus and a new Franco-German push on defense, industry insiders say.Initiatives from a new continental combat jet to a decision by Airbus (PA:AIR) to downgrade its UK representation, as well as the redeployment of some research projects, have left the $90-billion UK sector feeling increasingly sidelined.France and Germany last week announced plans for a joint fighter, catching many in Britain off guard.Though chiefly designed to rejuvenate the Paris-Berlin axis, the move has highlighted questions over Britain's place in the European powerhouse after Brexit and left its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (L:BAES) maneuvering for a place.""Everyone is now simply acting on the basis that Brexit has happened, and let's get on with life,"" said former French security adviser Francois Heisbourg, chairman of think-tank IISS.The move coincides with plans by Franco-German-led Airbus to shake up its UK management. Airbus Group UK President Paul Kahn is leaving as part of wider plans to shed management layers, Airbus said this week.Government affairs chief Katherine Bennett will run the Toulouse-based company's UK arm as senior vice president.Officially, the changes are nothing to do with Brexit. A top executive in Spain is also leaving the slimmed-down firm.But the four-nation giant is aware of the intense focus on Britain's role in flagship European ventures, while Airbus remains represented at more senior levels in France and Germany.""You couldn't say there is no link to Brexit,"" a person familiar with the process said.The industry's ADS lobby, of which Kahn remains president, says aerospace and defense support 363,000 direct jobs in Britain and has warned against a 'hard Brexit' that could see trade tariffs and restrictions on movements of workers. Airbus alone employs 12,000 in Britain where it builds wings for jetliners and campaigned to keep the country in the EU. Although Bennett will report directly to CEO Tom Enders, Kahn's departure after three years deprives Britain of a strong voice inside Europe's largest aerospace group, insiders said.DRIP FEEDThe reshaping of Airbus's UK presence does not end there.Industry sources say civil planemaking operations chief Tom Williams is unlikely to be replaced when he eventually retires, leaving a significant gap in the firm's UK profile.Williams, who turns 65 on Friday, is Airbus's ""national representative"" to Britain on key matters and has warned the country is entering a ""dangerous phase"" over Brexit. No departure date has been set for one of Britain's top industrial managers.Airbus declined to comment.In the long term, Britain faces competition for wings production when design starts on the next generation of Airbus jets next decade. Germany and Spain both want the work.For now, the chill toward Britain is felt mainly though a drip feed of small changes, though these collectively represent what one insider called an ""insidious"" threat to UK relevance.Britain will have less responsibility for Europe's Galileo satellite program. Some R&D work has been removed from British universities. And plans for a small but symbolic ""Cyber Lab"" at Airbus in Britain have been shelved.""You are less likely to see UK leadership of projects with continental content. There will still be UK content but more likely under French or German leadership,"" one source said.That partially reverses the trend of recent years with rotary wing research placed in Britain after Airbus recently won a major military services contract.Supporters say Britain remains attractive for investment, with public funding for new technologies and a weaker pound offsetting uncertainty over Brexit.Asked whether she feared a stronger Franco-German defense axis leaving Britain in the cold, Defence Procurement Minister Harriet Baldwin told Reuters: ""Far from it ... We are very happy with how things are going with our European friends and allies.""Senior commentators are worried about the health of Britain's industrial base, however, especially if it fails to win a place in the planned Franco-German fighter program.""...you have a certain critical mass of design and development engineers and if they are not fed with noble work they will dissipate over time,"" said defense and aerospace consultant Brian Burridge, ex-commander of UK forces in Iraq.He likened this to years of under-investment in nuclear power stations, which saw Britain turn to foreign partners.""Just as we saw in our nuclear power-generation industry: if suddenly, for strategic reasons, you want to change your indigenous sovereign capability that would be very difficult.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

598,"Jul 18, 2017 06:49PM ET",United Airlines posts higher passenger unit revenue,nan,"By Alana WiseNEW YORK (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) said on Tuesday passenger unit revenue rose 2.1 percent in the second quarter, but unit operating costs, excluding fuel, rose more than 3 percent as rising labor costs weighed on the industry.The No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic outperformed analysts' expectations on key financial metrics, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, versus analysts' consensus forecast of $2.67.Excluding special charges, United posted net income of $846 million and a pretax margin of 13.2 percent.The solid financial results for the period ended on June 30 came despite consumer outrage over an April incident in which a paying passenger was dragged off a United flight.The company eventually settled with the passenger for an undisclosed amount and promised changes to company policy in hopes of winning back goodwill.In the second-quarter report, United posted a 79 percent decline in the number of passengers involuntarily denied boarding in May and an 88 percent drop in June, following the uproar over the dragged passenger.The airline performed better than expected on revenue, pulling in $10 billion, up 6.4 percent year over year, versus analysts' consensus of $9.97 billion.Despite gains in several measures, United shares fell in after-hours trading as much as 3.5 percent. Airline shares were down industry-wide at market close. United also said on Tuesday it would delay taking four Airbus A350 jets from 2018 and it would accelerate its order of 12 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max aircraft into 2019 and two Boeing 787-10 aircraft within 2019. United's deferral of the four A350s marks another blow for the Airbus (PA:AIR) jetliner designed to challenge Boeing's carbon-fiber composite 787 Dreamliner. It comes after Qatar Airways canceled four A350 orders earlier this month, citing delivery delays. Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said in May it would put off taking delivery of 10 A350s. Despite its deferrals, Delta still took delivery of its first A350 earlier this month, and it will be the first North American airline to operate the new jet later this year. The A350 will mainly fly on routes between the United States and Asia, replacing older Boeing 747 aircraft, Delta said. The Qatar Airways decision meant Airbus would need to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is weak.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

602,"Jul 15, 2017 07:40AM ET",Austrian lawmaker files charges against Daimler over Eurofighter,nan,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Green party lawmaker Peter Pilz has filed a complaint with Vienna prosecutors against  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), alleging deception and serious fraud linked to business deals that accompanied the country's 2003 purchase of Eurofighter jets.Vienna prosecutors are already conducting a fraud investigation into the Eurofighter consortium and Airbus (PA:AIR), then called EADS, of which Daimler was the parent company when the $2 billion fighter jet order was agreed 14 years ago. Daimler on Saturday rejected the new charges.Airbus and the consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), have also denied the accusations.Pilz, who has campaigned for years over the side deals, now wants prosecutors also to open a probe into Daimler.""As a result of years of research, we filed legal charges against Daimler,"" said Pilz, confirming an earlier report by German weekly Der Spiegel. The complaint, seen by Reuters, was jointly filed with another Green lawmaker. A spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutors on Saturday could neither confirm nor deny the complaint and said she would know more on Monday. Pilz said they had ""a seamless chain of evidence"" to prove that Daimler deceived the Austrian Economy Ministry about side deals intended to boost the local economy that were required by Austria to agree the purchase.He alleges many of the projects were already in progress but were presented by parties tendering for the fighter jet contract as though they were new.Daimler company spokeswoman Ute Wueest von Vellberg said the criminal charges were unfounded. ""The appointment of Austrian companies by Daimler AG and the cooperation with EADS were legal,"" she said in an emailed statement.So called offset-deals are common practice in big international defense orders to provide work for local businesses to let them benefit. Austria had required business deals worth 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion), or more than double the purchase price. The volume was reduced to 3.5 billion euros in a 2007 settlement agreement. The deals had to be approved by Austria's Economy Ministry.Offset obligations are typically met through projects that are pitched by a company – everything from investing in a local factory, to passing on proprietary technical information to drumming up tourism for the country. The lawmakers' move comes only days after a parliamentary inquiry into how the business contracts were awarded ended. A final report is expected next week.

606,"Jul 12, 2017 07:52AM ET",Trump and Macron may not be an odd couple after all,nan,"By John Irish and Ayesha RascoePARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's relationship with Emmanuel Macron got off to an awkward start, with a jaw-clenching handshake at a summit in Brussels before the French president rebuked the U.S. leader for his stance on climate change. The two men would appear to have little in common. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to ""make America great again"" who is unpredictable on foreign policy. Macron, 39, is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations.Trump's visit to Paris this week, to celebrate 100 years since U.S. troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain, follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world's major economies at a G20 summit last weekend.In Paris, Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors. Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport, and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship.Trump could use a friend overseas. His preference for a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U.S. president appearing isolated among world leaders. ""Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don't like, such as on climate, but we can deal with it in two ways: we can say, 'We are not going to talk to you,' or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,"" government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI. ""Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand.""POLITICAL OUTSIDERSTrump and Macron are political outsiders, the American a real estate mogul, his French counterpart a former investment banker. Both love a good deal, demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions, and have a penchant for showmanship.Like Macron, Trump will be looking for common ground.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Trump and Macron enjoyed a ""great"" relationship.""You know, Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same,"" Cohn said.Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy. Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy. He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as ""a long bilateral meeting between the two men"".Having reshaped their countries' political landscapes, both now have certain shared objectives, making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority.It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran, possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress that might derail a 9.5 billion euro ($10.9 billion) gas pipe project in which France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) has a stake.The United States and France hold differing views on Iran.On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. During the U.S. presidential race, he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, branding it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"".So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and automobile manufacturers  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to sign initial deals.'A WIN-WIN FOR BOTH'Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France's former monarchy, Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees.For Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction.""The visit is a win-win for both,"" said one French diplomat. ""Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys. Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no-fuss picture with the leader of the 'free world'"".Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner, French diplomats said. Moreover, he senses an opportunity to sway U.S. thinking and elevate the role of France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East, they added.France is the second-biggest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State.It is one reason, the diplomats say, that in his first two months as president, Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin, just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him.""The Russians are pleased to have a grown-up to talk to in Europe,"" a second French diplomat said.Daniel Fried, an expert on U.S.-European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself. ""By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

608,"Jul 07, 2017 08:56AM ET",Austria plans to end Eurofighter program early amid row with Airbus,nan,"By Shadia NasrallaVIENNA (Reuters) - Austria plans to end its Eurofighter jet program early and replace it with a cheaper alternative fleet of aircraft bought or leased from another government, its defense minister said on Friday, amid a legal battle over the jets with Airbus (PA:AIR).Austria sued Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium, including Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to a near 2 billion euro ($2.3 billion) jet order in 2003. Airbus and the consortium have denied the accusations.The charges were the latest in a series of rows between Austria and the consortium, which have sparked two parliamentary inquiries and resulted in Airbus boss Tom Enders being investigated by Vienna prosecutors.The defense ministry said in a statement that Austria's 15 Eurofighter jets could be phased out from 2020. The continued use of the Eurofighter planes for 30 years - the normal life span of such jets - would cost up to 5 billion euros, largely for maintenance.Buying and operating a new fleet comprised of 15 single-seater and three twin-seater supersonic jets over the same period could be 2 billion euros cheaper than continuing its current program, the ministry added.""It is necessary to get a grip on the overflowing costs of the Eurofighter,"" Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said.A source at the ministry was confident existing maintenance contracts with Airbus for the Eurofighters could be renegotiated. Doskozil said some kind of compensation for its Eurofighters was ""likely"" to come from the court battle. Alternatively, the aircraft or parts could be sold.Airbus and Eurofighter said in emailed statements: ""it is not for us to comment"" on Austrian defense procurement discussions, adding the Eurofighter ""works very well for all other customers"".Doskozil said the plan had nothing to do with campaigning ahead of Austrian elections in October and that he expected it to go ahead even if there was a change in government. TALKS UNDERWAYThe defense ministry said it had already been in touch with other governments, air forces and aircraft producers. It prefers a government-to-government deal that would see Vienna lease or buy aircraft from another country, rather than organizing a tender that would take longer and might jeopardize the 2020-2023 timeframe for the change of fleet.Such a government-to-government deal could involve the other country buying supersonic jets from one of its national producers whose planes have self-defense systems, radar-guided missiles and can operate at night. The head of export and international relations at Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), Joakim Wallin, said the FMV supplied Austria last month with pricing and technical information about 18 Saab (ST:SAABb) JAS Gripen fighter jets.""We expect to hear from them again after the summer,"" Wallin told Reuters, referring to a potential deal that could see Saab sell the planes to the FMV which would sell them to Austria. He declined to give details on the price quoted.Austria has also spoken with U.S. officials about its interest in the U.S.-built F-16 fighter jet, made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), the largest arms maker in the world, according to a source familiar with the matter.Lockheed is still offering the F-16 in international competitions, although production is due to end, the source said. It would take about three years to start delivering aircraft, or about two years after a contract was signed, the source added.The tranche 1 type of the Eurofighter jets which Austria uses is also in operation in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

610,"Jul 06, 2017 02:29PM ET",$1 billion headache for Airbus as Qatar cancels four jets,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Qatar Airways has axed orders for four A350s because of delivery delays, Airbus said on Thursday, handing the European planemaker a new headache over what to do with jets worth $1.2 billion at list prices as it tries to close a sales gap with rival Boeing.The decision means Airbus (PA:AIR) will have to try to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is softening, and could cost Airbus $60-80 million to rip out and replace interiors designed to fit the airline's plush brand.""Smart players are not going to rush in, because other cancellations or deferrals may come,"" said veteran aircraft financier Bertrand Grabowski, former board member at DVB Bank.The cancellation follows concerns about delays and quality problems on cabin equipment for the A350, but also comes at a time when Qatar is entering the second month of a crisis caused by a ban on Qatar's use of the airspace of four Arab nations. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said earlier any delays were the planemaker's responsibility.""We are asking Airbus to deliver it faster,"" he told a Dublin news conference. ""The delay is from Airbus."" An Airbus spokesman said the cancellations were related to ""known supply chain issues"". Asked what would happen to the undelivered A350-900 jets, he said: ""They will be reallocated"".Qatar Airways has a reputation for being demanding when reviewing aircraft for quality defects before delivery. However, some analysts have said the Gulf political crisis may give the airline a further incentive to slow deliveries, compounding the impact of relatively weak oil prices.""All the Gulf carriers realize they have ordered too many wide-bodied aircraft and don't have room for them, especially now,"" said an aircraft finance industry official.Al Baker last month denied the Gulf spat would interfere with Qatar Airways' growth or aircraft deliveries.FIGHTBACK VS BOEINGThe Qatar setback extends a torrid week for Airbus as it tries to bounce back against a resurgent Boeing (N:BA) and shake off an internal row over a shake-up in its sales organization.The surprise decision to have the sales team report to Chief Executive Tom Enders and by-pass airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, first reported by Reuters, raised hackles internally and prompted concerns about a power battle.Enders on Wednesday defended the decision, saying it was about freeing his no.2 to focus on core operations.The Airbus sales force has been urged not to dwell on the reorganization and to push back ""aggressively"" against Boeing which won the Paris Airshow for the first time in five years.Sales chief John Leahy, who plans to retire this year, has also warned staff that Airbus faces a stronger and ""much more aggressive"" competitor, people familiar with the matter said.Airbus took 248 orders between January and June, or 203 after cancellations. As of June 27, Boeing had notched up 407 orders this year, or 361 after cancellations. On Wednesday, China signed a deal to buy 140 Airbus jets.Leahy, who will report to Enders for a few months before handing to his designated successor Kiran Rao, also delivered an internal tribute to Bregier, saying ""he helped us win"".Bregier, whose reign as head of the planemaking business has coincided with the sale of 5,800 jets, has urged staff to remain focused on customers and pledged to do the same in his new role.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

611,"Jul 05, 2017 04:30PM ET",Airbus pushes for stake in U.S.-led German helicopter project,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBUECKEBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Airbus urged the German government on Wednesday to ensure domestic firms get a big share of a near 4-billion-euro contract earmarked for the country's next generation of heavy-lift military helicopters.German defense officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of the two biggest U.S. weapons makers -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA).Airbus officials say they do not have a helicopter large enough for Germany's likely military's needs, but want to take a close look at the requirements when they are released by the defense ministry, a move that could occur next year.Europe's biggest aerospace company and seven German firms including engine maker MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) said on Wednesday they had teamed up to push for a management and maintenance role in the project.""This is about the future of the German helicopter industry,"" Wolfgang Schroder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland (PA:AIR), told Reuters at a helicopter conference in northern Germany.The Defense Ministry has proposed spending 3.84 billion euros ($4.35 billion) for the project through to 2029, although the program must still be approved by parliament.The German firms want the ministry to split the procurement of the helicopters from the work of certifying, managing and maintaining the new aircraft that will go on for decades.This program is ""too big for Germany industry not to be involved,"" Airbus's Stefan Woelfle told military officials and industry executives at the conference.""There's nothing else on the horizon,"" Schroder said, noting that German law did not require a specific amount of German content on major weapons systems, and that many German firms in the sector had been hit hard in recent years by a drop in demand linked to declining oil prices.'NOTHING RULED OUT'Airbus and Boeing worked together for five years on a possible heavy-lift helicopter but dropped their plans in 2012 after realizing the effort would be too costly. Boeing's CH-47 Chinook, already used by eight other NATO countries, will now square off against Lockheed's Sikorsky CH-53K, a redesigned version of the CH-53G that Germany now flies and which the U.S. Marine Corps plans to start using in combat in 2019.Senior executives from both firms attended the conference.Wednesday's surprise announcement by Airbus follows talks between U.S. and German firms, and reflects growing concerns in German industry about how much work would be left for them.Boeing and Lockheed already work closely with German industry and have said they would seek to form partnerships to build and maintain a future German helicopter.If the ministry decided to award a single contract that included procurement and system maintenance, then Airbus would have to look for a partner and negotiate good terms, but it could also consider submitting a bid of its own, Schroder said.He said Airbus could bid as a prime contractor, offering a U.S.-made helicopter made by a partner, though any future moves would depend on the terms of the contract.""I'm not ruling anything out,"" he said.

613,"Jul 05, 2017 09:16AM ET",Airbus signs deal to sell 140 planes worth $23 billion to China,nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has signed an agreement to sell 140 aircraft to China, it said on Wednesday, in a deal worth almost $23 billion at list prices.The agreement, signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Germany, is for 100 A320 family aircraft and 40 A350 planes, Airbus said.""It's one of the biggest deals that we've signed in a long time,"" Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders told journalists after signing the deal in Berlin.The planes will be purchased by state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, which will then allocate them to Chinese airlines.The A320 planes will be a mixture of the older CEO and the new NEO version with revamped engines, while the majority of the A350 orders are for the -900 model. The deal is flexible pending negotiations with the airlines.Enders said he expected up to 50 percent of the A320 family planes would come from the Airbus final assembly line in China. Enders was making his first public appearance since Airbus rolled out a new structure, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, changes which included a shift in the reporting line for its commercial sales team to Enders.Enders said the shift in reporting lines for the sales team reflected the fact that commercial aircraft head Fabrice Bregier had been given more tasks in his new role as group-wide chief operating officer. With orders slowing and the focus shifting to the backlog, Enders said the shake-up allows Bregier to concentrate on deliveries.""This is merely a burden sharing mechanism because the focus should be on execution and this is what it's all about,"" Enders said. ""We have plenty of challenges on the execution side, be it the transition to the NEO, the ramp-up of the A320 family, the 350 family, not to mention the A400M, which is not entirely solved,"" he said. Enders also said the group was in talks with the Chinese over the A380 superjumbo, which has suffered slow sales.""It won't happen overnight.

614,"Jul 03, 2017 08:59AM ET",Airbus unveils leaner structure and sales shake-up,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) rolled out a leaner new structure on Monday, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, and including a shift in the reporting line for its key commercial sales team to group CEO Tom Enders. That move, which confirmed a Reuters report, raised concerns among some insiders and customers about a possible power struggle with long-standing airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, though Airbus denied any tensions. Cementing changes first outlined last year, the ""one Airbus"" reorganization involves a single headquarters in Toulouse, France, with Bregier confirmed as group-wide chief operating officer and president of commercial aircraft.""We need to become more integrated, more collaborative and less bureaucratic for speedier decision-making and execution,"" Enders said in a letter to employees.The revamp, which saves hundreds of millions of euros in overheads, is designed to complete a decade-long drive to turn the former European consortium - with a history of strong French and German government influence - into a more normal company, and prepare for digital innovations sweeping through industry.But in an unexpected adjustment reported by Reuters on Friday, Airbus said its commercial sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jet market with Boeing (N:BA), would now report directly to Enders and by-pass Bregier. That decision is seen as sensitive because it revisits a power-sharing deal between the German Enders and Frenchman Bregier that initially gave the latter responsibility over all planemaking activities.Enders said in his commercial aircraft role, Bregier would lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality. ""However, due to the heavy operational challenges in our largest revenue-driving business, and to slightly rebalance our internal burden-sharing, I will lead sales and marketing,"" he said in his letter.The decision sent tremors though the commercial arm and raised questions over the future of Bregier, an industrial and marketing heavyweight whose ties to Enders are seen as key to Airbus's ability to smooth output and face a resurgent Boeing.""People are very surprised. There is no doubt that this is an important step,"" a person close to the company said.A jet financier expressed ""surprise"" at the move, given well-established relations between many airlines and Bregier.Other critics said the sudden move reflected a heavy-handed new management style or risked being perceived as a weakening of French interests.""It is creating a culture in which people will go back to 'Germans versus French' and people having to choose which camp they are in. It is not good for morale or the culture of the company,"" said a person with detailed knowledge of the group.An Airbus spokesman called it a routine internal matter of reporting lines, as with any normal company.POLITICAL TESTThe new structure comes almost 10 years to the day after leaders of France and Germany agreed in Toulouse to abolish a system of dual control over the company, with the CEO role shared between two people, one French and one German.Enders had to wait another five years to become sole CEO of the group and another year beyond that to reduce the political influence of French and German government shareholders. Both now own 11 percent but their power is limited under a 2013 overhaul.Analysts say Paris and Berlin have generally had their attention elsewhere during the euro zone crisis but that their hands-off approach remains to be tested against a recently softening market for jets, with thousands of jobs at stake.Airbus also faces a raft of politically charged decisions, such as how long to keep building its slow-selling A380 or its response to corruption probes in Britain, France and Austria.Despite resisting interference, Enders appeared to recognize the significance of French politics to Airbus by writing a letter of support in the familiar 'tu' form to then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, which many in Paris saw as a gaffe.Enders is, however, convinced Airbus has to find a new agility to cope with the way 'Big Data' and simultaneous breakthroughs in other technologies are creating opportunities for newcomers such as U.S. rocket maker SpaceX.He acknowledged the new reorganization, which unions say could affect over 1,000 jobs, would be ""uncomfortable"" for some.But he told staff Airbus was ""waving goodbye to an era in which a return to 'stability' was a realistic aspiration"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

615,"Jun 30, 2017 07:17AM ET",'Bad' foreign firms drive U.S. manufacturing jobs revival,nan,"By Lesley Wroughton and Howard SchneiderSPARTANBURG/CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - Years before Donald Trump began promising to bring back good manufacturing jobs by getting tough with U.S. trade partners, such jobs have already been on the rise, largely thanks to foreign companies now cast as villains in Trump's narrative.Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2sWkzTB)Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump's way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOYThe courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (PA:AIR) plant in Mobile, Alabama. Few places highlight the gap between Trump's rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map. ""The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,"" McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW's newest X3 sports utility vehicle.Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.But the poster child of South Carolina's success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW's plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump's ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was ""very bad"" on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg. “We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,"" Oliver Zipse, BMW's board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ""We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.” The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ""America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.DOOMSDAY SCENARIO""Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don't tear it up,"" Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. ""We're going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less."" Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina's once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP).The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.Mercedes-Benz, part of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a ""doomsday scenario"" for the region.""This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don't understand the ramifications.""(1 euro = $1.1350)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

616,"Jun 30, 2017 06:54AM ET",Exclusive: Airbus CEO Enders to take control of plane sales in new shake-up,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is launching a reorganization of its commercial aircraft sales operations in a move likely to focus fresh attention on a delicate balance of power at Europe's largest aerospace company, people familiar with the situation said.From July, the globe-trotting sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jetliner market with Boeing (NYSE:BA), will report directly to Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, bypassing commercial aircraft president Fabrice Bregier, the people said.A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment.The surprise move, announced at a management dinner on Thursday, is part of a wider effort to streamline the company by uniting the headquarters with its dominant civil planemaking business, giving substance to a recent internal merger.But it is likely to raise questions about the coherence of the commercial planemaking operations and could revive speculation over the future of Frenchman Bregier, who has run the world's second-largest civil planemaker since 2012.The issue is not one of differing strategies, but the way responsibility is divided inside a company straining to keep a lid on tensions amid recent industrial and regulatory problems.Absorbing commercial sales, the powerful driver of Airbus's growth in past decades, will strengthen German-born Enders' grip on civil operations, which provide 74 percent of revenue.Bregier and Enders have long been rivals but had reached what was widely seen as a peace deal over the internal merger. Bregier stepped aside from his role as chief executive of the Airbus civil business as Airbus combined with Airbus Group (PA:AIR).But he remained in charge of the planemaking business as its president, while also becoming Enders' official no. 2 and chief operating officer of the overall group, now renamed Airbus.The decision to shift sales from Bregier's direct control raises uncertainty over the stability of the management deal and steers him toward a purely industrial role, a position the 56-year-old former missiles CEO is unlikely to relish indefinitely.Bregier could not be reached for comment.Sources caution it is too early to talk about a repeat of Franco-German tensions that rocked the group over a decade ago.But any instability among top management would come at a sensitive time for Airbus as the company wrestles with supplier delays, growing concerns over A350 quality problems and an aggressive new marketing stance at rival Boeing.A senior company source said the shake-up was driven by ""heavy operational challenges"" and would ""better balance the internal burden sharing"" as Airbus becomes a normal company after ridding itself of complex internal structures this year.INERTIAThe shake-up comes as John Leahy, who propelled Airbus to equal status with Boeing, prepares to retire after 23 years running sales. He is expected to hand over to his designated internal successor, Kiran Rao, later this year.Whispers of a shake-up partly explain a sense of inertia as Airbus lost on orders to Boeing at last week's Paris Airshow.Although it won more orders than expected, many delegates said Airbus failed to display its usual self-confidence and agility as Boeing executed a polished new airplane launch.""Everybody feels lost (at Airbus),"" one delegate said.The company has also been thrown off balance by British and French investigations into the use of middlemen in plane sales and a widening Austrian probe into a fighter sale.The chief executive of an aircraft buyer said Airbus was slower to react than before due to new internal processes.The challenge under the new structure will be to recapture momentum while separating sales from core industrial operations, which have emerged as a key priority to fulfill record orders.By contrast, the sales teams for helicopters and defense will continue to report to the heads of those units.Bregier has taken an increasingly high-profile role in sales campaigns, forging relationships in Japan and elsewhere. He has been credited with improving Airbus's industrial performance, but has recently been distracted by delays at key suppliers.Enders overhauled Airbus's strategy after a failed defense merger in 2012 and has become a leading advocate for exploiting 'Big Data' to reshape the industry. But industry sources say he is less well known for a 'hands-on' approach to operations. Speaking to media earlier this month, he praised ""much flatter"" management structures and said ""old-style command and control"" was ill-suited to the pace of change in a digital era.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

617,"Jun 23, 2017 12:50PM ET",Are you being served? Planemakers alter sales pitch to boost profit,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Victoria BryanPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing leave this week's Paris Airshow with plans for ambitious growth in aviation services, as flattening demand for new jets and pressure to raise profit margins encourages planemakers to deepen their exposure to airline operations.The two largest planemakers set out their stalls at the world's biggest air show in a series of announcements that could set them in competition with some of their suppliers and even some of the airlines that have ordered jets in recent years.The overlap reflects the complexity of the aviation market as it matures, leaving a large fleet of aircraft to service or upgrade and tens of thousands of people to train - all services that could in turn become tools to help sell even more jets.""Many customers are now looking for fixed cost per flight hour with assured outcomes on part availability. It is the (airline) CFO's dream to get costs out and management risks under a third party,"" Stan Deal, head of Boeing's newly created global services division, told Reuters.""The future state we want to get to is that we can support every element of a day of operations on the airplane.""For years, air shows were all about ""moving the metal,"" winning as many orders as possible.Orders are still buzzing, but higher-margin services have taken a prime time slot for the first time with a volley of announcements from each company.""Would you imagine having your Mercedes car without the associated services? It makes no sense,"" said Laurent Martinez, head of 'Services by Airbus'.""We are definitely the best placed to serve our aircraft because we know the aircraft nose to tail,"" he told Reuters.Boeing's (N:BA) newest division starts up on July 1 with a mandate to roughly triple Boeing's commercial and defense services to $50 billion in 10-15 years. The existing commercial unit will also keep its own services sales team to support the effort.Airbus (PA:AIR) said the worldwide aftermarket services business for jetliners will double to $3.2 trillion over the next 20 years. The overall services market is worth an estimated $100 billion a year: almost as much as building and selling jets but yielding fatter margins.""We are definitely on a major growth plan,"" Martinez told Reuters. ""In 2017, we will see double-digit growth.""ACQUISITIONSBoth companies are ready to look at modest acquisitions to expand their services businesses.""I would characterize them as bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate our position in the market,"" Deal said.Competitors include the major maintenance and repair organizations (MRO) such as Air France Industrie (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa Technik (DE:LHAG), though there are partnerships with such firms too.""The market is growing fast. ... We see more and more airlines that are concentrating on their core business and want to have all their operations subcontracted,"" Martinez said.Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) , which had selected Boeing over Lufthansa Technik to maintain its fleet in Boeing's biggest commercial services deal last year, returned to the show to sign a new deal for Boeing to take charge of flight training.As fleets age, upgrades are lucrative too. United Parcel  Service (N:UPS) last month signed a deal with Airbus and Honeywell (N:HON) to upgrade the cockpits on 52 elderly A300-600 freighters, and arrived in Paris this week with a deal for Boeing to convert three second-hand 767 jetliners to freighters.Powering the expansion in services is a transformation in the way data can be used to connect aircraft, pepper them with sensors and predict upcoming maintenance problems.Airbus launched such a platform with four airlines, powered by analytics firm Palantir Technologies.""We are able to define the weak signals for components and ... change the component before it fails. This is the future of maintenance,"" Martinez said.Data can also be used to optimize a flight trajectory, saving fuel by 1-2 percent, Airbus said. Boeing offers to manage airlines' fuel demands, even if their jets were made by Airbus.In a further step, services are being baked into the way planes like Boeing's proposed mid-market jet are designed.The switch demands a different culture from the measured, highly regulated process of building a plane for public transport. That will stay in place wherever safety is an issue.""Part of standing it up separately (as a new services division) is to break the shackles of that, recognizing that we are going to be a fast-paced innovator with short sprints of incremental innovation and some big-bang innovation,"" Deal said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But they warned of massive hurdles, including bickering among European states and companies, the troubled history of past joint projects such as the A400M military transport plane, and the sheer cost of developing advanced military aircraft.Any project is likely to cost far more than the 10 billion-plus euros sunk into the Eurofighter, the last joint fighter built, at a time when Europe is grappling with other expensive problems such as increased Islamist militancy and the influx of well over a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa.Yet EU politicians are determined to increase cooperation on defense and security, and wary of effectively leaving the fighter jet market to the United States. ""It's the same with food. Some things you have to be able to do yourself,"" Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the European Parliament and chair of the parliament's Sky & Space Intergroup, told Reuters during a visit to the A400M at the air show.Germany, which has begun early work on a next-generation fighter, last month asked the United States for a classified briefing on the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), as it prepares for a more intense look at fighter options after the Sept. 24 election. The F-35, which showed off its moves during its premiere at the Paris show, is being bought in Europe by Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Turkey. Finland, Switzerland and Spain have also expressed interest.Buying the F-35 would help improve Germany's ability to fight with key allies, but could prove politically difficult in a country with strong labor unions eager to safeguard jobs.Corporate rivalries add another level of complexity.CORPORATE BATTLELINES""We are already working on the Next Generation Weapon System, which has been initiated by Germany but with strong interest from Spain and other nations, as part of a bigger concept of future combat systems including unmanned aircraft,"" Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft at Airbus (PA:AIR), told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. ""And I very much hope that we will see France involved in that because it is clearly very much in all our interest to see a common solution,"" he added. Airbus represents Germany and Spain in the maturing Eurofighter program, which also includes Britain through BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy via Leonardo (MI:LDOF).France, however, dropped out of that project early on due to disagreements over the sharing out of work, with its Dassault Aviation (PA:DAST) going on to develop the Rafale fighter jet.Airbus is pressing Dassault to join in this time instead of forcing Britain to choose a preferred continental partner.It is also unclear what role, if any, Sweden's SAAB (ST:SAABb) might play. SAAB builds the Gripen fighter, which is in use in Sweden, South Africa and Hungary, among others.One French diplomat said it was clear no one European nation could develop a new combat jet in the current environment. ""Those days are over. Period,"" the diplomat said.Even the United States' F-35 was developed with funds from Britain and other countries.Volker Thum, managing director of the German Aerospace Industries Association, said Franco-German cooperation was a ""key driver for the urgently needed agreement"" on the project. He said new President Emmanuel Macron's arrival at the air show on an A400M signaled his commitment to European cooperation.Airbus's Alonso said this month that upgrades and modernization would keep the Eurofighter flying into the 2040s, and possibly longer, but older warplanes like the pan-European Tornado and Spain's F/A-18s would soon need to be replaced, with buyers likely to want the latest technology and capabilities.Given the costs and timescale involved, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the need to get started on ""an indigenous homegrown alternative to the F-35"" was one of the biggest defense issues facing Europe. But Brexit and disagreements among remaining EU members made him skeptical. ""The odds are they probably won't get their act together,"" he said, citing historical angst about military issues in Germany, Europe's largest economy, and Britain's increasing focus on U.S. ties.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

620,"Jun 22, 2017 04:00PM ET",Airbus' Leahy reveals negotiating tricks after 'last air show',nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) sales chief John Leahy, one of the dominant figures of modern aviation, hinted on Thursday he would retire this autumn, as he wrapped up what he said would be his last air show by revealing a few precious negotiating tricks. The 67-year-old New Yorker, who has overseen the sale of more than 10,000 aircraft worth $1 trillion since 1994, has said he plans to retire by end-year. But he went a step further on Thursday as he ruled out going to the Dubai Airshow in November.He pledged to ensure a smooth transition to his designated internal successor, Kiran Rao.""We want to have a smooth transition with Kiran and the team. We don't want people sitting around the canteen trying to figure out 'what does this mean for me'?""After suffering a rare air show defeat at the hands of Boeing (NYSE:BA) in brutal heat at the Paris Airshow this week, Leahy talked about the pros and cons of a stage he has made his own.It turns out the man who has reigned supreme over air shows for more than 20 years was never particularly fond of them.""After I retire I will not come back to an air show. I don't see any reason to do that. Air shows are hot and sometimes very wet, they can be cold and windy, they are crowded, you never have enough time for people,"" he said.""The only useful thing about an air show is that it is a deadline, a point in time. You talk to people when negotiations have been going on for months...and you say 'this is my best and final (offer); it can be announced at the air show and we have got a deal,' and they say 'no I want more',"" he said.""Then you have to say 'if you didn't get it from me during the air show, what makes you think you are going to get it from me the week after it?' So it becomes a deadline: that is about the only use I see in air shows.""Most often, the recipe seems to work. Insiders say talks can and often do drag through the night, with barely time to change before a morning press conference, such as a $14 billion deal with Wizz Air over ordered-in pizza that stole the last Paris Airshow from Boeing in 2015.Now, Boeing is on the offensive and won this year's biennial event, thanks to the launch of a new model and the apparently deliberate spacing of air show announcements to keep up a drumbeat that put Airbus under pressure from day one.Industry watchers said those techniques are directly out of the Leahy playbook, but this time they worked for his rival.Asked whether he thought Boeing had borrowed his air show strategy, he said, ""Yes, very much so.""But asked earlier if Airbus had lost momentum, Leahy said orders had been expected to be lower this year.Boeing's recently appointed sales chief Ihssane Mounir paid tribute to the man he had just out-competed for air show orders.""I have nothing but respect for John Leahy. He is an icon in the industry and has been instrumental in the success Airbus has had over the years,"" Mounir told Reuters.Although silver-tongued in public and always ready to snap into salesman mode, Leahy is surprisingly reluctant to talk about himself, but retains a lightning return of serve.Asked to describe his greatest achievement, he countered, ""Keeping my cool with reporters"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

621,"Jun 22, 2017 02:20PM ET","Beyond air show, newcomers challenge Airbus-Boeing duopoly",nan,"By Matthias Blamont and Victoria BryanPARIS (Reuters) - This year's Paris Air Show was dominated by the annual order battle between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), but industry executives said the duopoly will be forced to share the stage at future shows as newcomers from Russia, China and Japan muscle into the passenger plane market. Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp (T:7011) brought its MRJ regional jet to Europe for the first time during the air show. China and Russia carried out maiden flights of new narrow-body aircraft last month in their bids to enter the $100 billion-plus annual aerospace market. The two countries have also set up a joint venture to build wide-body jets to challenge incumbents.Consultants Alix Partners estimates that of the current order backlog of around 13,000 planes, about 7-8 percent are for planes from new entrants, among them Russia, China and Japan.Delegates at the show said mounting a proper challenge will take Russia and China at least a decade. The newcomers face headwinds including proving their technology, and gaining customer confidence by deploying and maintaining a quality aircraft maintenance and support network.""Overall, there are big steps not only on the product side but on the support and services side for the airlines to feel confident that they can go in and order those aircraft,"" Pascal Fabre, managing director at Alix Partners in Paris, said. However, China and Russia are large enough markets that orders from their home countries alone could propel the respective airliner ventures.Among COMAC's first customers for its C919 was China Eastern, which has ordered up to 20 planes from the Chinese manufacturer, while Aeroflot is due to take the Russian MS21.COMAC said this week total orders for the C919 stood at 600 from 24 customers.Giorgio Callegari, strategy and alliances director at Russian carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT), said people he met at the air show showed great interest in the MS21 and the Russian-China wide-body cooperation. Aeroflot is set to lease 50 MS21 planes from state defense conglomerate Rostec. ""If maybe in the past, Russian airplanes were discarded as a non-factor, they are now taken much more seriously and people can see that they are potentially a serious competitor,"" he told Reuters.The chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, said he would not have a problem buying jets from Chinese or Russian manufacturers, provided they met operational and performance requirements.BATTLE FOR THIRD SPOT Some executives at the airshow said the marketplace would eventually settle on three major manufacturers and placed their bets on China's COMAC to win that third spot.""Twenty years from now, I think there'll be the big three manufacturers of Airbus, Boeing and China,"" said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.However, Leahy said it would be hard for countries to make billions of dollars of investments over decades to get the product line and support network up to scratch.Cedric Goubet, vice president of commercial engines at  Safran  (PA:SAF), said he too is betting on the Chinese. ""My feeling is that it will be the Chinese. They have the resources, the skills, the national ambitions and a huge domestic market,"" he said, while adding that it was also crucial to get export orders. Dang Thiehong, deputy head of marketing at China's COMAC, told Reuters the aircraft market was big enough to share. ""We hope to provide our services and products to the market no matter in which part of the world,"" he said. China is crucial to the growth prospects of all the major airliner manufacturers. Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing and sales at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, cautioned against the dangers of underestimating new rivals, ""Never sell your competition short.""Japan's Mitsubishi has set its sights on the regional jet market instead of going head to head with the larger planes sold by Airbus and Boeing or rising Chinese and Russian rivals. Yugo Fukuhara, vice president sales and marketing at Mitsubishi, told Reuters, ""Our vision of this business is to become one of two major regional plane makers. We don't compete with China and Russia.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This is probably one of our busiest air shows."" Asked if Airbus had lost momentum after years in which it often trounced Boeing at annual industry gatherings, sales chief John Leahy said the slowdown in orders had been expected.""Is this a slower show than previous years? Yes, it is. Are we conceding that Boeing sold a few more airplanes than we did? Yes,"" he told a news conference.In a late flurry on Thursday morning, Airbus signed deals for almost 100 aircraft, with AirAsia and privately-owned Iranian carriers Zagros Airlines and Iran Airtour.Boeing topped up its tally by announcing a firm order for 125 737 MAX 8 airplanes with an undisclosed customer and another deal with lessor AerCap (N:AER) to convert 15 of its MAX 8 orders into the larger MAX 10. It also added a memorandum of understanding from Chinese domestic Riuli Airlines for 20 737 MAX 8 aircraft.Analyst Richard Aboulafia, of Virginia-based Teal Group, said commercial activity had been better than expected and was reminiscent of shows in 2009 and 2011, when the aircraft industry had bucked a retreating world economy.""This time we've got instability and uncertainty in many regions of the world, but airline traffic is strong, and as we've seen at this show, airlines want jets and the finance people are certainly happy to help."" Leahy said he had expected the new Boeing plane to make more of a splash. ""We had expected they would have had a bigger launch on the 737 MAX 10, not quite as many conversions, more incremental orders.""While he did not expect the MAX 10 to be a viable competitor to the A321, Leahy said the Boeing plane's launch could result in price pressure. ""They're clearly going to come after us on price.""The A321 is larger than any previous member of the 737 family, a gap that the MAX 10 is intended to close.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Any decision will be based on overall global demand, he said.He also hinted at orders for the 777 wide-body jet which faces a drop in production pending the arrival of a newer model.""There will be more 777s that we can talk about as time marches on,"" he told a news conference.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

627,"Jun 21, 2017 11:20AM ET",Airbus to fit ejectable black boxes to A350 from 2019,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) will fit ejectable flight recorders to its long-range A350 jets from 2019, meaning they could float in the event of a crash at sea, the company said on Wednesday. It will also start to fit new fixed recorders to both short-range and long-range jets that can store 25 hours of voice and data information on a single recorder. Currently, the ""black boxes"" of an aircraft are two separate recorders, one for voice and one for flight data, with the voice recording only covering two hours. The ejectable or ""deployable"" recorders would separate from the tail during a crash and float, emitting a distress signal. Flight recorders at present emit acoustic signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams fewer than three weeks to locate them in what can be deep waters.Recommended by investigators after an Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, the idea came to the fore after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in March 2014, for which the recorders still have not been found.The new ejectable recorder, which Airbus calls the Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (ADFR), is made by L3 Technologies (N:LLL) and can record up to 25 hours of voices from the cockpit and flight data. The ejectable black box is also aimed at the other longer-range planes made by Airbus such as the A321LR, the A330 and the A380. The long-range planes would have both an ejectable and fixed recorder, while short-haul aircraft from the A320 family will be fitted with two of the fixed recorders, Airbus said.However, some in the industry have expressed doubts over ejectable black boxes, saying they could deploy accidentally, while others have said they would prefer live streaming of data.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Industry watchers said the veteran Airbus sales chief could pull off a signature last-minute deal to avoid an unusual defeat at the European company's home event.Leahy took issue with claims by Boeing (N:BA) that the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is 5 percent more efficient to operate than the Airbus A321neo, which has outsold the smaller 737 MAX 9 by about four to one.""I am getting to the point where I may run my Pinocchio ad again with the stuff they are saying,"" Leahy said, referring to an advertising war between Airbus and Boeing in 2012 over conflicting claims on jet performance.RESALE VALUESBoeing says the 737 MAX 10 is a lighter plane with a longer wing, making it more efficient. Airbus says the A321neo has a larger and more efficient engine, giving it an advantage.Boeing's development chief said on Tuesday Airbus marketing risked ignoring the ""physics of the universe"".Leahy also said Boeing was putting some of its own sales at risk, rather than denting interest in the A321neo.""I don’t think we have a real competitor to worry about there.

However, Airbus immediately hit back with an order for 100 of its popular A320neo planes from leasing company GECAS, as well as a deal for 12 A321neos with Air Lease Corporation.Airbus sales chief John Leahy brushed off the latest Boeing challenge, saying that much of the interest in the MAX 10 was from existing Boeing customers switching orders from other models. ""We think the 737 MAX 10 is a competitor to the (MAX) 9 and that's why a lot of people are converting,"" he said.Twenty of SpiceJet's provisional order for 40 MAX 10s were conversions from an existing order for other 737 models. GECAS also converted an existing 737 order for 20 planes to the new model and Europe's largest tour operator TUI Group (DE:TUIGn) did likewise for 18 aircraft.Boeing did announce provisional new orders for 90 MAX 10s including 50 from Indonesia's Lion Air.It also won a boost from leasing giant AerCap (N:AER) for its 787 Dreamliner long-range jet, which sits in a category for which demand has been fragile over the past year.Industry sources said that Airbus would soon announce an order for 10 of its A350-900 wide-body jets from Ethiopian Airways, while it also looked set to clinch a $5 billion deal with low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru.Providing reassurance for planemakers, Qatar Airways said it was sticking with plans to increase its fleet and routes despite a diplomatic rift with four Arab nations that have closed their airspace to the company.""We have had a lot of cancellations, especially to the four countries that did this illegal blockade, but we have found new markets and this is our growth strategy,"" Chief Executive Akbar al Baker told Reuters.F-35 DEBUTWhile demand for passenger jets may be ebbing, there are signs that interest in military aircraft is picking up after years in the doldrums because of government budget cuts and weak economic growth. Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) is in the final stages of negotiating a $37 billion-plus deal to sell 440 F-35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.That would be the biggest deal yet for the stealth warplane, which is making its Paris debut this week.President Macron flew into the show aboard an Airbus A400M military transporter in his first official engagement since winning a parliamentary majority in elections on Sunday.His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, with France's aerobatic team.The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by difficulties: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future.Airbus said on Sunday that it was working on an A380 upgrade -- dubbed A380plus -- with fuel-saving wingtips, confirming plans reported by Reuters in March.Airbus chief Fabrice Bregier said on Monday that the company was in talks with several potential customers for the upgraded plane. But it would only be put into production if it received ""a large order"", he said, without elaborating.Four-engined, double-decker superjumbos such as the A380 and Boeing's 747 were once viewed as the future of air travel between international hubs, but interest has waned as airlines have preferred cheaper, more nimble aircraft.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Neither firm could be reached for comment. Apart from Monday's expected launch of a new version of Boeing's 737 MAX that could net the U.S. planemaker in the region of 150 orders, most industry analysts have muted expectations for orders going into the June 19-25 event.But there were indications on Sunday that Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) would try to pull off several surprises as they look for bragging rights at the world's largest air show.Bloomberg News reported that Ethiopian Airlines might order wide-body Airbus A350 aircraft worth $3 billion at list prices.Airbus declined to comment. Ethiopian could not be reached.Demand for long-haul, wide-body models is thin due to long waiting lists and fears of a potential glut later this decade.But Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said on Sunday he expected further demand to kick in to replace aircraft retiring in coming years.Still, this year's event will be dominated by small models.Leasing companies will be out in force as they try to pick up aircraft at competitive prices, since a multi-year boom of sales for fuel-efficient types is winding down.Industry sources say leasing companies  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) and Chinese lessor ICBC are hunting for deals and may order aircraft including Airbus A320neos. Leasing firm Avolon, another major buyer in past years, is also expected at the show.Engine makers will also be drumming up new business, with China Eastern expected to tap French-U.S. engine maker CFM International (N:GE) (PA:SAF) to provide the power for Airbus A320neos already purchased for delivery starting next year.European airlines group IAG (L:ICAG) could split an engine order to go with its new A320neo fleet, picking Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to power Airbus A320neo aircraft for its Vueling subsidiary and CFM to provide engines for British Airways.None of the companies was available for comment.Several aerospace firms are meanwhile expected to announce contracts for aftermarket services - a growing area for the industry thanks to powerful new data analytics.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The new wing design adds to other modifications presented earlier this year, including new stairways and cabin rest area to fit in more seats, with Airbus dubbing the enhanced version the ""A380plus"".Airbus announced the plan at the Paris Airshow, where it revealed the new wingtips and new ""A380plus"" branding on the fuselage and wing of an A380 belonging to the Air and Space Museum at Le Bourget airport.Reuters had previously reported the plans, which the planemaker hopes will help revive weak sales of the double-decker jet.""The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in a statement. Overall, the changes will lead to a 13 percent reduction in cost per seat compared with the current A380, Airbus said. The ""A380plus"" will also have an increased maximum take-off weight of 578 tonnes, meaning it can either carry 80 more passengers or fly a further 300 nautical miles. Airbus said it would also offer longer time between maintenance checks, meaning the plane can fly more and thus cutting maintenance costs.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

636,"Jun 15, 2017 11:04AM ET",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world's largest air show.The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing's (N:BA) most-sold airliner, the 737.The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland's Ryanair (I:RYA) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.'DIFFERENT DYNAMIC'Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (PA:AIR) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year's Farnborough Airshow in Britain.""I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,"" said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like ""predictive maintenance"" to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.""We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,"" Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.Mitsubishi's MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.""There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,"" Barrett said of the would-be challengers.In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.With the New Yorker's departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It currently only flies 189-seat 737-800s.It was not clear if a MAX 10 order would be in addition to or at least partly a substitute for the MAX 200 order for 100 planes.Talks are progressing but it also remained unclear whether a deal would be ready in time for the June 19-25 air show, one of the people said. Ryanair rarely attends such events and is expected to hold out for the best possible price before placing an order. Ryanair executives have said repeatedly in recent months that they would be interested in additional aircraft if they were available at the right price, saying the only thing curtailing faster growth was a lack of available planes.Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said in May Ryanair was talking to Boeing about opportunistically adding planes to its current order and for additional orders to cover growth from 2023 to 2028. The latest talks come as Hungarian rival Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) shifts from the 180-seat A320 to A321s which can carry up to 239 passengers and has said it hopes the larger planes will help bring its unit costs below those of Ryanair. UK budget airline easyJet (L:EZY) said in May it would take 30 Airbus A321neo jets with 235 seats from next summer, instead of 30 smaller A320neo planes, which it said would enable it to reduce costs per seat on affected trips by around 8 to 9 percent.Indonesia's Lion Air is also preparing to place an order for the 737 MAX 10, Reuters reported last week.

Britain is due to begin negotiations with the rest of the European Union about the terms of its departure in nine days time, despite Prime Minister Theresa May being weakened by losing her majority in Thursday's election.Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said a deal must allow its staff from all over the world to enter Britain easily, ensure that parts are exempt from trade tariffs and ensure certain regulatory standards are maintained. Otherwise, he said, Britain would risk losing Airbus production in the future. ""For new productions, it's very easy to have a new plant somewhere in the world. We would have plenty of offers to do that,"" Bregier said, according to the newspaper.""We want to stay in the UK — provided the conditions to work in an integrated organization are met.""May might be forced to reassess her Brexit priorities after being weakened by the election. She has previously said she wants Britain to withdraw from Europe's custom union as well as its single market. She has also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, implying she could accept tariffs on imports and exports.Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday that a ""hard Brexit"" where trade tariffs between the UK and European Union were imposed could potentially impact the competitiveness of the firm's activities in Britain.Airbus employs over 10,000 people across two plants in Britain, according to the company's website.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

642,"Jun 09, 2017 01:03PM ET","WTO largely backs Boeing in trade row, faults tax break",nan,"By Tom MilesGENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of maintaining unfair support for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), but said it had failed to withdraw a tax break in its main planemaking state that continues to cause trade fireworks.The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a U.S. tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier.The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests.It found that one U.S. subsidy program, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had ""adverse effects"", involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland.Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State.""The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding,"" the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint.""The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities,""  Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement.The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state.Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet.In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy.That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal. The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing.Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster U.S. tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

645,"Jun 09, 2017 07:43AM ET","Airbus predicts $5.3 trillion jet demand, trims traffic outlook",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 percent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the United States to dominate air travel.The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world's middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said.But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf.Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalization and a surge in private consumption.""It's the tyranny of large numbers,"" Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative.The world's second largest planemaker after Boeing (NYSE:BA) also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world's fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036.The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in.Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines.Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive.""Low-cost long-haul will work,"" he told a media briefing at the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters.TWIN-AISLE DEMANDAirbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak.A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model.Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing's proposed new mid-market jet.For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable.Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March.The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard.Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company's finance chief was also achievable.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

647,"Jun 06, 2017 12:50PM ET",Embraer's biggest passenger jet may be its best-seller,nan,"By Brad Haynes and Tim HepherCANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) - The biggest passenger jet ever made by Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) may become its top-selling model, emerging from the shadows of smaller siblings due to extra rows and big wings that have changed its economics, a senior executive told Reuters.The first generation of the 116-seat E195 was outsold more than three-to-one by the 100-seat E190, but a larger, re-engined version entering service in early 2019 as part of the so-called E2 lineup has attracted another level of interest.""It's fair to say that the E195 features heavily in almost every conversation about the E2 family,"" John Slattery, head of Embraer's commercial aviation business, said in an interview late on Monday at the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting. ""There's a distinct possibility for the E2 that the E195 outsells the E190.""The possible reversal highlights how three additional rows of seats and longer, sweeping wings have forced many airlines to take a second look at Embraer's biggest airliner, now aimed squarely at rival Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) new CSeries.For Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker after Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the E195 is the biggest change in its E2 lineup, which has focused on its core regional aviation market as Bombardier picks bigger fights.While Bombardier sells larger CSeries aircraft against the lower end of the narrowbody families built by Boeing and Airbus, Embraer has said it has no plans for passenger jets larger than the new E195.Bombardier's CSeries offers unparalleled range for an aircraft of its size, but even that advantage has shrunk as a new engine boosts the range of the E195 by some 600 miles (966 km) from the first generation.Last week Embraer extended the range of the E195-E2 to 2,600 miles from a previous estimate of 2,450 miles on better-than-expected aerodynamics of a prototype that started flying in March. Bombardier's CS100 has a maximum range of 3,100 miles.The CSeries also boasts roomier cabins in a five-abreast layout, compared with Embraer's two-and-two seating.However, Slattery said the real selling point of the new E195 is an operating cost that rivals Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies on a per-seat basis while costing about 20 percent less per trip. Extra seats and skinny wings have made the new aircraft a ""profit hunter,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We just got one two days ago, our ninth, and it was shipped within one or two days of when it was supposed to be.""

Malaysia Airlines has been in talks with airlines and leasing companies about bringing in used widebody planes to replace the single-aisle planes it currently flies on some five-hour flights, such routes as to India, China and Hong Kong.""We've found the planes, we're in the process of doing due diligence,"" Peter Bellew told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association. He said he hopes to sign a deal in July and the planes, which have Wi-Fi and lie-flat seats in business, could enter the airline's fleet by the end of the year.Bookings for the next six months are looking good and yields - a measure of revenue per passenger - are up around 10 percent from a year earlier in June, July and August after coming under pressure at the start of the year, Bellew said. Uncertainty over failed travel bans in the United States and political turmoil in Europe has driven demand from travelers in the Middle East and India, Bellew said.""We've seen a significant upturn in business from India because of that and I think that's only set to continue,"" he said. Malaysia Airlines had offered to lease some A330s from Alitalia, in the event the struggling carrier collapsed. However, Bellew said it seemed Alitalia would survive as an airline operating medium and long-haul flights and so those planes would not become available.Malaysia Airlines is also due to receive the first two of six new A350 planes this year from Airbus SE (PA:AIR), but deliveries have been delayed due to issues with cabin equipment supplied by France's  Zodiac  Aerospace PA (PA:ZODC).The carrier was due to receive the first in October, but that has slipped to November and Bellew expects it may be the end of December before they arrive.He confirmed Malaysia was still looking to order around 30 new widebody planes from Boeing (N:BA) or Airbus for delivery from 2019 and 2020 but that the prices they were asking were not realistic.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms.The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR).Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly.""The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,"" test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models.""It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,"" said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.A Western jetmaking source called it a ""genteel flight"".A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air.Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.FIRM ORDERSPresident Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called ""a significant event"".The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had ""firm orders"" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how.But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s.UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. ""I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But decades after Boeing failed to prevent European upstart Airbus gaining momentum with early victories in the United States, people familiar with the company say the strategic importance of defending its core passenger jet business outweighs the diplomatic storm.U.S. industry experts say Boeing and other jetmakers at the time did not take the European consortium seriously enough and allowed their future nemesis to poach U.S. airlines from 1978.Again after the September 2001 attacks in the United States, when Boeing slashed production, Airbus (PA:AIR) filled the vacuum, building up market share and never looking back.For years Boeing insiders have rued that decision, even while battling Airbus at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies.While leading in widebody jets, it has seen the narrowbody market – where the industry makes most cash - slip away as Airbus grabbed some 60 percent of new-generation sales.Such a significant imbalance in market share poses serious long-term risk to the loser in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, because it creates a gap in costs that can't easily be bridged.Now, Boeing sees a second rival entering its domestic market with what it sees as low prices and is determined not to underestimate the threat again, people close to the company say.""It's a crucial entry market,"" said a person familiar with Boeing's strategy in taking on Bombardier.

Not taking action at the start led to consequences.""On the surface, Boeing's case is about the sale of jets to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) at what Boeing claims were unfairly low prices.Bombardier denies Boeing's estimates of both the price and the cost at which it is able to make its new jet, while critics say Boeing accounting rules allow it to disguise weak pricing.While the high-profile deal ignited Boeing's complaint, executives say Boeing's stance reflects a longer-term concern.Although Bombardier's small narrowbody jet has so far barely scratched Boeing's larger 737 and has suffered a spate of financial problems, the all-new design disturbs a landscape made up mainly by makeovers of existing Airbus and Boeing models.With Airbus still well ahead on narrowbody orders even after a recent lull, Boeing can ill afford to be squeezed on two fronts. Even less so with new players like China arriving.A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. PRECISION TRADE WEAPONBoeing's response marries strategic worries about its narrowbody position with a legal tactic designed to exploit a vulnerability the CSeries has, but global rival Airbus did not.The 110-130 seat CSeries relies mainly for now on the regional jet market, where North America is by far the largest single component and whose airlines therefore decide its future.That hands Boeing the opportunity to make use of a domestic lawsuit ill-suited to its global confrontation with Airbus, but which if successful could deliver a hammer blow to the CSeries.Trade sources see a second tactical motive for spurning the WTO and filing the industry's first such domestic U.S. case. U.S. anti-dumping cases typically take a year - versus 13 years and counting in its trench warfare against Airbus. That coincides with first delivery of a CSeries to Delta in April 2018. If Boeing succeeds, the jets could be hit from day one with extra duties, blunting Bombardier's competitiveness more quickly and more directly than normal trade sanctions.Still, Boeing faces a headache over what to do about lost fighter sales if Canada makes good on a threat to drop a deal for F/A-18 warplanes in retaliation for Boeing's trade claim.With Boeing's future fighter production in jeopardy as sales run dry, Boeing is anxious to keep its presence in that business long enough to compete for tomorrow's military programs. But without stability in its narrowbody jetliner business, Boeing faces an even deeper concern, since this is the cash cow for many of the company's other activities.Sources says Boeing's defense bosses signed off on bringing the trade case, highlighting the importance attached to the 737.The broader stakes raised by Bombardier's foray into the U.S. market were underscored when China was reported to revive on-off talks to invest in Bombardier. Airbus itself weighed buying the CSeries before talks collapsed in 2015. Whoever wins the trade spat between Bombardier and Boeing, one thing is clear: the small jet from Montreal has made its mark on the strategic calculations of all industry rivals, and now faces a battle for new sales.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

660,"May 22, 2017 05:15AM ET",Airbus hires outside monitors amid fraud investigations,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has appointed an independent panel including two former ministers to examine its anti-corruption practices after Britain and France launched fraud and bribery investigations into the sale of jetliners.Europe's largest aerospace group said on Monday the three advisers, who include former German finance minister Theo Waigel and former French European affairs minister Noelle Lenoir, will report to Chief Executive Tom Enders and the board.Airbus is in the midst of an upheaval after acknowledging discrepancies in past applications for British financial support to sell passenger jets.The company's self-disclosure of ""misstatements and omissions"" regarding the use of middlemen to help win contracts prompted Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to launch a bribery and fraud investigation last year.France opened a similar investigation in March and authorities in the two countries have said they will cooperate in the inquiries, the most far-reaching to target the 47-year-old company's civil activities.Airbus is also facing legal wrangles in Austria. Vienna prosecutors last month announced a fraud investigation into Enders and other individuals in connection with a $2 billion fighter order in 2003.The company has strongly rejected that move as a political gesture but has pledged to cooperate with all investigations.The voluntary decision to bring in monitors appears designed to strengthen Airbus's chances of winning a deferred prosecution deal in the civil investigations in Britain and France, where U.S.-style bargains are now possible under a recent French law.In its 2016 annual report, Airbus said it may have to alter its business practices and could have a compliance monitor imposed on it due to the investigations.It is also bracing for potentially significant fines and has warned it might get barred from some government contracts ""for some period of time"" following the investigations.Airbus shares fell 0.4 percent on Monday.AGENT FREEZEA deferred prosecution agreement is a court-supervised deal to suspend prosecution for a time in return for reparations, which in the aerospace industry tend to involve big fines.Following a four-year bribery investigation, UK engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) agreed in January to submit to external monitoring and pay 671 million pounds ($872 million) as part of settlements in Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States.The third and possibly leading member of the Airbus panel, UK lawyer and House of Lords member David Gold, led a review of Rolls-Royce's anti-corruption policies and was appointed by the United States to monitor Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) following a $400 million bribery settlement in 2010.The independent panel will take a ""hard look"" at Airbus's systems and culture, Enders said in a statement. It will set its own remit, a spokesman said.Airbus has meanwhile frozen the use of agents and overhauled its international marketing activities. But the freeze has caused some intermediaries to sue the company.Sales agents are not illegal but many regulators view large payments to them as a potential avenue for corruption.In a 2014 study, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said intermediaries were involved in three out of four bribery cases."
661,"May 17, 2017 11:02AM ET",Germany asks U.S. for classified briefing on Lockheed's F-35 fighter,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBERLIN (Reuters) - The German Air Force this month sent the U.S. military a written request for classified data on the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) F-35 fighter jet as it gears up to replace its current fleet of fighter jets from 2025 to 2035.The letter, sent by the Air Force's planning command and seen by Reuters, makes clear that the German government has not yet authorized a procurement program and is not committed to any particular aircraft to replace its current warplanes.It said the defense ministry would carry out ""an in-depth evaluation of market available solutions, including the F-35, later this year,"" with a formal ""letter of request"" to be issued in coming months.Germany's interest in the F-35 - the Pentagon's most advanced warplane and its costliest procurement program - may surprise some given that it is part of the four-nation consortium that developed the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon, which continues to compete for new orders.The Eurofighter is built by Airbus (PA:AIR) as well as Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Leonardo (MI:LDOF) of Italy.Germany will need to replace its current fleet of fourth-generation warplanes - Tornadoes in use since 1981 and Eurofighters - between 2025 and 2035. The F-35 is considered a fifth-generation fighter given stealth capabilities that allow it to evade enemy radars.Berlin's letter also comes amid growing tensions between the West and Russia over Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, with NATO officials saying that Russian naval activity now exceeds levels seen even during the Cold War. Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy - key NATO allies of Germany - are already buying the F-35 fighter jet to replace their current aircraft, and other European countries such as Switzerland, Belgium and Finland are also looking at purchasing the fifth-generation warplane.Germany's gesture may be aimed at strengthening its hand in negotiations with its European partners over the scale and timing of development of a next generation of European fighters. Any moves to buy a U.S. built warplane could run into political resistance in Germany, which has strong labor unions.But military sources say buying the F-35 could make sense for Germany given steady declines in the cost of the U.S. jets, and technical challenges with the Eurofighter.EIGHT-HOUR BRIEFING In the letter, the Air Force said a small team of air force officers was gathering data to prepare for a detailed analysis of alternatives for a new warplane. The group was working closely with the ministry's ""Task Force Future Air Combat System,"" which aims to make a recommendation for a political decision in mid-2018, the letter said.""In order to understand (the) F-35's cutting-edge technologies, the German Air Force is requesting a classified brief of the F-35's capabilities in general and especially concerning sensor suites, information management and operational capabilities,"" the letter said.The letter said a video conference suggested by U.S. officials in Bonn would help speed up the process.A source familiar with U.S. weapons programs said the classified briefing requested by Germany would likely last around eight hours. Since Germany is not part of the international consortium that funded development of the stealthy new fighter, the request for classified information must first be approved by the U.S. government, but U.S. officials said they did not expect any problems securing the needed marketing license.The Pentagon's F-35 program office said it had received the letter and was ""working to support the German Air Force request."" Lockheed referred questions to the State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, and the Pentagon. Spokesman Michael Rein said it would be inappropriate for Lockheed to comment since any potential sales would be negotiated between the two governments.The F-35 is in operational use by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, which last month carried out its first operational deployment of a small number of jets to Estonia for training with other U.S. and NATO military aircraft.The U.S. Air Force this month also announced this month that it plans to bring the F-35 to the Paris Air Show in June.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

664,"May 12, 2017 04:47PM ET",Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding,nan,"By Alwyn Scott(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem.The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France. CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline. Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights. ""Our plan remains to start deliveries this month,"" he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs.Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection. Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem ""within a few weeks.""Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far. The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said. Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus (PA:AIR) And China's COMAC.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At this critical time the company should be focused solely on the ramp up of the LEAP.""A spokeswoman for Safran declined to comment.Boeing says it has identified a problem with some of the low pressure turbine discs in the LEAP engine, which is made by a CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Safran.Safran, though, said on Thursday there was no design fault and that checks would be completed in a few weeks.It said production of the engines would not be affected because a second supplier for the same part was boosting its supplies. CFM aims to deliver ""as close as possible to 500"" in total for Boeing, Airbus (PA:AIR) and China's COMAC.Safran recently reported forecast-beating first-quarter revenue and reaffirmed its 2017 outlook, which includes plans to boost production of the LEAP engine to 2,000 units a year during the next three years.While Hohn said he backed Safran as it was structured now, trying to hit that target while also fixing problems at Zodiac would be a ""considerable and unnecessary distraction"".""It would consume management time and demand a reallocation of talented Safran employees to run Zodiac's troubled business. This would significantly increase the risk of the LEAP program developing expensive and damaging problems.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

668,"May 08, 2017 01:38PM ET",Exclusive: German report raises concerns over A400M military readiness,nan,"By Sabine SieboldBERLIN (Reuters) - A confidential report by the German Defence Ministry has warned that technical challenges and contractual wrangling with Airbus (PA:AIR) could impair full operational use of Europe's A400M military transport plane.The A400M, Europe's largest defense project, was ordered in 2003 to give Europe an independent military transport capability but costs have since spiraled and Airbus has warned of ""risks ahead"" for the program. ""Given the under-financing of the program and the expected demands for delay-related damages, Airbus will not make the needed investments to carry out required improvements,"" said the ministry report seen by Reuters on Monday. ""The operational use of the plane is therefore in jeopardy.""The report said Airbus could ask for delays of 12-18 months to resolve remaining issues, such as defensive measures and the ability to deploy paratroopers, as part of its latest negotiations with seven NATO countries involved in the 20 billion euro ($21.9 billion) project.That means that Germany could face a capability gap in 2021 when its current transport plane, the C-160 Transall, is due to be retired from service, the report said.Asked about the report, an Airbus spokesman said the A400M program had made significant progress over the past year in the areas of defensive measures and paratrooper deployment.Airbus defense chief Dirk Hoke told Reuters the company had been engaged in what he called ""very constructive"" discussions with all European buyers since a meeting at the end of March.PENALTY CLAUSES People familiar with the discussions said that buyer nations at the meeting upheld penalty clauses for delays to the program and that Airbus and Germany remained at odds over cash payments Berlin is withholding because of delivery delays, with little significant progress expected until after German national elections in September.A German Defence Ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the report but said the A400M had shown in daily operations that it was a capable aircraft and that it was known that the plane did not have all the capabilities required by the contract.""We are watching the project's development very closely,"" she said, noting that implications of any issues and risks on the project are analyzed carefully by the ministry. She said that Airbus is obligated to find solutions, which is why the buyer nations have been in negotiations with the company.The report cited other problems, including an unusually high 50 man-hours of work required to prepare the aircraft for a new mission because data had to be coordinated across different systems.""This is operationally unacceptable and must be reduced,"" the report said.Tobias Lindner, a member of the Germany's parliamentary budget committee, said the continued problems would have ""significant consequences"" for the country's armed forces and criticized Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen for failing to get a handle on the program in the three years since she took office.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Orders were boosted partly by demand for military derivatives.Airbus delivered 182 aircraft between January and April.Airbus is targeting 700 deliveries for the whole year, though top executives have also issued a more optimistic forecast of 720 deliveries.Boeing is targeting 760-765 deliveries.Airbus expects deliveries once again to be weighted towards the latter half of the year as it faces problems with one brand of engine on its A320neo family, but hopes to avoid the dramatic sprint of December last year following such difficulties.Deliveries so far this year include 36 A320neo-family aircraft including the first A320neo. It is aiming to deliver about 200 of the upgraded medium-haul models this year.It delivered 17 A350 aircraft in the first four months.

670,"May 05, 2017 10:43AM ET","With maiden jet flight, China enters dog-fight with Boeing, Airbus",nan,"By Jackie Cai and Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home.Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with ""C919"" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts.The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader ""Made in China 2025"" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots.""Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,"" Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters.""I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.""At the moment, though, Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe.On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight.A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a ""major breakthrough"" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], relies on overseas technology from firms including  General Electric  (N:GE), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) subsidiary Goodrich.China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers.HARDSHIP, STRUGGLEConceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide.

He added China should become more self-reliant.However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage.China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year.Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.""Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time.

On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term ""hardship"", ""dedication"" and ""struggle"" to meet the firm's goals.China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards.But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia.

673,"May 04, 2017 05:03AM ET",Exclusive: Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear program, a senior Iranian official said.IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (N:BA) is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities. But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review.So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say. Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added.""We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran,"" Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters.Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment.Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future. U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board.IRAN, UK ELECTIONS Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then.UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent.For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier  General Electric  (N:GE) or GE and its French partner  Safran  (PA:SAF).UKEF has said in the past it recognizes the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

674,"Apr 28, 2017 05:25PM ET","Bombardier rejects Boeing trade claim, shares slide",nan,"By Allison Lampert and Alwyn ScottMONTREAL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) hit back on Friday at rival U.S. planemaker Boeing Co's (N:BA) claim that it sold jets well below cost to win market share in the United States, the latest sign of increasing trade tensions between the two countries.The risk of the United States imposing a tariff, which would likely depress sales of Bombardier's newest jet, and concern over how big that tariff might be, unsettled investors, sending the Canadian company's shares down just over 4 percent. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate what it describes as rock-bottom prices for Bombardier's new CSeries aircraft, including an ""absurdly low"" sum of $19.6 million it says Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) paid for a jet costing $33 million to build. ""The allegation is absurd,"" Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said, in response to numbers contained in a petition sent to the U.S. Commerce Department by Boeing on Thursday.The spat comes days after Washington imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, prompting claims in Canada that Boeing was taking advantage of the Trump administration's tougher stance on trade. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the filing against Bombardier was ""an initiative we chose to take ourselves"".He declined to say whether Boeing also planned to ask the United States to pursue Canada through the World Trade Organization, as it has against European rival Airbus. (PA:AIR)Domestic cases, where companies can petition for duties on specific products, typically take around a year. That is much quicker than a 13-year-old transatlantic battle on jetliner subsidies at the WTO, an international forum open only to nations.Planemakers ""often sell below costs to break into a new market or with a new product, particularly if it involves a significant launch customer,"" said U.S.-based trade policy expert Joel Johnson.Such tactics cause long-term harm by creating momentum that rivals find hard to reverse, Boeing's petition said, although industry analysts say Boeing and Airbus both regularly offer discounts of 50 percent or more.Boeing has said it competed for last year's Delta order against the CSeries CS100 with used 717s, which it no longer makes, and used jets from Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3), since Delta was only ready to pay a low price and wanted smaller jets than its more modern 737.But it said Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737.Still, its complaint puzzled some analysts and trade lawyers, since Canada is in talks to sign a deal later this year or in early 2018 to acquire 18 Boeing fighter jets. ""It's certainly the right political climate for a trade complaint. But I'm not sure this is the best idea,"" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia.Canada has rejected Boeing's accusations and says the CSeries uses many U.S. parts and generates thousands of U.S. jobs. Around half of the 110 to 130 seat CSeries is made in the United States, including the engine, cockpit control panels and avionics. Trade experts say an investigation could result in Delta and other buyers having to pay extra duties on future deliveries, effectively raising the price but not benefiting Bombardier. Canadian trade lawyer Mark Warner said Canada could challenge final decisions at the WTO or through NAFTA.Delta did not respond to requests for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We welcomed it ... However, when we were almost certain that we wanted the plane, it was no longer available,"" Chairman Farhad Parvaresh was quoted by Iran's English language Press TV as saying.Industry sources had said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey.""We have currently stopped our negotiations in absence of the plane,"" Parvaresh was quoted as saying.Boeing said it does not comment on specific deliveries.""Boeing and Iran Air continue to work on implementing the sales contract for commercial passenger airplanes signed in December 2016, at which time we announced first deliveries are scheduled to start in 2018,"" a spokesman said.""We continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government on all our dealings with approved Iranian airlines.""Since last year, when most sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, Tehran has joined a long waiting list for new airplanes and the swap would have allowed it to speed up its fleet renewal.IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program, and has taken three deliveries.Iran's return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions is a boon to planemakers trying to dispose of some new planes discarded by airlines facing economic difficulties.But Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

678,"Apr 25, 2017 10:04AM ET",Exclusive: Boeing near decision to launch 737-10 jet - sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus (PA:AIR) A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said.The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years.Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries.The sources said a solution had been found and that Boeing was talking more deliberately to airlines about launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes. ""Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,"" a spokesman said. ""No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.""Boeing shares were up slightly in early trading.Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet.But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay.It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.This is what aerospace engineers call a ""semi-levered"" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10.In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space.COMPETITION IMPACTDrawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales.A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales.Airbus, which declined comment, will try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. It is meanwhile said to be working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus.Market sources say Boeing is offering 5 percent lower costs per seat than the A321neo for the 737-10. Some experts are more cautious on operating costs, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over two other important drivers: range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those features and is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes.Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design.Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8. The 737-10 would thus be an extra rampart to defend Boeing's biggest cash cow.""It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet,"" one strategist said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

China's answer to Boeing now just needs to sell,nan,"By Brenda Goh and Tim HepherSHANGHAI/PARIS (Reuters) - When China unveiled an historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China's aviation ambitions.The COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force - illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR). ""They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group.Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training program, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say.And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this.Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad.""You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem,"" said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. ""After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness.""Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919.GLOBAL SUPPORT NETWORKThe C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown.In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January.Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them.While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, COMAC has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it's adopting a more outward-facing approach.While operating manuals for COMAC's smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919's will be in English to support sales.COMAC's sales and support networks - it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng - are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus.Still, COMAC's home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes - mostly from Boeing and Airbus.""Their sales person is the government,"" said a Chinese airline executive, who didn't want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. ""As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen.""Airline executives say the first flight is when COMAC can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing.""We haven't placed a deposit; at the moment it's intentions,"" said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines (SS:600029) (HK:1055), which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s.""We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they're able to produce it... They (COMAC) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates.""HOW SAFE IS IT?Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919's safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team.The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence.Although the EU has agreed to recognize some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie.""We are just at the start of the process,"" said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes.Without Western certification, ""sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible,"" said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week.The C919's only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent  General Electric  (N:GE) co-built the plane's engine with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).""Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has,"" Cheng said.-For graphic on 'Comparison of passenger jets' click: http://tmsnrt.rs/1kwEmC4  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

682,"Apr 17, 2017 07:48PM ET","Japan jet may not make money, but aims to revive dormant industry",nan,"By Tim Kelly and Maki ShirakiTOKYO (Reuters) - The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) has been delayed five times and faces rising costs, yet its future as the vanguard of Japanese-built passenger jets seems assured by the corporate muscle behind it and a government set on reviving an aerospace industry dismantled after World War Two.The delays - the new 90-seat plane was due to take off in 2013, but the first delivery is not now seen until 2020 - have dented its chances of commercial success as established regional jet makers, Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), catch up with its innovations, and China and Russia flex their aerospace ambitions.But the Japanese government's primary goal isn't to make money for Mitsubishi Aircraft, the MRJ's manufacturer, rather it's to have the plane cement an industry revival that failed to take off half a century ago with Japan's last passenger plane, the YS-11.""Rather than a simple question of whether it makes a profit or loss, what is more important is will it over the longer term be the foundation of a strong aerospace industry,"" a government source who is helping the program told Reuters. He asked not to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media.Presentation documents prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, seen by Reuters, see the MRJ as the first in a three-generation program stretching beyond 2060.With the plane still awaiting U.S.-standard certification for commercial flights, signed-up customers are banking on the backing of big-name Japanese companies to see the project through.Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp is 64 percent-owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011), with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058) each holding a 10 percent stake. Other shareholders include state-owned Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) and Mitsui & Co (T:8031).""Not a bad list,"" says Jep Thornton, a partner at Aerolease Aviation in Florida which has ordered 10 of the planes. ""This is coming from the government sector, the financial sector and the investor sector.""Launch customer ANA Holdings (T:9202), Japan's biggest carrier, says it won't walk away from its order for 15 MRJs even as it has to keep older aircraft flying and leases four Boeing (N:BA) 737-800 aircraft to make up for a capacity shortfall.""We want this plane in our fleet and although we have been on stand-by for a while, we await it with anticipation,"" said Yuji Hirako, who runs All Nippon Airways.RE-WIRINGThe plane's latest delay, announced in January, can be dated back more than 20 years - six years before Mitsubishi even considered a passenger jet - when a Boeing 747 plunged into the Atlantic, killing 230 people.Investigators blamed a short circuit that ignited a fuel tank fire, prompting the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to tighten wiring certification in 2007.Mitsubishi, which had by then begun work on the MRJ, overlooked the change, said two people with knowledge of the project. ""Mitsubishi was clearly aware of it but did not apply it to the design,"" said one, who didn't want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media.Hundreds of engineers wiring the MRJ did so without using a common design framework incorporating the new rule. So, when asked by Japanese regulators certifying the jet to FAA standards how it complied with the stricter standard, Mitsubishi Aircraft faced a time-consuming task to explain each twist and turn in the 23,000 wires snaking through the plane's fuselage.""They decided it would be easier to start from scratch,"" the second person said.In response to Reuters queries, Mitsubishi Aircraft said: ""We were aware of the regulation in our early phase of design, so it is not accurate to say we overlooked the regulation. Our design was made reflecting the regulations, but we made a subsequent decision to relocate certain systems for a better design. System location was the main reason for requiring wiring changes and the re-routing ensures we meet the highest safety standards.""Four of the five delays so far have been caused to some degree by similar failures to document work for certification, forcing engineers to redo some of their work, said Yugo Fukuhara, vice president and general manager of sales and marketing at Mitsubishi Aircraft, adding the company is hiring ex-Boeing engineers and other foreign experts to help it better navigate FAA rules.BREAKING EVEN?Mitsubishi Aircraft has orders for 233 MRJs, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades. The company declined to say how many planes it has to sell to break even.Based on presentations by Mitsubishi Heavy, the first four delays doubled the MRJ's development cost, and the latest delay could add another 30 percent - taking total spending to 350 billion yen ($3.17 billion), equivalent to the value of 67 list-price MRJs.At the average operating margin of 7.84 percent at commercial planemakers including Embraer, Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) over the past three years, the profit per MRJ plane would be $3.7 million, according to Reuters calculations.At that rate of return, Mitsubishi Aircraft would need to sell more than 800 of the planes to cover its costs.""Assume a very conservative 30 percent discount to the list price, then re-do. That probably brings us to 1,200 jets, and they'll never get there,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, when asked about Reuters' estimate. A more realistic number, he says, would be 30 aircraft a year over 25 years, adding up to sales of around 750 MRJs.""We understand that the commercial aircraft business is a long-term investment, and we expect to absorb the development costs over the long run,"" Mitsubishi Aircraft told Reuters.""We see this as the creation of a new industry, establishing supply chains and a regulatory certification process,"" said Fukuhara, the sales and marketing manager, in his office at Nagoya Airport. ""I don't think it will end with the MRJ.""(For graphic comparing regional jets, click: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/1/25/49/index.html)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

683,"Apr 13, 2017 04:06PM ET",New Boeing 737 makes first flight as larger version moves ahead,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Jamie FreedSEATTLE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A new version of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 jetliner took off for the first time on Thursday, marking another step in Boeing's revamp of its best-selling product line that could see up to five new models introduced by 2020.Boeing's 737 MAX 9, a fuel-efficient, long-range successor to the 737-900, made its initial flight, a test mission, about 50 years after the 737 first took to the skies on April 9, 1967, and follows the first flight of Boeing's largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, last month, from its factory in South Carolina.The new models are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed. Boeing has committed to making four new 737 versions and is considering a bigger version than the MAX 9, known as the 737 MAX 10X. It could begin delivering that version in 2020 if airlines start ordering it this year, with China emerging as a promising market, said Michael Teal, 737 MAX chief project engineer and deputy program manager.With the MAX 9 in the air, Boeing is turning more attention to the larger version. It began pre-marketing the plane this year but has yet to formally launch development of the jetliner, which would compete against the popular Airbus (PA:AIR) A321neo.Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020, depending on orders.""We'll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that program when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane,"" he said on a conference call with reporters.CHINA""The China market and airlines there are very interested in the (MAX) 9 and 10 depending on their needs,"" said Teal. ""We're looking at putting together deals for the China market today on both the 9 and the 10.""Boeing said in March it had approached India's SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) and Jet Airways (NS:JET) about the MAX 10X, which its marketing chief says would offer the best efficiency in that part of the market, a claim Airbus rejects.However, the heads of two major aircraft leasing companies have voiced skepticism about the appeal of the MAX 10X and suggested it would eat into rentals of other MAX models.The 737 MAX 10X would be 66 inches (167 centimeters) longer than the current largest family member, the 737 MAX 9, and add 12 seats. It would require longer landing gear as a result.Teal said the landing gear was still in the development stage, with several concepts in prototype testing.""We won't hit the firm configuration on the gear and, really, the complete airplane until the end of this year,"" he said. ""All of the development tests are proving positive and we are well on our way to firming up that configuration and moving forward into production.""The first 737 MAX 9 customer delivery is expected next year, while the first 737 MAX 8 should be delivered next month.""We start with several airplanes in May, more in June and more in July and we start the ramp-up from there,"" Teal said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That aircraft will make its first test flight in Seattle on Thursday, weather permitting, he said.Boeing began marketing the 737 MAX 10X as an option to customers this year but has yet to receive any orders for the fuel-efficient single-aisle jetliner, which competes against the popular Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A321neo.Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020 depending on orders.""We'll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that program when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane,"" he said on a conference call with reporters.

(Former CEO) Louis (Gallois) retired from the company aged 68, which is not my benchmark, but in 2019 I will only be 60,"" he said.Enders was speaking after shareholders approved a change in the name of the company's Dutch-registered top entity to Airbus SE from Airbus Group SE, completing an overhaul which saw the group merge with its main jetmaking division earlier this year.The recent shake-up saw Frenchman Fabrice Bregier, who runs the planemaking business, add the new role of chief operating officer of the unified company, with an official No. 2 role.Uncertainty over Enders' plans could test what is often painted as a guarded relationship between him and Bregier, a tandem seen as vital to keeping the Franco-German-led aerospace company on track as it breaks away from years of in-fighting.Although Bregier is widely viewed as the main candidate to replace Enders, his status as heir apparent has not officially been confirmed and a delayed handover could allow others to develop the profile needed to be considered, analysts say.Bregier has said he is focused on running the airplane business, which is the main rival to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA), and his new company-wide operational duties.Enders is expected to let the board know around March next year whether he would like to stay in the 3 million euros ($3.2 mln) a year post, giving the company a year to polish its succession plans.Asked whether he would seek a new mandate from 2019, Enders said, ""It depends on many things. If it were boring then that would be a different story, but this company has plenty of challenges - sometimes more than I would like - and it is a fascinating one and I am still relatively young, but we will see. There is no need to take any decision on that now.""

686,"Apr 10, 2017 06:19PM ET",Printed titanium parts expected to save millions in Boeing Dreamliner costs,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co hired Norsk Titanium AS to print the first structural titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner, a shift that the Norwegian 3-D printing company said would eventually shave $2 million to $3 million off the cost of each plane.The contract announced on Monday is a major step in Boeing's effort to boost the profitability of the 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3-D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminum, and accounts for about $17 million of the cost of a $265 million Dreamliner, industry sources say.Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE's rival A350 jet.""This means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least,"" starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing, said in a telephone interview.Boeing builds 144 Dreamliners in a typical year. The company declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk's technology would help reduce costs. The Dreamliner turned profitable last year after racking up nearly $29 billion in production-related losses.Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them, Yates said.Norsk expects the U.S. regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year. That will ""open up the floodgates,"" Yates said, by allowing Norsk to print thousands of other parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, resulting in the millions in expecting savings per plane. ""You're talking about tons, literally,"" on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is already printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight.Norsk said it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running by year-end at a 67,000-square-foot (6,220-square-meter) facility in Plattsburgh, New York.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

689,"Apr 07, 2017 03:50PM ET",Airlines asked to perform early engine checks on CSeries: Bombardier,nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - Two airlines flying Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries planes were asked to perform early preventive checks of engines by manufacturer Pratt & Whitney after problems were detected in a different variant of the geared turbofan motor, the aircraft maker said on Friday.United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) division Pratt & Whitney directed Swiss International Air Lines (SWIN.UL) and airBaltic to inspect engine combustion liners after 2,000 flight hours, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft spokesman Bryan Tucker said. The steel liner fits into the combustion chamber of an engine where fuel is burned.""We expect the lifespan to be greater than this, but the inspections will determine when the liners require replacement,"" said Bryan Tucker, a spokesman for Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, in an email. ""The corrected liner’s lifespan is expected to be around 6,000 hours and these are expected to be delivered (by Pratt) this summer."" A Pratt and Whitney spokeswoman referred a reporter to a company statement which said it added a combustor lining inspection to its regular scheduled maintenance of the PW1500G engine. Bombardier expects its first CSeries narrowbody delivered to customer Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) this summer will have a corrected liner, Tucker said. There are no reported performance issues with the PW1500G engine used in the CSeries 110-130 seat jets, unlike a different variant, the PW1100G, which is being used in the A-320NEO. India's aviation regulator said in February it is investigating technical issues with the engine variant used in Airbus Group (PA:AIR) planes flown by IndiGo - owned by InterGlobe Aviation - and privately held GoAir.Two GoAir A320 NEOs made emergency landings following technical issues last month, and in January an IndiGo flight was aborted after one of its engines developed a fault while accelerating for take-off.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

690,"Apr 07, 2017 05:28AM ET","U.S. South, not just Mexico, stands in way of Rust Belt jobs revival",nan,"By Howard SchneiderMOBILE, Ala. (Reuters) - In the years since the 2008 financial crisis, this southern U.S. port city has attracted a new Airbus factory, seen its steel industry retool, and gained thousands of jobs building the Navy's new combat vessel.Some 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure.As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern ""rust belt"" states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base. States like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north.Whether the ""rust belt's"" expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises. For a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data.The analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment. (For graphic on' A battle for jobs' click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nHSda5) Florida, a state whose population has boomed under an influx of retirees, many of them from the north, was excluded.FREE LAND AND DEGREESEconomists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in.""Labor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land,"" said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting. In the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with.David Fernandes, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, said that of the roughly 700,000 engines the factory made last year, half went to Mexico and Canada. The facility also makes engines for cars assembled at a Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. ""Anything that hinders the opportunity to provide product to a customer is what is concerning,"" he said. Plants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion.Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day. Gunmaker Remington Outdoor [FREDM.UL] came to Huntsville lured by $110 million in tax and other concessions. Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago.Jeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees.Many of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states. The rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014.The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s. Population in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period.When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, ""there was no Minnesota play,"" said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville. The market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500. FROM LAGGARD TO A RISING TIDEGlobalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south.Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent. In the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data.The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry.Supplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico.New industries, such as aerospace, followed. Boeing (NYSE:BA) opened a new factory in Charleston, South Carolina, while decades of federal spending on space and defense programs created a pool of engineers in Alabama. A surge in energy and locally important industries like wood products added to the employment gains.Judith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million. ""The vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here,"" Adams said. When European aircraft maker Airbus scouted sites for its $600 million North American plant more than a decade ago it settled on a former Air Force base in Mobile. As it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes. ""We looked at transportation costs, labor costs, productivity, and it made sense,"" said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group (PA:AIR) Inc. ""We will be building single aisle airplanes (in Mobile) for a long, long time.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

691,"Apr 06, 2017 03:29PM ET",Airbus loses first quarter order race as delays hamper A320neo,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) took 20 new jet orders in March to end the first quarter well behind rival Boeing (N:BA) as delays in deliveries of the A320neo shifted the spotlight back to an earlier model.The France-based company ended the quarter with 26 orders, but the net total for the year shrank to six after allowing for cancellations and conversions between different models.Boeing earlier posted 226 jetliner orders for the same quarter, boosted by orders for 21 airframes for its P-8 military surveillance jet project and 15 U.S. air refuelling tankers.After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including those military derivatives, but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified.Airbus took 18 orders for its popular A320 single-aisle jet, despite it nearing the end of its production as Airbus switches to the upgraded A320neo, whose deliveries have been delayed by problems at one engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing.Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as ""opportunistic"" prices.Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the 2017 total to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers.Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year.In two other widely watched projects it delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. In total, it delivered 136 jets in the quarter compared with Boeing's total of 169. However, analysts said Boeing's deliveries were lower than expected and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities cut its earnings forecast for the quarter, while maintaining its forecast for the year.Boeing shares rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the U.S. market, while Airbus shares rose more than 1 percent.Boeing overtook its European rival as the world's largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year.Last quarter's wide order gap with Boeing came as Airbus faces a UK probe into suspected corruption in its use of third-party agents to win contracts in at least five countries, which widened this month as France started its own investigation.Airbus said in its annual report released ahead of an April 12 shareholder meeting it was reviewing processes for using such agents, most of which have seen their relationships with Airbus canceled as the company carries out a compliance drive.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

692,"Apr 05, 2017 06:42PM ET","Airbus, Boeing close in on Qantas' ultra-long haul dream",nan,"By Jamie FreedSYDNEY (Reuters) - Both Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the ""Holy Grail"" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN).As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say.Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles.""These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. ""You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility.""For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand.Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travelers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specializing in transport at the University of Sydney's business school.""It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas,"" he said.FUELLING DOUBTSQantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modeling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks.The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947.Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage.""In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic.""He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices.Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year.HEADWINDSQantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route.Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles.Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count.""We think our airplane has the legs and the capability,"" said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. ""If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology.""Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear.Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s.BEST PRICINGQantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently.""It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time,"" Joyce said. ""That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft.""Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalize the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said.""The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe,"" Joyce said. ""(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs.""(To view a graphic on 'The Kangaroo route' click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/QANTAS-ORDERS/010040G811D/QANTAS-ORDERS.jpg)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

693,"Apr 05, 2017 03:39PM ET",Exclusive: Rockwell to win EU approval for B/E Aero takeover - sources,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins (N:COL) is set to gain unconditional EU approval for its $6.4 billion bid for aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace (O:BEAV), two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The deal will boost Rockwell Collins' exposure to a record pipeline of commercial aerospace equipment purchases and expand its relatively modest presence in lucrative aftermarkets.The two U.S. companies have little product overlaps, with Rockwell active in avionics and flight control systems while B/E Aerospace is a major supplier of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and lavatories.The European Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by April 12, declined to comment. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Securing EU approval without conditions will be a major step toward closing the deal, which Rockwell aims to do within the next few months.Pricing pressures from Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) are seen as one factor which triggered the deal. The merged company has forecast cost savings of about $160 million due to greater buying power with suppliers and combined information technology systems.The Rockwell deal has also renewed speculation of more tie-ups in the sector. French aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) launched a $9 billion takeover bid in January for seats maker  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC) to create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

694,"Apr 04, 2017 10:50AM ET",Iran's Aseman Airlines signs deal to buy at least 30 Boeing jets,nan,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh and Tim HepherDUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance toward Iran.Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy.Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations.Boeing described the deal as a ""memorandum of agreement,"" meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added.If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that.Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities.Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions.In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an ""aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States"". TURBOPROP TALKSBoeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. planemaker must first apply for licenses from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale.""Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval,"" it said.In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran's ageing fleet following decades of sanctions.The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal.Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy.Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR (PA:AIR) (MI:LDOF) were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed.A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney Canada.The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies (N:UTX), one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month's retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines.Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered.Pratt & Whitney Canada had no immediate comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

695,"Apr 04, 2017 06:20AM ET",Airbus to fit more seats into super-jumbo with slimmer staircase,nan,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has developed a new, slimmer staircase for its A380 super jumbo to allow for more seats in its latest effort to improve sales of the world's largest airliner.Reuters reported last month that Airbus was considering doing away with the front ""grand staircase"" to lower the double-decker's operating costs and boost fuel efficiency.Airbus cabin marketing executive Ingo Wuggetzer said that introducing a slimmer stairway instead of the double staircase would generate enough space to add 20 extra seats. Meanwhile, changing the shape of the rounded stairway at the back to a square one would provide further space, for 14 more passengers plus two food trolleys. ""There's a lot more revenue generation potential,"" Wuggetzer said at the Aircraft Interiors fair in Hamburg on Tuesday. The changes are available as a retrofit to existing A380s or as options on new jets, Wuggetzer said, adding that Airbus had customers ""interested and signed"" for some of the elements.If other space-saving changes such as a new cabin crew rest compartment and a new seat layout are taken into consideration, airlines can add up to 80 more seats, Airbus said. Airbus recently shelved plans for a bolder upgrade of the A380, involving new engines, due to cost. It also announced plans to cut output to one a month due to poor sales.

697,"Mar 31, 2017 09:50AM ET","Airbus faces cash headache, lengthy talks over A400M delays",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Andrea ShalalPARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) faces a cash squeeze and months of uncertainty over its troubled A400M troop plane after buyer nations upheld penalty clauses for delays to Europe's largest defense project.The Toulouse-based group has called for help on the 20 billion euro ($21.4 billion) program as it continues to encounter technical problems, seven years after winning a 3.5 billion euro bailout from seven NATO nations.On Thursday, Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders met European buyers and a source with knowledge of the talks said nations maintained penalties, but agreed to keep talking.Airbus has hinted at a broad shopping list of demands including a better share of liabilities on the A400M's engines, whose development has faced a series of problems.However, people familiar with the project say Airbus's campaign chiefly boils down to concerns over a shortfall in cash payments, especially from the largest customer Germany. It is not this time asking for an injection of new public funds, they add.Insiders say Germany is withholding some 15 percent of cash payments under financial retention clauses in the contract because some A400M systems are not working as planned. That hurts Airbus when it faces volatility in cash planning due in part to choppy commercial markets.It also risks inflaming prickly relations between Airbus and one of its government shareholders. Berlin owns 11 percent of Airbus and is the biggest A400M buyer with 53 planes on order.Airbus declined to comment on the talks.TECHNICAL PROBLEMSTechnical problems have put the A400M years behind schedule, with Germany's share of the costs having risen to 9.6 billion euros from an initial estimate of 8.1 billion.Problems range from genuine shortfalls in its ability to wage war to apparently minor discrepancies.In one example that some describe as splitting hairs, one of the fuel tanks is supposed to hold 64,000 liters but only holds 63,500 and has been marked as ""contract not fulfilled"".But in an example of deeper issues, a defensive system for the German air force does not meet specifications, though Airbus insists it is still ahead of many rivals.For now, buyers are standing their ground and forcing Airbus to provide what was agreed, though some have not ruled out short-term relief.German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen has indicated she plans to make full use of clauses that allow Berlin to withhold payments. German officials say none of the eight aircraft delivered to Germany so far fully met specifications.Germany has also asked for 39.4 million euros as compensation for delays on the first five aircraft. Defence sources say the hard-nosed approach reflects a shift away from cozy relationships when arms firms would freely commit to unrealistic assignments and then strike a compromise.Buyers, on the other hand, would order over-ambitious kit to secure extra work for their own factories. Such over-reach was typically worked out in negotiations, but cash-strapped European governments are nowadays playing by tougher rules.Analysts say the A400M was one of the first major defense projects to contain a fixed price but failed to get rid of bloated requirements, putting Airbus repeatedly on collision course with buyers over the bill for sorting out problems.Buyers insist mismanagement inside Airbus is largely to blame for billions of euros of cost overruns.Although all sides have agreed to meet in June, little progress is expected until German elections in September.That echoes the pattern of previous bailout negotiations when Airbus called for a new deal in early 2009, which was also a German election year. Talks only began in earnest after that year's September polls and a final deal was struck in 2010.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

698,"Mar 30, 2017 03:20PM ET",European governments to maintain Airbus penalties on A400M: source,nan,"MADRID (Reuters) - European governments buying the A400M military transport aircraft have agreed to maintain the penalties incurred by the manufacturer, Airbus (PA:AIR), for production delays, a source with knowledge of the talks in Madrid said on Thursday.The defense ministries may, however, give Airbus some flexibility on its most pressing sanctions, the source added, though it is still unclear how this leeway would work.Airbus called in February for talks with European governments to ease ""heavy penalties"" for delays to the program, after taking a fresh 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) charge on Europe's largest defense project.Problems with engine gearboxes and delays in supplying defensive aids has led to penalties and cash being held back by governments, according to the company. The A400M was ordered in 2003 by seven NATO nations -- Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Britain and Turkey -- to give Europe an independent military transport capability.Its costs have since spiralled and Airbus has warned of ""risks ahead"" for the program.""(The countries) are close to signing an interim agreement showing an understanding of the problems Airbus is going through,"" the source said. ""This could lead to a small amount of flexibility on the sanctions, although they still stand.""Airbus declined to comment. In a joint statement put out by the Spanish defense ministry, the seven European governments said they had held ""constructive talks"" with Airbus. ""Everyone expressed their total confidence in the A400M aircraft ... We agreed on a common line of action to move forward in a way that reflects the interests of the program, the armed forces and taxpayers,"" they said. The next meeting between the countries and Airbus is due to take place at the British air base of Brize Norton in June.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We are only buying training aircraft, and just a few, 12."" Argentina's center-right President Mauricio Macri has set an ambitious goal to trim spending and narrow a budget deficit after two terms of free-spending populism under leftist leader Cristina Fernandez.Martinez did not say how much Argentina was spending on the training planes, only acknowledging that the budget was ""very small."" The Beechcraft Texan planes will help replace 24 Embraer EMB-312 Tucanos that have been used in the air force training school for decades. Beechcraft is a subsidiary of  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) making Beechcraft T -6C Texan II planes that are used for training pilots in several countries. ""We will need 12 more, and then we need a lot of other aircraft, medium-sized transport and other kinds of planes,"" Martinez said.A navy spokesman said in December Argentina was also in talks to buy four C-205 aircraft manufactured by Europe's Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SA.Asked if Argentina would need new aircraft to achieve Macri's goal of better patrolling borders with Paraguay and Brazil to stop drug flights, Martinez said the training aircraft could potentially also be used for that purpose.Macri's government is also looking to restart manufacturing at cash-strapped state-run aircraft producer Fadea, which was previously operated by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and nationalized under Fernandez. Martinez confirmed a report by state-run news agency Telam last week that said Fadea would manufacture three Pampa training planes this year.Martinez also said Argentina did not have any immediate plans to purchase arms from abroad, denying statements on Twitter from former President Fernandez who said on Monday that Argentina sought to buy $2 billion of ""sophisticated weapons of war"" from the United States. ""For now no, no arms,"" Martinez said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

700,"Mar 27, 2017 04:00AM ET","NATO to spend 3 billion euros on satellite, cyber defenses",nan,"By Robin EmmottBRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO plans to spend 3 billion euros ($3.24 billion) to upgrade its satellite and computer technology over the next three years as the Western military alliance adapts to new threats, a senior official said.Seeking to deter hackers, and other threats including Iranian missiles, the investments underscore NATO's recognition that conflicts are increasingly fought on computer networks as well as in the air, on land and at sea. A senior official at the NATO Communications and Information Agency said the plans include a 1.7-billion-euro investment in satellite communications to better support troops and ships deployed across the alliance, as well as aiding the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones.It was not immediately clear if NATO allies would fund a new military communications satellite to be launched into space or if an increase in broadband capacity could be gained from existing U.S. and other allied satellites.Non-NATO member Japan launched its first military communications satellite in January.The proposals, for which some funding must still be approved by NATO governments, also envisage spending about 800 million euros on the computer systems that help command air and missile defenses, said the official, who declined to be named.Seventy-one million euros will go to improving the protection of NATO's 32 main locations from cyber attacks. NATO says it has seen a five-fold increase in suspicious events on its networks in the past three years, while Russian group APT28 is blamed by Western intelligence for the hacking of the U.S. Democratic Party during last year's U.S. election.NATO officials have told Reuters they suspect Russia sponsors attacks against their networks before major summits.Another 180 million euros are to be spent to provide more secure mobile communications for alliance soldiers in the field. NATO will present its needs in detail at a conference in Ottawa in April and then begin launching the bidding process. It is likely to attract major Western defense contracts including Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Raytheon and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), the official said, in part because ""there cannot be content that does not come from NATO nations.""NATO rules prohibit Russian or Chinese suppliers unless there is a specific need that allied companies cannot provide.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It could test a 2016 anti-graft law which introduces in France the possibility of a ""deferred prosecution agreement,"" a type of settlement often favored in corruption probes and already used by Britain's SFO.Britain last year suspended the issue of export credits to Airbus, and France and Germany immediately followed suit, forcing Airbus to provide financing itself to some airlines in order to maintain aircraft deliveries.The system remains suspended but Airbus has suggested export support may return on a case-by-case basis later this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We can only digest so much and have to be diligent about that.""Chang was fishing in New Zealand when he was asked to run the huge Chinese bank's aviation leasing arm and said he would not have heeded the call if it had come from a short-term fund.""We are long-term players. Our investors don't have a six-year exit strategy. We are not going to sell up our aviation portfolio and start renting bicycles. We are going back to the old-fashioned way of working with airlines, rather than trading aircraft. We are more traditional in that sense.""Chang last week attended the ISTAT Americas air finance conference, whose record attendance underscored a flood of investors looking for higher returns amid low interest rates.The influx has put pressure on lease rates and spurred talk that some will exit as the cycle turns lower. Financiers say there are more than 50 leasing companies in China alone.""There are lots of reasons why there are so many lessors from China. They have limited capital investment alternatives, a similar reason why so many investors went overseas,"" Chang said.""I think that once the capital investment market is normal in China, when they have similar investment instruments to those abroad, then a lot of this money will leave aviation because they are not getting the yields.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The profitable 737 is Boeing's top-selling jet family and is crucial to hitting financial targets Boeing has set.""I'm frankly bullish on the airplane,"" Keith Leverkuhn, vice president and general manager of Boeing's 737 MAX program, said of the MAX 10X on a call with journalists. ""The conference down south at ISTAT was important,"" he added, referring to the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading event in San Diego that ended on Tuesday. But ""we're listening to customers around the globe...many of whom have expressed enthusiasm for it.""Leverkuhn said suppliers are willing to build components for the MAX 10X, which needs taller landing gear to accommodate its length. ""Suppliers are always interested in extending the capability of the (737) family,"" he said.Boeing pitched the MAX 10X to battle huge sales of rival Airbus' (PA:AIR) A321neo, which seats more passengers than the 737 MAX 9 that Boeing is already building. Boeing rolled the first MAX 9 out of the factory on Tuesday, and plans to begin delivering it next year.The heads of two major aircraft leasing companies said at ISTAT that the MAX 10X is not a thriller for their customers and would eat into sales of other MAX models. Lessors buy aircraft but don't operate them, meaning they have a different perspective than airlines.Boeing already is offering the MAX 10X to airlines, though it has not yet formally decided to go ahead with it. Leverkuhn said it would be a 66-inch (1.68 m) stretch of the MAX 9, adding 12 seats and giving the MAX 10X ""eye-watering economics"" versus the Airbus A321neo. The plane would be timed to reach customers in 2020, and would be developed after the other MAX models.Leverkuhn said Boeing has built 13 MAX 8 jets, and held a key meeting with regulators on Tuesday, meaning the model should be certified soon so deliveries can begin in the second quarter.Boeing shares were flat at $182.08 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airplane makers typically line up orders before deciding whether to formally undertake building a new aircraft. SpiceJet and Jet Airways have the option to substitute some of their existing orders of MAX planes with the MAX-10, Keskar said.In January, budget airline SpiceJet agreed to buy 100 new 737 MAXs aircraft with an option for 50 more, while Jet Airways had 75 orders for the 737 MAX through January 2017.SpiceJet and Jet Airways did not respond to requests for comment.Boeing is creating up to five versions of MAX, which will replace the current 737 ""NG"" introduced in 1997 and offer greater fuel efficiency.The company has been looking at the feasibility of the 737 MAX-10 - the biggest aircraft in the MAX family - to take on rival Airbus (PA:AIR), which has had strong sales of its A321neo, its largest single-aisle aircraft.The first MAX model in production, the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. The A321neo competes with Boeing's MAX-9, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats as many as 220 passengers. The A321neo seats as many as 236 and has a list price of $127 million. Keskar said the incremental cost to operate the MAX-10 is going to be very little and airlines may face slightly higher costs on fuel, food and an extra cabin attendant.

The statement made no mention of specific price reductions Spirit is seeking or plans to move work overseas.Executives at supplier companies said Spirit is telling them in the meetings that they are bidding against U.S. and overseas rivals and against Spirit's own fabrication facilities. ""They say, 'If you don't do this, we have other suppliers that will.' That's the leverage,"" said the chief executive of a U.S. metal parts supplier who met with Spirit recently. ""There's a massive threat of offshoring and an additional threat of insourcing.""Many suppliers learned about the re-bidding from Spirit's letter last month, according to the sources, who spoke in recent days and on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about contract details. At least one supplier already has lost all its work with Spirit, worth millions of dollars annually, to Asian suppliers who bid with lower prices, one of the sources said.Spirit's statement from last month said it is not tearing up existing contracts.""Spirit honors its contractual obligations. Our focus is on negotiating new contracts - well in advance of expiration,"" said the statement. But many Spirit contracts contain ""termination for convenience"" clauses that mean they can be ended at will, according to the sources and industry consultants.Spirit said its target prices for more than 50,000 parts are based on what materials, labor and overhead should cost if companies are sourcing efficiently and using the most modern production equipment. ""We work collaboratively with our suppliers to help them achieve those targets,"" it said in the statement. If suppliers cannot hit the target, Spirit will outsource to others or take work in-house, the company said, noting plans to hire workers in Wichita for insourcing and to meet rising production at Boeing and Airbus.POLITICAL AND PRODUCTION RISKSShifting work offshore risks drawing a critical tweet from President Donald Trump, whose ""America First"" policy is intended in part to bring factory jobs back to the United States. It is also unusual, and risky, in an industry that relies on long-term agreements to ensure millions of complex, highly engineered parts reach aircraft factories on time. Many aerospace manufacturers have moved work to low-cost countries such as China, Mexico and Morocco. But Spirit's shifts to new suppliers could disrupt production at Boeing, Airbus and others if parts are late or defective, analysts and consultants said. The changes come as Boeing and Airbus are ramping up production and slashing costs to battle on price for orders, as airlines slow their purchases of new aircraft.Spirit Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile discussed some details of supplier actions at a Feb. 9 investor conference.But the Feb. 13 letter goes further, saying Spirit ""has launched a company-wide Strategic Sourcing Initiative"" and asking suppliers to send ""decision-makers"" to Wichita the week of Feb. 27 ""or have them available remotely"" so Spirit can ""have each proposal ready for a contract by the end of the day.""""Suppliers shall be awarded contracts based on results from an intense bid and contract award process,"" Spirit wrote in the letter, signed by Wendy Crossman, Spirit's director of supply chain management contractors.MASSIVE FACTORYSince Spirit spun off from Boeing in 2005, it has gone from being a Boeing factory to making parts for Airbus, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011), General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) Gulfstream,  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), Textron Inc's (N:TXT) Bell Helicopter, and  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) Sikorsky. It has facilities in three U.S. states, plus the UK, France and Malaysia.Its massive Wichita facility produces 42 fuselages a month for Boeing's 737 program, the complete front section of the 787 Dreamliner and many other Boeing components.Spirit said about 90 percent of its supply chain spending is made in the United States, including about $1.2 billion annually to more than 500 suppliers in Kansas and surrounding states. Gentile, who took over last July, has pushed for lower costs on the two-thirds of its overall spending that is made in the supply chain. In December, Spirit warned about 85 supplier contract administrators in Wichita that their jobs were at risk of being outsourced. Spirit later kept the work in-house. In February, Gentile noted many suppliers have ""very strong margins"" in structural airplane pieces.""That's an opportunity for us to take advantage of that and capture some of that margin,"" Gentile said.The company reported an operating margin of 10.7 percent in 2016, slightly below the industry average, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its 2016 revenue totaled $6.8 billion. Spirit's drive for greater profit margins is in line with Boeing, which is trying to double its margins to mid-teen percentages by 2020.Spirit's lower prices have already prompted some current U.S. suppliers to give up work. Spirit's targets are lower ""than what I gave them the last time,"" said the U.S. metals supplier chief executive, referring to past negotiations. ""It's bankruptcy-level pricing,"" he said.Spirit's ability to change contracts also bars companies from investing in new machinery, because they risk losing the work before earning back their costs, said the U.S. metals supplier chief executive. The chief executive of another U.S. company that makes metal aircraft parts said Spirit's actions were unprecedented in his decades in the industry.Said the executive, ""I've never seen anything like this in my career.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

710,"Feb 28, 2017 06:27AM ET",France: Reasons to be bullish despite election stress,nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - If financial markets are a guide, France is facing a perilous period of turbulence and uncertainty as the presidential election nears. But the underlying economy is telling a different story.While France's bond yields have spiked and its stocks have trailed the rest of the euro zone, as investors run scared of political risk, the country's economic prospects are actually looking up.French business confidence, consumer confidence and job creation are surging, while earnings expectations for big French companies are also improving. Whoever wins May's election - whether it be conservative Francois Fillon, far-right leader Marine Le Pen or centrist Emmanuel Macron - will start their five-year term with hiring at a decade high and the sluggish economy finally strengthening.Ironically they may have predecessor Francois Hollande to thank, as his business-friendly reforms could be bearing fruit at last - too late for the man whose failure to turn the economy around helped make him the most unpopular president in modern French history and pushed him towards the political exit.For a factbox on past reforms click For some large international investors, any risk aversion to France offers buying opportunities for stocks underpinned by robust fundamentals.""When markets apply a blanket negative response to an issue like France, we can come in and benefit our shareholders,"" said Steve Caruthers, an investment specialist in Los Angeles with Capital Group Companies Inc, which manages $1.4 trillion.""We have lots of companies within France that we have high conviction in today. They offer attractive valuations, certainly, compared to a lot of their U.S. competitors,"" said Caruthers, whose firm holds stakes in Airbus (PA:AIR), spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH). POLITICAL RISKOther bond and stock market investors fear the global populist revolt that propelled Brexit and Donald Trump could sweep Le Pen to power. A scandal over Fillon's payments of state money to family members has left the election with no clear favorite. Though polls put Le Pen in the lead to win the Apr. 23 first round of the two-round election, either Fillon or Macron are seen easily beating her in a May 7 runoff.She has however narrowed the gap with her rivals in second-round voting intention surveys, a development which last week drove the premium that investors demand to hold French over German debt to highs not seen since late 2012. ""Le Pen's campaign is gaining traction and we can't ignore that, even though her victory is hardly anybody's main scenario,"" said Hideo Shimomura, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management. Japanese investors, traditionally big buyers of French debt, have been net sellers in recent months, according to official data.Some funds say this is more about Japanese investors staying home as long-term yields rise there. Shimomura said that many Japanese institutional investors could also not buy ahead of their book-closing at the end of March.Meanwhile, French bond futures (FOATc1) - used to hedge risk and trade market swings - have seen record interest this month, while some equity investors have been looking for hedges against volatility around the election in put and call options.French stocks have also become the least preferred by portfolio managers in Europe, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey. France's CAC-40 blue-chip index is largely flat since the start of this year, while the Stoxx Europe index of euro zone shares has gained 2 percent. http://reut.rs/2kGj1GTThis is despite improving earnings expectations for French companies; the number of analysts upgrading their earnings expectations for the country's firms is now higher than the number downgrading for the first time since mid-2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) put the probability of a Le Pen presidency at no more than 15 percent, in a research note on Thursday, saying markets were overestimating the likelihood. REAL ECONOMYWhile markets stress about the election, business leaders appear largely unfazed, judging by the latest monthly purchasing managers surveys, which came in at a near six-year high. The surveys have exceeded expectations and, at least for the service sector, have surpassed levels seen in the stronger German economy on firming domestic demand. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhcHWGEven the long-struggling industrial sector is picking up, with morale rising more than expected this month, according to a monthly survey from the INSEE statistics agency.Official data this month also showed the economy created jobs in the fourth quarter at the fastest pace in a decade thanks to the services sector, which is by far the biggest sector in France. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhrTmJThe trend looks set to continue with the Labor Ministry reporting job vacancies running at a five-year high and employers planning on hiring a record 216,500 managerial level workers this year, according to the APEC association that represents them.The recovering economy could be down to Hollande's reforms over the past five years, which included a payroll tax credit scheme to boost firms profitability and looser labor market rules to encourage hiring, and are likely to benefit his successor.""Whatever party is elected, these measures will keep having a positive impact on (economic) activity,"" said economist Arthur Jurus at Switzerland's Mirabaud Asset Management.

713,"Feb 23, 2017 10:46AM ET",Exclusive: Airbus calls for European ministerial meeting on A400M,nan,"(Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has called for a European ministerial meeting to address the latest problems engulfing the A400M military plane, saying its own viability is at stake as it seeks government help to contain fresh losses on Europe's largest defense project.The move comes a day after Airbus took a fresh writedown of 1.2 billion euros against A400M losses and urged seven NATO buyer nations to limit its exposure to heavy fines and payment delays caused by new technical snags and delays.In a letter to government buyers, the company spoke of ""significant risks ahead"" on the project, originally valued at 20 billion euros and now costing well over 30 billion euros, according to two people familiar with the letter's contents.""We are committed to the A400M program. However we are responsible to sustain the viability of Airbus,"" said the letter signed by Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque and Chief Executive Tom Enders and sent to the capitals of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey and the UK.Noting ""huge losses"" on the project, Airbus called for a meeting of ministers of those nations to take stock of the situation and agree on next steps in the best interests of the program, government customers and Europe's defense industry.It also called for talks with Europrop International (EPI), the consortium responsible for providing the troop carrier's turboprop engines, which have been involved in some delays.EPI is owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), Germany's MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP) of Spain.An Airbus spokeswoman declined comment on Thursday on details of the company's contacts with governments, but said there would be three elements to any discussions: the nations, the OCCAR pan-European procurement agency and the engine makers.Engine consortium EPI could not immediately be reached for comment.A spokesman for OCCAR had said on Wednesday the agency was in regular and ongoing dialogue with Airbus, but declined comment on the company's request for new measures.Airbus received a 3.5 billion euro bailout from the seven core purchasing nations in 2010, but has suggested it did not go far enough in limiting the company's financial exposure.Defence officials from the seven nations were expected to confer by telephone on Airbus requests as early as Thursday.Germany, the largest A400M buyer, has so far given a cool response, saying it is important that Airbus should resolve outstanding problems on the military program.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

714,"Feb 22, 2017 01:14PM ET",Airbus seeks new European help over A400M costs,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) called on Wednesday for new talks with European governments to ease ""heavy penalties"" for delays to its A400M military aircraft, after taking a fresh 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) charge for Europe's largest defense project.The appeal comes seven years after Airbus won what at the time was regarded as a definitive 3.5 billion euro bailout for the delayed project, plagued from the start by political wrangling over the choice of new European engines.Airbus said recent problems with engine gearboxes and delays in supplying defensive aids had led to severe penalties, bureaucratic arguments and cash being held back by governments.""We cannot go on like that. This is unacceptable and puts a huge burden on Airbus and we need to do something about it,"" Chief Executive Tom Enders said.The A400M was ordered in 2003 by seven NATO nations -- Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Britain and Turkey -- to grant Europe an independent military transport capability.An unusual fixed-price contract worth 20 billion euros reflected efforts by Airbus at the time to win a major military contract to add to its growing jetliner business.But it foundered over problems with the West's largest turboprop engines, which were to be supplied by a European consortium instead of Airbus's preference for a Canadian supplier, as well as tight deadlines for military hardware.Speaking after reporting lower 2016 profits, Enders argued Airbus was still paying for the ""original sin"" of striking an unrealistic deal 14 years ago, despite having reset the program with the 2010 bailout deal.The pan-European agency representing the buyers was not available for comment. But Germany, the largest A400M buyer which has been most critical of the project, expressed little immediate appetite to help Airbus cope with the latest issues.""It is important that the manufacturer resolves the current problems in the program,"" a defense ministry spokesman said.Tobias Lindner, a Green lawmaker and member of the German parliament's budget committee, urged the government to press for ""a new and resilient"" agreement without reducing penalties.CALL FOR REASSURANCEEnders, who is said to privately regret not cancelling the project before the bailout in 2010, declined to say if Airbus would threaten to stop building the plane. Airbus shares fell about 1 percent on news of the 1.2 billion euro charge, which brings the total amount it has written off on the A400M towards 7 billion euros.Raymond James analyst Harry Breach wrote that Airbus needed to reassure investors the stream of charges was nearing an end.Several others questioned how easily Airbus would be able to strike a new A400M deal in the midst of budget austerity, French and German elections and political distractions in a group of nations dealing with Brexit and conflict in Syria.""I am not sure that the states will agree to put their hands in their pockets once again,"" said Chloe Lemarie, director of aerospace and defense research at Mainfirst Bank in Paris. The A400M overshadowed a narrower-than-expected drop in 2016 core earnings as Airbus delivered a record 688 jetliners.Core operating income fell 4 percent to 3.955 billion euros on revenues up 3 percent. Analysts had expected a 7 percent drop in core profit due to weaker pricing of old models. Airbus said bottlenecks in the supply chain for its A350 jet had improved, but called for a ""huge effort"" from engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to ease delays in A320neo output. It predicted more than 700 jetliner deliveries in 2017.It did not give a formal target for orders but executives say they will lag deliveries for the first time since 2009 as the aircraft market slows.(Additional erporting by Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold in Berlin; editing by Keith Weir)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

716,"Feb 21, 2017 11:36AM ET",Airbus faces multiple challenges as it enters new era,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus will draw a line under two decades of M&A dealmaking and frenetic orders on Wednesday as it reports its first results since the European aerospace and defense group unified under its dominant planemaking arm last month.The sense of Airbus entering a new era is palpable, with the complex reorganization set in motion by the swallowing of parent Airbus Group (PA:AIR) (formerly EADS), by the subsidiary it was created to oversee, coinciding with waning demand from airlines.The company is expected to report a 7 percent drop in full-year core earnings and confirm that orders for new planes this year will drop below the number of jets it delivers for only the second time in 14 years.Mounting legal problems, uncertainty over two major programs and a changing of the guard among senior management also blur the outlook for Europe's largest aerospace company.EADS was created in 2000 from multiple mergers to form a civil and defense giant, incorporating the older Airbus, and later became Airbus Group.After failing to buy BAE Systems (LON:BAES) in 2012, defense ambitions dimmed and the era of shareholder-led consolidation is now drawing to a close, with Airbus Group absorbed by its Airbus planemaking subsidiary. The technical completion of the internal merger is due to take place later this year.In a careful reshuffle, Tom Enders keeps overall leadership but can only achieve this by resuming his former post as head of the planemaker ""Airbus SAS"" -- until now merely a division.That means Fabrice Bregier has had to abandon the civil business's separate CEO privileges to became chief operating officer of the wider group as a powerful No.2 -- a delicate move in a company with a long history of see-sawing job moves.How that balance works in the coming months is seen as key to avoiding a resumption of political in-fighting that could prove a worrying distraction as the company prepares for a number of high-profile departures over the next 1-2 years.Group strategy chief Marwan Lahoud, 50, announced plans to step down this month and commercial sales chief John Leahy, 66, has already scheduled his retirement in 2018, though some believe he could step down before the end of this year.Two top executives credited with improving industrial performance -- operations head Tom Williams and programs chief Didier Evrard -- are also nearing retirement, though Airbus says that any changes will be gradual.CULTURE CLASHTaken collectively, however, the looming changes suggest that the relentless drive for market share under Leahy, and M&A under Lahoud, have peaked.""It is a move away from the traditional managers, cheerleaders and engineers towards the bottom line-focused crowd,"" said Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia.The internal overhaul also brings a shift in power from heavyweight engineers to a new breed of managers.Convinced that digital technology will alter the way aircraft are made, Enders recently hired 36-year-old ex-Google executive Paul Eremenko as chief technology officer.The appointment has raised questions among some Airbus watchers over how long engineering chief Charles Champion will stay at the company. Champion could not be reached for comment.Company tensions have also been inflamed by a UK investigation into the use of middlemen to sell jets, people close to the matter say. Legal exposure widened when Austria instigated legal action against Airbus last week, alleging fraud related to a fighter jet order in 2003. Airbus denied the allegations.Also consuming attention are concerns about the delayed A400M military aircraft and questions over the future of the A380 superjumbo.The loss of a Singapore Airlines order to rival Boeing (N:BA) completed a shaky start to the year, blamed by some on a flat-footed response to calls for a larger A350 variant.On the positive side, analysts say that Airbus can look forward to a boost from a strong dollar as hedges unwind. And it remains well ahead in orders for the latest medium-haul jets, a lifeline for future developments.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It then ordered a review of the purchase four years ago following bribery allegations. The deal was controversial from the outset and allegations surfaced almost immediately after its announcement in 2003 that money was pocketed by politicians, civil servants and others via brokers for side deals accompanying the purchase.A European defense executive, asking not to be identified, said Eurofighter had won the deal with the lowest price.The Eurofighter is built by a consortium comprising Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF) as well as Airbus, which represents the other two nations in the European project: Germany and Spain.Airbus and the consortium illegally charged nearly 10 percent of the purchase price of 1.96 billion euros for so-called offset deals, according to the defense ministry's findings.While offset deals - which involve work being given to local companies - were part of the agreement, their cost should have been reported separately, it said in a report.Airbus and Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, which coordinates the production of the aircraft and is headquartered in Munich, also deceived Austria about its ability and will to deliver the agreed equipment, the report said.The Eurofighter consortium was not immediately available to comment.The ministry said its damages estimate of up to 1.1 billion euros related to extra costs paid for the Eurofighter compared with a jet from another bidder and higher operating expenses.Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace group, has said it is co-operating with a separate German probe into the fighter sale to Austria, as well as three probes into suspected irregularities in defense or security markets, including a UK investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia.($1 = 0.9400 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""But I don't see a bust cycle"" unless there's a trade war, he added.An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production.Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defense spending is expected to rise at least initially under U.S. President Donald Trump, he added.Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the U.S. aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since World War II, he added.A U.S. trade dispute with China would likely benefit European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the U.S. by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned ramp up in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue. The two plane makers plan to increase output by more than 30 percent through the end of the decade and need the income from these high-volume assembly lines to hit their financial targets.""This is the part of the market where you're going to see continued growth,"" he said.But twin-aisle aircraft face a much tougher future because there are more models competing while demand is declining.

723,"Feb 14, 2017 01:22PM ET",Boeing expects 737 MAX-9 to fly in April as larger version takes shape,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it plans to fly its new 737 MAX-9 aircraft for the first time in April, a further sign the company will start delivering the large version of the workhorse plane in 2018.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 ""NG"" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world's largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present. The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year.""We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks,"" Keith Leverkuhn, 737 general manager, said at a Monday briefing embargoed until Tuesday. The stamp of approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would come about a year after the MAX-8's first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the $110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, likely ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 percent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 percent by 2020.Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April.MAX-10 TAKES SHAPEBoeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus (PA:AIR), which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 66 inches (1.68 m) longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year ""to see which one ... is going to be the best solution,"" Leverkuhn said.Boeing is about 90 percent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line.Sales of Boeing's larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 percent this year. It will rely on the 737 and 787 to make up a large part of the financial difference.Introducing new models while increasing production rates requires Boeing to solve any factory issues quickly. So far, Leverkuhn said, ""the hours to build the MAX are meeting our expectation.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The German and Dutch militaries have already knitted together closely some land forces and naval elements in what analysts and military officials say could be a model for deeper security cooperation in Europe in the future.""The German military cooperates with the French, the Dutch and others, but the cooperation with the Dutch is by far the least complicated,"" said Tim Stuchtey, executive director of the Brandenburg Institute for Society and Security in Potsdam.

725,"Feb 09, 2017 04:17PM ET","Boeing's $14 billion Singapore Air order does not fill 777, 787 gap: CEO",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) must sell more 777 and 787 jetliners to keep production plans on track, despite a $13.8 billion order that landed earlier on Thursday, its chief executive said.The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said.But the win over rival Airbus (PA:AIR) did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co.Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 percent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered.""When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on,"" Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month.Boeing shares were up 0.4 percent at $164.42 in afternoon trading.The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model.Muilenburg said the airplane market is still ""very healthy"" with passenger traffic growing 5 percent to 6 percent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about 2 percent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages.Boeing has already cut 777 output to 7 planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to 5 a month in August. Deliveries - which generate the bulk of airline payments - will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said.Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 percent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said.Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. ""These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs,"" he said. ""The economic value to the U.S. is real.""He also saw prospects for more U.S. defense sales, noting ""re-emerging strength"" in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the U.S. Air Force, which has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

728,"Feb 08, 2017 01:23PM ET","Canada gives aid to Bombardier, vows to defend any trade dispute",nan,"By Allison LampertMONTREAL (Reuters) - The Canadian government on Tuesday announced C$372.5 million ($283 million) in repayable loans for two of Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) jet programs, promising to defend the deal against a potential trade challenge by Brazil.While the aid was far less than the $1 billion originally sought by the Canadian plane and train maker, Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare called it the right level of support, saying the company's financial situation had improved.The interest-free loans, which come from a Canadian aerospace and defense fund targeting research and development projects, will be used for Bombardier's new CSeries jet and the Global 7000 business jet.The contributions will be provided over four years with the majority allocated to the Global 7000 program and will not be repaid on a scheduled basis.The move risks exacerbating trade wounds with rival jetmaking nation Brazil, which has already threatened to take Canada to the World Trade Organization over a $1 billion injection by Quebec for the CSeries.Asked about the potential ramifications of the new aid, Canada Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said: ""We'll fight that wherever we need to fight that.""""I'm very much prepared to defend what we're doing,"" Champagne added, noting other countries supported their aerospace sectors.Bellemare said both the earlier funding from Quebec and the new federal money complied with WTO rules.Bombardier initially asked Canada to match Quebec's investment in the CSeries, but negotiations dragged on for more than a year as the Liberal government made requests of the company, such as changes to its dual-class governing structure.Quebec's spending on the CSeries, along with a separate $1.5 billion investment by the province's largest pension fund in Bombardier's rail division, already risks triggering a trade feud between the company and Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).Brazil on Wednesday will request the WTO start consultations on a dispute involving the two companies around Quebec's funding, Brazil's Foreign Ministry said. Bombardier's CSeries competes with some Embraer jets and the smallest products of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR).Reimbursable loans are a pillar of the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual transatlantic claims of unfair support for aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing.The WTO found government loans used by European Union member states to support Airbus airplane developments constituted unfair subsidies, prompting the threat of U.S. sanctions. The case has yet to complete lengthy WTO legal and compliance processes.($1 = C$1.3182)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

731,"Jan 30, 2017 02:45PM ET",Visa row overshadows Iranian investment drive and plane deals,nan,"By Parisa Hafezi and Tim HepherANKARA/PARIS (Reuters) - A row over U.S. visa bans may further weaken Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's efforts to attract foreign investors to Iran, particularly if it slows the implementation of deals for Western aircraft, officials and analysts said.The deals for 80 Boeing (N:BA) jets and 100 from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) struck last year are seen by Western investors as a crucial test as they seek business in Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal that led to the lifting of most sanctions.People involved in the airline deals say it is too early to assess the impact of the U.S. visa ban but worry that hardening rhetoric in Tehran and Washington can only add to a list of complications that could slow, if not endanger, the jet sales.While Airbus planes come from Europe, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump can veto the sale of all the planes to Iran because of the widespread use of U.S. parts in the aircraft which need U.S. export licenses.The visa ban could also prolong a hiatus in talks about financing deliveries of jets, with European and Chinese banks reluctant to put up money to back Iranian jet purchases for fear of a backlash against their U.S. operations.""It will make people more nervous, more risk-averse, more inclined to wait and see,"" said a senior Western financier, who asked not to be named.Iranian officials say that even before Trump imposed restrictions on travel to the United States from seven mainly Muslim countries, concerns about what the new U.S. president might do had already put the brakes on post-sanctions business.During his election campaign, Trump criticized the nuclear accord six major powers struck with Iran and his victory in November increased uncertainty around Iran's investment drive.FINAL RULING""The process has been very slow ... foreign investors were very interested to work in Iran, but since Trump's election the process has almost stopped. Investors are worried about possible U.S. punishments if they work with Iran,"" a senior economy ministry official told Reuters.Final decisions on whether the plane deals go ahead may well lie with Trump and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate broker in the country's faction-ridden politics who has the last say on key matters. Since taking office this month, Trump has largely ignored the Iranian jet deals in public, even as he lambasted U.S. aerospace firms including Boeing about other projects.For now, at least, Boeing appears comfortable that Trump won't automatically block its deal, though questions also remain over further approvals from Iran, two industry sources said.Boeing and Europe's Airbus declined comment.Still, any long-term U.S. travel curbs could also undermine the case for long-distance jets capable of linking Tehran with expatriate communities in cities such as Los Angeles. Boeing plans to start delivering its large 777 jets in 2018.IranAir has already canceled orders for Airbus A380 superjumbos, initially meant to signal its ambitions to compete on equal terms with the hubs of Gulf rivals.Besides the Boeing and Airbus orders, state airline IranAir is planning to buy 20 small Franco-Italian ATR turboprops to help expand economic development to smaller Iranian cities.But officials say a final deal has been held up due to uncertainty over some licenses for engines made by a Canadian subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney, America's top military engine maker and supplier to the colossal F-35 fighter project.Pratt & Whitney is seen to be wary of the political risks of dealing with Iran, especially with the F-35 project at the center of Trump's criticism of aerospace firms for going over budget.A Pratt & Whitney Canada spokesman said it was, ""working closely with ATR to ensure all necessary licenses are in place prior to providing any products or services"".SHOWCASE FLIGHTSThe renewal of Iran's unsafe, elderly fleet is also a major political battleground ahead of presidential elections in May as Rouhani's failure to boost the economy a year after the lifting of sanctions intensifies political infighting.Hardliners blame Rouhani for failing to deliver a swift improvement in domestic living standards following the nuclear deal, at a time when prices for oil exports are low and the promised foreign investment has yet to arrive.They have singled out long-range jets for particular criticism, arguing that they only benefit rich travelers.""The economy is the main factor for most of the Iranian voters ... Rouhani was hoping that the deal with major planemakers will encourage other investors to come to Iran,"" said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian.""That is why hardliners are mainly focused on criticizing this deal. Basically, Rouhani's political career depends on this deal.""One senior Iranian official said he doubted the aircraft deals would be ditched altogether.""I don't think the deal will be canceled because Rouhani signed it with the approval of the Supreme Leader ... but he might be forced to cancel some of the orders to save the deals,"" said one senior official.Others were more cautious, saying foreign investors would avoid being targeted by Trump for doing business with Iran.""This is good news for Rouhani's rivals,"" said another senior official, referring to the U.S. visa restrictions.For now, IranAir appears anxious is get airplanes into the country as an urgent priority ahead of May's presidential election, demonstrating tangible results from the nuclear deal.But so far, just one aircraft has been delivered: an Airbus A321, paid for in cash. It was promptly deployed widely on domestic routes in an apparent effort to showcase the benefits of the lifting of sanctions.In its first 12 days, Iran's first brand-new jet in decades covered 46,000 km (29,000 miles) between 15 cities, from the Kurdish city of Kermanshah in the West to the Shi'ite holy city of Mashhad in the northeast, according to FlightRadar24 data.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,"" Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television.""To annul world trade accords does not help their economy and does not serve the development and blooming of the world economy,"" Rouhani told a tourism conference in Tehran. ""This is the day for the world to get closer through trade."" The protectionist-minded Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact.Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran's relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions.For Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, the agreement was a landmark foreign policy achievement but the new president has threatened to annul it or seek a better deal. The other five powers party to the deal have reaffirmed their commitment to it.Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was ""meaningless"".Since sanctions were lifted, Iran has signed major deals with Western firms, particularly with planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA).Rouhani said on Saturday: ""Today is the time for peaceful co-existence, not the time to create distance among nations.""Rouhani made no direct reference to Trump's order on Friday curbing the entry of refugees into the United States and temporarily barring travelers from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Trump said the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The sum is up from a record $10.5 billion in 2016 and well above the $10.4 billion that analysts had forecast for 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The Chicago-based aerospace and defense company forecast 2017 core earnings of $9.10 to $9.30 a share, which exclude some pension and other costs, up from $7.24 in 2016.Cost-cutting and productivity gains fueled Boeing's strong performance and forecast, and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he sees no signs of a slowdown on that front.""This will be a relentless effort going forward,"" he said on a conference call, referring to Boeing's efficiency drive. ""While we've made some strong strides over the last couple of years, and you see it reflected in the performance, we have much more ahead of us than what's behind us.""Orders for new jetliners have slowed sharply after peaking in 2014. Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have focused on streamlining factories to lower costs and drive profits. Boeing has also benefited from lower costs for parts for its 787 as the plane reaches key production milestones. It delivered its 500th 787 in December.Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, topping 748 deliveries in 2016, likely enough to keep the title of world's biggest plane maker.Boeing said its outlook showed confidence in its ability to continue smooth operating performance and cost-cutting while raising plane output.Some analysts questioned whether the cash performance will last into 2018, after Boeing cuts production of its 777 by 40 percent this year, begins assembly of the successor 777X model and goes into full production of the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker.Boeing said it took an aftertax tanker-related charge of $201 million in the fourth quarter due to initial production problems.""And that's not assuming any change in end-market demand, where trends have arguably been weakening,"" Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note to clients.Boeing said deliveries of its smaller 737 and 737 MAX models will make up for the decline in 777 production. And it suggested the upward trend in performance won't falter.""Over the remainder of the decade, we continue to expect to see revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the call. The forecast includes a planned increase in the 787 production rate, which has been in question as sales have slowed.Muilenburg said recent meetings with President Donald Trump's show a pro-business attitude that should help Boeing.

735,"Jan 25, 2017 01:50PM ET","Ryanair in cooperation talks with AlItalia, to fight Lufthansa deal",nan,"By Victoria Bryan and Conor HumphriesDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) is in talks about providing connecting flights to AlItalia's long-haul services and has raised objections with German authorities about a Lufthansa-Air Berlin tie-up, as it tries to ease its expansion in continental Europe.The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, is looking to add 11 million passengers in the year to March 2018 and has frozen expansion in top market Britain in the wake of its decision to leave the European Union.But it is unlikely to look to acquisitions to fuel that growth due to inefficiencies at rivals and the fact most have Airbus (PA:AIR) fleets, rather than Boeing (N:BA) planes as used by Ryanair, CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters in an interview. Ryanair is currently in talks with AlItalia about providing feeder flights to its long-haul hubs in a deal that could help the Italian flag carrier curb losses on short-haul flights. AlItalia is undergoing restructuring amid uncertainty around major shareholder Etihad, which this week said it would review its European investment strategy following the departure of its chief executive James Hogan.""We can help them by offering them cheap feed, low-cost feed into their hubs ... but that means taking out aircraft, people, and that's very difficult politically in Italy,"" O'Leary said. ""We are still talking to them.""FEEDER FLIGHTSRyanair, which exclusively operates short-haul point-to-point services, is hoping to pilot a system of feeding long-haul flights in the coming months. O'Leary said he hoped such plans with Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) and Aer Lingus (L:ICAG) could start in May. The integration of their booking systems has delayed the signing of deals, he said. Ryanair is offering long-haul carriers the ability to book its seats for resale at the same prices offered to customers on its own website. The long-haul carriers would take full responsibility for missed connections, though Ryanair would pay fines under EU rules for flights over three hours late, he said. In addition to Italy, Ryanair is targeting Germany, Europe's second-largest aviation market after Britain, and O'Leary said he planned to fight Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) recent agreement to lease 38 crewed planes from low-cost Air Berlin for six years. O'Leary said the lease was a ""fig leaf"" to mask the acquisition of its main domestic competitor, which he said would raise their combined market share to 63 percent. ""It is nothing other than a takeover,"" O'Leary said. Ryanair has submitted its concerns to Germany's competition authority, which said on Wednesday it would make a decision by the end of the month on whether to review the deal. ""They have been very receptive,"" O'Leary said. OVERCAPACITYOvercapacity in the short-haul market will continue to force fares lower in Europe in the coming year, but the rate may slow from a high single digit percentage drop to a low-single digit one, O'Leary said, while adding there were many variables. ""The outcome for fares depends on what happens on Brexit and economic confidence in UK and Europe, what happens to oil, and unforeseen security events,"" he said. Ryanair, which is due to release results for the three months ending December, its fiscal third quarter, on Feb. 6, will continue to return cash to shareholders so long as profits continue to grow, he added. ""As long as profitability continues to rise from 1.25 billion (euros) last year, in line with traffic, ... I see no reason why share buy backs shouldn’t continue, absent unforeseen shocks,"" O'Leary said. Ryanair may also tap bond markets again if rates remain low, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The CEO of Garuda from 2005 to 2014 was Emirsyah Satar, who is now chairman of Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group's e-commerce platform MatahariMall.com.In a phone message to Reuters, Satar denied wrongdoing but said that it was the authority of the KPK to name him as a suspect and that he will respect the legal process.""As far as I know, when I was the CEO of PT Garuda Indonesia, I had never done corrupt activities and I did not receive anything that was related to my position,"" Satar said.MatahariMall said it supported the legal process in Indonesia, but declined further comment. Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Airbus said the company had no comment on the issue.The KPK said it found evidence that ""ESA"" had received 20 billion rupiah ($1.5 million) of cash and items worth $2 million in Singapore and Indonesia from another suspect.KPK Chairman Agus Rahardjo said at a news briefing its probe was directed against individuals, and would not affect Garuda's operations. Garuda's vice president for corporate communication, Benny S.

""With flying, you don't need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads,"" he said.Enders said Airbus, as the world's largest maker of commercial helicopters, wanted to invest to make the most of new technologies such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, to usher in what amounts to an era of flying cars.""If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business,"" he said.A spokesman for Airbus declined to say how much the company was investing in urban mobility."

740,"Jan 13, 2017 07:02PM ET",Airbus versus Boeing: Iran deals the difference in plane battle,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market.On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago.Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight.While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country.It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018. Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition.During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009.Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order.Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening.Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

741,"Jan 12, 2017 05:20AM ET",India's SpiceJet to seal $10 billion deal with Boeing for 737 jets: sources,nan,"By Anshuman Daga and Tommy WilkesSINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing (N:BA), two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into India's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said.The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement.An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus (PA:AIR) has won record-sized orders with IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.India is the world's fastest growing aviation market, showing double-digit growth in annual passenger numbers thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes.SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of the 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders.Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo.Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The other two aircraft were bought back from another customer that no longer needs them and are unused, sales chief John Leahy said.IranAir was expected to take delivery of the first aircraft in France later on Wednesday.Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications.But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy.Industry orders peaked in 2015. Leahy warned of a further slowdown in orders in 2017 and said Airbus would be unable to sell as many aircraft as it delivers this year.But he dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically ""overbook"" to dampen the risk of airline failures.Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise ""for several years"" despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

She said the group will be a ""megaphone"" to spread the message that aerospace jobs in Washington state are at risk. ""We are in a competition to keep them here,"" she said. ""Any state in the country would die to get these jobs.""The group, Aerospace Works for Washington, also could be involved in other issues, such as efforts by the European Union to roll back the tax incentives under World Trade Organization rules, Daudon said.Chicago-based Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, has its largest manufacturing centers in Washington state, employing 72,000 people, and is the state's largest private employer.As with previous efforts to change the tax law, ""Boeing is opposed to any effort to alter the Washington aerospace tax incentives,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday.""Changing the parameters of the incentives now would simply increase the cost of building airplanes in this state, and unnecessarily put excellent, family-wage jobs in Washington at risk.""Aerospace Works for Washington has more than 30 members, including elected leaders, economic development organizations and chambers of commerce from regions in the state where Boeing and other aerospace manufacturers have factories. It includes trade groups of retailers, restaurants, hotels and other industries. Alaska Airlines, owned by  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK), is also a member. No labor groups are involved. Preserving the tax breaks has become a key issue since the incentives passed in 2013. The law said the tax cuts were designed to ""maintain and grow"" aerospace employment in the state. They are available to any aerospace manufacturer, not just Boeing. Despite the passage of the tax breaks three years ago, Boeing has since eliminated 11,414 jobs in Washington, about 15 percent of its workforce in the state, according to the company's employment data.The reductions are part of a cost-cutting drive at the aerospace and defense company in response to competition from European rival Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) and recent years of constricted U.S. defense spending, Boeing has said.Boeing's job reductions have prompted some legislators to argue that the company should maintain a certain number of jobs or lose the incentives. Boeing said it fulfilled its commitment to locate the assembly line and wing factory for its new 777X aircraft in the state.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

747,"Jan 09, 2017 10:46AM ET","Exclusive: Airbus may post 8 percent rise in 2016 deliveries, narrow gap with Boeing",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements.The European planemaker was forced to sharply accelerate deliveries in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year.It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo.One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670.Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing (N:BA), but its upward trajectory contrasts with the 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is also the latest evidence that planemakers are boosting deliveries to whittle down record order backlogs and hoard cash as they face warnings of slowing demand later this decade.Boeing temporarily slowed output last year for industrial reasons but, like Airbus, plans further output increases.An Airbus spokesman declined to comment.The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday.Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter.The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29.""I was amazed,"" said a veteran of such operations.Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal with India's GoAir. It may also announce a significant order from Saudi carrier flynas. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATIONAirbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies.Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo.Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive.On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates.But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents.Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say.Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation.The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets.The program took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

748,"Jan 06, 2017 04:09PM ET","Boeing's 2016 orders lowest since 2010, deliveries hit target",nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year.Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes.Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday.Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading.Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's ""book to bill"" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, ""it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing,"" said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. ""That says something about the production system,"" said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies.OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOWDeliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production.""What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production,"" said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results.The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said.The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways.Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX.The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The order is valued at more than $4 billion at current list prices. Delta, in its statement, did not disclose specific terms of the agreement. The airline, which acquired Northwest in 2008 for $2.6 billion in shares, said it would continue to take delivery of 737-900ER aircraft through 2019.Delta declined to comment beyond its statement.The cancellation comes as Delta and other top U.S. airlines seek to slow flight capacity growth and in some instances shrink existing service in response to falling airfares.Airlines like  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) from outside the United States are adding flights that Delta says have exceeded passenger demand and hurt unit revenue.Delta has 25 widebody aircraft from Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR), the A350, already slated for delivery that will add to its flight capacity this decade. Delta said earlier this year that it would defer the delivery of four A350s by a year or two from 2018 to make the schedule ""more consistent with (the) expected pace of international market improvement.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The company's deliveries started the year below trend because of problems with supplies of engines and cabin parts, including the Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) Geared Turbofan engine that required extra time for cooling before restarting under some circumstances.Some versions of the A321 will now come equipped with CFM engines, known as the LEAP-1A and made by a joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA of France (PA:SAF), expected to reach customers in early 2017."
757,"Dec 20, 2016 03:10PM ET",Embraer calls for industry limits on aircraft development funding,nan,"By Brad HaynesSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) called on Tuesday for the aviation industry to set limits on state funding of aircraft development, a day after Brazil said it would challenge Canada over government support for rival  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).Embraer Chief Executive Paulo Cesar Silva said the aviation industry's standards for export financing by state banks had worked well to promote fair competition between Embraer, Bombardier and larger peers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR).""If the industry can establish a framework for aircraft development financing similar to what we have for export financing, then we'll have a level playing field,"" Silva told journalists.The timing may be tough for an industry accord, however, after Brazil said on Monday it would dispute investments made by the province of Quebec in Bombardier's CSeries, which helped to develop a direct competitor for Embraer's E-195.Silva said the capital injection had helped Bombardier sell the CSeries at cut-rate prices to Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) in April and there were signs of similarly aggressive pricing in other ongoing U.S. sales campaigns.Bombardier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest standoff at the World Trade Organization (WTO) recalls nearly a decade of sparring between Brazil and Canada over state financing for Embraer and Bombardier's exports. Silva's comments on the rules that settled those disputes shows the Brazilians may be looking ahead to industry-wide talks.Silva said it is especially important to set limits as new entrants from Russia, Japan and China are challenging Embraer's and Bombardier's duopoly in the regional jet market, in some cases with generous government backing.""This is a market that can barely fit two players. Five is impossible,"" Silva said.Making matters worse, Silva said demand in the aviation industry is passing through a softer cycle, making 2017 a challenging year. Structural changes to the executive aviation market, with the rise of fractional ownership companies such as NetJets in the United States, have also given buyers more leverage in an already weak market for new private jets, Silva said.Embraer shares fell 2 percent on Silva's downbeat outlook to their lowest in two months.One bright spot for Embraer is the defense division, which is expected to start delivering the new KC-390 military cargo jet to the Brazilian Air Force in 2018. Jackson Schneider, head of Embraer's defense division, told journalists he expected to book another order for the KC-390 in 2017.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Conner is now vice chairman.""To successfully compete and win new orders that will fund future product development and growth requires us to achieve much better performance,"" Conner and McAllister said in a memo to Boeing Commercial Airplane employees on Monday.Boeing ""will need to do more in 2017"" to lower costs and make its planes more affordable, the memo said.Boeing shares were up 1.1 percent at $156.19.For 2016, Boeing said it expects job reductions to total 8 percent of the commercial airplanes workforce, including a 10 percent reduction in the ranks of executives and managers. The unit cut 6,115 jobs, or 7.3 percent, through November compared with the tally on Dec. 31, 2015, according to Boeing's employment data. That suggests a further 565 job reductions in 2016, and more next year. In March, the company said it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs at the unit. The company is offering a voluntary layoff program in early 2017, according to Monday's memo, which added that involuntary layoffs may occur in some cases. A spokesman said employees participating in the voluntary layoff program will receive a lump sum payment of one week's pay for each year served, for a maximum of 26 weeks.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This is the first step in that commitment.""The investment is part of a $1.2 billion fundraising by OneWeb, which is seeking to provide affordable internet access to people around the world with satellites.The remaining $200 million will be funded by its current investors, which include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and Virgin Group. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.In making his $50 billion pledge in the meeting with Trump, Son said his investment would create 50,000 new jobs, a move the U.S. President-elect claimed was a direct result of his election win.The latest investment will come directly from SoftBank, not from a $100 billion tech fund it is launching with Saudi Arabia, even though Son has said that large-scale investments would be made through the tech fund to avoid a further expansion of its debt.OneWeb, established in 2012 and based in Arlington, Virginia, plans to use the funds to build a plant in Florida to produce low-cost satellites, creating almost 3,000 new jobs in the United States over the next four years.Son is steering SoftBank, a diverse company that holds stakes in U.S. carrier Sprint , Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and other firms, towards cutting-edge tech investments as the telecoms services markets mature.

764,"Dec 13, 2016 02:43PM ET",JetBlue to double share buyback as checked bag fees boost revenue,nan,"By Alana Wise and Jeffrey DastinNEW YORK (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Tuesday said it was earning more than expected from checked bag fees and higher-priced fares and it plans to double the money it will return to shareholders via stock buybacks.The New York-based airline said new fares and fees for add-ons it rolled out last year, including a $20 checked bag charge for its lowest-fare customers, generated an expected $260 million in 2016, compared with a prior forecast of $200 million.As part of the windfall, the carrier is expanding its share repurchase program to $500 million from $250 million through 2019.JetBlue also said it planned to increase flight capacity between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent in 2017, down slightly from 2016's growth.""We are able to grow at a rate higher than the industry average and also deliver (pre-tax profit) margins that are above industry average,"" Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said in an interview.When asked about potentially buying CSeries jets from  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), Hayes said. ""As an aviation buff, I'm a fan of the plane,"" he said, but added that JetBlue is not actively looking to order aircraft after a recent deal with Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR).JetBlue's shares were up 4.6 percent in mid-afternoon trading, partly on better-than-expected unit revenue guidance reported on Monday.The company said it would generate up to $300 million in annual cost savings by 2020, including up to $65 million from evaluating suppliers and spending at airports as well as automating more of the customer experience.Staff, once constrained to stay behind a counter, will be free to approach customers who need help most, interim Chief Financial Officer Jim Leddy said in the interview.The change is not about headcount and will ""not necessarily"" result in fewer hours or lower pay for employees, he said.Cost savings also include about $20 million per year from reviewing agreements with online travel agencies, JetBlue said. ""There's just no way to get across the real value of a JetBlue experience versus flying any of our competitors,"" Marty St. George, JetBlue's executive vice president of commercial and planning, said in the interview. ""Getting back towards a direct model is probably a better solution for us.""For months, airlines have tried to draw passengers to their homepages to upsell add-ons like extra legroom. This effort has put airlines at odds with some websites, which only display the base airfare and has drawn the ire of consumer advocates who say it hampers comparison shopping.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus has agreed to provide financing for 17 planes,"" he was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.The first contract is expected to involve some 50-60 jets out of 118 provisionally ordered during a visit to France by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in January.An Iranian official told Reuters in November that IranAir had reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets from Airbus, boosting the prospects of finalizing a deal to buy European aircraft.Dubai's DAE Capital has been closely involved in the talks in coordination with Airbus, according to industry sources, but the leasing company has declined to comment.Parvaresh said IranAir was trying to get first five Airbus planes before March 2017, the end of the financial year. Such a timetable would mean the first new passenger jets reaching Iran ahead of presidential elections in May, widely considered a key objective for pragmatist president Rouhani who has faced hardline opposition to the aircraft deals.Further details meanwhile emerged of Iran's deal with Boeing, which depends partly on further financing agreements.Parvaresh was quoted by Fars news agency as saying Boeing had agreed to finance the first six planes it sells to Iran.He also said Iran would pay for 15 percent of the value of the jets from its development fund, with the rest to be financed externally.Industry sources expect Boeing, which faces Republican criticism over trade with Iran, to deal with Iran via foreign lessors or other financiers in order to avoid infringing core U.S. sanctions restricting use of the U.S. financial system.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

English-language Dawn newspaper, citing the PIA spokesman, said the pilot noticed a problem in one of the engines.ATR is a joint venture between Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and Italian aerospace company Leonardo. It competes for turboprop sales with Canada's Bombardier.Most of the ATR planes used by PIA were for short-haul flights.PIA, a loss-making state carrier, has been defending the ATR plane's safety record and vehemently denied media reports that there was a fault with the aircraft before the take off.""It defies common sense that pilots and engineers would fly an aircraft that does not meet safety standards, and risk their own lives,"" PIA said in a statement on Friday.Officials say the aircraft, made by ATR in 2007, had racked up 18,739 flight hours since joining PIA's fleet that year and the plane's captain, Saleh Janjua, had logged more than 12,000 flight hours over his career.Concern is growing over air safety in Pakistan as media in recent years have reported several near-misses.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

771,"Dec 11, 2016 02:20PM ET","Iran seals $17 billion Boeing deal, close to Airbus order",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Sami AboudiPARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing (N:BA) passenger jets on Sunday and was said to be close to another for dozens of Airbus (PA:AIR) planes to complete what would be the biggest package of firm contracts with Western companies since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.The deal between IranAir and U.S. planemaker Boeing includes 50 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft and 30 long-haul 777s, split equally between the 777-300ER, which is badly in need of an order boost, and the 406-seat 777-9, which is under development.An Iranian official told Reuters that IranAir was also at the ""very final stage"" of formalizing a deal with Europe's Airbus, which led Western companies back into Iran with a provisional agreement for 118 planes when Tehran emerged from global sanctions in January.The Airbus deal, which is expected to involve a first batch of 50-60 jets, should be completed in the next couple of days, the official said.Also closing in on a deal to renew Iran's aging fleet, kept going by smuggled or improvised parts after decades of sanctions, European turboprop maker ATR said it had received U.S. approvals needed to finalize the sale of up to 40 aircraft.The Boeing contract, the biggest Iran-U.S. deal since the fall of the Shah, clears a major technical hurdle toward implementing last year's pact between Iran and world powers to reopen trade in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.However, political opposition could yet threaten a deal that would provide a welcome boost to Boeing's order book after a year in which it has lagged behind rival Airbus.Congressional Republicans are trying to counter last year's nuclear accord, with the U.S. House of Representatives passing a bill last month seeking to restrict financial transactions by U.S. banks in an effort to block the sale of Western passenger jets to Iran.TEST FOR TRUMP, ROUHANIThe Iranian official said the Boeing deal was subject in part to further agreements on financing, but added that money from the deal would not pass through the U.S. financial system.Financial sources said Boeing has a financing plan for 15 777-300ER jets, which are expected to be delivered from 2018, but the rest of the financing may still have to be negotiated.Sunday's move could also test relations between America's top exporter and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, days after he complained about the cost of new Boeing ""Air Force One"" jets.Because of the length of the 10-year deal, some U.S. export licenses may need to be extended during Trump's administration. The president-elect, who opposes last year's nuclear sanctions deal with Iran, has also rattled Boeing by sparring with China, which accounts for a fifth of the company's deliveries.A Boeing statement said the Iranian contract would support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs for the 777-300ER jets and nearly 100,000 U.S. aerospace jobs for the whole package.In Iran the deal is viewed as a crucial political test for the government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, who has been criticized by hardliners opposed to opening up to the West.The first Airbus aircraft are expected to reach Iran in 2017. Iran's presidential elections are due in May.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

777,"Dec 06, 2016 11:40AM ET",Boeing expects business jet sales to recover in next two years,nan,"By Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) sees sales of its business jets rebounding over the next two years after a ""tough"" 2016, Boeing Business Jet President David Longridge said at a press conference in Dubai on Tuesday.Boeing Business Jets (BBJ), which sells variants of Boeing aircraft for the corporate jet market, blames a more than halving of sales this year on the uncertainty created by Britain's Brexit vote and U.S. Presidential election.In 2016, Boeing has booked sales for three business jets, all narrow body aircraft, compared to 10 in 2015, including four wide-bodies, and 14 jets in 2014, BBJ Vice President Jeff Dunn told Reuters.""Now the elections are over and Brexit is decided we're starting to see things pick up,"" Longridge said. ""I think over the next two years we'll go back to the kind of six to eight airplanes that we saw more regularly in the past four years,"" he said.Boeing has campaigns open for three to four business jets though is unlikely to close those deals before Dec. 31, Longridge said. He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis. Boeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets (PA:AIR), makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year.Longridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We can specify the helicopter type we want to use and we have already built up capacity with a different helicopter. The Sikorsky S-92,"" he added.Norwegian investigators have said in preliminary findings that the crash was caused by a technical fault causing the Super Puma's main rotor blades to be separated from the aircraft.

779,"Nov 30, 2016 04:40AM ET",France says U.S. must comply fast with WTO Boeing ruling,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday that the United States must comply with a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling this week against U.S. tax breaks for Boeing (N:BA), and that failure to do so would give the EU legal basis for retaliatory measures.The WTO said this week that a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus (PA:AIR).""The United States must quickly comply with the decision and put an end to these illegal measures,"" the French finance ministry said in a statement.""If not, the European Union will have the legal grounds to adopt retaliatory measures concerning goods coming in from the United States,"" it added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

780,"Nov 28, 2016 02:09PM ET",WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles(Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (N:BA) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.It is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus.The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based.Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.Boeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute.The WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel.It urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when.Seizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. They also zeroed in on ""program accounting"" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. Under the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.CONFIDENT ON APPEALThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid ""without delay"".Boeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020.They said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.Investors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market.""We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.On paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly.Under WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned.European officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. In 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

781,"Nov 24, 2016 10:30AM ET",Airbus's largest A350 jet carries out its maiden flight,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Johanna DecosseTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Europe's largest twin-engined passenger jet, the Airbus (PA:AIR) A350-1000, took to the skies for the first time on Thursday, seeking to grab the spotlight from Boeing's popular 777.The lightweight carbon-fibre plane, 7 metres longer and able to carry 40 more people than A350s already in service, began a three-hour debut flight at 0942 GMT, watched by some of the airline bosses who have invested in the $356 million jet.It later returned to base after a 4 hour and 20 minute flight during which co-pilot Frank Chapman said it had performed ""smoothly"", similar to its sister plane the A350-900.The 366-seat A350-1000 is designed to break Boeing's (N:BA) virtual monopoly in the lucrative ""mini-jumbo"" segment, typically involving large twin-engined jets carrying 350 people.It is larger than the new-generation A350-900, which entered service last year. Both are built from similar advanced materials to Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner in a race between planemakers for fuel savings and better passenger comfort.The aircraft involved in Thursday's Toulouse debut is one of three test planes facing 1,600 hours of intensive flight testing before the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017.Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the planemaking division of Airbus Group, told Reuters he was confident the A350-1000 would be delivered on time to launch customer Qatar Airways.""It makes me very happy and very proud. We are flying according to the timetable we had planned,"" he said moments after the jet, weighing 230 tonnes, took off under leaden skies to applause from factory workers.GRAPPLING WITH OTHER DELAYSBregier added he had grown more confident of reaching this year's target of at least 50 A350-900 deliveries. [nL8N1DP30Z]11While the first flight of its latest model took place on time, Airbus is grappling with delivery delays to the A350-900, clusters of which remain dotted around the airport in Toulouse, France, due to shortages of cabin equipment.Smaller A320neo jets are also parked with missing engines, due to delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney, highlighting the strain on the industry of adding new technology while securing record production targets.Airbus programmes chief Didier Evrard said the planemaker continued to scrutinise its suppliers, notably France's  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC), which said this week it was on a path to recovery following a production crisis at its factories.Asked about the progress displayed by cabin and other suppliers for the A350 family, Evrard told Reuters: ""It has improved, but it is not where it should be and we are watching them very carefully."" [nL9N1DA00K]He said the planemaker was working hard to achieve the target of 50 A350-900 deliveries this year, having reached 34 so far, with a further plane due to be delivered later on Thursday.""I have already cancelled my holidays,"" he added.Airbus says the A350-1000 will be 25 percent cheaper to operate than the competing Boeing 777-300ER, an older aircraft which weighs more but which has more seats in some layouts.Boeing has responded to the A350-1000 by developing an even larger version of 777 able to seat over 400 people, making it the largest twin-engined jet when it enters service in 2020.Airbus is also considering whether to go up in size with a further stretch of the A350, but senior marketing vice president Francois Caudron said it did not currently deem this necessary.Industry sources say Airbus is nonetheless offering the potential ""A350-2000"" to influential buyers including Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) and British Airways (L:ICAG).Such a jet would need an enhancement of the Rolls-Royce (L:RR) Trent XWB engine that powers the A350-1000, already one of the industry's largest with a fan case large enough to swallow the fuselage of the now defunct Concorde.Chris Young, programmes director at the embattled UK engine manufacturer, which is in the midst of restructuring, said it would always be ready if needed to upgrade its engines or add new ones according to the needs of airplane manufacturers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The U.S. government feels almost obliged to update its partners on the sanctions on Iran. They want to show that Iran can benefit too from the nuclear accord,"" Azeredo said. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to scrap the nuclear agreement with Iran during his campaign for not being tough enough, which could bring back secondary sanctions on non-U.S. entities. The OFAC team's briefing coincided with a visit to Brazil by an Iranian mission headed by Finance Minister Ali Tayebnia seeking to advance trade deals.Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3), the world's third largest maker of commercial planes, is in talks to sell Iran at least 20 of its E-195 jets worth over $1 billion as the Middle Eastern country moves to renew its aging airline fleets.Embraer still requires a U.S. license for the sale to Iran of sensitive jet engine technology in its planes. An Embraer spokesman said the company was hopeful it will get the go-ahead following similar licenses granted recently to European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell commercial planes to Iran.Brazilian bus maker Marcopolo SA (SA:POMO4) is also looking to sell hundreds of vehicles to Iran. The company declined to comment.Azeredo said Iranian companies were seeking Brazilian equipment ranging from tractors and electrical generators to hospital and dental equipment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

785,"Nov 23, 2016 09:12AM ET",Iran warns of retaliation if U.S. breaches nuclear deal,nan,"By Bozorgmehr SharafedinBEIRUT (Reuters) - Extending U.S. sanctions on Iran for 10 years would breach the Iranian nuclear agreement, Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Wednesday, warning that Tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved. The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law.Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA, last year. It imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy. ""The current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,"" Khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the Revolutionary Guards, according to his website. ""The latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA, and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it."" The U.S. lawmakers passed the bill one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also criticized it.Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president.President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would ""rip up"" the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would ""set fire"" to the deal.The House of Representatives also passed a bill last week that would block the sale of commercial aircraft by Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) to Iran. The White House believes that the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact and has said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

787,"Nov 22, 2016 04:04PM ET",Exclusive: U.S. grants second Airbus license to sell planes to Iran,nan,"By Yeganeh TorbatiWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it had issued a second license to France's Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell commercial planes to Iran Air, bringing Iran's flag carrier a step closer to receiving new Western jets under last year's deal to ease sanctions.The move in the waning months of Democratic President Barack Obama's administration to further unlock jetliner sales to Iran prompted complaints from Republicans in Congress and is likely to raise the ire of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has said he would dismantle the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, which includes a measure allowing U.S. and European companies to sell Iran civilian aircraft. Licenses allowing such sales could easily be withdrawn by the Trump administration if he chose to do so, sanctions experts said. But he would likely face opposition from U.S. allies and other world powers who were partners in negotiating the deal to lift some sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on Monday issued the license for the sale of 106 planes to Iran Air, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, on condition of anonymity. An Airbus spokesman confirmed that the company had received the OFAC license, but declined to confirm the exact number of planes approved.Although Airbus is based in France, it must have U.S. approval to sell planes to Iran because at least 10 percent of the aircraft's components are American-made. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year.Before the license was issued on Monday, Airbus had U.S. permission for the sale of 17 jets to Iran.Members of Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the license.Opponents of the nuclear deal argue that passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes, such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria, something Iranian officials deny. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused Iran of using commercial airline flights to ship weapons to Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah. The U.S. Treasury says that the licenses it issues contain strict conditions to require planes be used solely for commercial passenger use, and not be sold or transferred to a sanctioned person or group.Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill intending to block the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, which would also affect sales by U.S. firm Boeing (N:BA).The measure is unlikely to become law during the current Congress, as it would need to pass the Senate, where it would face stiff opposition from Democrats. The White House also said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate.On Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce sent a letter to Obama asking him to refrain from trying to boost international investment in Iran or issuing new regulations, licenses or guidance on remaining sanctions in the last two months of his administration.McCarthy said in a statement on Tuesday that Obama should not allow for the Airbus sale. ""Actions like this underscore the need for the upcoming Trump Administration to review all options when it comes to this failed deal,"" the statement said.Confirming a Reuters report on the issuing of a second license, the U.S. State Department said the Obama administration was not trying to push through Iran-related measures on its way out.""This particular license that we're talking about today isn't new. It is something that has been in train for quite some time, as other licenses have been as well,"" said State Department spokesman John Kirby in a press briefing. ""There's no Machiavellian intent here to push in any way outside the bounds of our normal commitments and obligations here in the final months of the administration.""Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Obama's hallmark foreign policy achievements.The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to Iran Air would help modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. Iranian officials have voiced growing concerns about what they see as unfair delays in obtaining U.S. licenses, or clarity over banking and financing rules.Sanctions experts said Treasury licenses allowing such aircraft sales, and easing the way for other commerce with Iran, could easily be reversed by Trump if he chose to do so.""The licenses can be withdrawn at any moment...so long as they're not required by legislation, which is a very small number,"" said David Mortlock, a former White House sanctions official.The airplane deals still face major obstacles, including reluctance from major European banks to finance deals involving Iran.The Airbus spokesman said that taken together, the company's two Treasury licenses cover its entire 118-plane deal with Iran, implying that there is some overlap between the two licenses.Some aircraft have been canceled because of delays in receiving authorizations, and officials say Iran no longer plans to take delivery of A380 superjumbos, so the final tally is likely to be closer to 100 aircraft.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease.Ahmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added.Ahmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake.However, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe. A meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, ""to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,"" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters. The official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months ""to attain a clean balance sheet,"" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units. The airline would spin-off four ""special business units"" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses.The units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

801,"Nov 02, 2016 08:00AM ET","China, Russia take step closer to new long-haul jet",nan,"By Brenda GohZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China and Russia took a step closer on Wednesday to the joint development of a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR), displaying a model of the unnamed plane that would compete with Western rivals.State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] and United Aircraft Corp (UAC) of Russia said they had started the hunt to find suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China.Neither firm gave details on financing or technical specifications for what Western analysts call a politically-driven initiative that will be difficult to pull off and is likely to carry a high price tag. China opened the show on Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter, in a demonstration of military clout.Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the best-selling Airbus and Boeing types.Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialize. The firms have said they want conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 or later.Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programs that sought results in 5-7 years and came in late.""A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge,"" Guo told reporters. ""China and Russia each have their own advantages.""Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles). SUPPLIER SEARCHThe decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a ""mutual decision"", Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC's Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia's Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017.U.S. firms Honeywell (N:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corporation (N:UTC) said on Wednesday they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. ""We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation,"" Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines.Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe's Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact.Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project.The firm's Shanghai headquarters tells ""where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market,"" said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

803,"Nov 01, 2016 01:59PM ET",Frustrated Europe hopes Clinton win can spur elusive Iran deals,nan,"By Noah Barkin BERLIN (Reuters) - After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy.While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8, a win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May.""If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now,"" said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group.""This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for,"" he said.Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, the excitement in Europe's business community was palpable.With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union.European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Iran's isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors.But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides.BIGGEST OBSTACLEThe biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continent's largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line.The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran.But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried.This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners.""Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties,"" said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI).Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign.Trump, by contrast, has called it ""one of the worst deals ever made"" and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe.Recently however, there have been signs of movement.Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services.""Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively,"" said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB). ""We can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's still quite far away.""ENORMOUS POTENTIALIn June, the German government began offering export credit guarantees via insurance group Euler Hermes for firms wanting to trade with Iran.Edna Schoene, head of German government business at Euler Hermes, said about 30 formal applications had been received since then with a total value of about 2.5 billion euros. Nine of them have been approved.Add to that roughly 70 non-binding letters of interest (LOIs) that have been issued and the volumes push up into the double-digit billions of euros, Schoene said.""The potential in Iran is enormous and the demand for export credit guarantees is high, both in terms of formal applications and expressions of interest,"" Schoene said. ""I expect that we will see the first large-scale, credit-financed deals in 2017.""Some European firms are already benefiting from the opening of the Iranian economy. Last week French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP), once the market leader, announced it had produced 105,000 cars in Iran under the  Peugeot  license in the third quarter, 15 percent of its total sales volume.Etourneau of MEDEF International is also optimistic that Iran's order of 118 jets from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and a recent joint venture deal between carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Iranian investment fund IDRO will prove a boon for smaller European suppliers. MEDEF International announced last month it was opening an office in Tehran, its first outside France, to support small and medium sized French firms seeking to enter the Iranian market.""We expect that 20-30 billion euros in public contracts to be attributed by the Iranians before the end of their fiscal year in March,"" Etourneau said. ""What we are telling companies is that they need a 5-10 year strategy. The market will open up progressively.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

804,"Nov 01, 2016 02:22AM ET",China debuts J-20 stealth jet in show of strength at country's biggest air expo,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Brenda GohZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China showed its Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter in public for the first time on Tuesday, opening the country's biggest meeting of aircraft makers and buyers with a show of its military clout.Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai, offers Beijing an opportunity to demonstrate its ambitions in civil aerospace and to underline its defense ambitions. China is set to overtake the U.S. as the world's top aviation market in the next decade.Two J-20 jets, Zhuhai's headline act, swept over dignitaries and hundreds of spectators and industry executives gathered at the show's opening ceremony in a flypast that barely exceeded a minute, generating a deafening roar that was met with gasps and applause and set off car alarms in a parking lot at the site. Experts say China has been refining designs for the J-20, first glimpsed by planespotters in 2010, in the hope of narrowing a military technology gap with the United States. President Xi Jinping has pushed to toughen the armed forces as China takes a more assertive stance in Asia, particularly in the South China and East China seas.""It is clearly a big step forward in Chinese combat capability,"" said Bradley Perrett of Aviation Week, a veteran China watcher. It was China's second successive display of a new stealth jet at the biennial Zhuhai show, following the 2014 debut of the J-31.QUESTIONS UNANSWEREDAfter arriving as a pair at low-level, one of the J-20s quickly disappeared over the horizon, leaving the other to perform a series of turns, revealing its delta wing shape against bright sub-tropical haze.But analysts said the brief and relatively cautious J-20 routine - the pilots did not open weapon bay doors, or perform low-speed passes - answered few questions.""I think we learned very little. We learned it is very loud. But we can't tell what type of engine it has, or very much about the mobility,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor of FlightGlobal. ""Most importantly, we didn't learn much about its radar cross-section."" A key question whether the new Chinese fighter can match the radar-evading properties of the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-22 Raptor air-to-air combat jet, or the latest strike jet in the U.S. arsenal, Lockheed's F-35. The F-22 Raptor, developed for the U.S. Air Force, is the J-20's closest lookalike.But the mere display of such a newly developed aircraft was a revealing signal, others said.""It's a change of tactics for the Chinese to publicly show off weapons that aren't in full squadron service yet,"" said Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, ""and demonstrates a lot of confidence in the capability, and also a lot of pride."" C919 PASSENGER JET ABSENTIt remained unclear whether or how the J-20 would be displayed at the airshow after the flypast.Aircraft that are officially scheduled to be on display alongside the latest Chinese weapon systems, radar and drones include the Xian Y-20 strategic airlifter, and what organizers say is the largest amphibious plane now in production - the AG600.The flying boat is officially promoted as a fire-fighting or search and rescue plane. But analysts note the AG600 - first unveiled 10 days after a Hague tribunal ruled against China's claim to parts of the South China Sea in July - is well suited to resupplying military outposts in the disputed area.Notably absent from the airshow schedule is the 150-seater COMAC C919 passenger jet. Designed to compete with Europe's Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co of the United States, the rivals who dominate the global supply of airliners, the much-delayed C919 is now running three years behind original plans.COMAC said at the show that China Eastern Airlines will be the launch customer for the C919, which may take its first test flight later this year or early 2017, and that it had clinched 23 new orders for its C919, taking total firm orders to 517.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

805,"Oct 31, 2016 12:10PM ET",Pharma and aerospace seek Brexit assurances after Nissan deal,nan,"By Ben Hirschler and Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pharmaceutical and aerospace industries, both big exporters, are stepping up pressure on the government for assurances about their future after last week's post-Brexit deal with carmaker Nissan (T:7201).The two sectors, which have been talking to ministers since the summer, are pressing their case after written assurances by business secretary Greg Clark persuaded Nissan to invest in the country's biggest car plant, industry officials said. Pharma and aerospace companies share the motor industry's worries about trade barriers once Britain leaves the European Union, but they also have deep concerns about regulation, their ability to recruit foreign staff and loss of EU science funding.The discussions are part of a broader jockeying for position among businesses worried by the fall-out of Brexit, with finance companies anxious to retain so-called passporting, allowing London-based banks to sell services across Europe.The pharma and biotech industry will detail its priorities on Nov. 23 when ministers next meet a life sciences steering group co-chaired by GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) Chief Executive Andrew Witty and AstraZeneca (L:AZN) CEO Pascal Soriot.Nissan announced it would build two new models at its plant in the northeastern English city of Sunderland as a result of the agreement. Clark said on Sunday that the government aimed to negotiate tariff-free trade for the motor industry with the remaining 27 EU member states.Steve Bates, CEO of Britain's BioIndustry Association, said the deal showed the government was ""listening to business"", adding that drugmakers' needs were somewhat different, with a big focus on the right climate for research and development.""For pharma and biotech, we are looking for fundamental platforms to drive our sector over a long time,"" he told Reuters. ""It's not as obvious as one car plant in Sunderland.""Autos, pharma and aerospace are three notable success stories for British manufacturing following the demise of traditional heavy industries such as steel and shipbuilding. As such, pharma and aerospace want parity of treatment.""The prime minister has reportedly given assurances to car manufacturers that that sector will not be negatively impacted,"" Paul Kahn, president of Airbus Group UK (PA:AIR) told an industry conference last week. ""We need to work together to ensure that as aerospace, defense and space sectors our voice is equally heard.""Airbus, which makes aircraft wings in Britain, is a major exporter along with aero engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and defense group BAE Systems (L:BAES). In the case of Nissan, CEO Carlos Ghosn had brought matters to a head by saying he would need a guarantee of compensation to offset any impact of Brexit before deciding whether to build the new models in Britain. Clark said no money had been promised to compensate for any imposition of tariffs.TRACK RECORDOther players may lack comparable binary investment decisions, but they want their track record to be recognized.AstraZeneca, for example, is building a $500 million headquarters and research center in Cambridge, while GSK committed $360 million to investment in British manufacturing in July, five weeks after Britons voted to leave the EU.A worry for both drugmakers and aerospace companies is the risk that Brexit will mean Britain also leaves regulatory bodies that allow companies to sell products across Europe and beyond.Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) offer one-stop-shops for endorsing product quality, which smoothes the sale of goods across borders.Drugmakers warn that loss of access to the EMA could put British patients at the back of the queue for approval of new medicines, since applications for a British license would come after the European one, given the relatively small size of the UK market.The EASA, meanwhile, is vital for aerospace firms since once the agency certifies a component it means many other global bodies, including U.S. regulators, accept that certification.Another big area of concern where pharma and aerospace companies want assurance is the looming gap in funding currently provided by the EU for scientific research and development.""Aerospace does quite well financially from that,"" Paul Everitt, CEO of industry group ADS, representing Britain’s aerospace, defense, security and space sectors, told BBC radio.""But more importantly the collaboration with universities both here in the UK and in other parts of Europe, and part of our integrated supply chain around the rest of Europe, helps us be more competitive.""For global aerospace and pharma companies, Britain is a small market and any post-Brexit economic strains could further diminish its appeal, as highlighted by recent rows over drug pricing.With growing strains on the National Health Service (NHS), some drugmakers are warning that Britain could lose its draw as a place for investment if the system does not pay up for new breakthrough medicines.""Companies will not come to the UK to invest in R&D, experimental medicine or clinical trials if the healthcare system is not adopting the most important innovations that are becoming standard of care in other countries across the world,"" Mene Pangalos, head of AstraZeneca's innovative medicines and early development unit, told a meeting in parliament last week.(editing by David Stamp)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At the same time, commercial aviation is faltering after a decade-long winning streak.""Civil is weakening and turning very spotty in places, whereas defense is growing in U.S. and world markets,"" said Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia. ""It's a combination of a re-armament cycle coupled with something of a ramp-up based on regional tensions and fears.""China's biggest aviation event - Airshow China, starting in Zhuhai on Tuesday - underlines the trend in what is a banner week for the industry. A defense trade show takes place in Jakarta and an air finance conference in Hong Kong, as well as the annual U.S. business jet jamboree in Orlando, Florida. Topping Airshow China's agenda is the last-minute public debut of the J-20 stealth fighter - a warplane China hopes will narrow a military gap with the United States. Ability to project air power is key for China as it flexes muscles on territorial disputes in the East China and South China seas.It's the second successive edition of the biennial Zhuhai show at which China has pulled the covers off a classified stealth jet, after displaying the export-oriented Shenyang J-31 in 2014. Western analysts say the J-20 moves up a gear in terms of China's ability to punch beyond its territory, though it may lack the clout of its lookalike, the U.S. F-22 Raptor. The Xian Y-20 strategic cargo carrier, similar to the U.S. C-17 aircraft, will also be present.C919 - FYING SOON?Another hot topic at Zhuhai will be the outlook for the much-delayed maiden flight of state-owned Comac's 150-seat C919 jetliner - Beijing's effort to challenge the civil aerospace domination of Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA). The C919 is currently scheduled to take flight this year, but industry sources say this will slip to 2017. ""When it was launched the C919 was supposed to fly in 2014. Now it is 2016 and it hasn't flown, because developing a commercial jet has been much harder than they expected,"" said China aerospace expert Bradley Perrett of Aviation Week.The delays mean the jet is launching into a civil market looking softer due to slowing growth - a subject set to dominate discussion when 1,000 commercial jet financiers gather at the two-day Airline Economics conference this week in Hong Kong. With more than a million millionaires and over 200 billionaires, China should also be among the most promising markets for private jets. But belt-tightening and Beijing's corruption crackdown have hit demand for large models, which had resisted a post-financial crisis drop in industry sales.The plight of the business jet trade will dominate the U.S. National Business Aviation Association's Florida get-together this week. ""Previous declines always rebounded,"" said Daniel Hall, senior valuations analyst at Flight Ascend consultancy, referring to business jet sales. ""This has clearly not.""Those concerns deepened when parts supplier Honeywell (N:HON) predicted fewer deliveries next year.INDO DEFENSEUnderlining the current divide between civilian and military aviation fortunes, foreign sellers are expected to flock to the Nov. 2-5 Indo Defense arms exhibition in Jakarta, just weeks after Indonesian jets staged exercises on the edge of a South China Sea area claimed by Beijing.With Indonesia's arms imports up threefold since 2010, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, competition between suppliers is brutal.Delegates at the event will seek updates on a tentative decision by Indonesia to buy around 8 Sukhoi Su-35 fighters from Russia.Rivals contractors are fighting to stay in contention for the deal to supply Jakarta with fighters, in what one Western source described as a test for efforts by President Joko Widodo to enforce more transparency in big-ticket deals.Rivals  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), Sweden's Saab (ST:SAABb) and owners of Europe's Eurofighter will all attend Indo Defense.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The 747-8 will allow UPS to upsize our network in both new and existing markets,"" he added.The purchase adds significantly to Boeing's order book in a year in which it and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have struggled to sell widebody aircraft.Sales of the 747-8, the latest version of the four-engine plane that first flew in 1969, have been slowing. Boeing has cut production to six a year, and in July warned it might end production of the plane altogether.Similar-sized two-engine planes that are more fuel efficient have largely eclipsed the 747's passenger mission. Sales have also slowed for Airbus' competing four-engine A380.But the 747-8 freighter has a special hinged nose that gives it a unique ability to carry large cargo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(and) there is a very large number of aircraft that still need to be replaced.""In July, U.S. plane maker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) forecast that airlines in the Americas would require 11,290 new planes over the next 20 years to replace aging aircraft as well as grow their fleets, representing a large opportunity for manufacturers and financing companies alike.The region is only second to Asia, which will require 15,130 planes, according to Boeing. Nearly 40,000 aircraft in total will be delivered through 2035, worth $5.9 trillion, Boeing said.MUFG provides debt to airlines, plane lessors and others through underwriting, export credit financing and other means.Trauchessec said MUFG also can benefit from the active trading between aircraft lessors and investors in the Americas.Economic slowdowns have cast doubt over future travel demand, and lower oil prices have allowed airlines to defer the delivery of fuel-saving planes while keeping older, gas-guzzling models in the air. Orders for the world's dominant plane makers Boeing and Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) have fallen from a year ago. At the same time, industry experts have said the market is somewhat oversupplied with jets, particularly larger and more expensive wide-body models.The slowdown has raised some questions about whether the manufacturers will maintain plans to boost output later this decade.""We're not doing this because we see this instantaneous moment to make a big splash. We see a business that our organization can build over time,"" said Lance Markowitz, MUFG's group head of leasing and asset finance in the Americas, in the same telephone interview. ""It's a longer-term approach.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

811,"Oct 26, 2016 09:12AM ET",Boeing third-quarter profit jumps; raises delivery and revenue outlook,nan,"By Alwyn Scott(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday beat profit expectations in the third quarter despite declining revenue and notched up its sales forecast for the full year, saying it planned to deliver more jetliners than it originally thought.Factoring out a one-time tax benefit, the results showed the impact of cost reductions and leaner manufacturing at the world's biggest plane maker. Boeing is cutting costs to boost profit margins and compete for orders against European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) amid slowing jetliner sales.""Solid operating performance across our commercial and defense and space businesses in the third quarter again generated strong cash flow for Boeing,"" Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said. Operating cash flow rose 12 percent to $3.2 billion.Deliveries were down nearly 3 percent from a year ago, reflecting slower production of profitable 777 and 737 models.But Boeing raised its target for jetliner deliveries for the year to between 745 and 750 from 740 to 745, and kept its operating cash flow target of more than $10 billion unchanged.The additional planes will boost revenue by $500 million, Boeing said, prompting the company to raise its year-end revenue target to between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion.The closely watched deferred production cost balance for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, a tally of the manufacturing costs not yet recouped by sales, declined about $150 million in the quarter to $27.5 billion, reflecting the fact that the high-tech plane is now profitable by some accounting measures. The balance peaked at $28.7 billion in the first quarter and has declined since then.Boeing's earnings rose to $2.28 billion, or $3.60 per share, in the quarter, from $1.70 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to $3.51 per share from $2.52.Both figures included a special gain of 70 cents a share, reflecting a tax benefit Boeing received by claiming more depreciation on plants and equipment than it had previously.Factoring that out, core earnings were $2.81 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $2.62, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue fell to $23.90 billion from $25.85 billion.Boeing shares dipped 0.4 percent at $138.40 in premarket trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

814,"Oct 24, 2016 01:32AM ET","Boeing takes on peers, partners in bid for replacement parts business",nan,"By Alwyn ScottPHOENIX (Reuters) - In search of higher profits margins,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is aiming to win more of the lucrative market for replacement parts and repair services, pitting the plane maker against major suppliers who view that growing $62 billion a year market as their turf.Boeing told Reuters it has added 35,000 parts to stocks it positions around the world to serve airlines in the last year, after analyzing its vast store of aircraft data to see where the parts will be needed. It has also cut prices on 24,000 parts to be more competitive, and it is expanding training and other services.Boeing is trying to capture more profit from spare parts made under license by suppliers as well. To get there, it is producing some new parts in house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service.The maker of such flagship jets as the 787 Dreamliner and top-selling 737 has been building its aftermarket business for years. But as demand for planes has slowed over the last 18 months, Boeing is now turning more aggressively to spare parts and services to help meet its own ambitious targets of doubling overall margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The main reason: a dollar of added aftermarket sales is more valuable than a dollar of new aircraft sales.Boeing's aftermarket sales have risen over the last three years and are outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters. ""That means we're taking market share,"" he said.Boeing's effort is ratcheting up competition with many of its biggest suppliers, including Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL), and repair operations such as Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) Technical Operations and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) Technik - which are all taking action to defend their lucrative franchises.Aftermarket sales typically offer margins of 20 percent or more - which makes expanding its presence in that market crucial to Boeing's effort to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg's overall profitability goal, analysts say.Boeing doesn't break out aftermarket revenue, and has not publicly discussed its aftermarket strategy in detail. Analysts estimate parts and services generate about $15 billion a year, or nearly 16 percent of Boeing's $96 billion in annual sales, split roughly evenly between its commercial aircraft and defense businesses. Industry experts say Boeing aims to more than triple aftermarket sales to as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years. Boeing declined to confirm a specific target, but the company's ""leadership has set high aspirations,"" Floyd said. ""We are investing heavily into these businesses."" Boeing has logged its largest number of orders for its ""GoldCare"" aircraft maintenance service this year, and now counts 60 customers and 2,200 planes in the program. ""We're seeing the returns on these investments,"" Floyd said.""COMPETIMATES""Boeing partners with the likes of Honeywell Aerospace to do some repairs. But both are trying to increase their own sales of repairs and parts to airlines. That's why the two manufacturing heavyweights are ""competimates,"" said Mike Beazley, vice president of aftermarket sales at Honeywell. ""There's a segment of the market that will pay a premium to deal with one company"" through Boeing GoldCare, he said. But many ""would still like to have a direct relationship with the biggest suppliers.""At Honeywell Aerospace's 360,000 square-foot aftermarket center in Phoenix, the largest of its 40 repair stations around the globe, Andrew Newingham recently circled a small auxiliary aircraft engine on his workbench. As a robotic voice called out questions and Newingham answered, a computer logged details about what work the engine needed, reducing to minutes what was formerly an hours-long task involving paper checklists and typing on a computer.Honeywell aims to cut engine repair times to 20 calendar days or less, and offers upgrades and enhancements when engines come in for repairs.""What keeps us competitive and allows us to win new business is being able to offer speed,"" said Steve Foust, senior plant director. WINNING ON PRICERepair organizations also are reacting as Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) try to grab business.Boeing partners with Lufthansa Technik (LUFT.UL) on some services. But it also undercuts Lufthansa on others.Low-cost, long-haul airline  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC), for example, considered several service groups, including Lufthansa Technik. In the end it picked GoldCare to maintain its 737 MAX and 787 jets, Asgeir Nyseth, chief operating officer of Norwegian Group, said in an interview.  Boeing's service ""was the cheapest one,"" he said, adding Norwegian benefited from the increased competition Boeing provided.Boeing and Airbus ""have the advantage that they can combine an after-sale service package with the sale of the aircraft,"" said Lufthansa Technik's Frank Berweger, senior vice president of corporate sales for the Americas. In part to counter the aircraft makers, Lufthansa Technik plans to quadruple investment in research and product development to 200 million euros ($219.52 million) to 2018 from 2015, on top of increased spending on tooling and training to service new Boeing and Airbus jetliner types. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago.Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boeing will find it difficult to capture $50 billion in services revenue annually -- not to mention making a profit -- given the strength of some of the suppliers and specialist service companies.""Boeing has to be agile and cost competitive enough to win business from established players,"" Michaels said. ""They need to be entrepreneurial. That's a challenge."" ($1 = 0.9111 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

U.S. officials said Airbus had failed to undo subsidies worth $22 billion, including $4 billion for the A350, on which Airbus's prospects in the wide-body jet market largely depend.The European Commission said the $22 billion figure reflected the face value of all repayable loans granted to Airbus and had nothing to do with the actual amount of subsidies.It also said the WTO panel had sided with the EU on some points, such as that there had been no prohibited subsidies for the Airbus 350 XWB or A380 models and that most of the other subsidies challenged by the United States had come to an end.""The present appeal should be seen in the context of two on-going WTO challenges brought by the EU against billions of U.S. subsidies to Boeing for its aircraft production,"" the Commission added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But he said the A400M would eventually offer superior capabilities to comparable transports.He said Airbus was making steady progress in increasing the capabilities of the A400M, and the Germany would receive its first with a self-defence system this autumn.He also said Germany and other European countries would have most of their A400Ms in use by 2021, when the new tactical C-130 airlift capability is due to begin.Germany's military initially planned to operate only A400M transport planes once its C-160 Transall is retired in 2021, but studies later suggested it would need extra planes that could land on rough terrain more easily than the bulkier A400M.Hoke insisted that the A400M could land everywhere that a Boeing (N:BA) C-17 transporter, C-130 or C-160 could.Airbus has delivered 29 A400Ms - including 9 this year - since it finally entered service in 2013.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There are no specific timelines for that purchase,"" a defence ministry source said.The German-French agreement foresees the new joint tactical airlift capability being in operation by 2021, but it is not certain Germany will have all its C-130Js by then.Von der Leyen told Reuters last week that Germany would make a decision soon on acquiring C-130s to cover what Berlin views as a gap in capabilities once the elderly Transall leaves service in 2021.Germany is part of a European group of seven European NATO nations that funded the 20-billion-euro development by Airbus (PA:AIR) of the A400M. Lockheed was originally a partner at an early stage of the A400M project, which was eventually billed as a European alternative to the smaller C-130 and the larger Boeing (NYSE:BA) C-17.Airbus declined to comment on Germany's C-130 proposals.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

826,"Sep 30, 2016 11:57AM ET",Mission Complete: Rosetta says farewell with comet crash-landing,nan,"By Victoria BryanBERLIN (Reuters) - The Rosetta spacecraft ended its historic mission on Friday, crashing on the surface of the dusty, icy comet it has spent 12 years chasing in a hunt that has provided insight into the early days of the solar system and captured the public's imagination.The spacecraft has stalked comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko across more than 6 billion km (3.7 billion miles) of space, collecting a treasure trove of information on comets that will keep scientists busy for the next decade.Scientists in the European Space Agency control center in Darmstadt, Germany, clapped and hugged as confirmation of the end of the mission came at 1119 GMT. Rosetta completed its free-fall descent at the speed of a sedate walk, joining the probe Philae, which landed on the comet in November 2014 in what was considered a remarkable feat of precision space travel. ""Thank you Rosetta,"" ESA director general Jan Woerner said on Twitter.He was among some 300 people who had also gathered before dawn at a conference room at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, to watch a live webcast as Rosetta's signal disappeared from monitors, simultaneously with the team in Germany.""It was a good ending,"" Klaus Schiling, who worked on mission planning for Rosetta 27 years ago with prime contractor Airbus (PA:AIR), told Reuters at the Mexico space conference. ""There were so many ups and downs with this mission.""PLANET FORMATIONThe mission managed several historic firsts, such as getting a spacecraft into orbit around a comet and the unprecedented landing of a probe on the surface. A handful of previous spacecraft had snapped pictures and collected data as they flew past their targets.But, dashing hopes for more discoveries, Philae, the 100 kg (220 lb) probe, bounced several times on landing before getting stuck against a cliff wall, leaving it unable to perform any more experiments beyond its first three days on the comet after its solar-powered batteries ran out.Rosetta's cameras located Philae's resting place just a few weeks ago.The ESA is ending the mission because 67P is racing toward the outer solar system, out of range for the solar-powered spacecraft.Rosetta also has been subjected to the harsh radiation and extreme temperatures of space since launching in March 2004 and so was unlikely to last too much longer.Before reaching the surface and shutting down, Rosetta's instruments and camera relayed back data and images, giving scientists insight into the structure of the comet.That data will reveal information on the side walls of the comet, crucial to understanding how they are formed, plus on large 100-metre (300 foot) wide pits, which scientists believe are key to how the comet releases gas and dust as it is warmed by the sun.Daniel Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said the images sent back from the Rosetta mission were ""as powerful as Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon"".Data collected by Rosetta and Philae is already helping scientists better understand how the Earth and other planets formed.For example, scientists now believe that asteroids, not comets were primarily responsible for delivering water to Earth and other planets in the inner solar system, possibly setting the stage for life.""We've just scratched the surface of the science. We're ending the mission, but the science will continue for many years,"" project scientist Matt Taylor said ahead of the end of mission.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said.Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year.It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion.The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups.Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand.Engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year.Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August.""Our relationship is very strained,"" Al Baker said in August.

They asked not to be named because the plan has not been formally approved.Nine months after arriving from Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), Dirk Hoke, the head of Airbus Defence & Space, the group's second largest division, would be awarded oversight of program management and new services as part of the plans to reshape the way Airbus develops, produces and supports aircraft.The proposal builds on efforts to knit together a once faction-ridden company and mark an end to what Enders described in the past as ""fiefdoms"" inside the group, whose products range from jetliners to satellites and choppers to fighter jets.Airbus Group (PA:AIR) declined comment. An announcement on the widely anticipated overhaul could come later this week.Enders said in a letter to staff last week that organizational changes would be finalised soon, adding ""lean structures"" and speedy decision-making were both priorities.Group-wide roles have historically struck a sensitive note inside the Franco-German-led firm, because they step across business lines previously identified with national priorities.It was not immediately clear exactly what role the overlapping business heads would play in each other's divisions, each of which faces pressing industrial challenges and can ill afford any loss of focus, according to analysts.But people familiar with the plans said daily control of standalone projects such as the new Airbus A350 or troubled A400M military plane would stay in their respective divisions.Insiders say it is not, in the immediate term, chiefly seen as a cost-cutting exercise but that it would prepare the ground for modernization plans relying on digital design, production and support methods that would also require some new investment.Job cuts have not been ruled out, however, particularly as a result of slow demand for A380 jetliners and civil helicopters. Others say it strengthens Enders' grip after longstanding tensions with Bregier, who is expected to give up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial unit while remaining its president and cementing his status as likely next group CEO. Enders recently named Marc Fontaine the company's first digital transformation officer.In his wider role, newly recruited Hoke is expected to bring a fresh perspective to program management, which has been a problem area for many planemakers in recent years, and develop new services beyond the traditional job of selling parts.Aircraft connectivity, for example, was identified as one of the key growth areas in new services for the jet industry at the ISTAT Europe aviation conference in Barcelona this week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It's important to me that we learn from the mistakes of the past.""Germany chose the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), made by MBDA and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), last year over Raytheon Co's Patriot system, but said the firms would have to meet tough performance milestones to retain the contract, one of Germany's biggest arms projects. The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States, although the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use. Germany is buying MEADS to replace its Patriot air defense system fielded in the 1980s.Lockheed and MBDA had hoped to finish negotiations with Germany by the end of year, but those prospects dimmed after the companies missed their goal of submitting a proposal by the end of July.Experts say the project could still slip into 2018 or later due to German elections next year if the German parliament does not approve it in early 2017 before the federal election campaigns get into full swing.MBDA, jointly owned by Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA, had no immediate comment.Von der Leyen said Germany was determined to avoid signing the kind of superficial and risky contracts that had led to major cost increases on past weapons programs.""We are applying tougher standards to procurement projects and are keen to sign a carefully vetted, differentiated contract,"" von der Leyen said. ""The goal is to avoid that unexpected risks result in a future burden for the government.""Von der Leyen said companies were used to such careful contracting procedures in the commercial world, although they had not been applied previously by the government.

Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Roskam is chairman of the tax-writing Ways & Means Committee's Oversight subcommittee. Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) said on Wednesday they had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting over 200 jets to Iran, under a deal struck in January. The news is likely to ease complaints from Iran over implementation of last year's international nuclear agreement, in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the deal could cost jobs at Boeing plants, but opponents of the deal argue that security concerns are more important.The letter to Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, asked for answers to several detailed questions on issues including Iran Air's leadership, the Treasury's ability to control transfers of aircraft or parts once they are in Iran's hands and the nuclear pact.Foreign banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business.With U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions ""snap back.""Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Democratic President Barack Obama's foreign policy achievements.Arguing that Obama was more concerned with enhancing his legacy than national security, they have pushed legislation and other measures seeking to overturn or undermine the agreement.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

How are we going to double the traffic flows in the next 15 years if we don't use larger aircraft like the A380?”Despite that longer-term optimism, Airbus now is lacking in new orders for the A380. In 2018, the company plans to cut the A380's delivery target to 12 a year from 27 in 2015 and about half what is projected for this year, to prevent a glut of unsold planes. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said this month it will not extend a lease on one of aircraft.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It is being studied and it's just a determination if we find the right solution for the customer and the timing and how much change we would have to do to make that work,"" he said.The Airbus (PA:AIR) A321neo can hold up to 240 passengers, compared with a maximum of 220 on the planned 737 MAX 9. The MAX 10 would be developed after its other MAX variants. It would enter service after the smallest version, the MAX 7, comes out in 2019, Teal said. Boeing is studying a wide range of options for the larger planes, including using the engines designed for a single-aisle plane being developed by China's COMAC. Boeing already has decided to enlarge the MAX 7, adding 12 seats. The MAX 7 will have a range of around 3,500 to 3,600 nautical miles, longer than the MAX 8, he said. Flight testing of the initial 737 MAX 8 planes is on schedule and expected to conclude late this year or early next year, allowing the first 737 MAXs to go to customers in 2017. ""We're gonna meet that [deadline],"" Teal said. ""It's going pretty well. All four [test] airplanes are flying.""Boeing has already built 10 MAX planes and the 11th is in production now. The company is building the 787 MAX 8 first, with delivery in 2017, followed by the MAX 9 in 2018 and the MAX 7 in 2019. Teal said he didn't have concerns about supply chain problems as 737 production rates increase and the Max comes into service. Most of its 737 production in 2017 will be 737 NG (next generation) models, making more MAX models by the end of 2018, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

833,"Sep 22, 2016 12:25PM ET",WTO says EU failed to rein in Airbus subsidies,nan,"By Tom MilesGENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization said on Thursday the European Union had failed to rein in billions of dollars in subsidies to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), prompting Washington to call for an immediate halt to support to unwind damage to U.S. jobs.The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments.The WTO said the EU had failed to comply with earlier rulings by the global trade body against all but two of 36 contested measures, including billions of dollars of European government loans to Airbus stretching back decades.The loans were a ""genuine and substantial"" cause of significant lost sales for its U.S. competitor Boeing, it said.In a blow to Europe's long-held argument that the most recent Airbus plane, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for the jet had been subsidized but rejected U.S. claims it fell into the most toxic category of ""prohibited"" aid.The United States said Airbus had failed to undo subsidies worth $22 billion, including $4 billion for the A350.European industry officials dispute those numbers, saying they overstate the amount of support at stake within the loans.U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the subsidies had cost U.S. workers exports worth tens of billions of dollars.""We expect the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain – some of our closest trading partners – to respect WTO rules. We call on them to end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately,"" he said in a statement.The EU, however, suggested it would appeal the latest findings, saying it found some of the report ""unsatisfactory"".""We are closely analysing the report,"" the European Commission said, adding the 574-page document should be read in the context of two other WTO reports expected to address U.S. subsidies to Boeing (N:BA) in coming months.It comes amid a U.S. presidential campaign where claims that U.S. companies are suffering from alleged cheating by foreign competitors is a prime topic for both candidates, and amid growing support for protectionism on both sides of the Atlantic.In earlier findings, the WTO ruled that both Airbus and Boeing received unfair subsidies worth billions of dollars.Both sides have sought WTO permission to draw up sanctions that could penalize other industries, with the U.S. calling for up to $10 billion in counter-measures and the EU $12 billion.But no reprisals are expected until the WTO process, which is already running about three years behind schedule, has been exhausted, which trade sources say could take months or years.Many analysts expect a negotiated settlement instead.(Story refiles to remove extraneous word in paragraph six.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

834,"Sep 21, 2016 11:17AM ET",U.S. begins unblocking jetliner sales to Iran,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - The United States has begun unblocking deals by Western planemakers to renew Iran's ageing passenger fleet in a move likely to ease growing complaints from Tehran over the implementation of last year's historic sanctions deal.Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Wednesday it had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting jetliners to Iran and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) said it looked forward to receiving similar licenses ""shortly"".The move signals the unfreezing of one of the most high-profile deals between Iran and foreign companies since last year's agreement between Tehran and world powers to open up trade in exchange for curbs on the country's nuclear activities.But complex questions remain over the financing of deals between Iran and Western planemakers that could still obstruct deliveries of many of the planes, in what is seen as a test case for Western trade and investment following the nuclear deal.Earlier this year, Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing each signed deals to supply over 100 jets to flag carrier IranAir to modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions.But nine months after the first deal was signed, Iranian officials have voiced growing concerns about what they see as slow progress in obtaining in the U.S. licenses needed for most modern aircraft because of their ample use of U.S. parts.An Iranian official told Reuters earlier this week that its deal for 118 Airbus jets was being trimmed by six units following the regulatory delays.Airbus said on Wednesday it had been granted an initial license to supply 17 A320 or A330 jets that are slated for early delivery, and that it expected a second license covering the remaining aircraft within the next few weeks.Aviation sources said the U.S. Treasury was expected within ""days"" to begin unblocking Boeing's deal to sell or lease over 100 jets.Iran has also ordered up to 40 Franco-Italian ATR (PA:AIR) (MI:SIFI) turboprop planes that are awaiting Washington's green light.Iran has said it could start receiving a limited number of aircraft this year.Some airlines are also looking at buying second-hand planes to meet their most urgent needs.Diplomats say new jets will allow pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to argue the sanctions deal is working, but the deals are opposed by U.S. Republicans who say the jets could be misused and by conservatives in Iran who oppose the country's opening and say the purchases will not benefit most Iranians.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We will at that point have a some clear public negotiating guidelines,"" David told a committee of lawmakers investigating the role of parliament in the Brexit process.The government has been pressed for detailed answers on how it intends to enact the decision to quit the bloc by everyone from business leaders to foreign allies. So far, it has revealed little.""Before Article 50 is triggered there will be a rather frustrating time, because we won't be saying an awful lot,"" Davis said. He said giving a running commentary on the talks would undermine Britain's negotiating stance.Separately, finance minister Philip Hammond sought to address the concerns of businesses about Brexit, meeting with large exporters like Honda (T:7267), Airbus (PA:AIR) and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) to tell them that trade with EU member states would be a priority in the exit talks.FAST AND RESPONSIVEOnce the exit process has been started, Britain has an initial two-year period to negotiate its departure. Davis said this time frame was possible, but would require the government to be ""nimble, fast and responsive."" The talks can be extended if both parties agree. Davis said parliament would be called upon to pass new laws to enact the exit from the bloc. The government has previously stated parliament did not need to approve the decision to trigger an exit.He said the negotiating strategy would be drawn up by assessing feedback from other government departments which have been asked to consult with relevant parties on the opportunities brought about by leaving, the risks of leaving, and best policies to mitigate those risks.""At that point, which is not yet, we will be doing some quite quantitative assessment of what we think the advantages and disadvantages are,"" he said.

However, year-on-year, retail sales declined by 1.5% last month, compared to expectations for a 0.3% rise.Market participants were looking ahead to a U.S. employment report due later Wednesday, for further indications on the strength of the economy.On Tuesday Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the U.S. labor market is almost at full strength and the pace of interest rate increases will be data dependent.Financial stocks were broadly higher, as French lenders  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) rallied 1.23% and 1.30%, while Germany’s  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) surged 2.00% and 4.27%.Germany’s Manager Magazin earlier reported that Deutsche Bank explored a possible merger with rival Commerzbank, without saying where it obtained the information, adding that the considerations were “only of a theoretical nature” and at a very early stage.Among peripheral lenders, Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) climbed 0.59% and 0.81% respectively, while Spanish banks BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) advanced 0.49% and 1.12%.Airbus Group (PA:AIR) added to gains, with shares up 1.19% after the company said it delivered more aircraft in August than for the same period in any previous year, improving its chances of meeting 2016 targets after earlier delays in receiving parts.In London, commodity-heavy FTSE 100 slipped 0.18%, weighed by sharp losses in the mining sector.Shares in  Rio Tinto  PLC (LON:RIO) tumbled 1.80% and BHP Billiton PLC (LON:BLT) lost 2.16%, while rivals  Randgold Resources  Ltd (LON:RRS) and  Anglo American  PLC (LON:AAL) plummeted 2.50% respectively.Meanwhile, financial stocks were sharply higher as Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) climbed 0.61% and the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) advanced 0.87%, while  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) jumped 1.38% and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) rallied 1.46%.ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) was also on the upside, with shares adding 0.12% after shareholders on Tuesday approved the recommended $32-billion cash offer made by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a steady to lower open.

846,"Aug 30, 2016 04:01PM ET",Airbus on course for record deliveries in August: executive,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus delivered more aircraft in August than for the same period in any previous year, its top planemaking executive said on Tuesday, in a breakthrough that improves its chances of meeting 2016 targets after earlier delays in receiving parts.Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of French business leaders, Fabrice Bregier did not give numbers for total deliveries, which have not yet been completed, but said Airbus had hit a crucial target of six A350 deliveries this month.""We tend to deliver a lot of planes in the last few days of the month, but what I can already tell you is that it will be the best month of August in Airbus's history, in terms of the number of planes delivered,"" said Bregier, who is president and chief executive of the planemaking unit of Airbus Group (PA:AIR).Its previous busiest August was in 2013, when it passed 47 aircraft to customers. For 2016 as a whole, it targets at least 650 deliveries, up 2.4 percent from last year.Until now, problems with supplies of cabin equipment have hampered deliveries of Europe's newest long-haul jet, the A350, leaving Airbus well short of its full-year target of 50 A350 deliveries with just 15 handed over to customers by the end of July.Airbus has also experienced delays in bringing out a new version of its best-selling A320 due to engine problems and asked staff to work overtime during the traditionally quiet summer to help catch up on deliveries of both models.""On the A350, we reached our objective which was to deliver six aircraft during the month,"" Bregier said.""This morning I attended the delivery of the first A350 to Thai Airways. That doesn't mean the (annual target of) 50 are in the pocket, but we are now at 21 (for the year) at end-August and if we keep up that rhythm of six to seven aircraft a month over the next four months, then we shouldn't be too, too far off.""Bregier paid tribute to Airbus staff who had responded to calls to stagger vacations and work extra hours over the summer.""That seems to be bearing fruit, at least for the A350. This was one of the important issues of the summer,"" he said.For total deliveries, Airbus is expected to remain behind U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA), which targets 740 to 745 deliveries this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

847,"Aug 29, 2016 05:12PM ET",Boeing keeps jetliner prices steady amid slowing sales,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Monday it will refrain from increasing jetliner prices for the first time since 2009 as the industry grapples with a slowdown in new plane sales.""Boeing will continue to quote July 2015 base prices in 2016,"" company spokesman Doug Alder said in an email to Reuters. Airlines typically negotiate steep discounts from the list prices that Boeing and rival plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) quote publicly, leaving the list prices as largely symbolic. Boeing has held prices steady during sales slow-downs in the past. It did not increase prices in 2001 or 2009, Alder noted.‎ Boeing and Airbus sales fell precipitously those years following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the financial crisis.This year, Boeing has booked new orders for 335 planes though Aug. 23, much fewer than the 418 jetliners in the first seven months of 2015, according to company data. Boeing list prices range from $80.6 million for the small 737-700 to $400 million for the large 777-9X.Airbus sales have slowed to a net 323 through July this year. That compares with 1,080 in all of 2015. Airbus prices range from about $88.6 million for an A319 up to $428 million for the double-decker A380.Both major plane makers have struggled to sell their big twin-aisle planes this year as low fuel prices have kept older planes flying longer. Boeing has said it feels particular pricing pressure from Airbus, but that it will not cut prices simply to win market share.Boeing said earlier this month that it may need to cut production of its twin-aisle 777 and skip a planned production rate increase on the 787 as a result unless sales improve. Boeing also is slowing production of its 747-8 jumbo jet.Airbus said in July that it would cut A380 production starting in 2018, citing weak demand for its largest plane.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

848,"Aug 29, 2016 02:56PM ET",Chinese-owned Zhongwang USA enters U.S. aluminum market with Aleris buy,nan,"By Luc CohenNEW YORK (Reuters) - Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminum magnate Liu Zhongtian, said on Monday it would buy U.S. aluminum company Aleris Corp in a bet by the billionaire that the nascent U.S. automotive aluminum sector will be the industry's next big growth market. The $2.33 billion deal comes as Liu and Zhongwang International Group Ltd, the parent of Zhongwang USA, are embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. It marks the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the U.S. aluminum industry since trade tensions began ramping up in recent years.Zhongwang International is also the parent of China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd, the world's second-largest producer of aluminum extrusions. It has been accused of evading U.S. import duties on extruded products, prompting an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). The acquisition has strategic importance because Aleris is in the midst of a $350 million expansion of its Lewisport, Kentucky rolling mill to produce automotive body sheet for U.S. auto manufacturers. It hopes to produce 200,000 tonnes per year and begin shipping in 2017. Liu noted in a statement that Aleris is ""well-positioned to capitalize on the positive demand trends we see globally."" Auto manufacturers like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have been moving toward aluminum, which is lighter than steel, to reduce body weight of autos in order to improve gasoline mileage, which will reduce emissions.Aleris has been owned by a group of funds including Oaktree Capital Management LP and Apollo Management LP since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2010. It has plants in the United States, Europe and Asia and supplies fabricated products to the aerospace, construction, automotive and defense industries.Sean Stack, chief executive of the Cleveland-based company, said the transition to strategic ownership from private equity would allow it to focus on long-term investments in the U.S. automotive market and aerospace market in China ""without worrying about the next quarter's performance.""Zhongwang produces extrusions for the automotive sector, and recently built a rolling mill in China for auto body sheet. Stack said the two parties have not yet gotten into the details of how they might collaborate.Extrusion is the process of shaping aluminum by forcing it to flow through an opening in a die. Aleris's mill in Zhenjiang, China mainly serves the aerospace sector, and is licensed to supply Bombardier Inc. , Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE. Zhongwang USA is majority-owned by Liu, China Zhongwang's founder. He has a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. The company will pay $1.11 billion in cash and take on Aleris's $1.22 billion in net debt.TRADE DISPUTEUpstream smelters and downstream extruders in the United States have both argued that subsidized Chinese aluminum production has depressed global prices and presented unfair competition. China Zhongwang - the subsidiary that is not the purchaser of Aleris - is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) into allegations from industry group the U.S. Aluminum Extruders Council (AEC), that the company evaded U.S. import tariffs on aluminum extrusions. Jeff Henderson, president of the AEC, said on Monday the deal ""raises very serious concerns for the entire industry.""China Zhongwang has denied the allegations.Zhongwang USA LLC is not owned by China Zhongwang, but the two are related through Zhongwang International and Liu. Stack said Zhongwang had assured Aleris that it denies the allegations and was cooperating with the DOC to resolve the case. He emphasized that the two were separate companies despite the link to Liu. ""This helps them move beyond that with very significant investment and exposure to the U.S. market,"" Stack said, referring to the trade case. ""Aleris' position doesn't change - we support free and fair trade with a level playing field."" Henderson disputed that Zhongwang had been cooperating with the DOC, noting that it had not responded to the department's questionnaires.""Zhongwang is a state-supported enterprise and has received large benefits and financing from the government of China. Zhongwang also has a long history of circumventing and evading duties in trade cases,"" Henderson said. Last year, short-seller Dupre Analytics accused China Zhongwang of doctoring its books, in a report cited widely in the AEC's complaint. The company denied those allegations.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was financial adviser to Aleris, while Moelis & Co advised Aleris on certain aspects of the deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Rolls-Royce said its Trent 700 engine had been chosen for about 70 percent of new A330 orders over the last five years.That engine, however, is behind some of the company's current difficulties - its profit is forecast to more than halve this year - as some airline customers wait for the newer, more fuel efficient Trent 7000, which powers the A330neo, leading to lower pricing on the Trent 700. Rolls-Royce said under the deal announced on Wednesday it would also provide China Eastern with maintenance services for the engines as part of its TotalCare offering.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

851,"Aug 22, 2016 01:30PM ET","Boeing internal forecast sees 535 jetliner sales in 2016, below target: AvWeek",nan,"SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) aims to sell 535 jetliners this year, Aviation Week reported on Monday, citing an internal company forecast, well below the plane maker's official forecast of 740 to 745 aircraft. If correct, the reduced tally would mirror a slowdown in aircraft sales at Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR). Widebody plane sales are under particular pressure.Still, asked about the internal forecast which has not been made public, Boeing said it remained committed to its target of selling about as many planes as it delivers this year, or about ""740 to 745."" ""We have a host of internal forecasts,"" Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said. ""As a general rule, we do not comment on internal numbers.""New aircraft sales have slowed as airlines rein in capacity amid weak global growth, and as low oil prices prompt some carriers to fly older planes longer, rather than upgrading to new fuel-efficient models. Also, many airlines already ordered new planes over the past few years, which has cooled demand.Alder noted Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's recent comment that 737 sales could allow Boeing to achieve its goal, even if widebody sales remain slow.""This year's order cycle is more favorable on the narrow bodies,"" Muilenburg said on a July 27 conference call. ""We expect the predominance of that orders flow this year to be in the narrow-bodies arena."" The company is working to sell more widebodies and doing ""a lot of scenario planning,"" he said, adding that Boeing won't cut prices to win orders. Aviation Week said Boeing aims to book 88 orders each for its 777 and 787 widebodies this year. So far, Boeing has sold 19 of its 787 Dreamliners and eight 777s, according to official Boeing data. Boeing especially needs to sell 777s to fill a gap in its assembly line as it phases out that plane for the successor 777X over the next few years. It said this month that it might cut 777 production and defer a planned 787 production increase if it cannot book more orders.According to the forecast reported by Aviation Week, Boeing aims to sell 324 of its narrowbody 737 aircraft, 14 of its widebody 747 jumbo jets and 21 of its widebody 767 model in 2016.Boeing's official forecast isn't broken down by model. So far this year, it has sold four 747s, seven 767s and 297 of its 737 model. Boeing has a backlog of 5,697 unfilled orders.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

855,"Aug 16, 2016 03:20AM ET","Airbus, Boeing brace for crucial phase in subsidies dispute",nan,"By Tom Miles and Tim HepherGENEVA/PARIS (Reuters) - The world's two largest jetmakers are bracing for the next round in a transatlantic spat over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies, amid accusations of widening U.S. support for Boeing (N:BA) and persistent European aid to Airbus. (PA:AIR)After a year-long lull, the world's biggest trade dispute will enter a crucial phase in coming months, potentially casting a shadow over faltering efforts by the European Union and United States to negotiate a wider free-trade deal.At stake are mutual claims of unfair subsidies to the two planemakers that raise the prospect of $22 billion a year in threatened trade sanctions, though many say a resolution remains years away and could ultimately involve a negotiated settlement.The dispute, said to be the biggest in terms of value and time, dates back to 2004 when the U.S. urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to act against European government loans to help Airbus develop jets such as the A380, followed by a counter-claim from the EU over federal and local aid for Boeing. In separate rulings, the WTO found that both planemakers had benefited from billions of dollars of unfair subsidies.The case is now bogged down in arguments over whether each side complied with orders to withdraw illegal subsidies and undo the effects of the majority of aid which, although not banned, can be challenged if it can be proved to be damaging. After a three-year delay due to the strain placed on its resources by the marathon dispute, the WTO is expected to rule within weeks on whether the EU obeyed its rulings, followed by a similar report on U.S. compliance early next year. Both sides claim the other ignored the thousands of pages of judgments and appeal findings in each case and have sought WTO permission to draw up sanctions, with the U.S. calling for up to $10 billion in counter-measures and the EU $12 billion.U.S. sources have said they are confident the WTO will find the EU flouted its decisions, while the European side has called U.S. accusations ""empty"".TAX-BREAK CHALLENGETogether, the cases affecting tens of thousands of aerospace jobs are seen as the biggest test of a multilateral system for resolving trade disputes since the WTO was founded in 1995. Any sanctions could further complicate relations as the U.S. and EU remain bogged down in differences over a proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), amid growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic.As the two existing Airbus-Boeing cases that have dominated the WTO's disputes forum for more than a decade creep towards a conclusion, a third WTO dispute affecting the world's two largest planemakers is simultaneously gathering pace.Last year, the EU complained that Boeing was set to receive unfair support for its latest plane, the 777X, from Washington state thanks to an $8.7 billion package of expanded tax breaks.In a confidential draft report, a WTO panel found Boeing would get some fresh subsidy from the tax decision, although it rejected several EU arguments, three people familiar with the case said.One European source called it an important win for the EU. A U.S. source denied this, saying claims that the EU is poised to win the case are ""false"", and a distraction from its inaction over earlier WTO rulings, but declined further comment.The WTO and all the parties declined comment.No publication date has been set for the interim findings, but they are typically released a few months after parties see a copy. Previous WTO rulings on aircraft subsidies have been bitterly disputed, with both sides finding support for their arguments in the trade body's decisions and there are no signs that this report will be any different when it is published.In parallel previous rulings, the WTO found both sides had doled out subsidies worth billions of dollars to their leading planemakers, sparking feuds between Airbus and Boeing over which side had won a greater percentage of the arguments in each case.The latest dispute over Washington tax measures adds a third pillar to the sprawling trade dispute and, just like earlier cases, is expected to take years of legal arguments and appeals.The EU argues that the 2013 package of preferential business tax rates, tax credits and tax exemptions represented subsidies to Boeing in return for securing the coveted 777X jetliner work.It also claims the support falls into the WTO's most severe category, that of ""prohibited"" subsidies, because it depends on the use of domestic over imported goods. U.S. industry sources argue the measures are available to any aerospace company in the state, including even a few suppliers to Airbus, and don't fall into the WTO's subsidy net.Washington state's 2013 tax package for aerospace companies is largely the same as an earlier 2003 package, which the WTO found caused ""serious prejudice.""   The 2013 law extended all of the 2003 benefits from 2024 to 2040, and added exemptions for sales and use taxes on new plants used to manufacture airplanes, wings or fuselages.In 2011, the WTO ruled earlier versions of the incentives from Washington state were subsidies that caused ""serious prejudice"" to Airbus, but rejected Europe's claim that they crossed the line of support that is prohibited automatically.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

856,"Aug 08, 2016 02:01PM ET","Germany, Netherlands to test joint missile defense operations for possible eastern deployment",nan,"By Andrea ShalalCOLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany and the Netherlands will in October test joint operations of their Patriot air and missile defense systems in what could be a model for multilateral deployments to Poland or the Baltic states in coming years, a top German general said.Brigadier General Michael Gschossmann said joint operations enabled by the new approach could help NATO reassure Baltic member states and Poland, which are clamoring for more defense after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia say they fear Russian aggression should Moscow's relations with the U.S.-led Atlantic alliance deteriorate further. The Baltic states are linked to the rest of NATO only by a narrow strip of land running between Belarus, a staunch ally of Russia, and Kaliningrad, the heavily militarised Russian coastal enclave.The October test will validate a new joint concept of operations for air and missile defense developed by Germany and the Netherlands over the past year, the first of its kind in Europe, Gschossmann, commander of ground-based units for Germany's Air Force, told Reuters in an interview.More than 40 interceptors will be fired during an exercise at a NATO site in Crete in early October that will include 300 German and 100 Dutch soldiers, as well as 10 U.S. soldiers and a U.S. Aegis destroyer, according to German and U.S. officials.After the test, German and Dutch military officials plan to declare their Bi-national Air & Missile Defence Task Force ready for combat, and will offer it to NATO for future deployments.Baltic state officials welcomed U.S. deployment of a Patriot battery to eastern Europe during a series of exercises earlier this summer, but the symbolic value would be greater if the deployment involved more than one country, Gschossmann said.""REASSURANCE""""We could offer even more reassurance and send a political signal if we took a mixed task force with German, Dutch and U.S. Patriot systems - a purely defensive asset - and set it somewhere in Poland or the Baltic states.""Dutch, German and U.S. Patriot missile systems were rolled out separately in Turkey for two years from January 2013, where they helped protect fellow alliance member Ankara's air space against the possibility of missile attacks from war-torn Syria.The new German-Dutch concept of operations uses the Surface to Air Missile Operations Centre, which was initially developed by Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE for the German Air Force. The SAMOC system can now manage all air defense equipment operated by NATO members, although Soviet-style surface-to-air missile systems still used by Poland and other eastern European states as a legacy of their Communist past cannot be fully automated and requires a human in the loop.The German-Dutch air and missile defense cooperation, signed in January and known as Project APOLLO, is part of a broader series of steps that have closely bound the two countries' navies and ground forces together in recent years. Gschossman said Germany and the Netherlands also plan to jointly develop an air defense system operated directly by their armies to replace the Stinger guided missile, which must be phased out in the next decade.Dutch Defence Ministry spokesman Jeroen de Vries said the two countries were looking into integrating the Dutch and German Patriot missile systems. ""The task force can be deployed within NATO as capacity to protect alliance territory,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

859,"Aug 08, 2016 08:08AM ET",UK to probe Airbus's use of third-party agents to sell planes,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) faces a lengthy and potentially disruptive investigation over its commercial jet sales after Britain said it would examine suspected irregularities in the use of third-party agents to win contracts. Europe's largest aerospace company said late on Sunday it had been notified that the UK's Serious Fraud Office had opened a formal criminal probe after being alerted by the country's export credit agency to discrepancies relating to the disclosure of the work of local agents. The probe raises a sensitive issue for the industry because the agency, UK Export Finance, has for years locked horns with aerospace firms about the need for more transparency, even though it does not object outright to the use of intermediaries. Airbus Group said the SFO was looking into possible ""fraud, bribery and corruption"" and that the company continued to co-operate with the investigating agency, having itself tipped off UKEF about internal findings under a recent compliance drive. ""It will take years,"" a person familiar with the matter said of the SFO investigation, adding it was too early to predict any outcome or consequences for the company or the industry.Airbus virtually eliminated the gap with U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) in their intense battle for airliner orders in July after booking about half of the 197 firm sales unveiled at the Farnborough Airshow.Airbus Group is already the subject of a four-year-old SFO investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia, while the SFO is conducting a corruption probe into engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) which it launched in 2013. The latest case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back years, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. In April, UKEF halted export funding over the reported discrepancies and was swiftly followed by France and Germany. Under rules dating back to July 2006, companies applying for export support in Britain must identify any intermediaries involved in sales negotiations and list the sums paid. The rules followed a series of policy U-turns and a fierce debate between UKEF and aerospace companies including Airbus, which had lobbied against the tougher disclosure rules on the grounds that such data was commercially sensitive and that their own codes of conduct and due diligence methods were sufficient.Airbus Group shares fell 1.5 percent on Monday. The longer-term impact may depend on how widely the investigation spreads and the level of managers who signed off on payments that can be worth millions of dollars, as well as the declarations to export agencies about them, analysts said.A spokesman declined to comment on any details of the investigation beyond Sunday's brief statement.FUNDING RACESeparately, Airbus is trying to restore export funding from UKEF under a revised compliance scheme. The company said last month it had agreed a process for this and expected export credits to resume in the fourth quarter. But several people familiar with the case say it has deeply soured relations between Airbus and export agencies, notably UKEF, and that much work remains to be done to restore trust. As for the operational impact of the funding hiatus, analysts say this is limited for now because liquid markets mean there is little demand for export credit. Just 5 percent of Airbus deliveries were supported by export credits last year. One person familiar with the case told Reuters the onus was on Airbus to prove it had a robust system for preventing abuse. One move being floated to win back confidence is a voluntary ban within Airbus on the use of percentage commissions to third-party sales agents and more careful vetting of any other form of payment, people familiar with the matter said. The move is designed to allay concerns that payments in countries where it is common to have local representatives, which include parts of Asia and the Middle East, could be seen as a potential vehicle for bribery. But it could provide a headache for a company which has stated to UK authorities in the past that it relies on a long-established network of representatives to remain competitive, and the ban does not appear to have unanimous support. It could also reopen former divisions between Airbus and its parent group, whose chief executive Tom Enders launched the new tough compliance drive under a new legal head. Currently, the playing field with Boeing is level as the corresponding system in the United States is also frozen due to political deadlock which has left the U.S. Export Import (EXIM) Bank without a fully functioning board. But with some U.S. officials predicting EXIM could resume funding for Boeing exports around the turn of the year, Airbus could be disadvantaged in some emerging markets unless it achieves its target of reopening European credits by year-end.In the meantime both Airbus and Boeing are having to offer the least creditworthy airlines some bridge financing.""Financial markets have priced in aircraft financing at attractive rates so EXIM and European credit agencies haven't had to step in. But I think this is going to become an issue,"" an aviation sector analyst said, asking not to be identified.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

862,"Aug 04, 2016 07:55PM ET",Airbus closes on rival Boeing in jet order race,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alwyn ScottPARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) virtually closed the gap with Boeing in their intense battle for airliner orders in July after booking about half of the 197 firm sales unveiled at last month's Farnborough Airshow, according to the latest data from both companies.Amid a broad slowdown in purchases, the European planemaker said it had sold a total of 373 jets between January and July, or 323 after adjusting for cancellations.That compares with 383 airplane sales, or 333 after cancellations, by U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA).Combined orders at the world's dominant planemakers fell 17 percent from the same period last year, weighed by concerns over the economy and relatively low oil prices, which have taken the edge off demand for new fuel-saving models.Both planemakers are struggling to book new sales in a market that is seen as somewhat oversupplied with jets, especially larger wide-body models, industry experts said.The slowdown has raised some questions about whether the companies will maintain plans to boost output later this decade. Both have also faced a slew of order deferrals in recent weeks, while insisting the trend of postponements is stable.Two industry sources said Indonesia's Lion Air, one of the largest jet buyers with hundreds on order from Boeing and Airbus, is weighing the deferral of about 25 Airbus jets.Airbus declined comment and Lion Air was not available.Airbus was also hammering out details of an order for 100 more planes from Lion Air's regional rival AirAsia (KL:AIRA), announced in a shower of publicity at Farnborough.After a slow start to the year, Airbus had looked set to end the Farnborough Airshow with 380 net orders for the year to date including the AirAsia deal, which it described as a firm order.The deal did not make it into the new tally, however, and an Airbus spokesman said paperwork was being finalised. A person close to the talks said this only involved tying up loose ends.Latest Airbus data also suggested that another order secured at the height of an industry boom in 2012 had been trimmed back. Mexican low-cost carrier Interjet has canceled five of 40 A320neo jets it has on order, according to the monthly update.An airline spokeswoman said the change was part of an ""operational swap,"" without giving further details. The cancellation emerged as Mexican consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in two years amid a weak economy.DELIVERY WOESWhile Boeing remains ahead by a whisker in the race for new orders, it maintains a solid lead on deliveries which drive revenues, handing over 432 jets between January and July.Airbus delivered 339 jets between January and July, down 4 percent on the year, due in part to a shortage of Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines for its newly revamped A320neo.It delivered just three of those jets in July, including two powered by Pratt & Whitney and the first to be delivered with alternative engines from CFM International (N:GE) (PA:SAF).So far this year it has delivered 11 A320neos and 15 of its widebody A350s, another model suffering delays due in part to problems with suppliers. It aims to deliver 50 A350s this year.Industry sources say that besides widely reported problems with cabin equipment such as toilets, the A350 has faced other glitches including quality problems with wing spoilers from Austrian parts maker FACC (VI:FACC). An Airbus spokesman said these problems had been resolved. FACC declined to comment.New Airbus data also incorporated the cancellation by Qatar Airways of the first of 50 A320neo-family jets it has ordered.The Gulf airline has criticized Airbus and Pratt & Whitney over A320neo delays and said in June it would exercise a clause to abandon the first jet, one of several parked in Qatar livery outside the French factory waiting for engines .Parent Airbus Group said last week that upgraded versions of the engines were now being delivered. Meanwhile, Qatar Airways is in talks with Boeing for rival 737 MAX jets to diversify its fast-expanding fleet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

863,"Aug 04, 2016 05:55PM ET","Iran nuclear pact opponents lobby in U.S. against Boeing, Airbus deals",nan,"By Patricia ZengerleWASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. Treasury Department decides whether to license sales of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) commercial aircraft to Iran, opponents of last year's nuclear pact with the Islamic republic have launched a lobbying campaign against the deals.The international agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program made such sales possible by easing sanctions on Tehran, but some members of the U.S. Congress who oppose it want to block proposed sales of some 200 jetliners, worth about $50 billion at list prices, to renew Iran Air's aging fleet.While the lawmakers oppose any action that could boost the Tehran government, they also argue that Iran could use passenger aircraft for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or elsewhere.Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest planemakers, struck provisional agreements with the Iranian carrier earlier this year.The Republican-majority Congress could pass legislation to block the sales even if the Treasury Department approved them. The House of Representatives last month passed two amendments that would have stopped the sales, although to become law they would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.This week, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington foreign policy research group, which has criticized the nuclear pact and advocated tougher sanctions on Iran, organized letters signed by dozens of national security figures expressing concern about the aircraft sales and promising to increase pressure on Congress.""This deal ... represents a legitimization of a State Sponsor of Terror and a direct benefit for a ruling regime responsible for gross human rights abuses, support for terrorism including threats against the U.S. and its allies,"" said the letters to Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chairman, and Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus' plane manufacturing unit.The 42 signers included former Secretary of State George Shultz, former CIA Director Michael Hayden and former U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman.HEATED POLITICSAviation industry experts said Treasury likely would not approve the sales until after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, although the companies would like to move more quickly.The campaign season ""is not the time to push it,"" said Adam Pilarski, a senior vice president at the Avitas aviation consultancy in Virginia. ""Once we have a resolution of who the president is, calmer heads will prevail. It is business that is good for the U.S.""Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state under Obama, supports the nuclear deal. Republican candidate Donald Trump opposes it.Treasury said it would not address its engagement with specific companies.Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined comment on the lobbying campaign, saying the company was working with U.S. authorities to ensure that all its activities complied with applicable laws and regulations. John Dern, a Boeing spokesman, said the company is continuing to talk with approved Iranian airlines, that all its actions to date have been licensed by the U.S. government and that any final agreements also would need approval.Since it is based in Chicago, Boeing must obtain a license from Treasury before the sale can go through. France-based Airbus must also obtain a license, as would virtually any aircraft maker, because its planes contain more than 10 percent U.S. content.Supporters of the Boeing sale say American firms will lose out to foreign competitors if the U.S. government bars sales to Iran. Although the nuclear pact eased sanctions connected to Iran's nuclear program, restrictions related to concerns such as terrorism support and human rights abuses remain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

867,"Jul 28, 2016 08:38AM ET",Boeing says it could end 747 production,nan,"(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) could end production of its iconic 747 aircraft, as the world's biggest plane maker faces falling orders and pricing pressure, according to a regulatory filing.""If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747,"" Boeing said on Wednesday.Boeing said it had canceled plans to increase production of the 747 to one plane per month from 2019, and stuck to its plan of halving the production rate in September.""On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market,"" Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a post-earnings call with analysts.""Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing declined to elaborate on the filing or the comments on Thursday.The production rate of the 747, which was 1.5 per month in June 2015, dropped to one per month in this month.The latest version of the 747 is used by Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa and Air China, among others.Boeing is not alone in facing problems with sales of the biggest passenger jets - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) has also been hit by weak demand.Airbus confirmed this week that it plans to roughly halve production of its A380 superjumbo as airlines shun large four-engined jets in favor of smaller two-engined models.The planemaker said earlier this month that it would cut the A380 delivery target to 12 a year from 2018, from 27 in 2015, to prevent a glut of unsold planes.The move raises the possibility that Airbus could revert to losses on the double-decker jet after breaking even for the first time last year, but averts the need to start ordering parts for unsold planes - something it has pledged not to do.Parts for A380s must be ordered up to two years in advance.Boeing reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss on Wednesday, helped by strong performances in its passenger jet and defense businesses.Up to Wednesday's close of $135.96, the company's shares had fallen about 6 percent since the start of the year."

However, the company joined Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the No.4 U.S. airline by traffic, in warning of a drop in a key profitability metric for the third quarter. American said it expected revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to fall 3.5-5.5 percent in the current quarter, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Jamie Baker said was ""at the higher end of our expectations.""A day earlier, Southwest forecast a decline of 3-4 percent in RASM, a key indicator of an airline's performance that measures sales against flight capacity.American said it would defer taking the delivery of the A350 aircraft from Airbus Group (PA:AIR) to late 2018 through 2022, with an average deferral of 26 months.The deferral will reduce planned capital spending for 2017 and 2018, the company said.American's operating costs fell 3.3 percent to $8.61 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, with fuel costs declining by a fifth.Net income plunged 44 percent to $950 million as provisions for income tax surged to $543 million from $15 million.Excluding an item, its profit of $1.77 per share handily beat the average analyst estimate of $1.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue declined 4.3 percent to $10.36 billion, hurt by intense competition, global macroeconomic headwinds and foreign currency weakness. There are investor concerns that carriers will continue to add flights and push down prices despite insufficient demand, and rebounding oil prices will add to their fuel costs.Economic slowdown abroad poses an even greater risk to revenue, with foreigners reluctant to buy tickets on U.S. airlines to visit the United States as the dollar rises in value against other currencies.American expects pretax margin of about 12-14 percent for the third quarter, excluding special items, compared with 15.4 percent in the second quarter.The company expects revenue to get a boost from the Olympics, which start next month.American's shares were up 2.7 percent at $35.88 in late morning trading.

872,"Jul 21, 2016 06:55PM ET","Boeing warns of more than $2 billion in charges, shares drop",nan,"By Alwyn Scott(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) second-quarter results will include more than $2 billion in charges related to the 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs, the aerospace and defense company said on Thursday.Boeing shares fell 1 percent after hours to $132.26 after the company gave notice of its largest write-offs in years, to be detailed in quarterly results on Wednesday.The combined charges of $2.05 billion address high-profile problems such as dwindling demand for very large planes like the 747 and a hangover of nearly $30 billion in deferred costs from producing the 787 Dreamliner.They also reflect Boeing's well-known problems with KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force that analysts had expected to hit earnings.In its announcement, Boeing reaffirmed its forecast for full-year revenue and cash, but said it will update its earnings per share outlook on Wednesday.""These are the right, proactive decisions to strengthen our business going forward,"" Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.The 787 charge of $847 million after tax, or $1.33 a share, stems from two test planes made in 2009 that remain unsold. The costs will be reclassified and shifted from 787 inventory to research and development expense, helping to reduce the deferred cost balance, Boeing said.Boeing said the charge was not a ""reach forward loss"" that would have reflected a change in assumptions about future earnings from the high-tech aircraft. The amount was in line with prior charges for 787s, said Carter Copeland, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York, but was not expected and left a large deferred balance. ""It's a small number in the grand scheme of things,"" he said.The 747 charge of $814 million after tax, or $1.28 a share, reflects anticipated weak demand for air cargo shipments. A year ago, Boeing cut production of its 747-8 aircraft to six per year, citing the weak market. At the time, it said it expected the market to improve by 2019, allowing it to lift output to 12 a year. Those assumptions now appear unlikely to materialize, the company said, meaning fewer 747-8 freighter aircraft are likely to be produced in the future. Last week, rival Airbus (PA:AIR) said it was cutting production of its biggest plane, the A380, also because of weak demand for large aircraft.The KC-46 tanker charge of $393 million after tax, or 62 cents a share, covers delays in deliveries and hardware issues that the company had already announced. Boeing said the charge did not include costs for potential compensation the U.S. Air Force is seeking for the schedule delay and initial operational deficiencies of the aircraft.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia, said the issues arose from de-emphasis of engineering at Boeing. Still, he said, ""they are starting to deal with the problems that have been in the works for some time now.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

875,"Jul 15, 2016 03:31PM ET",Canada says follows trade rules as Brazil mulls Bombardier WTO move,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Ana ManoMONTREAL/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Canada insisted on Friday that it plays by international trade rules after Brazil warned it may challenge government funding to planemaker Bombardier Inc, a move that would revive a two-decade-old dispute between the two countries.The Montreal-based company is locked in competition with Brazil's Embraer for narrowbody jet sales. The South American country has said favorable government financing gives Bombardier an unfair advantage in sales campaigns.Brazilian Foreign Minister Jose Serra told Reuters on Thursday it could move against Canada at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over $1 billion in funding that Bombardier received from the Canadian province of Quebec.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau brushed off the suggestion, telling reporters ""there is no country in the world that doesn’t heavily subsidize its aerospace sector.""Brazil and Canada have locked horns repeatedly at the WTO over the past 20 years regarding state support for Embraer and Bombardier, the world's biggest commercial planemakers after powerhouses Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus Group (PA:AIR)..Ottawa is also in discussions with Bombardier on matching Quebec's investment in the CSeries program, which ran years late and billions of dollars over budget. Quebec and Bombardier want the federal government to match the province's CSeries investment, but negotiations have dragged on, with sources close to the talks saying Trudeau's Liberal government wants changes to the plane and train maker's dual-class share structure.Embraer's concerns about the funding boiled over in April when Bombardier won a deal to provide 75 aircraft for U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) for the CSeries narrowbody jet, beating Embraer's E190 family of jets with what many industry watchers saw as an aggressive bid.The Brazilian company said at the time it was no longer ""competing with a private enterprise."" A Bombardier executive said on Friday that Embraer was likely worried about the competition from the CSeries, which made its first scheduled commercial flight on Friday with Swiss Airlines.""They have seen our airplane go through the certification process and now enter into service. There is certainly a lot more competition and they are probably concerned about what the CSeries means for their business,"" said Ross Mitchell, a vice president of commercial operations for Bombardier.Speaking in Calgary, Trudeau echoed the sentiment, saying competitors were ""rightly worried"" about the CSeries jet.An Embraer spokesman said the company has asked the Brazilian government to monitor any funding the federal government gives Bombardier.""Embraer is capable of competing against any companies, but not against the government of Canada,"" he said.Quebec's equity stake in the CSeries, first agreed to in 2015, is more difficult to challenge than a straight export subsidy arrangement, said trade lawyer Mark Warner at MAAW Law in Toronto. However, Embraer could raise legitimate questions over Delta buying CSeries jets at heavily discounted prices, especially given that the Canadian company had not signed a single deal for the planes in more than a year before ones with Delta and Air Canada in 2016.At the very least, Brazil's threat of a challenge could scare away potential customers who see risks to future funding for Bombardier from Canadian governments.“Most people don’t like messy situations,” Warner said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

876,"Jul 15, 2016 11:40AM ET",Jetmakers shrug off demand risks after mixed Farnborough,nan,"By Tim HepherFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - When a freak English summer storm flooded exhibition halls at this week's Farnborough Airshow, the stiff-lipped announcer told sodden aerospace executives: ""Please do not panic: we will not evacuate at this stage.""It was a message meant to reassure, but not exactly guaranteed to inspire confidence.After a chaotic and storm-ridden show, ""keep calm and carry on"" is also the message from the world's major jetmakers as they cling to bullish long-term forecasts despite economic and political concerns overshadowing aviation markets.Airbus (PA:AIR), Boeing (N:BA) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3) all upgraded their demand forecasts this week. But orders were slower than some expected, with several airlines said to be holding off making decisions.""People ask if this is showing the end of the cycle. I just have to say that ... we are on track as an industry for another good sales year and certainly on track for some really impressive delivery numbers,"" said Boeing marketing vice-president Randy Tinseth.As Farnborough organizers rued their inadequate weather preparations, order announcements flowed in corporate chalets.But they were reliant on a few players such as AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes, and some analysts say there are signs that while the jet industry remains standing, the roof is starting to leak.That is especially true of wide-body long-haul jets, with the market struggling to absorb deliveries later this decade.Although Airbus started the show with a high-profile order of A350 jets from Virgin Atlantic and Boeing expanded its 787 Dreamliner presence in China, there were relatively few orders for the industry's big jets, and none for the Boeing 777.According to Deloitte, Farnborough and its sister Paris air show, held every other year, have produced an average of just over a quarter of annual airplane orders over the past decade. That suggests this year's event might have produced close to 400 deals to be on trend. Instead, the total of firm deals was 216, though still-provisional ones would more than double that.WEIGHING THE RISKSNow, the greater test is whether orders will hold intact and whether manufacturers can learn from past mistakes on production and deliver their record backlog of jet orders smoothly.Deloitte says 13 percent of the industry's massive order book is vulnerable to deferral or cancellation but that jetmakers are cushioned by backlogs which have swelled to 6-10 years from 3-5 years, thanks in part to deliberate overbooking.Several industry sources say the second half of that backlog is flimsier than the first and that many buyers have more flexibility than planemakers would like to admit publicly.""Are they orders or cheap options? That is what we are going to find out,"" said Richard Aboulafia of U.S.-based Teal Group.Although manufacturers say deferrals have not yet risen, industry sources say they are spending more time monitoring customers to watch for any risk to near-term deliveries. The S&P Aerospace and Defense index rose 1 percent in the past week, slightly underperforming a 1.6 percent market rise.""People are twitchy, but they are not quite sure why they are twitchy because there isn't much evidence to support it,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris.Still, the trade part of the show opened and closed with reminders of deeper political and economic risks to jet demand, which is sensitive to business confidence and consumption.Britain's David Cameron opened the show as prime minister only to find his departure from office, following a referendum defeat, accelerated when Theresa May emerged as his successor.Two weeks after Britain's decision to leave the European Union, online travel bookings to and from the UK remain down, according to online travel agent Tripsta. Any prolonged dip could unsettle jet buyers with large UK coverage like Emirates.News late Thursday of a truck attack in France, killing over 80 people, also tragically underscored security risks cited by some executives, worried too about Middle East instability, tensions between the West and Russia and weak Latin American economies.However, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said the industry had coped with a series of shocks. Only one - the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States - made an appreciable dent in a long-term trend of air traffic doubling every 15 years, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

877,"Jul 14, 2016 10:39PM ET",Exclusive: Brazil considers WTO challenge to Bombardier state funding,nan,"By Alonso Soto and Lisandra ParaguassuBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil may launch a trade challenge against Canada over state funding to struggling planemaker Bombardier Inc that could hurt Brazilian rival Embraer, Foreign Minister Jose Serra told Reuters on Thursday. Serra, a former presidential candidate who took over the ministry two months ago, said a $1 billion investment in Bombardier from the province of Quebec was a ""subsidy"" and gave the company an unfair advantage against Embraer.""We are studying opening (a challenge) again as in the past,"" Serra said in an interview. ""Why the need for that subsidy from Quebec?""It was the first time a senior Brazilian official has publicly acknowledged the possibility of a challenge to the Canadian state funding at the World Trade Organization (WTO).A new dispute at the WTO would again pit two of the world's biggest planemakers and stoke tensions between major economies fighting for a piece of the global trade market at a time of sluggish growth. Brazil is reeling from one of its worst economic recessions in generations that has cost nearly two million jobs in the last year. Quebec decided to buy a near 50-percent stake in the long-delayed CSeries jet program, which is billions of dollars over-budget. The investment will be made in two installments of $500 million, the first on June 30 and the second Sept. 1, according to deal inked by both sides on June 23.Bombardier is also in talks with the Canadian federal government over a possible investment in the aircraft program. Embraer has threatened to challenge the state funding, which it says gives Bombardier an unfair advantage in sales campaigns where its new CSeries is up against Embraer's E-Jets.Brazil and Canada have locked horns repeatedly at the WTO over the past two decades regarding state support for Embraer and Bombardier, the world's biggest commercial planemakers after powerhouses Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus Group (PA:AIR).Any dispute over Canadian aid to Bombardier this time could also drag Boeing and Airbus, whose planes would compete with the CSeries passenger jet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

880,"Jul 13, 2016 08:45AM ET",Airbus says output cut won't drive A380 massively into red,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus's (PA:AIR) decision to cut production of the world's biggest passenger jet, the A380, will not drive the program massively into the red, the European planemaker's group chief executive said on Wednesday.Tom Enders added that Airbus remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the double-decker, 544-seat A380, and hopes to return to higher levels of output in the years ahead. ""I hope that this is only a year or two and then we can raise production rates again,"" he told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow. Enders was speaking a day after Airbus cut its target for A380 deliveries to 12 a year from 2018, from 27 in 2015 and well below its current break-even point, due to weak demand. The reduction deals a blow to one of Europe's biggest and most expensive industrial projects. Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) have enjoyed years of booming sales, driven by rising air travel and demand for new fuel-efficient planes. But risks to the global economy, from slowing growth in China to Britain's decision to leave the European Union, have caused sales to dry up and analysts are worried some of the industry's record order backlog could be deferred or canceled.So far at the Farnborough Airshow, the industry's showcase event, Airbus and Boeing have announced combined business worth a little more than $50 billion, including deals that confirmed preliminary agreements. That is less than half of the business closed at last year's sister event in Paris. Airbus shares dipped to 50.67 euros in early trading, but by 1200 GMT were up 0.8 percent at 52.63 euros. Jefferies analysts said they had already been expecting the A380 to make a trading loss, before research and development costs, of 250 million euros in 2018, 300 million in 2019 and 350 million in 2020. They added the cut in production could be a prelude to a revamped A380neo, with new engines, to counter the new version of Boeing's most profitable widebody jet, the 777, being developed by the U.S. company. Enders said Airbus would strive to break-even on the A380 at lower rates of production.""How far we can bring it down, we will have to see,"" he said. ""I do not expect to be massively in the red.""Each A380 is worth $432.6 million at list prices, but after discounts it would sell for significantly less. Sales of large four-engine airliners such as the A380 have been hit hard by improvements in the range and efficiency of smaller two-engined models, which can be easier to fill.The trend became starker on Monday when one of the mammoth plane's earliest advocates, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, opted for 12 of Airbus's A350-1000 twin-engined jets after progressively shelving its long-standing order for A380s.In another blow, Airbus finance chief Harald Wilhelm said on Wednesday the company was likely to take a fresh charge in first-half results later this month for the latest problems involving its A400M military transporter.Problems that the company partially blames on the gearbox of the aircraft's large turboprop engines have disrupted deliveries of the already delayed military plane and driven up costs.Wilhelm, who gave no indication of the size of the potential charge, said there was also a risk of charges related to loss-making contracts for the A350 jetliner, but that these would not affect the aircraft's overall break-even target.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It did not disclose the value of the deal. The orders are a boost for the ARJ-21, which is more than 10 years behind its original schedule and had its first commercial flight with Chengdu Airlines in end-June.It competes with similar small passenger jets produced by Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and the Russian Sukhoi Superjet.The ARJ-21 has garnered just over 300 orders, mainly from domestic carriers.  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) aviation arm supplies the engines, and its leasing firm has ordered five planes with options for 20 more.It has not received certification from other regulators such as the United States' Federal Aviation Administration, which means that only airlines in China and those that recognize the Chinese certification process can operate the aircraft.China is keen to establish itself as a global supplier of aircraft, and hopes that its in-development C919 narrowbody jet will compete with the established 737s and A320s. It is also working on a widebody aircraft project with Russia.(Additional Reporting by Brenda Goh in SHANGHAI; Editing by Stephen Coates and Jacqueline Wong)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

886,"Jul 11, 2016 09:02AM ET",Planemakers shrug off economy worries as travel demand grows,nan,"By Sarah Young and Conor HumphriesFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) raised their long-term forecasts for new aircraft demand on Monday, betting that rising wealth in Asia would continue to boost air travel and offset any short-term hits to the global economy.The world's two biggest planemakers also announced a flurry of multi-billion dollar jet deals at the biennial Farnborough Airshow, which opened on Monday 45 miles (72 km) southwest of London.Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed years of strong sales, with rising air travel and demand for new fuel-efficient planes raising the industry's order backlog to a record 13,500 planes at the end of 2015, or near 10 years of production at current rates.Some analysts have cautioned that economic risks from slowing growth in China to Britain's decision to leave the European Union could see orders start to dry up or be canceled, particularly for larger twin-aisle jets.The planemakers remain bullish, however.Boeing forecast airlines will need 39,620 new aircraft worth $5.9 trillion over the next 20 years, up 4.1 percent from its estimate last year.""Despite recent events that have impacted the financial markets, the aviation sector will continue to see long-term growth with the commercial fleet doubling in size,"" said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.Boeing forecast airline passenger traffic would increase by 4.8 percent per year over the next two decades.Airbus raised its 20-year demand forecast to 30,070 new aircraft, up 500 from its previous estimate, and saw passenger traffic rising by an average 4.5 percent per year.""Middle classes in emerging markets will double to 3.5 billion people by 2035,"" Airbus said in a statement, predicting particularly strong demand in China and India.Some industry executives sounded more cautious, however.David Joyce, chief executive of aero engines maker GE Aviation, said he did not see any need for further increases in planned airliner production which Airbus and Boeing are both considering as they strive to meet their order backlogs.NARROWBODY OR WIDEBODY?Opening the Farnborough event, British Prime Minister David Cameron finalised multi-billion dollar deals with Boeing to buy nine P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and to upgrade 50 Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters.Britain's shock decision in a referendum last month to leave the EU is providing the latest jolt to the global economy. However, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer said he didn't think the decision would fundamentally alter Britain's ties with the U.S. military or weapons-related trade.Among the civil aircraft deals announced at Farnborough, Virgin Atlantic ordered 12 of Airbus's biggest twin-engined plane, the A350-1000, in a deal worth $4.4 billion at list prices.That was a shot in the arm for the 366-seat jet whose sales have slowed as Boeing develops a larger version of its 777 model.Virgin Atlantic said it still had options to buy six of Airbus's A380 superjumbos, although industry sources have told Reuters that long-deferred deal is likely to be canceled. Both Airbus and Boeing said demand for single-aisle jets, rather than twin-aisled planes or four-engined superjumbos, were behind the increases in their 20-year forecasts.In a sign of mounting competition in the single-aisle market, Boeing said it would redesign the smallest version of its 737 MAX plane, increasing seating to 150 by adding 12 seats.Boeing also said China's Donghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines had signed memorandums of understanding for potential multi-billion dollar plane deals.Bloomberg reported Malaysia's AirAsia was close to a $12.6 billion deal for Airbus A321 jets, citing sources.

890,"Jul 10, 2016 08:30PM ET","Airbus set for Virgin, Germania order boosts at Farnborough",nan,"By Tim HepherFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is set to announce a key order for 8-10 of its biggest twin-engined model, the A350-1000, from Virgin Atlantic after beating Boeing to a scarce order for big jets as economic and political uncertainties overshadow the Farnborough Airshow.The order, worth some $3 billion at list prices, could perk up Monday's opening of an event clouded by geopolitical uncertainty, including Britain's decision to leave the European Union and concerns over the state of the global economy.British Prime Minister David Cameron will attend the opening day, where he is expected to finalize multi-billion dollar deals with Boeing (N:BA) to buy nine P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and to upgrade 50 Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters. Industry sources said Airbus's A350-1000 deal with Virgin Atlantic provided a shot in the arm to a 366-seat model promising greater efficiency but whose sales have slowed as Boeing develops a larger version of its 777, prompting a game of leapfrog between the only two makers of long-haul jets.Airbus declined to comment and Virgin Atlantic was not available to comment.Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed years of strong demand, helped by rising airline travel particularly in Asia and the Middle East and new, more fuel-efficient planes.But with the industry's order backlog standing at a record 13,500 planes at the end of 2015, or 9.6 years of production at current rates, analysts are worried that economic risks - from slowing growth in China to Britain's move to leave the EU - could see orders dry up and some even canceled.Larger, more expensive twin-aisle planes are likely to be most at risk. Indeed, industry sources said Virgin Atlantic, which has long deferred an order for six of Airbus's A380 superjumbos, looked set to finally cancel it.The head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Ray Conner, said the company was facing slower demand for wide-body jets and would be vigilant about matching supply to demand, though it was too early to say whether it would again cut output of its 777.SINGLE-AISLE COMPETITIONSeparately, industry sources said privately held German airline Germania was close to placing an order with Airbus for around 25 A320-family jets, worth over $2.5 billion.That deal for Airbus's top-selling single-aisle plane, if confirmed, would also be a disappointment to Boeing, which is trying to wrestle back such customers after losing market share.Germania operates both Airbus and Boeing jets but has said it aims to harmonize its fleet by switching to all-Airbus aircraft when it takes older Boeing 737-700s out of service.Germania officials could not immediately be reached for comment. An Airbus spokesman said: ""We do not comment on confidential talks which may or may not be happening with our customers."" Among other potential deals at Farnborough, Boeing is expected to firm up at least part of a deal for up to 20 747-8 freighters from Russia's Volga Dnepr, boosting its declining jumbo jet program, and could announce a new Asian customer for its high-density 737 MAX 200 jet aimed at low-cost carriers.The U.S. company announced a preliminary deal with Volga Dnepr last year.Also this week, it will effectively relaunch the smallest version of its 737 MAX series by adding more seats to make it more economical for airlines and reverse weak sales.It is also looking at adding a new and larger version of the 737 MAX family and has not ruled out both doing this and developing a larger new ""middle-market"" region-hopping jet.At least one of those moves partially includes a response to the success of the 185-seat A321neo, illustrated by what sources describe as plans for Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) to upgrade 30 of the 100 150-seat A320neos it has ordered to the larger jet.The company, which last month delivered the first of 72 A320neo planes ordered by India's GoAir, is in talks with the same airline for a follow-on order containing a similar number of jets, industry sources said, confirming a Bloomberg report.AirAsia, which is also in fresh talks to buy more jets, is itself bullish on India after regulatory changes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

891,"Jul 10, 2016 08:10PM ET",German ministry sees possible delay in signing missile defense contract,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Germany may not finish negotiations with Europe's MBDA and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) on the MEADS missile defense system by the end of the year as planned, according to a document sent to lawmakers by a senior German defense ministry official.The document, dated July 8 and sent by State Secretary Ralf Brauksiepe, said it was unclear if the project could be submitted to the parliamentary budget committee by the end of this year, or if it would slip into early next year. A copy of the document was seen by Reuters.Company officials told Reuters last month they hoped to submit a final contract proposal for the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) by the end of July and wrap up negotiations on the $4.5 billion project by year's end.Lockheed officials were not immediately available to comment on the ministry document.Experts say it may be difficult to win parliamentary approval if negotiations drag on too long too close to Germany's national elections in September 2017.Tobias Lindner, a member of the Green party, said the delay made him question if the ministry had fully understood the risks involved in the project.Germany announced last year it had chosen the MEADS system over Raytheon Co's Patriot system to replace the current Patriot system fielded in the 1980s, but said the companies had to meet demanding performance milestones to retain the contract.Germany funded a quarter of the $4 billion invested by it, the United States and Italy to develop the new system as a successor for the Patriot system. The U.S. military, citing financial pressures, decided several years ago not to buy the system, while Italy has not yet announced its plans.European missile maker MBDA is jointly owned by Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA.Raytheon, a candidate to build a separate radar system that would be integrated with the MEADS system, says it is staying in close touch with the German government in case the MEADS consortium fails to meet the milestones set by the government.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany is also considering buying C-130J planes to cover additional needs that government sources say would not be addressed by the A400M.Grant said there were early discussions about the U.S. military joining the European transport pool to help Europe meet its transportation and logistics needs.The U.S. Air Force was also exploring the possibility of adding some C-130J aircraft to the Strategic Airlift Capability, a consortium of 12 nations that operates three Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co C-17 transport planes from Papa Air Base in Hungary, she said.""We're looking at all kind of different options,"" Grant said. ""We're just looking for creative solutions to get at this gap in a resource-constrained environment.""No decisions had been made and there were still important questions to resolve, including who would bear the cost of expanding the current efforts, she said.Grant said newly confirmed Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein had carried out 14 bilateral meetings with officials from other countries and six industry partners during his visit to the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military air show, in England this past week.Goldfein's top priority, she said, was to increase the ability of the U.S. military to cooperate and work together with allies and coalition partners, and he had talked with industry about how best to incentivise that kind of approach."

894,"Jul 09, 2016 04:30PM ET",Interim fix for A400M engine issue certified: Airbus,nan,"By Andrea ShalalRAF FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - European authorities have certified an interim fix for a power gearbox issue with engines on Airbus Group SE's (PA:AIR) A400M transport aircraft, paving the way for countries to resume normal operations of the planes, company officials said on Saturday.""It's good news. It means that we're going to be alleviating the pain of the nations sooner,"" Fernando Alonso, president of Airbus Military Aircraft, told Reuters. ""It means they will essentially be able to use the aircraft normally again.""Alonso said the European Aviation Safety Agency would now require initial inspections of the planes after 650 flight hours, up from 100 hours, with follow-up inspections to be required every 150 hours, up from the 20-hour cycle imposed after the gearbox issue first emerged in late December.The EASA certification clears the way for Italy’s Avio, a unit of  General Electric  Co (N:GE), to begin retrofitting engines on existing planes with a modified part to replace the one with cracking. It can also begin producing new power gearbox kits with the part integrated.Airbus said the certification of the interim fix came a month or more sooner than planned. The company is continuing to work with GE and Avio on a long-term solution for the gearbox.Alonso said Airbus was also focused on adding tactical capabilities to the big transport plane, and has delivered the first aircraft capable of tactical tasks to France. The new plane offers armoring protection, refueling, the ability to airdrop loads, landings on some non-prepared runways and equipment to detect and counter enemy radars and missiles.Airbus has delivered 27 A400M aircraft to date, including a fourth plane delivered to Germany on Friday, the company said.Nearly all the aircraft have been affected by the engine issue, although only it affects only the two clockwise turning engines on each of the four-engine aircraft.It was not immediately clear how quickly Avio could build and deliver the retrofit kits for planes already delivered. Work on the kits, and production of power gearboxes with the modified part would start immediately, Airbus officials said.Airbus officials also disputed an article in Germany's Spiegel magazine, which cited a link between cold temperatures in the back of the aircraft and irregular air flows that could affect paratrooper operations.""There is no link,"" said an Airbus spokeswoman. Airbus said it was working on both issues, and would install a more efficient thermal curtain near the back of the plane by the end of the year to keep the back of the cabin warmer. The company is also examining a possible readjustment to the air flow system that would send more warm air to the back of the plane. No timing was given on that issue.It cited progress on qualifying and certifying the aircraft for paratrooping operations with one side door only, or using the ramp. ""Safety is paramount in this development program and we would note that the current regulations are very much stricter than those applied to legacy aircraft,"" the company said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

897,"Jul 07, 2016 04:13PM ET",Boeing slows payments to suppliers as it accelerates cost cutting,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim HepherNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is stepping up efforts to conserve cash, cut costs in its supply chain and trim inventory of parts in its factories, telling vendors it will take longer to pay bills, Boeing and aerospace industry executives said.Under the new terms, Boeing is taking up to 120 days to pay, rather than 30 days as in the past, these people said. The new payment schedules are being rolled out this year. Boeing also is reducing its factory inventory and is relying on suppliers to hold parts instead, these people said. The moves come at a time when investors are closely watching Boeing's cash flow.In a statement to Reuters, Boeing confirmed the changes in payment and inventory terms, saying they were necessary to compete when airlines want more capable planes at lower prices.""To align with industry norms"" and remain competitive, ""we are in the process of adjusting the payment terms of our large suppliers,"" spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said in the statement. ""In most, if not all cases, our new payment terms are in line with their payment schedules to their own suppliers.""Boeing, which is marking 100 years in business this summer, and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) earn lower average profit margins on the airliners they engineer and sell than many of the companies that supply components for the planes.The company's operating profit margin averaged 6.9 percent over the last decade. Airbus's figure was 3.7 percent. United Technologies Aerospace Systems' (N:UTX) comparable margin was about 16 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.""It's in Boeing's DNA to build the best airplanes,"" Kent Fisher, vice president of supplier management, said in an interview. ""But what we and suppliers have to recognize is that we have to shift that dynamic and focus on reducing the cost to build the airplanes."" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has told investors he wants to lift Boeing's profit margin to the mid-teens by 2020. Under a program called Partnering for Success, launched in 2012, Boeing suppliers cut prices 15 percent. Now, executives at Boeing suppliers say Muilenburg is pushing a renewed round of cost cutting.""I was in a meeting with Dennis where he was quite specific about needing to get continued cost reduction from the suppliers,"" said Dave Gitlin, president of United Technologies Aerospace Systems, one of the world's largest aircraft parts makers.Gitlin said UTC did not agree to delayed payment terms because it was focused on its own cash flow. But as Boeing searches for savings, he said, ""it's accurate to say that everything is part of the discussion. I think they're looking under every rock.""Major Boeing supplier Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) said Boeing is seeking a new round of lower prices and changes in payment terms. ""I cannot say the number, but I would like to satisfy as much as possible the required cost reduction level from Boeing,"" Shunichi Miyanaga, chief executive of MHI, said in an interview. On the question of longer payment periods, first reported by aviation publication Leeham News, he added, ""we have not decided.""$2 BILLION IN SAVINGSNot all of Boeing's efforts require price reductions. Some suppliers find cost savings by re-engineering components, a process Boeing calls ""value engineering."" Boeing saved $1 billion a year in 2014 and 2015 through these efforts, up from $60 million in 2012, Kowal said.""They're very aggressive,"" Tom Gentile, chief executive of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (N:SPR), said in an interview about price reductions. ""But Boeing is as hard on themselves as they are on anyone else,"" he added. On a recent tour of Boeing's factories in Washington state, he said, workers were under pressure to install new tools, reduce production time and reduce inventory.Payment terms could be included in a long-term agreement Spirit is negotiating with Boeing, Gentile said. ""There are a lot of levers to pull,"" he said.But many suppliers have already accepted the changes. At a mid-sized machining shop in Washington state that makes parts for Boeing, payment terms shifted this spring.""We went a whole month with no receivables from Boeing,"" said the owner, who asked not to be named because of concern about damaging relations with Boeing.When payments resumed, about 10 percent of the company's annual revenue remained unpaid, he said, adding that Boeing now pays in 60 days, not 30, and pays twice a month, not weekly.""We're having to change the way we manage our cash flow and change the way we pay our suppliers,"" the owner said. ""It is preventing us from buying equipment.""Boeing said small suppliers in the United States are exempt from the new payment terms and that it is trying to accommodate suppliers overseas.""Boeing did not implement any policy change or action that would have delayed or missed a contractual payment to large or small suppliers in April,"" Kowal said.Other suppliers also reported changes in Boeing's terms, along with further price reductions, said Christian Schiller, a managing director at investment bank Cascadia Capital in Seattle who works with mid-sized suppliers. The effort has been dubbed ""Partnering for Success 2.0.""""Notwithstanding all the concessions people made on PFS,"" Schiller said, ""there's a whole new wave now of all sorts of other concessions.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

902,"Jun 30, 2016 01:37PM ET","Airbus, Safran finalize space launchers merger",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) pledged on Thursday to make Europe competitive in the face of U.S. low-cost rival SpaceX as they completed a deal to merge their space launcher activities.The two aerospace groups said they were closing a deal that paves the way for the next generation of European rocket, the Ariane 6, which will make its first flight in 2020 and be used to put commercial and military satellites into orbit.The long-awaited deal calls for the integration of industrial assets, turning their existing Airbus Safran Launchers venture into an operational concern with 8,400 employees in France and Germany. The heads of both companies pledged to focus on making the venture competitive after Europe's position in the commercial launch market was threatened by Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which intends to offer cut-rate launch services by re-using its rockets.Under the final deal, French engine maker Safran will pay Airbus Group 750 million euros ($832 million) to ensure an equal 50/50 ownership split in the new venture -- slightly less than a previously expected figure of 800 million.. ""They needed to complete this deal so that they are ready to design an entire launcher for civil customers rather than government requirements, forcing the agencies to accept what they have done for their customers rather than work with what governments want,"" an analyst said, asking not to be named.The deal had earlier been held up for months as the two companies and the French government debated how the payment to Airbus should be treated for tax purposes.French tax regulations are not easily applicable to a partnership of equals in which both companies view the stake as strategic, and are locked in for the long term, so a compromise was reached sparing Airbus a hefty tax bill.Separately, the Safran board will meet on Thursday to make a preliminary selection from a dozen offers for its Morpho biometrics and security business, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

903,"Jun 30, 2016 02:11AM ET",Japan plans July fighter jet tender seen worth $40 billion as China tensions simmer,nan,"By Siva GovindasamySINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan will launch a tender for fighter jets as soon as mid-July, the Ministry of Defence said, in a deal seen worth up to $40 billion as Tokyo seeks to bolster its air defenses amid creeping tension with China over disputed maritime borders.In one of the biggest fighter jet contracts up for grabs in years, a ministry spokesman said Japan will contact foreign and domestic defense contractors soon after a July 5 deadline for expressions of interest in the tender for about 100 warplanes.People familiar with the matter said U.S. firms  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) have been invited to take part in the project, dubbed the F-3 fighter jet program, alongside Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) (T:7011), the prime domestic contractor.A final decision is likely in summer 2018, the people said, with deployment due at the end of the 2020s at the earliest. They declined to be identified because the matter was confidential.With a value seen by these people at up to $40 billion, the F-3 program will dwarf most recent fighter jet deals in value, likely attracting global contractor interest. But analysts say Japan's preference for an aircraft that can operate closely with the U.S. military, given close Washington-Tokyo ties, makes a non-U.S. option a long-shot.The project launch comes as Japan seeks a plane to maintain air superiority over China, now asserting itself in regional maritime disputes. China's warplanes still lag aircraft used by the U.S. and its allies, but Beijing has been building its capability, military experts say, fuelling Japan's more muscular security agenda under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Touted as a replacement for existing Mitsubishi F-2 multi-role fighter jets, the new home-grown aircraft will operate alongside Lockheed F-35 fighters that Japan has on order, as well as Boeing F-15Js jets that it is upgrading. A spokeswoman for MHI said the company doesn't comment on individual projects.IMPORTS VS. HOME PRODUCTIONJapan is open to importing existing fighter jets directly from Western suppliers, producing them under license at home, like the F-15Js, according to the people familiar with the matter.""We are certainly interested in another potential opportunity to bolster our longstanding partnership with Japan,"" Lockheed Martin told Reuters via email. ""We look forward to learning more about Japan's F-3 plans as discussions progress.""In an emailed response to a request for comment, Boeing said: ""We are constantly looking for ways to ... increase our presence in Japan, and are open to discussions with the customer to see how we can help meet their security needs.""Japan has a long-standing interest in acquiring a twin-engined stealth aircraft with long-range capability and internally-stowed missiles, according to the people with knowledge of the F-3 program.The only aircraft now in service that meets those requirements is Lockheed's F-22 - but that jet is no longer in production and the U.S. has not made it available for export despite Tokyo's interest. That makes Japan more likely to design and make the F-3 fighter at home, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, ramping up the project's cost. High development costs could be a barrier for Japan as it weighs its national budget, though its move to lift a decades-long ban on arms sales last year could potentially pave the way for future export sales to ease the cost burden. Beyond Boeing and Lockheed, other potential partners include the Eurofighter consortium - a European joint venture between Airbus Group (PA:AIR), BAE Systems PLC (L:BAES) and Leonardo  Finmeccanica  SpA (MI:LDOF) that produces the Typhoon fighter jet - and Sweden's  Saab AB  (ST:SAABb), which recently unveiled the latest variant of its Gripen warplane.On behalf of the Eurofighter consortium, an Airbus Defence and Space spokesman said, ‎""We are in regular contact with Japan and Japanese industry to discuss our capabilities and potential collaboration opportunities.""A Saab spokesman said the company was unable to comment on the tender.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

905,"Jun 27, 2016 03:30PM ET",Doubts grow over Airbus A380 sale to Iran: sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - As Western planemakers seek to finalize lucrative deals to sell some 200 jets to Iran, doubts are growing over the sale of a dozen Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 superjumbo jets to the country's national flag carrier, several people familiar with deal said.Iran's return to the international market for new aircraft after decades making do with an antiquated fleet is one of the biggest business opportunities opened by the lifting of sanctions after a deal to rein in its nuclear programme.The order for the double-decker superjumbo jetliners grabbed attention in January as part of a provisional deal for 118 Airbus jets worth $27 billion signed in Paris in the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.The inclusion of the world's largest jetliner was hailed as a symbol of thawing relations and a sign of Iran's determination to compete economically with political rivals on the Arab side of the Gulf that fly the jet.The order also threw a lifeline to the A380 itself, following a slump in orders that has left the future of one of Europe's highest profile industrial projects in doubt.But people familiar with the deal say there are increasing signs that Tehran is having second thoughts about whether to take delivery.""We always made clear this is an option,"" an Iranian official told Reuters, asking not to be identified.""It is possible to switch to other models,"" he added.An industry source familiar with the region said Iran was committed to the rest of the order, but was less interested in taking the A380s, ordered in part for political reasons.Another Iranian official said main obstacles to completing the full order were remaining U.S. financial sanctions.Others said the A380 part of the order, worth $5.2 billion at list prices, can be canceled or amended without penalty under the contract before Airbus starts building the jets.One industry source acknowledged ""the A380 part is less solid"" than the remaining 106 aircraft, despite the fact that Airbus had pressed Tehran to include the slow-selling model.FINANCING QUESTIONSBefore any of the deal can be completed, Airbus must obtain U.S. export licences due to U.S. technology on board its jets.Problems in financing must also be resolved as some banks have shied away from financing either the Airbus deal or a similar order for Boeing (N:BA) to sell or lease 109 jets to IranAir.Those uncertainties have also raised questions over the timing of the payment of deposits to Airbus on the wider order.""Following the preliminary agreement for 118 aircraft signed in January with IranAir, negotiations are progressing, and as with all agreements, it takes time for them to be firmed up and finalised,"" an Airbus spokesman said.IranAir was not immediately available for comment.Discussing the Airbus order in February, its chairman told Reuters the A380 would not arrive for another five years and that the airline would in the meantime monitor the expansion of Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport. While Airbus faces uncertainty over the A380 part of the deal, Boeing appears to have won a slight reprieve for the latest version of its 747 jumbo, which has also been suffering from poor sales.A person familiar with Boeing's own provisional deal with IranAir said it included four 747-8s. Both the A380 and 747-8 have seen production cuts as airlines switch to smaller two-engined models like the Airbus A350 or Boeing 777. But regional sources say Boeing's 747 has a more naturally receptive audience in Iran given the experience of its pilots and engineers in keeping old 747s flying during sanctions.Eager to prepare for projected transport growth post-sanctions, Iran has ordered a total of seven different types of Airbus and Boeing jet. But some analysts are cautious about how quickly new types, especially ones like the superjumbo, can be introduced without improvements in infrastructure and marketing.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

906,"Jun 21, 2016 12:49PM ET",Boeing confirms signing jetliner sale memo with Iran Air,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) signed an agreement to sell jetliners to Iran Air, the company said on Tuesday, confirming Iranian statements and briefly sending its shares up sharply in early trading.The historic deal to sell 100 jetliners to the airline, Boeing's first sale to Iran since its Islamic Revolution in 1979, resulted from the nuclear accord reached with that country last year.The agreement brings more work to Boeing's factories in Washington state and South Carolina, and helps the aerospace and defense company catch up with a $27 billion, 118-plane order Iran placed with Airbus (PA:AIR) in January.Boeing said in a statement that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with state carrier Iran Air ""expressing the airline's intent to purchase Boeing commercial passenger airplanes.""The Chicago-based company declined to discuss the number or type of planes it would sell, or the timetable for delivery of the aircraft. But the head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, Ali Abedzadeh, told the state-run daily newspaper Iran on Friday that the signed deal was for 100 Boeing aircraft.Such an order would be worth about $11 billion at list prices if Iran Air bought only Boeing 737 single-aisle jetliners, and perhaps twice that much if it included a significant number of twin-aisle planes such as the 777 or 787 Dreamliner.A large order was expected, but the sale raised concerns among some Congress members, who feared it could threaten U.S. national security.Boeing's statement said the talks that led to the memorandum of understanding were conducted ""under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord reached last summer."" Boeing said it would ""continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines.""It added that ""any and all contracts with Iran's airlines will be contingent upon U.S. government approval.""U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, a Washington state Democrat who has Boeing's biggest factory in his district, pledged to keep an eye on the deal's ramifications.""In the coming days the U.S. government will be taking a hard look at the specifics of the deal to ensure it is consistent with both U.S. interests and those of our international allies, and I’ll be tracking those developments closely,"" he said in a statement.Abedzadeh's statement in the newspaper on Friday confirmed a Reuters report on June 6 that Iran was close to a deal to buy more than 100 jetliners from the Chicago-based aircraft maker.Boeing shares were down 0.78 percent at $131.72 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the stock climbed to $133.18 from a low of $132.25.Separately, Bloomberg reported that Russian cargo carrier Volga-Dneper had placed more than 10 firm orders for Boeing 747 freighters. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

909,"Jun 21, 2016 07:20AM ET",Singapore delays $1 billion military helicopter buy after Super Puma crash: sources,nan,"By Siva GovindasamySINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has delayed a decision on a $1 billion helicopter purchase after the crash in April of a civilian Airbus (PA:AIR) Super Puma whose military version was the frontrunner to clinch the order, sources familiar with the matter said.The city-state, a highly sought-after customer for military contractors, had sought to replace 32 ageing Super Pumas but the move has now been put on ice until there is clarity over the fallout from the April 29 crash which killed 13 oil workers and crew off the coast of Norway, they added. The delay comes as the helicopters subsidiary of Airbus Group, called Airbus Helicopters, wrestles with the latest in a series of setbacks to the H225 Super Puma, a workhorse of the offshore oil industry and widely used across the world for search and rescue and heavy military airlift operations.    Singapore’s procurement, pitting Airbus Helicopters against Italian firm Leonardo  Finmeccanica  (MI:LDOF), marks the first major test of confidence in the military version of the aircraft since April’s crash, which led to the worldwide grounding of the civilian version.A fresh tender is not on the cards, said the sources, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. They could not say when a decision will be made.    Singapore has not so far announced any grounding of its military Super Pumas. Several other countries, including France and Brazil, continue to fly their Super Pumas.    Singapore's defense ministry did not provide an immediate response to a request for comment on the tender and its Super Puma operations.    ""We cannot comment on discussions we may or may not be having with Singapore,"" an Airbus Helicopters spokesman said in an email    Safety is the company's ""chief priority"" and it is working with investigators to identify the ""root cause"" of the Norwegian crash, he added. It is also ""providing support to customers who are flying mission-critical operations"" with the Super Puma family of helicopters, he added.    Singapore has Southeast Asia's largest defense budget - even in the context of increased spending across the region as China becomes more assertive in the South China Sea. Modern military technology is key for Singapore, which needs to compensate for a small size and population.    The island has long sought to replace its Super Pumas, which have an average age of 27 years, and a decision was expected in the first half of 2016 after an 18-month-long evaluation.    While the Leonardo-Finmeccanica AW101 was also shortlisted, sources said that the Airbus H225M was the frontrunner.    The Norwegian crash happened after the main rotor blades separated from the aircraft. Norwegian investigators said on June 2 that they had found metallurgical evidence that was ""strongly consistent with fatigue"" in a part of the gearbox.    The next day, the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) grounded all civil Super Pumas. This decision, however, does not apply to military fleets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Improvement plans have been launched, but too late"".Zodiac said on Tuesday the operational performance of its Cabin branch continued to be affected by problems with lavatories for the Airbus A350, but that delays in seat production were coming under control.Bregier expressed greater optimism about production of the smaller A320neo, saying glitches with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines were being fixed and Airbus aimed to catch up with delivery plans in the second half of the year.""It is achievable, even if it is a stretch,"" he said.Bregier said Airbus did not yet have sufficient promises of orders to commit to a possible larger version of the A350 to compete with Boeing's 406-seat 777-9, and that discussions of an engine revamp of the slow-selling A380 were on hold for now.

917,"Jun 13, 2016 09:01PM ET",China tells Germany: 'We don't want to fight a trade war',nan,"By Ben Blanchard and Andreas RinkeBEIJING (Reuters) - China's leader told Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday he did not want trade tensions with the European Union, a vital market for a huge economy facing falling exports, to descend into a trade war.Merkel has already said she favours, in principle, granting China market economy status at the World Trade Organization, and Beijing hopes she can encourage more sceptical EU voices to accept the move.""China has already fulfilled its obligations on joining the WTO. What's needed now is for the other parties to fulfil the matching obligations they had promised,"" Premier Li Keqiang told reporters in Beijing on Monday alongside the German leader.""We don't want to fight a trade war because this will benefit nobody,"" he said, echoing a similar comment Merkel made on Sunday.The European Commission is set to accept the WTO switch that will mean China is no longer treated as a state-controlled market, making it easier for Chinese exporters.But the EU executive also wants to strengthen Europe's ability to defend itself against heavily subsidised Chinese goods. That reluctance to give up a method to defend against cheap imports has set up a looming dispute at the WTO and the prospect of broader trade friction.Merkel, on her ninth trip to China as chancellor, said: ""It does not help us to emotionalise the whole subject. I am convinced that we can find a solution on the lines of what was promised 15 years ago.""She also pressed China on liberalising its banking industry in return for giving more access to the sector in Europe.RECIPROCITY ""We will certainly pay even more heed to reciprocity in the financial sector than in classic industry,"" Merkel said, adding that German banks were restricted by a 20-percent limit on the size of stakes they can buy in Chinese banks.""Germany has always presented itself as an open investment market,"" Merkel said. ""We expect reciprocity also from the Chinese side."" ""In the banking sector, we are at the start of a cooperation,"" she said.Li said there were informal barriers in Europe for Chinese banks, which were disadvantaged compared to European and U.S. competitors.""We need to talk more about how both sides will be treated equally,"" he said.Merkel said during a trip to China last year that Germany favoured granting China market economy status in principle but that Beijing still had work to do, including further opening its public procurement markets.Heads of the European Commission are expected to debate the issue in late June or July, at a time of heightened trade tension after global rivals accused China of dumping cheap steel exports after a slowdown in demand at home.Li said trade protection measures would not help resolve the problem and that low-end steel was not something China wanted to produce or sell and was committed to phasing out.Foreign critics accuse China of not following through on its reform agenda and of introducing new regulations that further restrict market access.""The facts prove that China's market is open. We will be even more open,"" Li said. ""We will take even more steps based on the principles of treating everyone equally, fairness and transparency.""Delegates at a Sino-German cooperation conference on the sidelines of Merkel's visit agreed 96 deals valued at $15 billion, according to China's official news agency, Xinhua.Airbus Helicopters (PA:AIR) finalised an agreement to build an assembly line on a Sino-German business park in China and to sell 100 helicopters to a Chinese consortium.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and its Chinese partner, BAIC Motor (HK:1958), pledged to jointly invest 4 billion yuan ($608 million) to expand engine production.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The distance is nearly four miles (6 km), as the chopper flies.A ride from the Blue Tree Faria Lima onward to Guarulhos International Airport costs 271 reais during the promotion. A car can take one to three hours to make that trip, depending on traffic. Uber media representatives declined to say how much prices would rise after Thursday or how many helicopters would be made available by the three companies operating the flights. Uber aims to get as much as five times the flight time out of each helicopter compared to standard use, according to a spokeswoman.The Sao Paulo pilot program, connecting four airports and five other helipads, is Uber's biggest step yet in a partnership with Airbus Group (PA:AIR), announced in January.Uber experimented in recent years with helicopter rides to the Coachella and Bonnaroo music festivals from nearby U.S. airports that cost as much as $3,000 to book a full helicopter and door-to-door SUV rides.Spanish rival Cabify, which launched its Sao Paulo car service on Monday, is also in talks with three flight providers and plans to offer helicopter rides in the city by the end of the year, as it already does in Mexico City.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

920,"Jun 10, 2016 12:10PM ET",Merkel to press China on business conditions amid takeover wave,nan,"By Noah Barkin and Andreas RinkeBERLIN (Reuters) - After a golden decade for economic ties between Germany and China, concerns are growing in Berlin over barriers to foreign firms in China, Beijing's more muscular foreign policy and its increased authoritarianism at home.German Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Beijing on Saturday for the ninth time since taking office amid growing pressure from industry and rights groups to confront the Chinese more forcefully.The trip comes as she faces criticism at home for failing to speak out more strongly about rights violations in Turkey. It also comes in the midst of a furious debate over Chinese takeovers in Europe, with some politicians calling for tougher restrictions following a recent offer by home appliance maker Midea <000333.SZ> for German robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G).""We have a proliferation and intensification of hidden and open conflicts in the German-Chinese relationship,"" said Sebastian Heilmann, head of the MERICS think tank in Berlin.""We won't be able to avoid tough conflicts with China in the next months and years. This will be a difficult trip.""Merkel will be traveling to China with six of her ministers and a large industry delegation that is expected to include the CEOs of blue-chips like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Airbus (PA:AIR).She will dine with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday and President Xi Jinping on Monday. In between, she and Li will attend a meeting with business leaders at which German firms are expected to openly voice their frustrations with conditions in the Chinese market. On Tuesday, Merkel is due to travel to the northern ""rust belt"" city of Shenyang to visit a BMW plant.More than any other European country, Germany has benefited from the rapid expansion of the Chinese economy over the past decade.Between 2005 and 2014, German exports to China more than tripled to 74 billion euros. And German companies, notably the big carmakers, benefited from a surge in Chinese demand that offset weakness in their home European market.In 2015, however, exports to China declined year-on-year for the first time in nearly two decades. And attention has shifted away from trade to the difficult conditions for German firms operating in a Chinese economy where growth has slowed.""FRESH WAVE OF PESSIMISM""At a briefing in Berlin on Friday, Merkel's top advisers expressed concerns about a wide range of developments in China, from a new security law that would place restrictions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to Beijing's actions in the South China Sea.Topping the list, however, was the situation for German firms. At a time when Chinese companies are on an acquisition spree across Europe, foreign firms are limited to 50 percent stakes in joint ventures with their Chinese counterparts.Chinese leaders heard the same message from U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew this week. He said in Beijing that foreign businesses were beginning to question whether they were welcome in China.""We want a level playing field, the same conditions for both sides,"" one senior Merkel adviser, who requested anonymity, told reporters, adding that Beijing's drive to be recognized this year by the European Commission as an economy controlled by the market, rather than the state, faced obstacles.Markus Kerber, managing director of the BDI Federation of German Industries, told Reuters: ""We have a difficult situation in China. We're in a transition phase.""The mood was summed up in the European Chamber of Commerce's annual business confidence survey released this week.It spoke of a ""fresh wave of pessimism"" about an ""increasingly hostile"" business environment that was tilted in favor of domestic firms.China has repeatedly pledged to increase market access for foreign firms and carry out market reforms in its effort to revamp its slowing economy. But foreign critics accuse it of not following through on its reform agenda and introducing new regulations that are restricting market access even further.For example, Beijing's Made in China 2025 plan calls for a progressive increase in domestic components used in priority sectors such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025 from a target of 40 percent by 2020.The European Chamber's survey showed that less than a quarter of its members were convinced by China's pledged reform drive and that fewer than half currently planned to expand operations in the world's second-largest economy.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

921,"Jun 10, 2016 10:01AM ET",Airbus under new pressure over A400M as deliveries slip,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) faces renewed pressure from France and other European buyers to meet performance and delivery pledges for its A400M military transport plane but is struggling to meet the deadlines, people familiar with the matter said.After partly successful efforts to overcome delays on Europe's largest defense project, the A400M has been plunged into uncertainty again, especially due to issues at an Italian subcontractor that have sparked potential compensation claims.France has written to Airbus pressing it to say whether problems with Italian-built gearboxes and other threats to the A400M's military effectiveness will be resolved this year, but Airbus has declined to give that assurance, the people said.With urgent needs in sub-Saharan Africa and Iraq, France has raised concerns about three main problems hampering the troop and heavy equipment carrier: gearbox flaws that require the planes to be checked every 20 flight hours, incomplete defensive systems and limits on certain types of parachute operation.Asked if Airbus had been able to give clarity on resolving them, one person familiar with the matter said, ""No, not right now, and especially not in the required timetable, which is by the end of this year"".The French government declined to comment.Airbus said it did not comment on discussions with buyers.The A400M has been ordered by seven members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - to give Europe an independent airlift capability.German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said last week that the country would exercise its right to compensation for delays in deliveries of the A400M and may have to buy other transport planes as well. In 2010, the A400M received a 3.5 billion euro bailout and Airbus later overhauled its management, but problems continue to beset the project launched in 2003 and Airbus is expected to add to the more than 5 billion euros it has already written off.Last year, a fatal crash that is still being investigated exposed a vulnerability in cockpit alarm systems.Then early this year a crack was found inside a power gearbox (PGB) made by General Electric's (N:GE) Italian unit Avio Aero, leading to tough new inspections.""It is currently the main problem and it generates uncertainty about the number of aircraft that can be delivered this year, because it is still unknown how many PGBs Avio can provide,"" a person close to the project said.Avio's Turin factory ""must be modernized,"" the person said, adding that things had improved since GE bought it in 2013.POLITICAL TWISTSAn Avio spokesman said, ""we are committed to improving our production"" and declined comment on the A400M.Airbus, however, believes it is making progress and hopes to have a certified long-term solution in place for the gearboxes in September, industry sources said.In April, it said it still hoped to meet a delivery target of 20 A400Ms in 2016, but that goal is increasingly in doubt. It has delivered five so far this year, including one to France.""We know it is very frustrating for our customers and are working extremely hard with our engine suppliers and specifically Avio to work out a solution and implement it as quickly as we can,"" an Airbus spokeswoman said.Avio's involvement reflects the political twists and turns of a program first mooted in the 1980s.Avio was originally part of a French-led consortium that bid against Rolls-Royce (L:RR) to provide engines for the A400M. The European engine partners eventually came together to make one combined bid, which won backing in 2000 from politicians over a transatlantic Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) model favored by Airbus.A year later, Italy pulled out of the A400M project but Avio remained as gearbox supplier to the European engine team. Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders has faulted European governments for tying the A400M to an untested engine consortium, but government officials say past mismanagement is also to blame.Air chiefs have nonetheless praised the capability of the plane, which Enders last week said would be ""worth waiting for"".Airbus is meanwhile weeding out other problems, including replacing an alloy used below the wing due to a hairline crack, and testing aerodynamic improvements and equipment changes to allow side-door parachute drops from both sides of the plane.But mid-air refueling of helicopters, required by France for its special forces, remains some way off, prompting Paris to place a recent order for four  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130s.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

922,"Jun 10, 2016 09:49AM ET",Air France-KLM taps jet data to defend maintenance share,nan,"By Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is tapping data from sensors on modern jets to bolster its position as the second-largest independent supplier of jet maintenance but faces a tug of war with planemakers over the profits to be made from Big Data.Maintenance is one of the most profitable activities of the Franco-Dutch airline group, whose French passenger operations have been engulfed by strikes and restructuring, but planemakers are also seeking a slice of the $65 billion overhaul market.The weapons in this latest aircraft industry battle are bits and bytes, rather than the nuts and bolts of a repair hangar.Sensors on newer jets provide vast amounts of information on the performance of parts, and Air France-KLM's maintenance boss believes airlines have the edge over planemakers, because they can put the stream of data to better use.""The (manufacturers) are designing the data and they are very well placed to understand and analyze the data. We are an operator, we know exactly what to do with the data,"" Franck Terner, head of Air France-KLM's maintenance and engineering division, told Reuters in an interview.Aerospace is one of many industries grappling with the challenges and possibilities of ""digitalization,"" using rich data to improve production or develop new services.Armed with growing databanks, planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) are gradually following the lead of engine makers, who make much of their money from maintenance.But consolidation in the sector has given their airline customers more bargaining power.In 2011, Air France-KLM ordered 25 Airbus A350s but it took two years to finalize the deal due to a tussle with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) over maintenance contracts for the high-tech jets.Meanwhile, independent competition in the jet maintenance industry is growing.""There is very intense and harsh competition,"" Terner said. ""The emerging competition is very aggressive, sometimes by buying market share. All this combined puts pressure on the price.""CRUNCHING DATAAir France-KLM's maintenance division, second in the market behind Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), accounts for only 15 percent of group sales but 26 percent of its operating profit. However, the profit margin was flat at 5.2 percent last year. Air France-KLM has invested 400 million euros ($452 million) over the last decade to modernize its maintenance services and aims to outpace predicted industry growth of 4-5 percent.At the same time, the aircraft maintenance industry is adjusting to a shift in contracts to more frequent, shorter services to continuously monitor the condition of jets and minimize the time spent on the ground for lengthy overhauls.Terner, who ran Concorde maintenance for three years in the 1990s, said Air France-KLM could provide customers with the right data sets to help them improve reliability.It is also working on ways to help customers manage the availability of fleets, such as designing predictive fuel-system maintenance for the A380, the world's largest jetliner, which sends alerts when parts are running at lower performance so they can be changed before they fail entirely.But Airbus says it too is working on predictive maintenance by crunching data from its jets to anticipate failures.Customer services head Didier Lux said last week that by using data collected during flights, a computer could generate an alert to prompt engineers to carry out a preventive fix and avoid the cost of an unscheduled maintenance visit.Pascal Pincemin, aerospace and defense partner at Deloitte, said airlines with maintenance units such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa face tough competition from rivals ready to invest to increase market share, but the fact they operate fleets gives them credibility when it comes to selling maintenance services.""The advantage for an airline over a specialist like Airbus is that the airline has experience of planes made by both Boeing and Airbus,"" he said.(Writing and additional reporting by Victoria Bryan and Tim Hepher; editing by David Clarke)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

923,"Jun 08, 2016 02:30AM ET",Call the air ambulance: Medical helicopters tipped for future China boom,nan,"By Siva Govindasamy and Fang YanSINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - As China opens up its low-level airspace to civilian aircraft, the global aviation industry is laying the groundwork for a boom beyond private business jets and pilot training schools - with the purchase of fleets of air ambulance helicopters.The freeing up of airways previously reserved for military use is a huge opportunity for Norbert Ducrot, head of Airbus Group (PA:AIR)'s helicopters unit in China. Ducrot says there could be enough demand for more than 3,000 emergency medical choppers in China - up from as few as about 20 now in service.While the United States already has more than 1,500 air ambulance helicopters, China's fleet is minimal because of the civilian airspace curbs. In a country where the World Health Organisation has estimated more than 250,000 annual road traffic deaths, air evacuations from both clogged Chinese city streets and remote rural areas could speed medical care and save lives.The change proposed by China's State Council is set to ultimately raise the ceiling on airspace for general aviation to 3,000 meters from 1,000 meters. That would radically multiply both the heights and the routes air ambulances could use, a boon for pioneers like Qian Siwei's China Air Medical Service Ltd.""Emergency air medical services have a great growth potential in China because our target customer is the general public, not just the privileged,"" Qian, a gynecologist by training, told Reuters. While the going rate for a helicopter evacuation is around 30,000 yuan ($4,565) per hour, companies like Qian's offer discount schemes that can cut costs by as much as 50 percent in some cases.Based in the province of western Shaanxi, China Air Medical has a fleet of four helicopters and two business jets, operating with the backing of local authorities. Qian claimed his service has proved so popular that three other provinces have invited Chen Air Medical Service to set up similar operations.China Air Medical is just one of a raft of operators across a broader aviation sector that Beijing is seeking to develop into a thriving home-grown industry. State-owned aircraft maker AVIC, which also supplies helicopters, is another.But the liberalization is also enticing Western firms like Airbus and U.S. aircraft maker  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT), keen to target what they see as a major growth opportunity.HELIPADS 'COMPLICATED'For Airbus executive Ducrot, the arithmetic is simple. He expects to sell 60 helicopters to China this year - for prices he declined to disclose - and for the country to buy up to 300 helicopters annually by 2025 as its economic growth still outpaces developed markets and liberalization kicks in.""By 2025, China will become the most important helicopter market in the world,"" said Ducrot.While some local authorities are enthusiastic, as in Qian's case, and some modern hospitals may be able to accommodate helipads, China's healthcare sector is already creaking and ageing hospital infrastructure may act as a brake on air ambulance growth.At the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital in the city of Chengdu, southwestern China, engineer Liu Xiaoxi, said that when the facility was under construction in the 1980s, a helipad was considered, but rejected as being ""too complicated"".""It's difficult to add things on to the building, especially as tall towers have sprung up on all four sides,"" said Liu. While some hospitals would be able to add them, he said, ""If you want to add a helipad on top of a building then you have to design that in early on in terms of the various beams and supports.""Still Beijing is ploughing ahead with reforms, despite uncertainty on issues like healthcare infrastructure, helipad construction and how Beijing will regulate a low-level civil aviation business.GROWTH WARNINGChina could have 2,000 general aviation airports by 2030 if the country opens the sector up to private investment, says Francis Chao, publisher of monthly publication China Civil Aviation Report and a contractor with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on U.S.-China aviation exchanges.That compares with a projection by China's State Council of 500 airports by 2020.But Chao warned growth could be restricted ""without further relaxation on flight permits, availability of chartering and fuel supply, more and accessible airfield and flight services"".Apart from emergency medical services, companies like Airbus and Textron unit Bell Helicopters - which declined to comment for this story - are targeting sales in the rapidly growing domestic tourism market, fire-fighting and police services, and by companies that need to patrol pipelines and power lines.For example, Airbus agreed to set up a final assembly line for its H135 helicopters in Hefei, Anhui province in October 2015. It's also investing in support services like sales offices, maintenance hubs and a training center for pilots - the latter being in short supply across the country.

924,"Jun 07, 2016 08:21PM ET","Pratt counters critics of new engine, gets suppliers ready",nan,"By Alwyn ScottMIDDLETOWN, Conn. (Reuters) - The head of aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney countered criticism on Tuesday from Qatar Airways and Lufthansa about Pratt’s new Geared Turbofan engine, saying early teething issues that have delayed delivery of some Airbus (PA:AIR) planes have been fixed.""I'm not going to debate the CEO of Lufthansa or the CEO of Qatar. I'm just going to state the facts to you as I know them,” Bob Leduc, president of Pratt & Whitney, said at a media event in Connecticut.The chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, said last week he had canceled one Pratt-powered A320neo, part of a large Airbus order, over concern that the engine required extra time to start under certain conditions.Some A320s are at Airbus' factory in Toulouse, France, awaiting engines, and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is not flying the plane into some airports because of the slow start issue.Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), is one of the world's biggest aircraft engine makers, along with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L:RR).Leduc ticked off Pratt's numbers: three airlines flying seven A320s with the engine, known as the PW1100G, which is demonstrating a 16 percent cut in fuel burn and 75 percent noise reduction compared with prior engines. In more than 2,000 takeoffs and landings so far, it has shown no major in-flight or takeoff issues, Leduc said, and it has dispatch reliability of 99.75 percent, meaning it was able to leave the gate on time.""This has been a phenomenal entry into service"" second only to the Boeing (N:BA) 777 in 1995, he said.The GTF’s performance is critical as Pratt speeds up production from about 200 engines this year to 1,200 annually by the end of the decade, working through a backlog of 7,100 firm orders and commitments, enough to keep its factories running for eight years and generate $750 billion in revenue over 25 years.The GTF engine is being used on new commercial jetliners from Airbus, Brazil’s Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), Canada’s Bombardier Inc, Japan’s Mitsubishi and Russia’s Irkut.To ensure the ramp-up goes smoothly, Pratt is buttoning down its network of 1,600 suppliers, which provide about 80 percent of the engine’s content. Pratt is holding them to such a high standard that many do not quite measure up.“About 44 percent of that (1,600) is what we would consider to be underperforming,” said Gregory Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies Corp. “That is, they don’t deliver at 95 percent on time and they don’t deliver with (quality of) 500 parts per million or better.""If a supplier is not meeting standard, Pratt will send engineers to help fix the problem, part of a multibillion-dollar investment in the new engine.The company is about halfway through investing $1.3 billion in new facilities. At a sparkling white plant here, workers were assembling five engines on Tuesday.Each 7,000-pound (3,175 kg) machine hung in a cradle from an overhead track, allowing workers to maneuver them for easier assembly, a trick learned from auto plants.Two engines stood near the door, wrapped in white plastic, ready to ship to Airbus. A similar line exists in West Palm Beach, Florida, part of Pratt's strategy of having no single point of failure on its lines.The company also has doubled up on suppliers, trying to find second or third sources for parts to ensure it will always have what it needs on time, Leduc said.Leduc said Pratt is looking more deeply into its supply chain. It is shifting to monitoring suppliers 100 weeks ahead of when parts are due to arrive, up from 20 weeks in January.If suppliers are not ready ""and you're six weeks out, you're dead in the water,"" he said."

It marked a stark contrast from Yellen's stance less than two weeks ago when the chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sent strong indications that it could raise rates in the coming months if inflationary and labor market gains continued to meet the FOMC's expectations. Last Friday, though, the U.S. Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 in May, representing its slowest pace of gains in nearly six years. While Yellen expressed concern at the rapid deceleration in labor market growth, she cautioned economists not to ""attach too much significance,"" to a single report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 112.93 or 0.63% to 17,919.99, while the NASDAQ Composite index added 26.19 or 0.53% to 4,968.71, closing near session-highs. The S&P 500 Composite index, meanwhile, gained 10.28 or 0.49% to 2,109.41, as eight of 10 sectors closed in the green. At session-highs, the S&P 500 reached their strongest intraday levels of the year.Stocks in the Basic Materials, Financials and Industrials sectors led, each gaining more than 0.7% on the session. A gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed is generally viewed as bullish for equities on Wall Street, as market players avoid higher yield plays at comparative lower rates.The top performer on the Dow was Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which added 4.52 or 3.55% to 131.90. Earlier, reports surfaced from Reuters that the Everett, Washington-based aircraft giant is nearing a deal to fill an order with Iran, which would provide Iranair with approximately 100 new jets. The order is expected to be in the range of a $27 billion transaction Iranair completed with Airbus Group (PA:AIR) for 118 aircraft in January. The worst performer was  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), which fell 2.55 or 1.94% to 129.19.The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP), which jumped 3.26 or 4.78% to 71.42. Shares in the Needham, Massachusetts-based travel website are still down more than 12% over the last year due in part to heightened global terrorism concerns. The worst performer was  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), which ticked down 1.76 or 1.91% to 90.31 after several top analysts suggested that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be wise to delay the launch of the iPhone 7 beyond this fall.The top performer on the S&P 500 was  Transocean Ltd  (NYSE:RIG), which surged 1.40 or 14.37% to 11.14 after Barron's reported that the offshore drilling company may have been awarded a two-year contract with ONGC for a semi-submersible Jack Bates. The deal reportedly could go for as low as $127,000 per day, providing further signals of the driller's ability to withstand a prolonged down period in oil markets. The worst performer was  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), which fell 2.36 or 3.73% to 60.85 after analysts at BMO downgraded the meat and poultry producer on Monday, amid higher soybean costs and valuations.On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 2,127-922 margin."

927,"Jun 06, 2016 10:39AM ET","After Airbus, Iran edges toward historic Boeing deal",nan,"By Tim HepherDUBLIN (Reuters) - Iranair is discussing a historic aircraft purchase with Boeing, potentially matching an order for over 100 jets from Airbus, but obstacles to both deals need to be resolved so that last year's accord to lift sanctions can be honored, its chairman said.The Iranian flag carrier is also talking to Boeing about providing support for its aging fleet following the deal between Tehran and six major powers to ease economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.""Meetings and negotiations are going on. We hope that in the future we can reach an understanding with each other,"" Iranair Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told Reuters in an interview.""The number and type of aircraft have to be discussed in the future, but the first step is to have a mutual understanding.""Iranair agreed in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Airbus. The deal was conditional on U.S. export licenses because of the quantity of U.S.-built parts.Asked whether Iranair was looking at an even bigger deal with Boeing (N:BA), Parvaresh said, ""No, not bigger than Airbus; maybe close, but this also depends on the situation. Anyhow Iran is in need of at least 300 aircraft for the next decade.""He said any such deal also depended ""of course on our government as well, because we are a state-owned company"". After decades of estrangement, Boeing officials have visited Iran to pitch their wares to Iranair and some other carriers under a marketing license granted by the U.S. government in February.The U.S. company would need another permit to strike a deal and then further export licenses, similar to those required by Airbus due to the use of U.S. technology, to complete it.Some industry sources expect a preliminary deal for at least 100 Boeing jets to be reached fairly soon.""We’re following the licensing process outlined by the U.S. government,"" said Boeing Middle East spokesman Fakher Daghestani.Parvaresh said ""a lot of issues"" needed to be clarified in talks between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Washington over export licenses for European planes under last year's nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).""We are very hopeful and optimistic that the licenses will be released in the near future. Based on the JCPOA, there should not be any big issues or excuses and they should clarify if there are any questions.""Asked about the status of discussions with the U.S. Treasury, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon said, ""We are making progress"".FINANCE TALKS 'PROGRESSING'Even with those licenses, Iranair faces what aviation sources still regard as awkward hurdles in financing any deals. The airline is talking to banks and leasing firms who could step in to take all or part of the Airbus deal, which must avoid the U.S. financial system under remaining core sanctions.""Our deal with Airbus is in euros. The financiers we are talking to...are finding a solution to pay Airbus in euros and then we would have to pay the financiers. We are working on this,"" Parvaresh said, adding these talks were ""progressing"".He said some banks were willing to get involved but lacked sufficient capacity to tackle the whole package. ""Everybody is willing to take 10 or so aircraft which is not in our interest. We would rather not have more than one or two (financiers) to make it easier, and we have had very fruitful discussions with some financiers who want to work with Iran and especially Iranair."" Financial sources say some Middle East and Chinese leasing companies appear willing to facilitate plane sales to Iran. But such deals would still need the backing of banks, many of which worry about the fate of assets if sanctions are reimposed.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in April Washington was not against foreign banks doing business with Iran under the deal between Iran and six powers collectively known as 5+1.Tehran, however, has complained about not getting the full economic benefits of the deal. Parvaresh said he hoped recent statements would reassure banks about doing business in aviation, which would send an important signal to other sectors.    ""Some people are making propaganda that the JCPOA will not happen because the banking issues are not resolved. This is a responsibility of the 5+1 to resolve it as committed.""Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western planemakers as it emerges from decades of sanctions.The country has a fleet of 250 aircraft, of which 90 are grounded due to the economy or missing parts, Parvaresh said.Of that total, 80 percent will need to be renewed in the next decade, he said, adding that growth could add even more jets to Iran's shopping list.""In the next 10 years, we need at least 250-300 aircraft or even more if everything is going well.""

Economists had forecast that payrolls would increase by 164,000.The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% from 5% in April as more people dropped out of the labor force.The weak data cast doubts over the prospects for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the coming months and sparked renewed concerns over slowing global growth.Financial stocks were mixed, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) declined 0.22% and 0.41%, while Germany’s  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) tumbled 0.92%.Among peripheral lenders, Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) slid 0.61% and 0.81% respectively. Spanish banks BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) overperformed however, with shares adding 0.12% and 0.15%.Elsewhere,  Accor  (PA:ACCP) retreated 0.73%, erasing Friday’s gains posted following reports that China's Jin Jiang was planning to raise its stake in the French hotel group.On the upside, Airbus Group (PA:AIR) edged up 0.13%, recovering from last week’s losses after Qatar Airways said it had cancelled its first Airbus A320neo jet and could cancel more due to delays in deliveries caused by engine problems.In London, commodity-heavy FTSE 100 advanced 0.80%, boosted by gains in the mining sector.Shares in  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) climbed 3.37% and  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) rallied 3.67%, while rivals BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) surged 3.88% and 4.25% respectively.Financial stocks were also mostly higher, as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) gained 0.40% and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) advanced 0.79%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) climbed 0.80%.

""We are not sure what we can buy from the U.S. or what we want to buy,"" Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh said in some of the first public comments from a Vietnamese defense official since the embargo was lifted.Washington's decision to permit lethal arms sales to Vietnam, its former enemy, underscored both countries' shared concerns about China's growing military clout. Vietnam, which borders China, is also a key part of President Barack Obama's efforts to rebalance U.S. strategy toward Asia amid worries about Beijing's assertiveness and sovereignty claims to 80 percent of the South China Sea.If the sale goes through, retired U.S. Navy P-3 turboprop planes now parked in a desert would be rebuilt with new wings, a new mission system and anti-submarine warfare equipment for Vietnam, Fearnow said.The cost could exceed the $80 million to $90 million price tag for each of the 12 P-3s rebuilt for Taiwan several years ago, given the added equipment, Fearnow said.Lockheed has built new wings or rebuilt aircraft for over 90 P-3 aircraft around the world, including the United States, Norway, Taiwan, Chile and Germany, since 2008, with some orders still in the works, Fearnow said. The company is scrambling to drum up more orders and extend its wing production line in Marietta, Georgia.Brazil and South Korea are each looking at ordering new wings for existing aircraft, but must decide by Sept. 1 to avoid a potentially costly gap in the supply chain for the wings, he said.Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is also marketing its P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance plane, but it is significantly newer and more expensive than the P-3. Another possible competitor is Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE's C295 plane, which is built in Spain.The U.S. State Department said it could not comment on potential P-3 or S-3 sales until it formally notifies the U.S. Congress.In addition to South Korea's interest in new wings for eight of its P-3s, Seoul is also looking at acquiring 12 of the U.S. Navy's S-3 aircraft, which were retired in 2009 and are now parked in a desert, Fearnow said.He said Spain, Portugal and Argentina also had P-3 aircraft that could use new wings, but those countries all face budget pressures. Japan, which has about 100 P-3 aircraft, is replacing them with its own P-1 aircraft, and the U.S. Navy is replacing its P-3 fleet with the Boeing P-8s.The Philippines also wants to expand its maritime surveillance capabilities, but is still defining its requirements, Fearnow said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

934,"May 31, 2016 11:20AM ET",Airbus sales chief not worried by Boeing super-sizing 737,nan,"By Tim HepherHAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) sales chief John Leahy said on Tuesday he was not worried about Boeing (NYSE:BA) adopting a larger engine for its 737 MAX 9 jet, dubbing it ""Mad MAX"" because of the technical challenges it would face. Reuters reported on Sunday that Boeing was looking at modifying a larger 'LEAP' engine used on Airbus' hot-selling A321neo to make a 737 with more capacity and range. Boeing would probably go ahead with the upgrade rather than build a widely touted and costlier jet in the 'middle of the market,' where Boeing is studying a gap between short-haul and big wide-body jets, Leahy told journalists.Boeing said it was in continuous dialogue with customers.Industry sources have drawn a distinction between Boeing's tactical defense of the 737 and longer-term discussions about a larger mid-market jet with about 220-260 seats, which could in turn prepare the ground for a full 737 replacement after 2030.While dismissing Boeing's plans to upgrade the 737 to compete with a larger Airbus model, Airbus said it remained in talks with airlines about adding to its own A350 family with a bigger version, sharpening competition at the top of the market.But conscious of the threat of drawing demand away from its existing A350 line-up, it said it did not expect the bulk of the airline business to be attracted to a 400-seat twinjet.It also dropped into its annual media briefings a new working name for the possible jet, the A350-2000.Reuters reported in March that Airbus was informally marketing a 400-seat jet, known internally at that stage as the A350-8000, to better compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9.The project is the latest move in a game of leapfrog played by Airbus and Boeing in the market for big twinjets, valued at $1.9 trillion over 20 years.Fabrice Bregier, president and CEO of the Airbus Group (PA:AIR) planemaking unit, said he was not yet convinced about the idea, because Airbus needed to ensure that it did not merely transfer orders from the 366-seat A350-1000.Two airlines whose stance is seen as decisive in whether Airbus launches the new jet are Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and British Airways (ICAG.L).""If they buy it, Airbus will build it,"" a senior industry source said.Bregier also issued a new warning to cabin suppliers over delays and manufacturing faults that have disrupted deliveries of A350 jets. One problem has been that some of the lavatory doors do not close properly, he said.Airbus said the sole supplier of lavatories for the A350 is  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC), which was not immediately available to comment.Bregier said, without naming companies, that Airbus would over time remove cabin equipment suppliers that failed to perform.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

936,"May 30, 2016 11:50AM ET",Airbus relies on current A320 model to meet delivery goal,nan,"By Tim HepherHAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is sticking to 2016 delivery targets despite a slow start caused by supplier problems, but is having to fall back on an older version of its best-selling jet to make up for delays in the A320neo, executives said.Deliveries fell 7 percent in the first quarter after problems at engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) left about two dozen A320neo jets without engines, creating what its operations chief called on Monday a queue of ""gliders"".Europe's largest aerospace group said it expected an updated version of Pratt & Whitney's engines to be ready in the summer, allowing it to complete the semi-finished jets and ramp up deliveries in the second half.But it acknowledged it would have to deliver fewer of the A320neo jets than planned this year, as it brings forward extra deliveries of the existing version, known as 'A320ceo' (current engine option), to plug the gap.""We are using the flexibility we have on ceos to offset some of our challenges on neos,"" Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams told Reuters on the sidelines of an annual media seminar.Airbus is targeting over 650 jet deliveries in 2016, up 2.3 percent. The deliveries account for about 70 percent of Airbus Group (PA:AIR) revenues.Recent delays have disrupted the outset of a two-year changeover between the current A320 and the revamped A320neo: carried out even as Airbus raises overall narrowbody jet production to 60 a month by mid-2019 from 46 a month now.Deliveries of the larger A350 long-haul jet have also been delayed, mainly by shortages of cabin equipment.""2016 is the start of a very challenging period,"" programs chief Didier Evrard said.Executives said Airbus expected to meet its target of delivering at least 50 A350s in 2016, compared with 9 since January. It plans to raise output to 10 a month by 2018.More than 40 of the jets are on the assembly line.""The airframes are there; now it is a race against the clock for the cabins and to finalize assembly,"" Chief Procurement Officer Klaus Richter said.But with Airbus still dealing with the unexpectedly slow start to the year, operations chief Williams dampened expectations it could raise its output targets even further, as suggested by its bullish sales chief John Leahy.He told journalists that current plans were ""enough for now"" and there were no serious studies of going higher.COSTS SHIFTED FROM A380Leahy has called for more A350s to open the door to increased sales and has suggested the market would support increasing A320 output as high as 63 a month.Aerospace analysts have, however, expressed concerns that an extended boom in jetliner demand is fading due to concerns over growth in emerging markets and relatively low oil prices.Williams said there had initially been some problems delivering A350 sections to the assembly line at the right quality, but there had been no repeat of wiring difficulties that crippled output of the larger A380 superjumbo in 2006.The future of that program remains uncertain as demand for large four-engined jets slows, forcing Airbus to cut production.Williams said Airbus was cutting A380 costs to maintain it at breakeven partly by redeploying overheads to small jets.A fourth assembly line for the narrowbody A320neo will use a building in Hamburg previously used for the A380, he told reporters at the German port city's Airbus plant.He declined to quantify the savings but said they would be ""significant"". Airbus also set out plans to lower costs and help speed overall production through greater automation, including the use of wearable robotic limbs called exoskeletons and drones inside the factory to check the roof of jets for riveting flaws.It meanwhile responded to suggestions that Boeing (NYSE:BA) could use an Airbus engine version to boost a weak-selling model.Reuters reported on Sunday that Boeing was considering modifying a larger 'LEAP' engine used on the A3231neo to enhance its 737 MAX 9 with more capacity and range.A320 chief Klaus Roewe said the version of engine made for Airbus was available to Boeing but would trigger significant work before it could be placed on the smaller 737 airframe.Boeing, which disputes Airbus' claims for demand in the 180-seat A321 segment, declined to comment on the engine study.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

940,"May 13, 2016 12:40PM ET",Exclusive: German firms scaling back investment in Britain ahead of EU vote,nan,"By Michael NienaberBERLIN (Reuters) - German companies are scaling back their investment in Britain ahead of its June 23 referendum on membership of the European Union, and German industry is becoming increasingly vocal in warning that a Brexit would hit both countries' economies.German foreign direct investment to Britain fell by 6 percent on the quarter to 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in the first three months of this year, Bundesbank data reviewed by Reuters showed. That followed an already steep annual decline of more than 40 percent in 2015.""A British exit means uncertainty for German companies doing business in Britain,"" Markus Kerber, managing director of the BDI Federation of German Industries, told Reuters. ""Firms are reacting to this, they are delaying or reducing their investment.""Reflecting the concerns of German companies and investors ahead of the British referendum, Kerber said a Brexit would lead to severe legal uncertainties for at least the next two years, creating economic risks for both Britain and Germany.German companies are among the biggest foreign investors in the UK, with 2,500 subsidiaries and some 500,000 British employees in sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, transport, energy and retail, according to German Industry UK, a private organization of some 100 chief executives of companies in Britain with a German majority shareholding.While German firms generally decline to comment in detail on their investment plans in Britain, there are signs that managers are becoming increasingly worried ahead of Britain's referendum.""From our point of view, it would be advantageous, particularly in terms of wealth and employment if Britain was to stay in the EU,"" a  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) spokesman said.He said if Britain should leave the EU, Siemens would not terminate its business activities there. ""But a British exit could play a role when it comes to future investment decisions.""Like many other German companies in Britain, Siemens sent a letter to its 14,000 British employees last month, warning of the risks the firm would face if Britain voted to leave.""In particular, a new trade deal with the EU could take many years to conclude and it is impossible to predict the terms that will be agreed and at what price,"" the Siemens management said.""This uncertainty, and threat of increased costs, could make the UK a less attractive place to do business and may become a factor when Siemens is considering future investment here.""Companies that have published similar letters or statements include BMW (DE:BMWG), whose British employees make the luxury Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) car, as well as chemical company BASF (DE:BASFn) and planemaker Airbus (DE:AIRG) (PA:AIR).A Brexit would not only affect the British economy.A study by DZ Bank showed it could also cost Germany up to 45 billion euros by the end of 2017 as exports from Europe's economic power house would likely be hit, at a time of already waning demand from emerging markets like China.In 2015, German companies exported goods worth some 89 billion euros to Britain, making the UK their third-most important export destination. At the same time, Germany imported British goods worth some 38 billion euros, leaving a trade surplus of around 51 billion euros.With a total trade volume of 127.5 billion euros, Britain is Germany's fifth-biggest trading partner behind the United States, France, the Netherlands and China.

942,"May 05, 2016 11:10PM ET","Bombardier pushes for airline talks, China breakthrough after Delta deal",nan,"By Allison Lampert and Siva GovindasamyMONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boosted by a pivotal CSeries deal with Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is rekindling sales talks with several U.S. and European carriers, even as it eyes China, the world's fastest-growing aviation nation.Montreal-based Bombardier is leveraging last week's order for 75 of the 110-seater CSeries narrowbodies to renew contact with established Western carriers, while harboring mid-term plans to win a breakthrough order from Chinese airlines, company executives said. The Delta deal, along with an expected firm order for 45 planes from Air Canada, give Montreal-based Bombardier the North American ""anchor"" it needs to bolster efforts globally, the company's chief executive said in an interview with Reuters. ""I would say the focus (on China) has to increase,"" Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said. ""Clearly, this is a target market for us."" The momentum has helped the company to ""advance"" its conversations with Chinese carriers, say company executives. Chinese passenger traffic has grown by double digits over the last decade, and industry observers expect the country's air travel market to remain buoyant despite any economic slowdown. Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) predicts the Chinese domestic market will leapfrog the United States as the world's largest within 10 years. Rising passenger traffic in cities away from the main hubs of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou can help convince airlines to opt for the 110-150 seat CSeries planes, said Andy Solem, who oversees commercial aircraft sales in China. ""Trunk growth is slowing down, but we don't play in those markets given the slot constraints in these hubs. There is growth outside these cities,"" said Solem. Boeing (N:BA) projects demand for 4,630 new single-aisle airplanes worth $490 billion in China over the next 20 years.Smaller regional jets, however, are not as widely used in China as in North America, where they account for 20-25 percent of aircraft fleets. Chinese airlines like Air China <601111.SS> , China Southern Airlines <600029.SS>, China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> and Hainan Airlines <600221.SS> also have hundreds of Airbus A320s and Boeing Co's 737s on order. Solem, however, points out that Chinese carriers also operate ""several hundred"" smaller A319s and 737-700s variants, and these are unlikely to be replaced by the larger variants of the Airbus and Boeing planes that have been ordered. The CSeries will help the airlines to ""right-size their fleets"" with a more cost-efficient product, he added. In China, Bombardier has not yet firmed up a 2014 letter of intent from China’s Zhejiang Loong Airlines Co Ltd to acquire 20 CS100 aircraft. CDB Leasing, a unit of the China Development Bank, also has a conditional purchase agreement for 15 planes. The manufacturer is in talks with other Chinese airlines and leasing companies, which are becoming an important source of aircraft globally, and hopes to finalize orders ""sooner rather than later"", said Solem. He added that the CSeries' imminent entry into service with launch customer Swiss International Air Lines will help, with airlines saying they want to look at its operating data and performance before making a commitment. Airbus and Boeing have also increased their presence in China to get more sales. Airbus, for example, assembles A320s in Tianjin and both companies have plans to open cabin completion facilities in the country. Bombardier manufactures some CSeries components in China, and Bellemare does not expect any imminent changes to the level of the company's presence in the country. ""It's critical for cost and it's critical for market access,"" Bellemare said. ""When you work in China you develop relationships with Chinese leaders and that has tremendous benefits when you look at getting orders from local Chinese airlines.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

944,"May 04, 2016 05:43PM ET",Bombardier not studying bigger version of CSeries jet: sources,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Tim HepherMONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) is not looking at building a bigger version of its CSeries jetliner, three people close to the company said on Wednesday.There has been persistent analyst and media speculation that Bombardier would add a third member of its slow-selling 108-130-seat jet family to compete with best-selling Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) models that carry at least 150 people.But despite earlier suggestions that Bombardier could enlarge its new jet to boost sales, the so-called 'CS500' version, which could cost up to $750 million to develop, is not being considered, the people said.""It is not on the table,"" one said, asking not to be identified. Bombardier last week scored a much-needed sale of 75 CS100 CSeries models to Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).Delta's new chief executive said it was potentially interested in anything larger that Bombardier could produce.Although Bombardier has toyed with the idea of building a bigger plane in the past, now is not the right time to consider breaking into the cut-throat 150-seat category as it tries to build on Delta's backing of its existing model, the people said.Some Canadian media have reported a larger CSeries could form part of a $1 billion package of federal support being negotiated between Bombardier and Canada's government. Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said last week Bombardier's focus was on its 108-seat CS100 and 130-seat CS300 models and a new business jet.""I think that, for us, is plenty. Our business case is all built around that: the CS100 and the CS300. It’s funny that people are already thinking about what’s next,"" he told Reuters.Bombardier has long argued there is a promising market in the 100-150-seat segment, just below the best-selling Airbus and Boeing models, but has suffered years of disappointing sales.One source familiar with Bombardier’s thinking said it would be ""suicidal"" for the company to launch a CS500 anytime soon, because it would thrust the cash-strapped planemaker into direct competition with Airbus and Boeing.Industry strategists say the two giants would relish drawing the CSeries into their core market, where their high volumes and pricing power could give them a strong advantage despite the Canadian plane's partly newer technology.A second source close to the program said it would cost $500 million to $750 million to stretch the CS300. The CS300, however, has the capability to be expanded if the market needs it, the program head said last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

After several hours searching for survivors, 11 bodies were found and the remaining two people were presumed dead.Norway and Britain suspended commercial flights of the type of helicopter involved in the crash, an Airbus Helicopters H225 Super Puma, a workhorse of the offshore oil industry.Airbus later said the grounding had been extended to the whole commercial fleet, 70 percent of which is used to support the global oil industry from the Gulf of Mexico to Asia and Africa.Plumes of smoke rose from the scene in a stretch of sea with many small islands and debris could be seen on the rocks. Several witnesses told Norwegian media they saw the rotor blades separating from the helicopter while still in the air.""While I looked up, the rotor (blades) loosened and disappeared toward the north,"" John Atle Sekkingstad told the website of local paper Bergens Tidende. ""After that, the helicopter turned north and I saw fire at the top of the helicopter, where the rotor had been attached. It caught fire before it crashed.""The main body of the aircraft was lying under water, while its rotor was found on a rocky outcrop about 200 to 300 meters (220-330 yards) away, state broadcaster NRK said, quoting the rescue center.Oil worker Chris Andersen told NRK: ""I saw the rotor separate ... It was horrible. There was a huge explosion that you could physically feel. You felt the vibrations.""The area, just west of Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, has frequent helicopter traffic to and from offshore oil installations. Weather conditions on the day were normal.Norway's king and the prime minister expressed their condolences to the families of the victims.""You are not alone in your sorrow,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg, dressed in black, said in an address to the nation.PRODUCTION, FLIGHTS HALTED Statoil halted production at the Gullfaks B platform, a visibly upset company executive told a news conference.""This is one of the worst accidents in Norwegian oil history,"" said Arne Sigve Nylund, Statoil's head of production in Norway, adding that the helicopter passengers worked for different companies, but were all on assignments for Statoil.""This is a heavy day ... Some of our colleagues will never come home,"" he said in a trembling voice. It was the second-worst Super Puma accident after a 2009 crash off Scotland in which the rotors also detached, killing 16 people. Investigators cited a catastrophic gearbox failure.Tracking service Flightradar24 said the helicopter in Friday's crash dropped 2,100 feet (640 meters) in the last 10 seconds.Formerly known as the Eurocopter EC225LP Super Puma, the aircraft is a long-range helicopter widely used in the oil and gas industry, as well as for VIP flights and search and rescue. Eurocopter changed its name to Airbus Helicopters in early 2014.Imposing a temporary ban on commercial flights using the same type of helicopter, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority said it was too early to determine the cause of the crash.Airbus Helicopters, a subsidiary of Airbus Group (PA:AIR), pledged full support for the investigation, which will be carried out by Norway with assistance from investigators based in France and Britain.Norway said late on Friday it had found the two ""black box"" flight recorders, one capturing data and the other recording cockpit conversations, and would send them to Britain, which has experience of handling several recent helicopter incidents.The crash deals a blow to an offshore industry already suffering weak demand due to low oil prices and puts the Super Puma back in the spotlight after a series of problems in the UK.In 2012, Super Puma fleets were grounded after a pair of controlled ditchings that were later linked to gearbox cracks, prompting Airbus Helicopters to carry out modifications.In 2013, four people died when an earlier version of Super Puma ditched off the Shetland Islands, off northern Scotland, in an accident blamed on crew.The last helicopter crash in the Norwegian oil industry, in 1997, involved a Super Puma in which 12 people died.Airbus Helicopters said it had no information so far to link the latest crash to earlier accidents.The helicopter that crashed on Friday had been granted extended flying hours, or delayed maintenance, twice in 2015, an aviation authority official told Norwegian daily VG.The flight was operated by Canada-based CHC Helicopter, owned by U.S. private equity firm First Reserve. CHC confirmed that the life of a previous gearbox fitted to the helicopter had been extended, but said the gearbox fitted at the time of the crash was new. It said the aircraft was fully compliant with Norwegian rules at the time of the accident.""The main gearbox in the aircraft in question, which has at all times been fully airworthy and compliant, was subsequently replaced in January 2016,"" said CHC's head of safety and quality, Duncan Trapp, in an emailed statement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The new planes can seat 185 people.Airlines typically enjoy discounts of 40 percent or more on aircraft off list prices.""The order for the A321s is an opportunistic fleet move that enables us to produce strong returns and cost-effectively accelerate the retirement of Delta’s 116 MD-88s in a capital efficient manner,"" Delta's incoming Chief Executive Ed Bastian in the release.Reuters reported earlier this month that Airbus was nearing a deal to sell Delta the 37 jets.The announcement comes a day after Delta ordered 75 CS100 aircraft from  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), boosting the Canadian planemaker's stature in the airline industry even as it faces a long road back to profitability.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It's not part of our plans at this stage but having said that there's plenty of scope in our future plans to look at the CSeries as a potential aircraft within the IAG fleet,"" he told reporters on a call.The CSeries serves the niche market for 100-seat planes spurned by larger rivals Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR), where Bombardier faces competition from Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3).The Delta order would make a difference to the jet's popularity, Walsh said. ""It will give confidence to others to look at the aircraft ... people wanted to see some significant hard orders before they wanted to commit to it,"" he said. Another of IAG's airlines, Vueling, had in the past carried out a detailed evaluation of the CSeries but decided against it, Walsh said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

951,"Apr 28, 2016 12:33PM ET",Bombardier gains traction with big Delta order for CSeries jets,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Jeffrey DastinMONTREAL/ATLANTA (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) won a major order for its new CSeries passenger jets from Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) on Thursday, potentially boosting the Canadian manufacturer's stature in global markets as it struggles to return to profitability.The order for 75 CS100 planes, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price, was the first from a major U.S. airline for the CSeries line, which is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Quebec-based Bombardier hopes the deal marks a turning point as it strives to break into the fleets of top airlines and serve the niche market for 100-seat planes that larger rivals  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus Group (PA:AIR) have neglected.Securing the order does not appear to have come cheap for Bombardier, which is waiting for a decision on its request for $1 billion in Canadian government aid.Industry sources estimated the company may have had to offer discounts as high as 75 percent to reboot the CSeries program with a major order, matching some of the most aggressive deals seen in the aviation market lately.Jet brokers say commercial jets usually sell for about half of their catalog prices before adjustments for inflation.Bombardier also said it would book a $500 million ""onerous contract"" charge in the second quarter related to the Delta order and a separate order from  Air Canada  (TO:AC) in February.""We were expecting to have to be a bit more aggressive to relaunch the program, and we have done just that,"" Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare told analysts on a conference call.He predicted the CSeries would be the largest driver of future growth in Bombardier's commercial plane business.Bombardier shares were up 3.5 percent to C$2.08 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after jumping 13 percent at the open.'HUGE ENDORSEMENT' The widely-anticipated deal with Delta included an option to buy an additional 50 CS100 aircraft, Bombardier said. Atlanta-based Delta also has an option to convert a number of its orders into the larger CS300 variant of the aircraft at a later date.The size of Bombardier's order book for the jet program also will be dramatically increased by the deal.For its part, Delta will be able to phase out the 50-seat jets that it contracts regional airlines to fly under its Delta Connection brand. The larger CS100 planes burn less fuel per passenger and have room for two cabin classes rather than one, giving the global carrier an opportunity to up-sell customers to business class.The order is a setback to Boeing, which had planned to sell Delta 20 used Embraer jets traded in by Air Canada as part of an earlier deal, industry sources said. Delta confirmed it no longer plans to induct the E190 into its fleet.The Delta order, coupled with the Air Canada's commitment from early this year, puts Bombardier's CSeries order book above the company's target for 300 orders before the jet enters commercial service this summer.""Air Canada is viewed as a shrewd buyer by many in the sector and Delta is seen as an even more astute aircraft buyer, so the two orders are a huge endorsement,"" said an industry insider who declined to be named.The order carries CSeries' firm order book beyond 2020. Bombardier Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said the program remains on track to break even on a free cash flow basis in 2020.Analysts had feared the CSeries order book could dry up just as the program became profitable.In the short term, the talks over Canadian government aid to Bombardier have hit an impasse over federal demands for more oversight.The company, which also manufactures business jets and rail transportation equipment, struck a $1 billion deal with the province of Quebec last October to support the CSeries.Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said on Thursday that Ottawa must help Bombardier, arguing that governments should not behave like bankers or investors but as ""economic agents.""Ottawa, Quebec and Bombardier have said the government assistance does not violate World Trade Organization rules.Separately, Bombardier reported an unexpectedly bigger adjusted first-quarter loss of 3 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate for a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell nearly 11 percent to $3.91 billion.Bellemare said the second quarter is looking a bit better, but more needs to be done to improve the company's cost structure. Bombardier is on track to meet 2016 guidance, he added.(Additional reporting and writing by Euan Rocha, Sweta Singh and Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Walker Simon and Paul Simao)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(EURJPY=)Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) had slumped 3.6 percent by the time it closed and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 dropped 0.6 percent. Disappointing earnings from plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) and Spain's second biggest bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) added to the gloom. (EU)The BOJ's decision to hold steady in the face of soft global demand and a rise in the yen was particularly jarring for markets after media reports ahead of the meeting said it wanted to go deeper into negative interest rates.On the key element of the speculation, applying sub-zero rates to the BOJ's main bank lending program, governor Haruhiko Kuroda spelled it out clearly.""I know such a program is adopted by the ECB (European Central Bank) ... At this stage, we don't have any plans to consider this option.

955,"Apr 25, 2016 12:10PM ET","Aiming for U.S. market, Airbus delivers first U.S-made jetliner",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher(Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) delivered its first U.S.-made jetliner on Monday to JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU), a key step in efforts to win market share from rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA).Airbus' first U.S.-built plane, the largest A320-family jet known as the A321, rolled out before a large crowd at the new $600 million factory in Mobile, Alabama, a site that was an empty field three years ago. ""We are so honored to be the first delivery here,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said at the handover ceremony.The plant employs about 600 people and is expected to attract a network of suppliers in the Mobile area. So far, major parts are shipped from Europe, except engines, which are U.S.-made and shipped from their suppliers,  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), Airbus said.The plant holds strategic and symbolic significance for the European plane maker. It ends an era in which Boeing was the only U.S.-based maker of such large commercial airplanes and it adds to Airbus' industrial capacity as the world's largest plane makers race to boost production through the end of the decade.Being ""U.S.-built"" is not a decisive factor in aircraft sales but “it certainly doesn't hurt to become part of the infrastructure,” Airbus sales chief John Leahy told Reuters.Airbus plans to notch up global A320 output to 60 a month in 2019. Boeing plans to lift output of its competing 737 planes to 57 a month the same year. Both build 42 a month currently.The Alabama plant also shows Airbus' growing global industrial base. Modeled on an Airbus plant in Hamburg, Germany, the Mobile facility is the company's fourth assembly plant for single-aisle jets after Hamburg, the French city of Toulouse and the Chinese industrial port of Tianjin.In contrast, Boeing builds all of its 737s at its single factory in Renton, Washington. “Now it is our most modern factory anywhere in the world,” Leahy said of the Mobile factory.Airbus broke ground at site in April 2013, began assembly of the first plane in July 2015, and plans to be producing four aircraft a month at the plant by late 2017. The plant is capable of building at twice that rate, Airbus said.Airbus is aiming to win 50 percent of the U.S. market for single-aisle jetliners. It already is on track to capture 40 percent of such U.S. sales based on the existing orders in its backlog, up from 20 percent before Airbus' newest single-aisle models were announced.The second plane from the Mobile plant, also an A321, is due to go to American Airlines (O:AAL) in a few weeks.Airbus is poised to win an order for 37 of its A321 jets from Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), industry sources said last week, raising the prospect that those jets could be assembled by U.S. workers 300 miles away in Alabama.Leahy declined to comment on any unfinished negotiations but said U.S. airlines would be ""first in the queue"" to receive aircraft from the new facility, which also could be used for exports.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Aviation Iran reported on Saturday that Bombardier signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from Iran's Qeshm Free Zone on establishing an airline. Citing an anonymous source, Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Qeshm Free Zone officials hoped to conclude a deal with Bombardier in the next two months on a project to set up an airline in the southern Qeshm island.De la Barrera said by phone that Bombardier did not plan to launch and run a new airline, but she could not say specifically whether the Montreal-based company was holding talks to sell planes to an Iranian start-up.""We build, market and sell aircraft and trains,"" she said.She said the company's talks in the country were progressing.""We are advancing in discussions,"" she said.

958,"Apr 21, 2016 05:57PM ET","Boeing mulls new 737 jet variant, airlines interested",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is studying whether to revise one version of its best-selling 737 aircraft in a bid to fend off competition, according to two people familiar with the matter.The U.S. planemaker's concept of a slightly larger version of its 737 MAX 7 jet with more seats and range drew airline interest on Thursday.The plans are preliminary, without many specifics, the sources said. But Boeing has a product study underway to determine if such a jet would make sense, they added. The plane could perk up relatively slow sales for the 737 MAX 7 and help Boeing's market share battle with Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE, which has outsold it with its competing A320 jet.Boeing's tweaked 737 also would help fight back competition from Bombardier Inc's fledgling CSeries aircraft, which appears poised to win a large order from Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Boeing needs to win support for the proposed plane from Southwest Airlines, which has ordered the smallest model 737s, as well as United Continental Holdings Inc, the Journal reported.Southwest, which only flies 737s, said on Thursday it would consider the plane. Asked if it would convert some orders to a new 737 variant, Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said no decisions have been made. ""Absolutely we would want to go and consider different options out there,"" he told reporters in a conference call.United did not respond to requests for comment.American Airlines said: ""We always look at new offerings from airplane makers, but we don't have anything more to say about these reports right now.""Boeing has officially called the model under consideration the 737 MAX 7X. It would seat around 150 passengers rather than 126, according to the Journal.To make such an idea work, Boeing would have to juggle costs and operating efficiency for airlines. Technically, the new model would be a ""shrink,"" or shorter-fuselage version of the 737 MAX 8.Analysts say shortened aircraft tend to be difficult to sell because they inherit part of the extra structural weight of the larger plane and are often considered inefficient.Using the best-selling 737-8 as the starting point for a new type of 737 could pose such challenges, but may also be cheaper to make because of economies of scale in busy 737-8 production.Two industry sources said Boeing may have pitched this idea to Delta without so far winning a favorable response.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

959,"Apr 21, 2016 10:40AM ET",Airbus to cut output of slow-selling A380 superjumbo,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) plans to cut production of its A380 superjumbo from 2017 as it struggles to revive sales of the world's largest passenger jet, two industry sources said.It has told its suppliers to slow production to support an assembly rate of 1.7 aircraft per month from next year, compared with production of just over two a month now, the sources said.The exact month in which the slowdown would be felt in the Toulouse assembly plant was not immediately clear. Airbus declined to comment on talks with suppliers. ""We can't comment on any discussions which may or may not have happened,"" a spokesman said.The company does not publish production figures for its biggest model, but only targets deliveries. Sales of large four-engine airliners like the 544-seat A380 have been hit by improvements in the range and efficiency of smaller two-engined models, which can be easier to fill.Airbus, which has delivered 143 A380s since it began service in 2007, says the double-decker is becoming more attractive due to lower oil prices and also helps to solve airport congestion.But because of long lead times the sources said Airbus had been forced to ask suppliers to slow the flow of parts.Depending on the exact timing of the change, any slowdown could test the company's ability to continue to break even on the jet, after stemming losses for the first time last year.Last year it delivered 27 A380s and has said it expects to continue to break even based on similar deliveries in 2016. It meanwhile continues to cut costs in an effort to lower the breakeven point to as low as 20 aircraft a year.Based on a full year, which Airbus counts as 11.5 months, the new production rate would yield 19.6 superjumbos a year. In February Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said it had between 20 and 30 A380s on its delivery list for 2017.RBC Capital Markets analyst Rob Stallard said he estimates Airbus will deliver 24 A380s next year, with its profit margin on the jet staying at zero, or exactly breakeven.ORDER UNCERTAINTYProduction and deliveries do not always match because of extra customization work needed for new airline versions.At the end of March Airbus had 135 aircraft on its books that have been sold and are waiting to be produced, mainly for leading customer Emirates which recently topped up its order.But after deducting aircraft that are unlikely to be delivered, analysts say the order situation is weaker.Air France (PA:AIRF) has said it plans to cancel two A380s listed on the Airbus order book. Another 10 listed anonymously are believed to have been canceled by Hong Kong Airlines and 20 are allocated to leasing firm Amedeo, which are seen as unlikely to enter production until the lesser places them with airlines.Analysts also say Qantas (AX:QAN) and Virgin Atlantic are unlikely to take a combined total of 12 of the jets.The project received a boost earlier this year when Iran announced a preliminary order for 12 superjumbos as it emerges from sanctions, but doubts remain over how quickly the order can be finalised as Iran faces continued financial restrictions.Airbus says it is working on several sales campaigns.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Hired last May on a three-year mission to revive the state-controlled firm after years of heavy losses, the German executive could not be reached for comment.Malaysia Airlines made no further comment on Mueller's personal situation, but said it has begun the search for a new chief executive. Mueller, 54, intends to remain on the carrier's board as a non-executive director, it said.The departure amid early signs Mueller's recovery strategy might work is a major blow for a carrier still coping with 2014's loss of two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777s, separate disasters that triggered a 6 billion ringgit ($1.55 billion) state restructuring package. Though still in the red, the airline has reported improved traffic and on-time-performance and last month Mueller forecast annual profit by 2018.""Mueller is a war general, he came in at the worst time,"" said Mohshin Aziz, an analyst at Maybank Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. ""A change of management can't help, a lot of people might feel things are uncertain.""Under Mueller, who previously steered a financial turnaround at Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  (IR:AERL) , the airline brought in a roster of experienced executives to head operations, commercial and marketing teams.With the blessing of Malaysia's state fund Khazanah, the new management also re-negotiated contracts with suppliers and leasing firms, leased new A350 aircraft from Airbus Group (PA:AIR) that were cheaper to operate and refocused on Asian traffic, rather than long-haul destinations.Malaysia Airlines said that while it looks - externally and internally - for a new boss, it has appointed Chief Operating Officer Peter Bellew, formerly with European budget carrier Ryanair (I:RYA) executive, to the board.""They need someone with Christoph's vision for the airline's future, the drive to push the changes through, and the nous to manage the politics that come with running a state-owned airline,"" said one industry source familiar with the company's executives and operations.""They did well to get Christoph, but it may be even harder to find an adequate replacement.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

964,"Apr 13, 2016 07:10PM ET",Utility trumps luxury as China private jet buyers fly economy,nan,"By Fang Yan and Siva GovindasamySHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Makers of private jets for China's elite are shifting their focus from luxury to convenience, as a cooling economy and long-running crackdown on corruption prompt customers to demand smaller planes and even consider second-hand deals.Utility is the watchword, say industry insiders, as buyers who once enlisted feng shui masters to help them design cabin interiors that might feature mahjong tables or karoake areas now look for functional desks to work at and rest areas to sleep.China's richest businessmen remain Asia's top owners of luxury aircraft: the greater China region had 466 private jets in 2015, according to consultancy Asia Sky Group, compared with 65 in 2007. Mainland China accounted for 300 of those. But for manufacturers such as Bombardier (TO:BBDb), Dassault (PA:AVMD), Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and General Dynamics' (N:GD) subsidiary Gulfstream the market is cooling, especially for new aircraft, forcing them to prioritise efficiency, keeping production costs low and speeding up aircraft delivery times.""The economy is weak and there are different political forces, as you know,"" said Bill Schultz, senior vice president of business development in China at Textron (N:TXT), which manufactures Cessna and Beechcraft-branded aircraft. ""It's impacted jet sales, there is no question about that.""Against that backdrop the mood was subdued as plane makers, charter firms and buyers gathered this week for one of the industry's biggest annual air shows in Shanghai. Interest in specialized firms who manage, charter or refurbish planes was high.KEEPING UNDER THE RADARPresident Xi Jinping's three-year-old campaign against official corruption has discouraged conspicuous consumption in China, hitting discretionary spending on everything from fine wine and jewelry to luxury cars, yachts and casino trips.""Ten years ago, if you bought a business jet, you would show your shiny new plane off to reporters,"" said one China-based business jet broker, who has been helping wealthy individuals buy and sell aircraft for more than 15 years.""These guys have seen their peers being hauled up, and they don't want any scrutiny of their wealth and business interests. So they would rather keep a low profile,"" said the broker, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.Asia Sky Group put China's fleet growth in 2015 at 6.6 percent - from highs of more than 49 percent when the market hit its peak in 2012. With orders slowing, growth is set to dip further.Schultz said that Textron, which has built its Caravan turboprop plane and the Citation XLS+ in China as part of a joint venture with state-owned aerospace firm AVIC, was focusing on the market for smaller jets and utilitarian turboprop craft.Until recently mainland Chinese buyers have favored larger cabin jets, even including retrofitted versions of the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 and Boeing (N:BA) 737 that can cost up to $90 million at list prices and another $10-15 million for fitting.Now there is more interest in smaller aircraft.""Instead of using too big a plane, people are flying in a smaller plane,"" said Fernando Grau, director of airline market analysis at Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, which uses actor Jackie Chan to sell its planes in China.Of course, countering China's domestic slowdown is its push to do deals abroad, spending more than $100 billion in 2015 - a boom that has more top executives forced to consider fast, convenient and efficient options as they travel more frequently beyond the country's borders.""We position the business jets also as a productivity tool,"" said Khader Mattar, who oversees sales for Bombardier in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and China. REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE But visible in Shanghai's exhibition halls this year has been the rising interest in second-hand deals, long frowned upon in China, and in companies that manage and charter flights.A 14-seater Gulfstream jet, for example, can be chartered for roughly 50,000 yuan (around $7,700) an hour, making it reasonably affordable for China's rich entrepreneurs. While many charter trips in the past were for leisure or ""unnecessary tours"" said Fang Xinyu, vice-president at Beijing-based Deer Jet which manages more than 80 aircraft that are available for charter, these days it's strictly business.Executives estimated second-hand planes now account for 30 percent of sales, still less than in a more mature market like the United States but up from 10 percent just three years ago.A Gulfstream G550, one of the most popular business jets on the market, manufactured in 2010, for example, can be bought for half of the roughly $60 million it would have originally cost.Prospective owners can spend another $2-3 million to retrofit the cabin with Gulfstream's latest interior. ""Compared to the price of a brand new plane, they are cheaper to buy and refurbish,"" said Jason Liao, CEO of China Business Aviation Group, which helps individuals buy and manage jets. ""They are great value."" ($1 = 6.4639 Chinese yuan renminbi)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

967,"Apr 08, 2016 04:20PM ET","France, Germany halt Airbus export credit amid UK probe",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Gernot HellerPARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany have joined Britain in suspending export credit facilities for Airbus (PA:AIR) jet deliveries, expanding the fallout from a potential corruption probe in Britain, several people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The move follows Britain's decision last week to suspend financing and alert the Serious Fraud Office after Airbus Group said it had found anomalies over the declaration of overseas agents and that it had itself notified the UK authorities.Unusually, it leaves the world's two largest planemakers, Airbus and Boeing (N:BA), both facing paralysis over government export financing as Congressional delays leave U.S. Export Import bank unable to support Airbus's U.S. rival.In Europe, Airbus draws on financing support for some sales from Britain, France and Germany where its main factories are.The nations typically act in concert, offering guarantees in proportion to the industrial work in each country, but declining to take up the slack whenever one of them refuses to take part. A German economy ministry spokesman confirmed that the financing, provided on its behalf by Allianz (DE:ALVG) unit Euler-Hermes, was no longer available. Berlin is also examining whether the UK episode could have consequences for export credits already awarded, he added. In France, three sources said export guarantees were being withheld for the time being. ""Audits are being carried out in the UK and we are waiting for the conclusions for those,"" a French government official said. Airbus Group declined to add to a previous statement that it was co-operating with export credit agencies and that it expected financing to be resumed in the near future.For now, the market impact is seen as limited as the use of export credits has dwindled to around 6 percent of deliveries from 40 percent at the height of the 2008-10 financial crisis.But the unprecedented halt raises doubt over the financing for some upcoming deliveries, pushing up demand for commercial loans and placing pressure on Airbus to offer bridge financing.""The problem is that deals financed with export credit are usually the tough-to-finance ones, so finding a commercial alternative is not always that simple,"" a market source said.AGENT FEES AND NAMESThe agency which underwrites aircraft exports in Britain has said it will not support Airbus deliveries until it gets assurances about Airbus's current practices on overseas agents. The UK case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back several years, two people familiar with the matter said.A person responsible for overseeing some of the information supplied in export credit applications is no longer with the group, people familiar with the matter said. Airbus Group declined comment. The decision by Airbus to report itself reflects efforts by many aerospace companies to toughen compliance and review their records for past failings after a series of industry scandals.In its just-published annual report, Airbus said a newly centralized compliance team was revising the procedures on hiring consultants and warned investors this may ""lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences"".Europe's largest aerospace group says it is co-operating with four existing criminal probes into suspected irregularities in defense or security markets, including a British investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia and a German probe into the sale of fighter jets to Austria.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

970,"Apr 04, 2016 03:48PM ET",Alaska Air to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion,nan,"By Jeffrey DastinNEW YORK (Reuters) - Alaska Air Group Inc said on Monday that it would buy Virgin America Inc for $2.6 billion in cash to become the top carrier on the U.S. West Coast and compete more effectively with larger airlines.At $57 a share, the deal represents a premium of about 86 percent from Virgin America's stock price before reports in March that the company was considering a sale. Analysts characterized the price as steep but said the merger would strengthen Alaska Air. ""The perception is that they paid a very, very high price,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel. However, he said Alaska Air could handle the cost because its strong balance sheet would allow it to raise capital at a low borrowing rate.The merger would help Alaska Air compete against Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc, which have embarked on major expansions in Los Angeles, Hackel added.The deal appears to end what Alaska Air Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden called a ""hard-fought competition"" to purchase the offshoot of billionaire Richard Branson's London-based Virgin Group, which had become famous for its mood lighting and media-rich entertainment on flights. JetBlue Airways Corp had also made an offer but said in a statement that the price reached a point where it decided to withdraw from the bidding. The Alaska Air deal would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline after a decade of mergers that have shrunk the industry to a handful of companies. The top four control more than 80 percent of the U.S. travel market.Virgin America accounts for about 1.5 percent of U.S. domestic flight capacity, while Alaska Air and its Horizon Air subsidiary account for 5 percent,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Michael Linenberg wrote in a recent research note.Shares of Virgin America were up 42.1 percent at $55.27 in afternoon trading. Alaska Air was down 5.2 percent, and JetBlue fell 3.4 percent.Branson, whose holding company owned 24.9 percent of the airline as of March 25, expressed sadness that Virgin America was changing hands.The U.S. Department of Transportation stipulated he take some of his shares in Virgin America as non-voting stock, reducing his influence over any takeover, he said on a Virgin Group website. ""So there was sadly nothing I could do to stop"" the Alaska Air deal, he said.INTEGRATION ISSUES Alaska Air said it might keep using the Virgin America brand in some form. Because of the deal, Alaska Air plans to slow down its share repurchase program this year and probably next, Chief Financial Officer Brandon Pedersen said on a conference call.Alaska Air said in a statement that the deal would generate $225 million in annual synergies once the companies are fully merged. It expects one-time integration costs of $300 million to $350 million.The companies face major hurdles in combining, although Alaska Air expressed confidence in its ability to tackle them.It must juggle the contracts of workers with disparate pay, benefits and seniority. Alaska Air said its unions and pilot leadership were on board with the merger.The Seattle-based company would also have to train pilots and maintenance crews on a new aircraft type from Virgin America's fleet of Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE A320-family planes. Alaska Air currently flies Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737s.Alaska Air said it was buying California-based Virgin America to expand in Los Angeles and San Francisco and offer more connections to international airline partners. It would also benefit from Virgin America's corporate contracts and cult-like status among travelers who work for technology companies.S&P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore said in a research note that the deal would increase Alaska Air's access to transcontinental markets on the East Coast.The companies said they expected the deal to receive the necessary approvals from Virgin America shareholders and U.S. regulators by Jan. 1.Alaska Air Chief Operating Officer Ben Minicucci said he expected few antitrust concerns because the two companies have ""minimal"" overlap of routes.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), UBS Investment Bank and Cowen & Co were financial advisers to Alaska Air, while Evercore Group LLC advised Virgin America. Legal advisers were O’Melveny & Myers LLP to Alaska Air and Latham & Watkins LLP to Virgin America.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

975,"Mar 23, 2016 12:40PM ET",Airbus unveils new cabin brand adding more seats to planes ,nan,"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) unveiled a new cabin brand on Wednesday designed to help cost-conscious airlines carry more passengers on long-haul flights while avoiding additional discomfort.The move reflects the rivalry between major planemakers to jazz up interiors and give airlines more flexibility on cabins as the industry struggles to capture more traffic without angering passengers.Airbus said the ""Airspace by Airbus"" brand would debut on its upgraded A330, the A330neo, which is due in service from late 2017, before the new designs are rolled out to other jets.Airlines will still be able to choose what cabin layout they want but with the new designs an A330neo will on average gain 10 seats compared with the existing A330 model, which can take up to 300 passengers.Airbus and rival Boeing (N:BA) are vying to add more seats to make their jets more economically attractive for airlines while claiming passengers will not feel the difference, though many consumer groups say cabins feel increasingly crowded.The trend has produced increasingly bitter industry branding wars in recent years, with each of the world's two largest planemakers accusing the other of sacrificing comfort.Airbus said by rearranging galley and lavatory space, the extra seats would be added to the A330neo with no reduction in seat width and still with eight seats across each row.""We are putting more passengers on the same amount of space but because of the cleverness and the way we have designed it we don't have to compromise on comfort,"" Airbus's executive vice president of strategy and marketing Kiran Rao said.The same set of options will later be available on the long-haul A350 and A380, adding 12 seats and 50 seats respectively, Airbus said.Adding seats is one way to reduce operating costs per seat, a key industry barometer, alongside changes to the structure of the aircraft itself or more efficient engines.At the same time, planemakers are increasingly stepping into areas previously jealously guarded by airlines and specialist cabin suppliers by offering eye-catching effects, competing more on cabin experience rather than launching costly new models.Boeing has a cabin brand called Sky Interiors and recently unveiled projections of light and images on ceilings and walls.Airbus said its new brand would include a quieter cabin and new ambient lighting options as it tries to address the growing importance of cabins on social media, where passengers post reviews and photos, and make decisions based on them. Analysts also said a standardized palette of cabin options could help to reduce the delays which have plagued the plane cabin industry and threatened some deliveries as airlines demand more and more customized features.Fabrice Bregier, president of planemaking at Airbus has said French seatmaker  Zodiac  (PA:ZODC), which has been dogged by production delays, would not be involved with the A330neo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

ATR, owned by Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and Italy's  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI), aims to sell about 90 planes to Indian airlines in the next three to five years, adding to the roughly 30 in operation currently, Moore said.India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets where passenger numbers grew a fifth last year to 81 million, with lower fuel prices and rising disposable incomes helping millions fly.But most of the travel in a vast country that is home to 1.3 billion people is between the country's larger and wealthier cities. The government wants to make air travel more accessible for the masses rather than the relative luxury it is today.Critics, however, say that forcing airlines to fly often unprofitable routes where demand is unproven will stifle the market and land carriers with unfair costs.India's civil aviation minister, Ashok Gajapathi Raju, said on Wednesday that the government planned to publish the final civil aviation rules detailing the regional connectivity program next month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

French Blue is due to take delivery of a 378-seat Airbus (PA:AIR) A330-300 jet at the end of June, with another A330 and two A350-900s scheduled for delivery in 2017 and 2018.The airline plans to offer three types of fare, the cheapest of which will not include hold baggage, meals or choice of seat. It will also charge passengers to use on-board Wi-Fi services.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Lufthansa, which stepped in as the first operator when Qatar Airways refused to take the plane, took delivery of its first A320neo in January.For now, the jet is only flying on routes within Germany, where Lufthansa has a large base of engineers at its maintenance division.""We could fly to other places but we would need more engineers in those locations,"" Spohr said.He said the German carrier was receiving compensation from Airbus until it could make full use of the A320neo and that the jet was showing a 20 percent reduction in costs compared with the earlier model.Software issues, where the engine sends erroneous messages to the cockpit, are also about 50 percent resolved, Spohr said.Pratt & Whitney said this month the new geared turbofan jetliner engine had logged high reliability at Lufthansa and that it was delivering software and hardware fixes.Lufthansa is due to take delivery of 52 new planes this year, including five A320neo jets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We have a relationship with SpiceJet that dates back to 2002. We have worked with them in good and bad times,"" said Boeing's Keskar.InterGlobe Aviation Ltd's (NS:INGL) IndiGo finalised the purchase of 250 A320neo aircraft in August, handing Airbus its largest-ever order by number of planes. Other airlines are also looking to grow their fleets to win more of the fast-growing sector. Consultants KPMG and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said in a report released on Thursday that India was on course to become the world's third-largest aviation market by 2020, six years ahead of a prediction made by the International Air Transport Association last year. The number of Indian passengers has jumped more than 20 percent in the past year. India's biggest airlines including SpiceJet,  Jet Airways (India)  Ltd (NS:JET) IndiGo and GoAir, largely money-losing until this year, are now profitable as the outlook for the market improves.""We are confident about the India forecast because of economic growth, middle class growth and airlines are doing well.

983,"Mar 09, 2016 12:43PM ET",Qatar Air says Pratt & Whitney engines not adequately tested,nan,"By Tim HepherBERLIN (Reuters) - Qatar Airways stepped up its criticism of U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) over delays and technical problems on Wednesday, saying that engines for its Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo aircraft had not been adequately tested.Qatar Airways has refused to take the jets because of engine glitches. Last month it threatened to switch to alternative engine supplier CFM International (PA:SAF) (N:GE).""I don't think this engine was tested adequately, especially for the temperatures in which Qatar Airways will operate,"" Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said.""We will only accept it when we are fully satisfied that it can operate efficiently and safely at Qatar operations (and) ... once we get sufficient performance guarantees and undertakings from both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney,"" he told a news conference at the ITB tourism exhibition in Berlin.""We are at the threshold of the walk-away clause in our contract, but I hope we will not have to exercise this.""Pratt & Whitney had no immediate comment but has said it is on track to eliminate problems with slow engine start-up times and erroneous software messages by June. Meanwhile, industry sources say that more than a dozen part-built A320neo jets are on the ground at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse waiting for their engines before they can be delivered.While keeping up the pressure in public, people familiar with the matter say that Qatar Airways is expected to give the planemaker and its engine supplier more time to fix the problems.""We’re confident that with Pratt & Whitney’s support we will address any early (lessons) and meet our targets,"" Airbus said.OIL FACTORCEO Al Baker disclosed that the airline had earlier deferred delivery of four Airbus A380s by one year when oil prices were high, only to agree to take delivery now prices have dropped.The company would consider exercising options for a further three jets if oil prices remain low, he said, though he warned that oil prices are a ""double-edged sword"" for airlines because premium traffic yields have slipped in the face of weaker business sentiment and a drop in spending by oil producers.On the airline's international ties, Al Baker predicted deeper links with British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG), in which it holds a 10.08 percent stake.Areas for possible cooperation include procurement, computer systems, fuel, insurance and even aircraft buying after a joint Boeing (NYSE:BA) purchase with Emirates in 2013.In Iran, he sees room for expansion after the lifting of sanctions that he said had been unfairly applied to the country's civil aircraft fleet -- an unusual statement from a senior Gulf state official amid rising tensions in the area.""My country has very good relations with Iran and has ... always played a balancing role in the region,"" he said.He dismissed warnings from some analysts that Iran's airspace would be dominated by foreign carriers, saying that ""there is enough demand for everyone"".On a recent trade row with major U.S. carriers, Al Baker taunted his airline's most vocal adversary by saying that a decision to fly to Atlanta would ""rub salt in the wounds"" of Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) but denied it would cause the airline harm.Atlanta-based Delta and others have said that Gulf carriers have received state support that contravenes Open Skies agreements, a charge denied by Gulf airlines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

984,"Mar 03, 2016 09:53PM ET",Exclusive: Airbus touts 400-seat 'A350-8000' jetliner,nan,"By Tim HepherPHOENIX (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is seeking airline support for a new 400-seat jetliner provisionally dubbed the A350-8000 as competition escalates with Boeing (N:BA) over the world's largest two-engined jets, airline and aviation industry sources said.After talking up the possibility of a new member of its A350 family, the European planemaker has swung into an active pre-marketing phase as it responds to a recent upgrade in the competing Boeing 777.While Boeing has scored successes in the Gulf with its biggest-ever twin-engined jet, the 406-seat 777-9, Airbus is expected to aim its design at airlines that do not always require the performance needed for extreme Gulf conditions.""It would have similar capacity and range (as the 777-9) and substantially lower seat-mile costs,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in an interview on the sidelines of the Istat Americas air finance conference. ""We are showing it to airlines right now.""The project is the latest move in a game of leapfrog played by Airbus and Boeing over the past decade in the market for big twinjets, valued at about $1.9 trillion over 20 years.It marks a shift in priorities after the oil price collapse eased pressure on Airbus to upgrade its larger four-engined A380, the output of which is declining because of slow sales. Two airlines whose stance could be decisive in whether Airbus launches the new jet are Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) and British Airways (L:ICAG). Singapore took delivery of its first smaller A350-900 model this week and has long been weighing up the 777-9.Both airlines declined to comment.In Singapore, where Airbus' planemaking president, Fabrice Bregier, stopped over on Thursday after a China visit, a company spokesman declined to comment.The A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) family was launched after a string of setbacks in 2006 to compete with Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777.Boeing responded to the all-new jet by upgrading its existing 777 family to include the 777-9, one of a pair of jets also known as the 777X series.Boeing has sold 306 777X jets. But after an initial burst, sales have hit a lean patch. Airbus has sold 181 A350-1000s. KEY DECISIONSThe new, bigger A350 would use a derivative of the latest Rolls-Royce (L:RR) Trent XWB planned for the A350-1000. One person briefed on the plans said it would boost thrust to just over 100,000 pounds from the current 97,000.Airbus believes that would compete well for a large majority of the industry's needs and eclipse the heavier 777X.Boeing dismissed the proposal.""We’re not surprised that Airbus is attempting to fill a hole in its product lineup after losing market share to the 777X. At the end of the day, we’ll still have the better airplane,"" Marketing Vice-President Randy Tinseth told Reuters.Some analysts said a key to the project would be how easily Rolls-Royce could expand a full slate of projects, even without pushing performance to the limits needed by Mideast carriers.""This sounds like they are making a virtue of its lack of hot-and-high performance compared to 777-9 when maybe it’s the case that Rolls can’t afford, or doesn’t want to, do a much bigger and substantially new engine,"" said Nick Cunningham of UK-based Agency Partners.One engine expert estimated the upgrade could cost half a billion dollars and require a bigger fan and new materials.Rolls-Royce was not immediately available for comment.To give the new jet enough capacity and range, Airbus would boost the maximum takeoff weight to just over 319 tonnes from 308 tonnes on the A350-1000, the person briefed on the plans said.But it would sacrifice some range compared with the 8,000-mile A350-1000.Airbus says it has not made a final decision on whether to launch a new A350 and will provide an update at the Farnborough Airshow in July.It has been weighing what to call the new member of the A350 XWB family, reflecting deeper decisions on market positioning that can affect billions of dollars in sales.It needs to strike a balance between protecting sales of the A350-1000, by emphasizing what is new, without weakening its long-held mantra of commonality between related aircraft.Until now, the possible new model was widely known in the industry as the A350-1100, continuing a sequence from the 276-seat A350-800 to the 315-seat A350-900 and 366-seat A350-1000.Sources now say it is being pre-marketed with a surprise new identity, the A350-8000, although a final decision has yet to be taken. An earlier working title was A350-1000 XL.Leahy confirmed Airbus was reluctant to call it A350-1100.""You don't want it so close to the 1000 that it is an either-or decision. You have the 1000 and another airplane, with equal gaps of 40 seats between the 900 and 1000 (models), and then whatever this becomes."" Eight is a number widely used by planemakers and is seen as a symbol of success in a key battleground for sales: Asia.""Eight is a very nice number out in Asia, but we are not going to comment until we launch the program,"" Leahy said. If the name is confirmed, Airbus will be hoping to bury any association with the last jet to use the 8000 model code: a VIP version of its A340, only one of which was ever built.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Its underperforming Otis elevator division is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line.United Tech makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines. The company called Honeywell's decision to drop its pursuit an ""appropriate outcome"" given the regulatory obstacles and negative customer reaction.""UTC will remain laser focused on our key priorities – program execution, innovation, cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation,"" the company said on Tuesday. Shares of United Tech, the maker of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, were down 2.8 percent in early trading on Tuesday, while Honeywell was up 3.2 percent.A combination of the two would create a company with nearly $100 billion in revenue, responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to cockpits and landing gear.Major customers Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) weighed in last week, saying they did not support such a deal. A merger would also have drawn scrutiny from the Pentagon, since the companies make parts for key weapons programs, including  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 program.United Tech's shares have risen about 10 percent since Feb. 19, the last trading day before deal talks were first reported.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Major customers also weighed in, with Boeing saying it would careful scrutinize a deal and underscoring the need for ""healthy competition"" in its supply chain.United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) said the two companies had talked about a possible combination for years.But it said the regulatory environment had changed and a merger now would either be blocked outright, or any synergies would be far outweighed by regulatory delays, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions.""It would be irresponsible for UTC to move forward with the proposed combination,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.United Tech's filing came hours after Honeywell (N:HON) spelled out the details of its $90.7 billion offer to acquire  United Tech , putting pressure on the reluctant aerospace supplier to come to the negotiating table.Honeywell Chief Executive Officer David Cote, in a presentation he made to United Tech's top executives last week and then made public on Friday, said a combined company would have double-digit earnings growth after it slashed costs.United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI), closed 0.4 percent lower at $97.69. That is well below Honeywell's $108 per share offer, suggesting Wall Street, like United Tech, was skeptical about the combination. ""Game on.... There is clear momentum in this saga, and a ratcheting up of the tensions,"" wrote Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets. He cited concerns about business overlap, and said there were unresolved questions about achievable synergies, management roles, cultural fit, and merger premiums.Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said he was not convinced that the regulatory environment was as tough as United Tech said. Divestitures were always possible, but United Tech likely did not want to cede control to Honeywell, he said.United Tech is the parent of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, while Honeywell makes thermostats, auto turbochargers and airplane cockpit electronics.Areas of overlap between the companies include small aircraft engines, airplane power units and environmental systems as well as wheels and brakes, CRT Capital analyst Peter Arment said in a note to clients. Honeywell would likely have to divest many assets and raise its offer before a deal was done, Arment added. U.S. and European regulatory scrutiny would push the deal's completion well into 2017, and potentially into 2018, according to sources familiar with the deal.Honeywell said its offer includes $42.63 in cash and 0.614 of its shares for each United Tech share. The proposal represents a 22 percent premium to United Tech's closing price on Feb. 19, the last trading day before the talks were made public. Honeywell shares closed 1.1 percent lower at $103.03.The companies said earlier this week they had held merger talks but did not offer details. United Tech had said a deal would ""face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.""""It just cannot happen,"" United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said on CNBC television this week. ""There's just no way to get it done."" A merger could either be blocked outright or made conditional on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review that would destroy shareholder value, United Tech has said.Honeywell, however, said potential regulatory issues would be ""easily resolved."" In its presentation, Honeywell said a deal with United Tech would save $3.5 billion each year by cutting spending on raw materials, consolidating real estate and in other ways. Under the offer, Cote would lead the combined company. United Tech said the merged firm's revenues could fall by $5 billion to $10 billion since the change in “control” would force it to reopen contracts with major aircraft makers, said a source close the matter. That would allow those customers to negotiate lower prices, or even find new suppliers, the source said.A merger would create a behemoth responsible for much of the equipment on commercial airliners and many military aircraft, raising concerns for companies like Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), as well as the Pentagon.The combined company would generate about 28 percent of sales from commercial aerospace customers, and 13 percent from the defense and space sector, according to Honeywell's presentation.(This version of the story corrects third paragraph to customers from suppliers)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

988,"Feb 26, 2016 07:00PM ET","Exclusive: Bailout would cut Bombardier's CSeries jet stake, taking it off books",nan,"By Allison Lampert and Andrea ShalalMONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposed Canadian government bailout of Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) new CSeries jet manufacturing program would reduce the company's stake in the money-losing aircraft, taking it off the plane maker's books and boosting results in the short-term, two sources familiar with the matter said.The federal government is considering a deal that would give Canada, the Quebec government and Bombardier each a one-third stake in the CSeries, which would be carved out as a separate joint venture with its own board, ‎said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. Currently, Bombardier controls 50.5 percent of the CSeries and Quebec 49.5 percent.Federal officials familiar with the situation stress it is too early to say whether a separate CSeries board would be part of a bailout of Bombardier. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his Liberal Party government would announce a decision before the federal budget on March 22.Such a deal would allow Montreal-based Bombardier to alter the way it accounts for the CSeries business, which is costing at least $5.4 billion to develop and launch and which the company doesn’t expect to generate returns for another four years or more. The proposed structure would have a positive effect on the parent company's cash flow and earnings per share for the next three to four years, said one of the sources. The company has forecast 2016 revenue of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion. Those figures bake in anticipated revenue from about 10 CSeries jet deliveries this year, according to one analyst. The loss of revenue because of deconsolidation would be more than offset by a reduction in CSeries costs and its cash burn rate in the parent company's accounts.Canada is leaning toward matching Quebec's $1 billion CSeries injection of funds through a deal that could give the federal and provincial governments joint majority control of the 100-150 seat jet program. The first of the jets, the smaller version, is entering service in 2016 after years of delays and cost overruns. New jet programs typically take years to sell and deliver enough planes to break even and recover sunk development costs.CASH DRAIN The federal government is not expected to invest directly in Bombardier itself, as opposed to the CSeries program, and there is no expected change to the company's dual class structure that favors the founding Bombardier-Beaudoin family, both sources said. Within the government, there are some concerns about the parent company's shareholding structure, which gives the family a roughly 54 percent voting stake, said a person familiar with Ottawa’s approach. The founding family has pushed back against any changes to the company’s governance, he said.A key member of the family, Bombardier’s previous Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin, launched three different plane programs at about the same time and the resulting draining of the company's cash is a major reason for its current problems.The investment model, proposed by Quebec and supported by Bombardier, would give the federal and provincial governments a combined four seats - provided Canada matches the province's $1 billion investment - on the seven person CSeries board, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Bombardier itself would only be able to nominate three of the seats, putting the company's representatives in a minority. On Thursday, Quebec Transport Minister Jacques Daoust confirmed the Reuters story during an interview on Canada's RDI television. “If we had a new player joining us, we could imagine having seven board seats,” Daoust said. “The new partner and us would control the company. This is certainly a scenario that is being explored now, because we couldn’t imagine investing two-thirds of the funds and having a minority on the decision-making front.” Quebec has argued that the governments' majority position on the CSeries board should assuage federal concerns over the company's governance. The governments would act as shareholders and not participate in the day-to-day operations of the plane program, one of the sources said. The deal would also allow Bombardier to buy back the governments' shares in the CSeries at a later date, as is already the case with the agreement between Bombardier and Quebec. ""The last thing you want are governments to run the program,"" said the second source. A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment. Bombardier received a boost in February when the company secured its first order in 16 months. That was for up to 75 CSeries jets to be supplied to Air Canada. Bombardier has faced fierce competition from plane-making rivals  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) which have adapted new engines to their respective narrow-body jets. That has helped them compete with the fuel-efficient CSeries. They have also been able to undercut Bombardier's pricing by discounting their older Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 models, which are late in their life cycles and can be built at a comparatively lower cost.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

989,"Feb 26, 2016 09:46AM ET",Exclusive: Pratt & Whitney A320neo engine suffers new test snag,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) has suffered a fresh problem during testing of new aircraft engines for the Airbus A320neo, but flight trials of the latest version of Europe's best-selling airliner are continuing, people familiar with the matter said.The problem occurred when an oil pump failed after an engine had been deliberately shut down in flight and left to turn with the natural airflow, a process known as ""windmilling"" which is designed to ensure an aircraft can fly on only one engine.""We found a bearing had seized within the main oil pump. We have never seen that anywhere in flight tests,"" an industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said.Pratt & Whitney is carrying out an internal investigation into the problem which happened about two weeks ago. Early signs point to a manufacturing fault in the broken part, another person close to the matter said.Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies, confirmed the incident in response to queries from Reuters.""These are the types of things you find in routine flight testing,"" a Pratt & Whitney spokesman said.""In this particular case, we haven't seen it before but we study it carefully to make sure we understand the root cause because our objective is always for the engine to perform flawlessly.""A spokeswoman for Airbus (PA:AIR) said the incident had ""no impact on the overall flight test campaign"".The aircraft involved is one of two A320neo models being used for testing and is still flying, Airbus said.Although described as routine, the latest snag comes as the latest version of Airbus's A320 family remains under scrutiny in the wake of earlier problems with its new Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines.The A320neo missed an end-2015 target for first delivery after it was found the engines needed longer than usual to start properly.The extra warm-up time creates problems for the aircraft's first operator, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), because of a shortage of space to taxi at Frankfurt airport, but has been reduced from five minutes to around two minutes, a source with the German pilots union said.A part was redesigned and will be followed by a software fix in weeks, the head of Pratt & Whitney told Reuters.The engines also face a problem with engine software sending erroneous messages to the cockpit, adding to the workload before the plane can take off. In the worst case scenario, such problems could force airlines to use an extra pilot, two industry sources said. However Pratt has said it will fix the problem by June.Airbus is meanwhile repairing an A321neo variant powered by engines from Pratt's competitor CFM International, which suffered a tail strike on one of its first flights this month.The A321neo was making a steeper than normal descent in an exercise commonly used for safety testing, according to airport sources. Airbus says it should return to service within weeks.The incident surprised some industry observers because the aircraft's flight control system would usually prevent the tail scraping the runway. Airbus said the problem would not affect the timetable for flight testing and certification.Qatar Airways last week threatened to cancel an order for Pratt & Whitney engines for the A320neo. Industry sources said such a move could trigger several months of further delays in delivering the jets, since the engines cannot easily be switched to CFM because each engine type uses different wing attachments.Pratt & Whitney has said it is installing fixes on the engines ordered by Qatar Airways.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Merger discussions between the two U.S.-based multinationals are not currently active, and there have been no recent meetings among lawyers or bankers on any specifics, a source familiar with the matter said.A merger of the two firms would create a behemoth with combined sales of more than $90 billion, a company responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to airplane cockpits and landing gear.Such a deal would likely draw opposition from plane makers such as Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), as well as the Pentagon, since the companies also make parts for key weapons programs, including  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 program.""If you put these two companies together, they would build the plane from tip to tail,"" said a source. ""There's just no way that Boeing and Airbus would ever accept that.""United Tech was reluctant to shed higher-margin commercial aerospace units that would likely be required to secure government approval, another source said.CNBC first reported on the talks earlier on Monday. Honeywell declined to comment on the report. Pentagon officials had no immediate comment. Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said any combination would spark a serious antitrust review given overlapping business in areas ranging from engines to avionics. ""If this were to go forward, it would get significant U.S. government scrutiny,"" said Bialos. ""This kind of a deal could well result in some kind of material divestiture.""The sources said the government was unlikely to approve a merger of this scale in a presidential election year, which meant the process could likely drag on for 18 to 24 months.Some analysts and antitrust experts said the deal could ultimately be approved if the parties agreed to some big divestitures, since there are other competitors, and if they enlisted the backing of their biggest customers.""We think a merger would unlock significant synergies,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore in a note to clients. Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said that the deal would likely win antitrust approval unless there was ""a very substantial expression of concern by the airplane manufacturers.""Shares of United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, closed up 4.6 percent Monday. Shares of Honeywell, a maker of aerospace parts and climate control systems, fell 2 percent.'DEAD IN THE WATER'United Technologies and Honeywell first began exploring a merger as early as 1993, but the talks were revived after a broad strategic review initiated by United Tech's Chief Executive Greg Hayes when he took over last year, according to the sources. That review also resulted in United Technologies selling Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin Corp (N:LMT).Hayes put out feelers with Honeywell, but he was snubbed, the people said. In September, after United Technologies' market capitalization dropped due to poor earnings, Honeywell approached United Technologies with its own offer, which would see it lead the merger instead, the people added. Despite United Technologies having been offered a premium for its shares, the deal was seen by the company as ""dead in the water"" with U.S. antitrust officials due to overlapping business in the commercial aerospace and military markets, the people added. United Technologies grew skeptical of the deal's prospects with antitrust regulators after reviewing it more closely over the course of the last year, one source close to the company said.United Technologies, which like many multinationals has been hurt by a strong dollar, unveiled a $1.5-billion restructuring plan to cut costs in December, citing slowing growth in China and weakness in Latin America and Europe.Honeywell, which counts Boeing and  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) among its customers, has cut jobs and sold or merged businesses to reduce costs.Both companies have been under pressure by Boeing and Airbus to reduce their costs, and both have also seen defense orders squeezed in recent years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

993,"Feb 19, 2016 04:50PM ET",Canada likely to aid struggling Bombardier: government sources,nan,"By David LjunggrenOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will likely offer up to $1 billion in aid to ailing plane maker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), according to senior government sources, though some in the ruling Liberal Party want to see the company make tough concessions around control.The federal government is under enormous pressure from the province of Quebec, which last year invested $1 billion in the firm's CSeries passenger jet for a nearly 50 percent stake in the project.Bombardier acts as the center of the aerospace industry in Quebec. Although the CSeries is billions of dollars over budget and years late, not helping the firm would cost the Liberals support there.""It is very, very likely the government will step in but the details still need to worked out,"" said one person with knowledge of the file.Bombardier wants the federal government to follow the example of Quebec and take a stake in the CSeries, though it is not clear how big.In public, federal cabinet ministers have stressed the importance of the aerospace sector, with Treasury Board Minister Scott Brison saying on Friday the Liberals would continue to invest in the industry.But sources say Ottawa is concerned about Bombardiers's dual class share structure, which gives the Bombardier-Beaudoin family a roughly 54 percent voting stake.Amid vocal criticism of Bombardier's management some Liberals have suggested the company could dilute or even scrap the dual class structure, thereby making it more accountable to investors. Bombardier has hitherto rejected this idea and there is no guarantee the firm would change its mind under pressure from Ottawa, setting up a potential standoff.""The Quebec government got a bad deal with its investment in the CSeries,"" said one senior Liberal, citing the lack of concessions it obtained.Quebec's 40-strong Liberal caucus has privately told the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that it is vitally important the aerospace sector be protected, according to two party sources, one of which said he knew the government would back Bombardier.But Liberals are also cautious about a backlash elsewhere.The right-leaning Canadian Taxpayers Federation says Bombardier and De Havilland - which Bombardier bought in 1992 - have already received more than C$2.2 billion ($1.60 billion) in government loans and contributions since 1966, adjusted for inflation.Another potential challenge is the energy-producing western province of Saskatchewan, hard hit by slumping crude prices, and already unhappy with Quebec over its resistance to a pipeline that would take oil from the west to the Atlantic.Bombardier on Wednesday announced it would cut its workforce by 7,000, including 2,830 positions in Canada.""If the federal government is considering a $1 billion bailout to address 2,830 Canadian job losses at Bombardier, what about the tens of thousands of job losses in Canada's energy sector?"" Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said in a Facebook (O:FB) post.The risk of exacerbating long-standing tensions between the West and Quebec means Ottawa needs to show it wrung concessions from Bombardier, said a Liberal legislator from outside Quebec.""In negotiations like these both sides make compromises, they offer something up. What is Brad Wall going to say if he sees we handed over the money and didn't get very much in return?"" said the legislator.Whether or not to aid Bombardier is formally a decision for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains. Bains and other ministers hailed Air Canada's announcement this week that it is looking at buying up to 75 CSeries jets.Despite the breakthrough, orders for the CSeries trail far behind those for similar-sized airliners produced by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR).($1 = 1.3767 Canadian dollars)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It recently spent $500,000 for high-speed punching equipment that can stamp complex metal cutouts used in housings for cockpit display screens, said President Greg Konkol.""We're dragging our feet on two more investments,"" worth about $1.3 million, Konkol said. ""We know we have to ramp up, but we're being conservative about investing too much and getting overextended.""The situation is similar at Tech Manufacturing, a maker of milled wing and airframe pieces that supplies Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier (TO:BBDb), Embraer (SA:EMBR3), Lockheed Martin's (N:LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and business jet makers.""We're taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" said Frank Kimball, senior vice president of sales at the company, located in Wright City, Missouri.Tech Manufacturing bought three new machines in the last five years, he said, but now is ""looking very carefully at investing."" Executives have priced other new equipment they want, he said. ""But it depends on some of these bids coming in.""The comments, made in interviews during a supplier conference in Seattle last week, reflect growing caution among the thousands of companies that produce parts for plane makers.Boeing and Airbus continue to forecast strong growth, and say they are fully committed to ambitious plans to increase production sharply through the end of the decade.Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg dismissed investor concerns about a cyclical downturn on Wednesday, noting large backlogs of orders are enough to keep factories running for many years without selling another plane.""This is fundamentally different than anything you have seen in history,"" Muilenburg said at an investor conference. ""We're not seeing any cyclical behavior. This is a strong long-term growth market.""Passenger traffic is rising more than 6 percent annually, above its historic 5 percent average, Muilenburg noted, adding that Boeing plans to deliver more than 900 jetliners a year by the end of the decade, up from 762 last year.But increasingly, suppliers are voicing concern that the high rates of production won't last. They fear that a weakening global economy, particularly in China and other emerging markets, will undercut growth. ""It causes us to play things a little tighter to the chest,"" said Konkol. His company now wants new equipment to pay back costs in one to two years, down from two to five years. Not all suppliers are being so cagey. Some say the lackluster growth forecasts and fears about falling sales of new fuel-efficient planes due to low oil prices are just temporary.""We all know oil's going to go up,"" said Rick Taylor, a vice president at ALTEK Manufacturing, a parts maker in Liberty Lake, Washington. ""And if oil goes up, you're right back into new aircraft demand,"" he added. ""This is just a snapshot in time.""But automation companies also report caution among some suppliers. ""They're trying to plan, but they don't want to get too far ahead,"" said Tim Shumate, a vice president at Ascent Aerospace, an automation and tooling supplier based in Santa Ana, California. ""Nobody would. You don't want to make an investment and have it sit idle."" Mark Irby, senior account manager at KUKA Systems' aerospace group, which supplies automation to Boeing, said his company is bidding for work on the 737, but it's diversified in autos and other sectors, protecting it against a downturn.But many smaller parts makers are especially worried about production targets Airbus and Boeing have set for their A320 and 737 assembly lines, rising to 60 and 57 a month in 2019, respectively, said Brian Murphy, an aerospace-focused investment banker at Meridian Capital in Seattle.""Very few I know are taking steps today to meet the 2018 or 2019 rates,"" Murphy said.

The company said on Wednesday that it signed a letter of intent to sell  Air Canada  (TO:AC) 45 CSeries jets, with an option for 30 more. The order, worth as much as $3.8 billion based on the list price, is the first for the CSeries since September 2014.The Quebec government, which gave Bombardier a $1 billion lifeline last year, said it would drop a lawsuit against Air Canada. In return, the airline agreed to conduct maintenance on CSeries jets in the province. The Canadian government said it was still in talks with Bombardier on its request for federal aid. The country's transport minister said Ottawa had put no pressure on Air Canada to buy jets from the planemaker.Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare said the company still wanted federal assistance for the CSeries, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns.""We are hoping the federal government would come very close to what Quebec did,"" Bellemare said on a conference call. ""Quebec came with a very good structure where they have equity ownership, and we've been benefiting significantly from that."" Shares of Bombardier, which also benefited from news of a planned reverse stock split, were up 19 percent at C$1.07 in midday trading after rising as high as C$1.17.""Despite the non-firm agreement, we believe this order could represent a strong commitment for the long-term viability of the C Series,"" Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier said in a note to clients. On a call with analysts, Bellemare said Air Canada's order was a strong endorsement for the line of jets, which faces fierce competition from Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 and Airbus' Group's (PA:AIR) A320 series. Bombardier now has 678 total orders and commitments for the CSeries, including 243 firm orders.JOB CUTS Despite the boost from the Air Canada order, the company said it was continuing with its restructuring and planned to slash its workforce by about 7,000 over the next two years.Bombardier, which has about 64,000 employees, expects to record $250 million to $300 million in restructuring charges in 2016 for the layoffs. The job cuts will be mainly in the company's aerostructures and engineering services and transportation divisions in Canada and Europe.At the same time, Bombardier will ramp up hiring to support production of the CSeries and its new Global 7000 business jets.The company forecast 2016 revenue of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion, below analysts' expectations of $18.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Bombardier's net loss narrowed to $677 million, or 31 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $1.6 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Bombardier broke even, but analysts were expecting a profit of 2 cents per share. Bombardier, which received recent cash infusions from pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as well as the Quebec government, said it expected free cash flow usage of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion this year.The company also confirmed Reuters' report of a reverse stock split to prop up its sagging share price, which had been below C$1 since late January, its lowest in 25 years.Bombardier will determine the ratio for the reverse stock split later, but it said it was targeting an initial post-consolidation price of C$10 to C$20 per class A or Class B subordinate voting share.(Addition report by Euan Rocha in Toronto and Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

997,"Feb 15, 2016 06:21PM ET",Pratt & Whitney head says jet engine output risks easing,nan,"By Tim HepherSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney's new chief says the performance of suppliers is much better than year ago, easing concerns over its ability to execute a $10 billion gamble on a new engine as it seeks to reclaim a once revered status in the jet industry.But the industry veteran said he knew how to find out whether the company's make-or-break production goals for the latest short-haul airplane engine are under strain.""I will get every engine serial number and will see the parts that are committed and if it supports the engine shipment date,"" Robert Leduc told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow.Speaking after opening a high-tech fan-blade plant in Singapore, Leduc also played down concerns over aircraft demand, saying the company had seen no deferrals or cancellations.Once dominant in commercial aviation, Pratt lost its way in the 1990s after betting on the wrong category of plane and leaving the door open to  General Electric  (N:GE) and its French partner  Safran  (PA:SAF), who now lead sales by volume.It is seeking to regain its position with a fuel efficient engine for jets including the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo as well as Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and the latest model of Embraer.Developed at a cost of $10 billion, the Geared Turbofan engines claim to burn 15 percent less fuel and have already influenced the way some future jet engines are designed.Pratt has sold 7,000 of them and triggered other engine and plane developments. But analysts warn the company still has much to prove as it attempts to increase production seven-fold in the next four years.When the previous president stepped down earlier than expected last month after steering through development, the boss of parent United Technologies (N:UTX) named retired operations expert Leduc to take on the crucial early production phase.It was the second time the no-nonsense 59-year-old had been pulled out of retirement.Returning to Pratt & Whitney's Connecticut offices on Jan. 14, Leduc paid tribute to the advanced design, but told senior staff: ""Now we've got to execute and deliver to our customers. Our reputation depends on it,"" according to a person present.It plans to make 200 Geared Turbofans this year, roughly doubling in 2017. That number will grow close to 1,400 by 2020.GE-Safran venture CFM International also has aggressive output plans, but benefits from an existing supply chain.FIST FIGHTS OVERBoth engine makers are at the forefront of a record output drive that has triggered concerns over the ability of weaker suppliers to keep up.Any slip-ups could affect profit across the sector and Pratt must additionally demonstrate it can execute on an all-new civil project for the first time in years.""I have spent an inordinate amount of time on this in the last four weeks; it was probably my number one priority, digging into the industrial schedule,"" Leduc said.With $22 billion of long-term supply agreements, or 85 percent of its needs now in place, confidence in suppliers has risen in the past year, Leduc said. That allows Pratt to focus most effort on the engines where needed.""We weren't managing that way last year,"" Leduc said.""I think every engine was a fist fight; we didn't have the fidelity around the (supplier) commitments. Now the design is stable; once (that happens) you give your operations a fighting chance to deliver.""Even so, some glitches need to be resolved.The Airbus A320neo missed an end-2015 target for first delivery after it emerged the engines needed longer than usual to start properly, adding precious minutes to turnaround times.A part was redesigned and will be followed by a software fix in 3-4 weeks. But the problem is an example of the slim margin for error in the cut-throat short-haul airline market.Most modern jet engines need 150-180 seconds to start up. Pratt's new engines currently need closer to 350 seconds. By June the goal is to get this to 200 seconds, and by end-year back to normal, a person familiar with the repair plan said.The engines have also faced a problem with sophisticated control software sending erroneous messages to the cockpit, adding extra workload before the plane can take off.Engineers aim to eliminate 65 percent of the rogue messages by April and the rest by June. They are not related to aircraft systems and don't present any safety risk, Leduc said.He said there had been no schedule delays since he took the job last month. Industry sources have cited previous delays and say Airbus is renegotiating some deliveries. Both firms say output will be skewed towards the second half.""I have got a fair amount of confidence in what is going to happen. I think we have got enough fidelity around our plants now and our investment and our supplier commitments that we are confident that we are going to make this ramp-up,"" Leduc said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing, he added, was in a “good spot” and had not had requests for deferrals from any of its other customers.“Most of our customers have been ordering 25, 30, 40 aircraft at a time and then replacing them every three to four years,” said Keskar, who added that the steady growth plans help these airlines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""And I'm sure that the planning departments of all these airlines are now studying their orders in the context of what the market is telling them.""Tyler said turbulence in financial markets had impacted global premium traffic.He said that while the overall Chinese economy had slowed down, air travel in the country remained robust as the country seeks to shift its economy away from capital investment and towards consumer spending. ""We are seeing still reasonably strong traffic within and into and out of China,"" he said.In December, IATA forecast that low oil prices and healthy demand for travel would boost global airline profits again in 2016.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

For now, airline traffic continues to grow rapidly, spurred by continued growth in Asian household incomes, while airline profits also benefit from low oil prices.But as aerospace industry shares fall in step with tumbling global markets, analysts increasingly question the durability of an aerospace expansion cycle now in an unprecedented eighth year.After a lackluster show in Dubai in November, the industry's expo bandwagon rolls into the crucial Southeast Asian region without the carnival atmosphere of previous years. ""All the thoughts that this is no longer a cyclical industry have disappeared. We are due for a down-cycle,"" said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group.""(But) I don't think there will be any impact in the next 18-24 months.

Some carriers, including Philippine Airlines, are expected to acquire new aircraft this week.But rather than counting up new orders, analysts say investors' main concern this week will be to check for signs of waning travel or jetliner demand and whether an overloaded supply chain is in danger of breaking as manufacturers work to turn a record backlog of orders into a smooth flow of deliveries.""We will be keeping a close eye on traffic this year to see if we can detect emerging signs of weakness,"" said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at UK-based Flightglobal Ascend.Doubts over economic conditions have not stopped Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) pursuing a battle of wits over new designs.Airbus, anxious to close the gap between its new 369-seat A350-1000 and the 406-seat Boeing 777X, is seeking an influential champion such as Singapore Airlines for a potential bigger version of its A350 series, industry sources said.Boeing has said it will decide soon on a potential new ""mid-market"" jet with about 240 seats to retrieve lost market share for relatively small jets - a project that could lead to a small twin-aisle jet with an unusual, oval-shaped cross-section.Industry experts will scour comments out of Singapore from both manufacturers for clues to what products they intend to launch ahead of July's premier aviation event at Farnborough, southwest of London, coinciding with Boeing's centenary.Defense remains at the forefront of the Singapore show, amid growing tensions over Chinese maritime and territorial claims that compete with those of several Southeast Asian nations.A number of regional states are looking into ways to beef up their fighter fleets and to boost their intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance capability.Intense competition to provide maritime surveillance equipment may also characterize the event, along with a significant presence of Western and Asian unmanned aircraft.At a pre-show gathering on Monday, airline executives will debate the economy, threats to airliner safety from drones, and efforts to cut jet emissions after the Paris climate summit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1002,"Feb 11, 2016 01:17PM ET","Boeing shares drop on accounting fears, competitive threats",nan,"By Alwyn Scott(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares plunged 11 percent on Thursday, hit by a report that regulators are probing the company's accounting and by mounting concerns about its slowing sales and production.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Boeing properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of two of its biggest jetliners, the 747 and 787, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. On Wednesday, Boeing said that competitive pressures from rival Airbus (PA:AIR) were prompting it to cut middle-management and executive ranks at its commercial airplane unit to reduce costs.The twin issues, at a time when Boeing's order book is bursting, show the deep financial hole that the 787 has dug for the world's biggest plane maker. The high-tech jet has racked up more than $30 billion in deferred production costs that Boeing has not yet charged against its income statement.Last month, Boeing announced an $885 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter to write off some of the deferred costs of the 747-8. Boeing has sold only two of the jumbo jets in the last two years and had acknowledged in SEC filings that sales would not be sufficient to recoup the deferred costs.On Wednesday, Boeing warned in its annual earnings statement that it might face about $9.7 billion in charges for the 787 and 747 programs, if it cannot sell more of both aircraft. While the 787 continues to log new orders, the 747 has garnered only two net sales in the last two years, prompting Boeing to take the fourth-quarter charge.""If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record additional reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results,"" Boeing's filing said.Boeing's shares were at $104.63, down $11.73 in midday trading.The company declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. ""We typically do not comment on media inquiries of this nature,"" a spokesman said.Boeing has long used an unusual accounting method, known as program accounting, that allows it to defer the costs of producing jetliners and spread them over a large block of airplanes.The so-called deferred production cost balance on the 787 Dreamliner now tops $30 billion, including tooling and other one-time charges. But because the aircraft continues to attract sales, Boeing has said it does not need to take an accounting charge to write off any of that total. ""It is perhaps the eye-watering size of this 787 deferred balance that has drawn the SEC's interest,"" RBC analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a research note on Thursday. The SEC probe, if confirmed, ""is not good news,"" he added, and would compound what is already a tough year for Boeing as it cuts output to bring out a new 737 model. ""A big adjustment to Boeing's accounting would probably not have a cash impact,"" he added, ""but we think it would not be positive for investors' sentiment."" Boeing said the 787 had accumulated $32.4 billion in deferred production costs, including tooling and other one-time charges. It expected only $23.7 billion of that total to be recovered from jets it has currently sold, and the remaining $8.7 billion to come from future sales.On the 747, Boeing said it still had $1.3 billion in deferred production costs and tooling expenses, even after taking the fourth-quarter charge of $885 million. The company said it expected $342 million to be recovered from planes that it has already sold, and $977 million to be recovered from future orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1003,"Feb 10, 2016 07:19PM ET",Boeing says to cut commercial airplane jobs to reduce costs,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it would cut jobs at its commercial airplane unit, addressing intense pressure to reduce costs and compete with Airbus (PA:AIR) even as the industry booms.Boeing and Airbus are turning out planes at record rates, and plan to boost output in coming years as they work through backlogged orders that stretch out seven or eight years.But last year Airbus won 57 percent of new orders booked by the two airplane makers. Boeing's operating profit margin also narrowed to 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter, from 9.3 percent a year earlier. Factors included the high cost of producing its state-of-the-art 787 Dreamliner and a charge it took to account for slowing sales of its 747 jumbo.""To win in the market, fund our growth and operate as a healthy business, we are taking thoughtful steps to reduce the cost of designing and building our airplanes, part of which involves evaluating our employment levels across all of commercial airplanes,"" Boeing said after its Airplanes chief, Ray Conner, announced the move in an employee webcast.""We will start reducing employment levels beginning with executives and managers first."" Conner also said Boeing may decide this year about developing an aircraft to fill a gap between its biggest 737 and the smallest 787 Dreamliner to compete with Airbus in that segment of the market.Boeing did not set a time frame for job cuts and said the number ""will depend on how effectively we bring down costs as a whole."" Once based in Seattle, Boeing has already cut about 4,000 jobs in Washington state and has come under fire there after receiving a major package of tax incentives in 2013 linked to job growth.Washington state granted Boeing tax breaks in exchange for the company's decision to put a new aircraft program, the 777X, in the Seattle area to ""maintain and grow"" aerospace employment.Washington state remains the center of Boeing's commercial airplane operations, and employment has tended to rise when production booms. But this time, Boeing is producing record numbers of planes with fewer workers than in the past. Employment has fallen as the company sent work to other states and countries, reorganized engineering talent around the world and stepped up automation and lean manufacturing.Boeing stock fell 1.2 percent to $116.36 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But industry experts considered the move unusual because the Pratt-engine version of the A321neo is due is to enter service before the version with CFM engines.Airbus said there's no change in plans for delivery, with the Pratt-equipped A321neo still expected to reach customers at the end of 2016, and the CFM-equipped version in early 2017.Pratt & Whitney noted that its Geared Turbofan is already carrying passengers on the smaller Airbus A320neo aircraft, the first version of which was delivered to Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) last month.

""Not only are we confident today, but we are confident in the future,"" he added, noting that CFM is undertaking the largest testing program in its history and working closely with suppliers to ensure stable production and cost controls.His comments come after problems developed with the Geared Turbofan engine made by rival Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (N:UTX) The Pratt engine, which competes with the LEAP, developed a glitch that requires a longer than normal restart procedure under some circumstances.Pratt has said it expects the problem, which requires a three-minute cooling procedure before the engine can be restarted, to be fixed this month. CFM officials said on Friday the LEAP restarts consistently in 50 seconds per engine.The Pratt issue delayed delivery of the first A320neo by several weeks. Pratt and Airbus said on Friday they are in talks with customers about A320neo delivery schedules. Pratt's engine is available on the Airbus A320neo but not the 737 MAX.CFM said it expects to build more than 140 LEAP engines and about 1,700 CFM56 engines this year.

Poland's previous centrist government, beaten by the euroskeptic Law and Justice (PiS) party in elections last October, agreed a provisional deal with Airbus for 50 EC-725 Caracal multi-purpose helicopters.That meant turning down offers from Sikorsky (N:LMT) in the United States and AgustaWestland (MI:SIFI) in Italy. The contract, negotiated by the economy ministry, has yet to be signed and PiS has repeatedly said it would rather see the deal awarded to a producer manufacturing locally. Both Sikorsky and AgustaWestland have facilities in Poland.As well as boosting Poland's defense industry, buying Sikorsky helicopters could further strengthen Warsaw's ties with Washington, already its closest ally, and could help secure U.S. backing for Poland's demands of more NATO presence on the alliance's eastern flank.Airbus has proposed a so-called ""offset program"" that would source work on its helicopters in Poland, but Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski has described that as ""leftovers"" and said those aircraft would mostly be built in France. The French defense ministry has now agreed Poland will only buy ""several"" helicopters from Airbus, Rzeczpospolita reported, citing an unnamed source in the Polish defense ministry.At the same time, Poland has begun negotiations with Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky, manufacturer of the locally-produced Black Hawk helicopters that could be purchased by the Polish army as soon as this year, the daily said.Earlier this year, a Polish deputy defense minister said that the deal with Airbus was ""very likely"" to be scrapped.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1007,"Feb 03, 2016 06:21PM ET",Flight control: China banks pilot jet leasing firms in chase for $228 billion market,nan,"By Siva Govindasamy and Anshuman DagaSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Fresh from taking on the world in financial services, China's cashed-up banks are targeting a bigger slice of the surging global aviation market, beefing up affiliates bent on supplying planes to airlines around the planet. Chinese lenders have grown big in traditional business like investment banking and brokerage, flush with Beijing backing and cheap funding. Now institutions are investing in operators that specialize in jet leasing, a newer financial service that was once the exclusive preserve of Western players.Bank of China Ltd's <601988.SS> BOC Aviation Pte arm is set to go public this year with an estimated $3 billion listing, the industry's biggest. Four Chinese lessors - including BOC Aviation - are among the world's top 15 by fleet value in a $228 billion industry, according to consultancy Flightglobal.Western firms like AerCap Holdings NV (N:AER) and GE Capital Aviation Services LLC still dominate a sector that underpins aviation - some 40 percent of carriers' aircraft are leased to avoid the fixed costs of owning planes. But China, through its banks, is aiming to create its own global champions.""The political drive is there for China to be part of the global economy,"" said Johnny Lau, who ran the aircraft leasing arms of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) <601398.SS> and China Minsheng Banking Corp <600016.SS> before starting his own consultancy.Against a backdrop of oil prices falling to 12-year lows, at least temporarily reducing aircraft operating costs and boosting carriers' profitability hopes, the drive is already under way.GROWING PAINS?Though industry insiders say some of China's newer leasing operations may face growing pains in securing specialist expertise, Singapore-based BOC Aviation is different. Now China's biggest lessor, and the world's sixth-biggest, with a fleet valued at more than $10 billion, BOC Aviation was founded in 1993 and bought by Bank of China in 2006 from investors including Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL). For China's banks, keen to grow abroad, the lure is in part predictable, dollar-denominated revenue streams. Airplane lessors are basically financing operations: planes are bought from aircraft makers like  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus Group (PA:AIR) in bulk and rented out to airlines - from full-service carriers to budget operators - keen to keep fleets flexible.""It is an enviable position,"" said consultant Lau. ""When (Chinese lessors) issue a bond backed by their parents with the bank's guarantee, there is no problem finding investors."" Apart from Bank of China, units of ICBC and China Development Bank Corp are among the top 15 leasing firms in the world. Their clients stretch across the global industry: BOC Aviation, which declined to comment for this article, leases jets to full-service Gulf carrier Emirates Airline and U.S. low-cost operator Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), among others.Ambitious leasing subsidiaries of China Construction Bank Corp <601939.SS> and Bank of Communications Co <601398.SS> are among those ramping up after placing multi-billion dollar orders for Airbus and Boeing aircraft. BOC AVIATION - MODEL OF SUCCESSIt's not all plain sailing. The Chinese lessors can be hampered by a lack of management talent, experience and industry connections - ties which can smooth over everything from marketing a plane once a lease comes to an end, to lessening the impact of a client airline's bankruptcy.""The technical expertise in terms of the aircraft, how to actually manage it when it comes to the end of the lease term is very, very important because that impacts the return,"" said Clarence Leung, asset finance & leasing director at PwC.BOC Aviation provides an example of the opposite.Chief executive Robert Martin, on board since 1998, has been credited with bridging differences between a Singapore-based team of experienced international leasing executives and a Chinese banking giant, creating a business known for a focus on profitability, not size.While the lessor has ordered more than 170 Airbus and Boeing aircraft worth over $18 billion at list prices over the last 18 months alone, almost all are narrow-body jets like the Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s. These account for 70 percent of its overall portfolio - as they are used by more operators and therefore easier to place.The company's good record has also helped it to win lucrative, highly-competitive deals such as a contract to supply 20 A320s to Singapore Airlines' Indian subsidiary Vistara.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Air Force One is one of the most visible symbols of the United States.The Air Force plans to modify the contract in coming years as the Air Force One program moves into the engineering and design phase, and later, into production.The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs, which are nearing the end of their planned 30-year life.In January, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable.The Air Force decision was widely expected since the only other suitable four-engine jet is the A380 built by Airbus (PA:AIR) in Toulouse, France.The 747-8 is the only four-engine commercial jet Boeing makes, providing an extra margin of flight safety over the more standard twin-engine planes.Boeing last week said it would cut production of the 747-8 in half in September and take a $569 million charge in the fourth quarter as it faces dwindling sales.The four-engine jet is now mostly a cargo workhorse, eclipsed by more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets for passengers.The double-decker plane entered service in 1970, undergoing a major overhaul in 2012, with new engines and a longer fuselage.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing has sold 3,072 of the planes and is racing to sell more as it battles for market share against rival Airbus's (PA:AIR) competing A320neo, which earlier this month was delivered to its first customer, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).Boeing is expected to deliver its first 737 MAX to customers in 2017. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) is scheduled to be the first airline to add the 737 MAX to its fleet. The first flight of the plane, which is filled with test equipment, was expected to last about 2 1/2 hours. Tracking web sites showed the aircraft cruising west over the Olympic Peninsula, the western part of Washington State.Boeing surprised analysts on Wednesday when it said the company would slightly reduce output of current-generation 737s this year to allow the factory to build the 737 MAX. Boeing stock tumbled 8.9 percent that day, its biggest daily decline since October 2001, to close at $116.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.Many analysts later said Boeing shares are likely to recover because the company's outlook for cash flow remains strong, as does its commitment to share buybacks and dividends.On Friday, the stock was trading up 1.6 percent at $119.60.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) are set to build an extension for Tehran airport, while  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), another building firm, is lined up to design, build and operate new terminals for the Mashhad and Ispahan airports.French oil company Total said it would buy some 200,000 barrels of Iranian crude from the OPEC producer. There were also deals in shipping, health, agriculture and water provision, all signed despite continued diplomatic tensions.DEALS UNFINISHED, BANKS WARYThe Airbus deal alone is worth $27 billion at list prices and French government sources put a 15 billion euro ($16 billion) overall tag on the agreements.But most have yet to be finalised or are subject to conditions. Senior French bankers have expressed wariness.Iran's industry minister Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said an agreement between French export-credit group  Coface  (PA:COFA) and the Iranian central bank signed this week was an important step in the right direction.But he said French banks must support a corporate push into post-sanctions Iran. ""If they don't get active, there will be no increase in business,"" he warned. For Peugeot, the Iranian factory tie up is critical. When it suspended sales in Iran in 2012 it lost nearly 10 percent of global deliveries and interrupted a relationship dating back more than 50 years.Under Thursday's deal, set to be finalised in the middle of this year, Peugeot and Iran Khodro plan to modernize a factory near Tehran and be producing cars by mid 2017.They target an initial 200,000 vehicles a year making Peugeot 208, 2008 and 301 models with a Peugeot investment of 400 million euros ($436 million) over five years.Away from the signing ceremonies and speeches, an estimated 3,000 people marched through Paris seeking to raise awareness about human rights. A protestor from the Femen womens' activist group dangled in a mock hanging from a bridge with an Iranian flag painted across her naked chest.Human Rights Watch criticized Iran on the death penalty and abuse of rights of women and minorities.

1011,"Jan 26, 2016 05:30AM ET",Hurdles remain as Iran seeks aviation investment,nan,"By Tim HepherTEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran courted Western aviation firms this week with a blueprint of regulatory reforms aimed at setting aside 40 years of sanctions and rebuilding its airways with new jets.But despite talk of a major plane order from Airbus (PA:AIR), a raft of legal, financial and regulatory hurdles remain as Iran seeks foreign investor backing for plans to overhaul its dilapidated aviation sector.""We are seeing massive opportunities in Iran,"" said Peter Harbison, chairman of the Centre for Aviation (CAPA), an Australian consultancy, adding that Tehran needed funding, organization and manpower to do everything its airlines intend.""Without each of those ingredients, the growth is going to be much less than optimal,"" he said after chairing a major Tehran aviation conference.A shopping list for over $20 billion of Airbus jets carried to Europe by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week is seen as a test case for post-sanctions trade because of the sums involved and state-of-the-art financing used in the jet market.Although Boeing (N:BA) jets are not involved, completing the Airbus deal depends on the approval of the U.S. Treasury, which must approve sales to Iran of jets with over 10 percent U.S. parts.Even then, Iran must work out how to pay for the jets, delegates at the Iran Aviation Summit organized by CAPA said.Iran on Monday urged Washington to remove any lingering obstacles to implementation of the accord under which sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear activities.""I expect a very short process. Actually we expect them to expedite all these efforts to .. open the way for legal business cooperation between Iranian and foreign entities,"" deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters at the CAPA event.Washington has said Iran may still not use its financial system, raising potential difficulties for jet deals denominated in dollars. If Iran pays for its planes in euros, any money subsequently converted into dollars may create problems.A senior Iranian official said Tehran was in touch with the U.S. Treasury to clarify the status of such transactions. U.S. officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Iran meanwhile faces warnings that Western banks may hold off from backing aircraft and other deals until rules are clear.""I think we need much more clarity on what (the U.S. Treasury) is going to authorize or not,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB Bank.In a further twist, Iranair remains locked out of a dedicated global financial system for air tickets because it is based on laws of Canada, which has not lifted sanctions on Iran.""To have Western banks effectively financing directly aircraft to Iranian airlines is going to be a tough call. This isn't going to happen in the next 18 months,"" Grabowski said.However, he said some banks may be more willing to support the activities of leasing companies working in Iran.POSITIVE SIGNALAircraft leasing companies, who control about 40 percent of the world's fleet, eagerly touted for business at the Tehran event, joined by suppliers from 35 nations offering Iran badly needed wares from avionics to airports.""We are behind, we admit that,"" Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said.""Therefore we have decided to ... look for the solutions and try to find proper responses to any questions"" on funding.Kashan said Iran was looking at joining the 2006 Cape Town Convention, a treaty of more than 60 nations designed to boost trade by protecting aircraft owners in return for cheaper financing.""That is a very positive signal for me,"" said Dick Forsberg, head of strategy at Dublin-based leasing company Avolon, while warning investors Iran would not be a ""gold rush"".Privately, some foreign delegates said doing business in Iran was still a complex puzzle, further obscured by upcoming elections.President Rouhani, a pragmatist, has been trying to attract technology and investment to bolster Iran's shattered economy. But some analysts say political in-fighting, and the possibility of fresh sanctions if Iran violates the deal, worry investors.Allies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on state matters, have already begun to criticize new oil contracts that are also designed to attract investors.While Iranian officials gave assurances that they would respect foreign investors' ownership rights, some delegates at the aviation conference saw potential sticking points over Iran's attitude to collateral on some transactions.Britain's export credit agency said last week it was open to doing business in Iran, boosting the prospect of aircraft sales. But such agencies typically demand security on the jet even if the buyer is government controlled and can put up a state guarantee to pay money owed.That may be a problem for Iran, which regards its sovereign-backed guarantees as word enough and is reluctant to offer collateral on the asset as well, delegates said.Grabowski said Iran had reassured investors but ""they need to deliver, and this is where it is going to be difficult"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1015,"Jan 18, 2016 10:20AM ET","IAG says its A380 options too expensive, looking to lease second hand",nan,"By Conor Humphries and Victoria BryanDUBLIN (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) is holding talks on leasing additional A380s second hand because it believes the options it has to buy more of the Airbus superjumbo are too expensive, its chief executive said on Monday.The move is part of a strategy of increasing the proportion of leased aircraft International Airlines Group (IAG) has within its fleet, Willie Walsh told the Airline Economics aircraft finance conference in Dublin. ""We have options on A380s ... but we are not going to exercise them because they are too expensive,"" he said. ""We see the option of leasing them second hand as an attractive opportunity."" Walsh said IAG was also interested in leasing or buying more second-hand Boeing (N:BA) 777-300ERs.""We see going forward probably a greater mix of leased in the fleet than we've traditionally had,"" he said. Leasing has traditionally been seen as an expensive option by large established carriers, which can often secure large discounts on new plane orders.But airlines are increasingly looking to lessors to quickly add and subtract capacity at short notice to match market demand, experts told the conference.""The adversity to off-balance sheet leasing from the mega carriers of the world is gone forever. Leasing is here to stay,"" Steven Udvar-Hazy of Air Lease Corporation (N:AL) said in response to Walsh's comments. Walsh said IAG was looking at adding another five or six A380s to the British Airways fleet, but that the jet could also be suitable for Spain-based group airline Iberia.He said the plane was successful for British Airways on routes where demand was high but it didn't necessarily need to operate frequent flights, thus freeing up a slot at London's overcrowded Heathrow airport.He said there was a limit to IAG's appetite due to the inflexibility of the aircraft, which he said suited relatively few routes. The 544-seat A380 has been a slow seller for manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) and is untested on the second-hand market. The first leased A380 aircraft are set to return to the market in 2017 and Malaysia Airlines is also looking to offload some A380s as it restructures. ""There's no time frame, it will depend on when aircraft become available, we're not in an immediate hurry,"" Walsh told journalists on the sidelines of the conference, adding IAG had already held talks with lessors.The A380s would not be a replacement for the 747s British Airways currently operates. Walsh said the low oil price meant the carrier was not going to accelerate retirement of the jet. Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) last week retired its final 747s.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Pratt also supplies F135 engines to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program operated by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), and is preparing to increase production.Adams had been head of Pratt for two years and had spent 17 years at the company. His departure, timed for late February, will allow overlap with Leduc. Leduc was named president of UTC's Sikorsky helicopter unit last April, coming out of retirement to take the job. UTC sold Sikorsky to Lockheed in November.A UTC spokesman said the change in leadership was not related to recent cooling problems with geared turbofan engines that delayed delivery of the first Airbus A320neo, slated for December. UTC has said it expects to have a fix in place next month.UTC said Adams was key in building Pratt's product line, and the geared turbofan, F135 and PW800 engines have produced Pratt's largest engine backlog in decades.""Under Paul's leadership, Pratt & Whitney positioned itself for a bright future,"" UTC Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1019,"Dec 15, 2015 10:20AM ET",Virgin America to lease 10 new Airbus A321neo aircraft,nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - Virgin America Inc said on Tuesday it will lease 10 Airbus A321neo planes starting in 2017, a move that could let the low-cost airline add flights from coast to coast in the mainland United States and to Hawaii.In an interview, Virgin America Chief Executive David Cush said the deliveries, slated for early 2017 through the third quarter of 2018, will increase the carrier's available seats by about 20 percent.The single-aisle planes, the largest yet to enter Virgin America's fleet, will be leased from GE Capital Aviation Services, the aviation leasing arm of  General Electric  (N:GE) Co. GE Capital Aviation Services had the planes on order from Airbus Group (PA:AIR) SE prior to Tuesday's announcement.Cush said the 185-seat aircraft will help Virgin America fly more travelers from the U.S. West Coast to slot-constrained airports such as New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The planes also could fly between Los Angeles and Hawaii, he said.He said he expects U.S. airfares to bottom out in the beginning of 2016.The U.S. airline industry has experienced steep declines this year in unit revenue, or sales relative to flight capacity, as carriers added seats to undercut rivals and to take advantage of lower fuel costs, which has made it cheaper to operate flights. ""Seat supply will start to moderate after the first quarter,"" Cush said of U.S. airlines' domestic service.However, Cush added, ""It is not my expectation that unit revenue will return to 2014 levels yet.""Virgin America earlier had indicated its interest in the A321 aircraft, noting it intended to expand its capacity by about 10 percent per year.The airline, based in Burlingame, California, currently operates more than 50 smaller A320 and A319 planes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1020,"Dec 10, 2015 05:20PM ET",Aircraft orders slow as cycle peaks; potential for production impact seen,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) - A decline in aircraft orders this year shows the order cycle is peaking after five years of torrid growth, industry experts said on Thursday, raising speculation that  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) may be forced to scale back higher production rates planned for coming years.""Orders have a history of very high peaks and very low troughs,"" said Edmund Greenslet, an independent analyst who publishes the Airline Monitor. After big surges, ""orders drop very quickly.""With three weeks left in 2015, Boeing Co and Airbus have booked 1,582 orders, a decline from 2,888 in 2014. Boeing Co (N:BA) booked 11 new jetliner orders worth about $1.1 billion at list prices on Thursday, leaving it about 180 short of its 2015 target of 755-760 planes. Airbus has booked 1,007 net orders this year, versus 575 for Boeing, giving it 64 percent of orders. Boeing is likely to deliver far more airplanes than Airbus in 2015.The slowdown itself is not a surprise. Because Boeing and Airbus have eight to 10 years of backlog, planes ordered today won't be delivered until 2023 or later, said John Plueger, president of  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL). ""There's not a whole lot left really to sell,"" he said. Slow sales in the next few years is ""a normal reaction.""But some see rising risk of a production excess. ""I can see signs of a glut emerging,"" said Adam Pilarski, an analyst at consulting firm Avitas, that could mean order cancellations.The biggest concern is over single-aisle planes. Airbus and Boeing each produce 42 of these planes a month. Airbus recently said it will lift that to 60 in 2019 and sources said Boeing is discussing when to follow. Failure to match the higher rate would leave Boeing with fewer production slots to sell.Sales have been stoked by new models. Airbus' single-aisle A320neo is due out by the end of the year, with the first going to Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG). Boeing this week rolled out its new 737 MAX, which is due to enter service in 2017.The risk of order cancellations is growing as the global economy cools, particularly in China, Russia and Brazil, Pilarski said. Boeing's orders in the latest week included 10 of its 737 planes for Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) and one 767 for FedEx Corp (N:FDX). Four orders for 737 jetliners were canceled. That's a risk for suppliers. ""When the consequences of these cuts in production come, they come fast,"" Greenslet said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That compares with 575 net orders for Boeing as of Thursday.With its total topping 1,000, Airbus appeared almost certain to win the annual order race.

Conversions have been a frequent cause of 737NG cancellations this year and do not reduce the order book as outright cancellations do.

1022,"Dec 07, 2015 12:11PM ET","Airbus eyes 2015 win over Boeing as orders hit 1,000",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) orders topped 1,000 aircraft between January and November, sending its shares higher as it looked all but certain to win its annual race against U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) . Boeing, however, remained in comfortable shape to retain its title as the world's largest jetliner producer as Europe's Airbus continued to lag on deliveries. Shares in Airbus Group rose 2.8 percent, while Boeing edged 0.4 percent higher. Airbus said on Monday that it had sold 169 aircraft in November, bringing the gross 2015 total to 1,079. After cancellations and model conversions, the net figure was 1,007. That compares with Boeing's 655 gross orders between Jan. 1 and Dec. 2, giving it 568 after cancellations. Airbus handed over 556 aircraft in the first 11 months, including 10 mid-sized A350s and 24 A380 superjumbos. Boeing remained ahead on 709 deliveries over the same period, but with some work left to meet its target of selling as many planes as it delivers this year. Boeing has a target of 750 to 755 deliveries in 2015. Sales chief John Wojick said last month that it aimed to finish the year ""close to"" a book-to-bill ratio of 1, the threshold at which a manufacturer sells as many units as it produces. Despite the share bounce, analysts said the latest data brought few surprises after a quiet Dubai Airshow last month. But it highlighted Airbus's stronger position for now in the widely watched race for orders of upgraded medium-haul jets, potentially casting a shadow over Monday's first public appearance of Boeing's 737 MAX. Boeing has sold 2,955 of the revamped jets but has failed so far to catch up with the A320neo, a similar model also equipped with new engines and due to enter service this month. Airbus has won 4,443 orders for jets in the A320neo family, giving it 60 percent of the market for this category of fuel-saving jets. Challenging the traditional duopoly for planes with seating for 150 to 200 passengers, Airbus has said it aims to keep a 60 percent market share, though Boeing has argued that its backlog is more robust.""The MAX started a year late relative to the neo, so there is a catch-up phase. It is very hard to catch up all of it at one time,"" Jeff Knittel, president of lessor CIT Transportation (N:CIT), who has ordered both types, said in a recent interview.Boeing plans to deliver the 737 MAX in the third quarter of 2017. Airbus, meanwhile, confirmed that TAP Portugal had canceled 12 orders for the next-generation A350 and replaced them with 14 revamped A330s following an ownership change at the airline.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1023,"Dec 01, 2015 04:55PM ET","Indonesia says faulty part, crew action factors in AirAsia crash",nan,"By Kanupriya Kapoor and Fergus JensenJAKARTA (Reuters) - Problems with a glitch-prone rudder component and the way pilots tried to respond were major factors in the crash of an Indonesian AirAsia (KL:AIRA) jet last year that killed all 162 on board, investigators said on Tuesday.The Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 crashed into the Java Sea on Dec. 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya to Singapore.In their first public report, Indonesian investigators did not pinpoint a single underlying reason why flight QZ8501 disappeared from radar, but laid out a sequence involving the faulty component, maintenance and crew actions.""There was a chain of events, starting with a broken (part), how it was handled and then after it was handled what the consequences were and how the pilot handled it. It's difficult for me to say what the main cause was,"" National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) investigator Nurcahyo Utomo said.Bad weather did not play a role.The crash was part of a string of aviation disasters in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, whose rapid air travel growth has led to overcrowded airports and stirred safety concerns. The NTSC said a system controlling rudder movement had cracked soldering that had malfunctioned repeatedly, including four times during the flight and 23 times over the previous year. The problem had generated maintenance reports.Officials said black box data suggested crew had ""likely"" shut off power to the computer that controls the rudder system by pulling circuit breakers, after three normal resets using push buttons failed to remove error messages.That is not usually done during flight but the captain may have been influenced to try after witnessing ground crew do it on the same plane three days earlier, the report said.To do so he would have had to leave his seat, it said, adding weight to the theory that the captain was not at the controls when the plane began to lose control, although officials said this could not be proved for certain.In February, the NTSC said there was no evidence for a Reuters report that the captain had left his seat.Investigators said on Tuesday they had asked Indonesia AirAsia and Airbus to take steps to prevent pilots ""improvising"" fixes to problems. It also said an Airbus manual on when to reset computers was ""potentially ambiguous"".""The thing we recommend is to please provide some procedure to prevent the pilots from improvising. Today maybe they improvise by pulling the circuit breaker, tomorrow they may do something else,"" said Utomo.With power to the vital computer now out, the rest of a detailed timeline laid out by the NTSC focused primarily on the performance of the crew, which needed to fly the jet manually.That is because the disabled computer was needed for the aircraft's automatic stall protection and autopilot to work.""Subsequent flight crew action resulted in inability to control the aircraft,"" the NTSC said in a statement.'PULL DOWN'Flown by the French co-pilot, the plane reared higher and entered a stall, a state in which it loses lift. The captain shouted ""Pull Down,"" a command investigators called ""confusing"" as a clearer order to point the nose lower and stop stalling would be ""Push Down"" or ""Push Forward"".But he did not take back control as a senior pilot seated at the controls is required to do in such an emergency.During this time, the rebooted computer was coming back to life and waiting for new instructions.""The computer was back on but it wasn't functioning to control (the aircraft). If they'd wanted it to control again there's a button that must be pushed. If your Blackberry (TO:BB) dies, you pull out the battery. When it comes back on you have to enter your PIN,"" Utomo said.The plane reached an altitude of 38,500 feet before falling at up to 20,000 feet per minute. There were ""about five minutes"" from the time it stalled to the moment of impact. Reuters reported in January that investigators were examining maintenance records of a flight computer and how the crew responded to any technical fault.The report is not intended to attribute blame and cannot be used in court but could influence pending lawsuits by families and test relations between Airbus and its top Asian customer.UK lawyer James Healy-Pratt said the report indicated problems with both the aircraft and pilot training.AirAsia said it had already upgraded pilot training and enhanced safety standards following the crash.""There is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer and the aviation industry,"" founder Tony Fernandes tweeted.Airbus (PA:AIR) declined detailed comment.""Airbus has just received the final accident report. We are now carefully studying its content,"" a spokesman said by email.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Islamic State militants fighting Egyptian security forces in Sinai said they brought it down.""The indications and analysis so far of the sound on the black box indicate it was a bomb,"" said the Egyptian investigation team member, who asked not to be named due to sensitivities. ""We are 90 percent sure it was a bomb.""His comments reflect a much greater degree of certainty about the cause of the crash than the investigation committee has so far declared in public. Lead investigator Ayman al-Muqaddam announced on Saturday that the plane appeared to have broken up in mid-air while it was being flown on auto-pilot, and that a noise had been heard in the last second of the cockpit recording. But he said it was too soon to draw conclusions about why the plane crashed.Confirmation that militants brought down the airliner could have a devastating impact on Egypt's lucrative tourist industry, which has suffered from years of political turmoil and was hit last week when Russia, Turkey and several European countries suspended flights to Sharm al-Sheikh and other destinations.It could also mark a new strategy by the hardline Islamic State group which holds large parts of Syria and Iraq. Asked to explain the remaining 10 percent margin of doubt, the investigator declined to elaborate, but Muqaddam cited other possibilities on Saturday including a fuel explosion, metal fatigue in the plane or lithium batteries overheating.He said debris was scattered over a 13-km (8-mile) area ""which is consistent with an in-flight break-up"".""GAME CHANGER"" ""What happened in Sharm al-Sheikh last week, and to a lesser extent with the ... (Germanwings) aircraft, are game changers for our industry,"" Emirates Airlines President Tim Clark said, referring to the crash of a Germanwings airliner in the French Alps in March, believed crashed deliberately by its co-pilot.""They have to be addressed at industry level because no doubt the countries -- U.S., Europe -- I would think will make some fairly stringent, draconian demands on the way aviation works with security,"" he said at the Dubai Airshow. Clark said he had ordered a security review but was not suspending any flights as a result of the disaster. Emirates does not operate regular flights to Sharm al-Sheikh.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond also said the incident could lead to changes in flight security. ""If this turns out to be a device planted by an ISIL operative or by somebody inspired by ISIL, then clearly we will have to look again at the level of security we expect to see in airports in areas where ISIL is active,"" Hammond told the BBC.Islamic State, which wants to establish a caliphate in the Middle East, is also called ISIS or ISIL.Islamic State militants fighting security forces in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula have said they brought down the aircraft as revenge for Russian air strikes against Islamist fighters in Syria. They said they would eventually tell the world how they carried out the attack.If the group was responsible, it would have carried out one of the highest profile killings since al Qaeda flew passenger planes into New York's World Trade Center in September 2001.Russia has returned 11,000 of its tourists from Egypt in the last 24 hours, RIA news agency said on Sunday, a fraction of the 80,000 Russians who were stranded by the Kremlin's decision on Friday to halt all flights to Egypt.In St Petersburg, where the flight was headed on Oct. 31, the bell of St Isaac's Cathedral rang 224 times and a service was held in memory of the victims.Russia has sent specialists to conduct a safety audit of Egypt's airports and to provide recommendations on additional measures, Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister, was quoted as saying by Russian agencies.Dvorkovich, the head of a government group created on Friday to deal with suspended flights to Egypt, added a second group was going to Egypt on Sunday and a third would be sent later.Britain, which has 3,000 nationals waiting to return home, has sent a team of 70 people, including 10 aviation specialists working at Sharm al-Sheikh airport to make sure security measures are being followed. Eight flights were expected to take British tourists back home on Sunday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There is a potential if the market is there and we are assessing that.""He declined to say when Boeing expected a decision, but added: ""We have the capability to do more and we do see pressure upwards.""Sales chief John Wojick said Boeing would only raise 737 output on the basis of orders from ""strong creditworthy"" airlines, an apparent attempt to defuse Airbus's lead over Boeing in the latest order cycle for such jets.Boeing supporters have questioned the quality of Airbus's order backlog for the A320neo, compared with the competing 737 MAX, saying it relies too heavily on unproven airlines. Airbus insists its order pipeline is robust.Wojick said he doubted that Boeing would decide to increase 737 output by 20 percent in one fell swoop."
1027,"Nov 06, 2015 10:08AM ET",Crash forensics to determine whether bomb downed Russian jet,nan,"By Tim HepherDUBAI (Reuters) - With world powers divided over the cause of a Russian jetliner crash, much rests on forensic teams as they scour a sandy trail of wreckage almost a week after 224 people died in Egypt's worst air disaster.Britain said on Thursday it believed Islamic State may have downed the jet, but Egypt said there was no evidence of a bomb and Russia said it was too early to draw conclusions.That puts the onus on Egyptian-led investigators to prove or disprove the theory, with only scattered evidence and Egypt's tourist economy at stake.Clues that might reveal whether the plane was deliberately brought down are flung across 10 miles of desert or potentially concealed in the dying microseconds of cockpit recordings.With at least one of the black boxes reported to be damaged, and cockpit sensors likely to be silenced by any blast, the main focus will be on understanding the wreckage as well as any evidence gleaned from bodies of the mainly Russian victims.To tackle their task an international team including Russia, France and Ireland is likely to draw on lessons from one of the bloodiest 12 months in aviation over a quarter of a century ago.In December 1988, 270 people were killed when a bomb brought down Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.In September the following year, a DC-10 flown by French airline UTA blew up over the Sahara en route from the Chadian capital N'djamena to Paris, killing all 170 on board.In both cases, investigators concluded that a device may have been smuggled aboard but drew a blank from 'black box' recorders whose power supply was severed by the explosions.Investigators relied on debris, bags and clothes as well as chemical analysis to find the subtle imprints of an explosion, according to the report and people involved in the two probes.""A first indication comes from distribution of the wreckage and then you look for potential reasons, and one would have to be a device on the aircraft,"" a former investigator said.""You are looking for traces of high-energy explosion, such as burns or scorching and penetration of material into bodies or the aircraft,"" he said.""Close to the device itself you might get traces of gas washing over the surface.""SCATTERED EVIDENCEA UK report on the Lockerbie disaster said the bomb sent a double shockwave and supersonic shrapnel and gases through the Boeing (N:BA) 747, contributing to the plane's disintegration.One of the earliest clues in that probe was evidence of fine ""cratering and pitting"" in the aircraft, which speeded up the criminal investigation, a person involved in the probe said.Investigators in Egypt and Russia, where most bodies are now located, will be looking for lacerated clothing, deformed baggage and burn marks in places otherwise free of fire damage, indicating fire before the A321 plunged into the ground.Russia has however started to bury some of the victims. Forensic experts say detailed examination of bodies would be vital in detecting evidence of any attack.In harsh conditions such as the Sinai peninsula where the Airbus A321 broke up and fell, evidence can be fragile and end up scattered well beyond the main crash site.In the UTA disaster, a team including 60 soldiers faced a 50-mile trail of tiny fragments, 10 times the size of the main wreckage field, according to an official French report.They also had to cope with desert winds and move quickly to make sure vital evidence was found. Their breakthrough came when soldiers combing through 60 square km of Sahara found parts containing traces of explosion.As with the recent Dutch probe into the downing of a Malaysian jet over Ukraine, investigators may reconstruct the recovered debris on a specially constructed frame.That can help pinpoint an explosion's source by examining the impact of shockwaves and debris on the fuselage. Engines may be examined for shrapnel and even paint smears if a suspected blast is thought to have happened near the front of the plane. Doubts meanwhile remain over what evidence the black boxes will supply. Egyptian officials said the voice recorder was damaged and previous disasters suggest the separate flight data recorder would have seen its power cut and produced little of value.But science may help fill in some of the blanks.On the UTA jetliner, as well as a TWA jet whose fuel tank blew up over the Atlantic in 1996, cockpit tapes ended immediately after the blast but still yielded vital clues thanks to a procedure called ""spectrum analysis"".Scientists use such methods to examine the signature of any sounds picked up in the last microseconds of normal flight.That helped investigators of the UTA disaster to identify a revealing sound: not of the blast itself but of the airframe transmitting shockwaves like a tuning fork.Investigators may be able to compare any usable fragment of audio to the frequencies produced by those previous explosions to try to assess whether they are looking at evidence of a bomb.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1028,"Nov 05, 2015 05:49AM ET",Britain says Islamic State likely brought down Russian plane,nan,"By Paul SandleLONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday there was a significant possibility that Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate was behind a suspected bomb attack on a Russian airliner that killed 224 people in the Sinai Peninsula.Asked if he thought Islamic State militants were responsible for the disaster, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""ISIL-Sinai have claimed responsibility for bringing down the Russian aircraft, they did that straight away after the crash. ""We've looked at the whole information picture, including that claim, but of course lots of other bits of information as well, and concluded that there is a significant possibility,"" he said on Sky television.U.S. and European security sources say evidence now suggests that a bomb planted by Islamic State's Egypt affiliate - Sinai Province - was the likely cause of the crash. The sources stressed they had reached no final conclusions about the crash.Islamic State, which wants to create a caliphate across the Muslim world, is also called ISIS and ISIL. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched air raids against opposition groups in Syria including Islamic State on Sept. 30. The hardline group has called for war against both Russia and the United States in response to their air strikes in Syria. Britain has decided to stop flights from Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh resort to gain more time to assess security in the town, where the Russian plane started its ill-fated journey.BLOODY CAMPAIGNIslamic State, which also has a presence in Egypt's neighbor Libya, is waging a bloody campaign of suicide bombings and shootings in Egypt designed to topple the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.The Egyptian leader is currently on a state visit to Britain, which like other Western powers sees Cairo as critical to efforts to counter militancy.A senior Russian lawmaker said Britain's decision to stop flights from Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh resort, where the flight originated, was motivated by London's opposition to Russia's actions in Syria, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.""There is geopolitical opposition to the actions of Russia in Syria,"" said Konstantin Kosachev, a senior member of Russia's upper house of parliament, when asked about Britain's decision.If a bomb killed the 224 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus A321 (PA:AIR), that would almost certainly undermine Egypt's tourism industry, which is still recovering from years of political turmoil.A Russian aviation official said the investigation was looking into the possibility of an object stowed on board causing the disaster. Islamic State, which controls swathes of Iraq and Syria and is battling the Egyptian army in the Sinai Peninsula, said again on Wednesday that it brought down the airplane, adding it would eventually tell the world how it carried out the attack. Egypt, a close ally of the United States and the most populous Arab country, dismissed a similar claim of responsibility for the crash by Islamic State on Saturday.TOURISM WORRIES Caution among Egypt officials in assessing the cause of the crash has not eased anxiety among tourism companies that handle visitors to Egypt's ancient sites and Red Sea resorts.Shares on Thomas Cook (L:TCG) opened down 2.1 percent as the United Kingdom canceled flights to Egypt, which depends heavily on tourism to generate hard currency. Sisi has described Islamist militancy as an existential threat to the Arab world and the West and has repeatedly called for greater international efforts to combat the militants. Britain said it was working with airlines and Egyptian authorities to put in place additional security and screening measures to allow Britons in Sharm el-Sheikh to get home, but that would take time and there would be no flights returning from the resort on Thursday.Late on Wednesday, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA)directed all Irish airlines on Wednesday not to fly to or from the Sinai Peninsula until further notice. The Russian-operated plane was registered in Ireland and the IAA is taking part in the official investigation into the crash. Security experts and investigators have said the plane is unlikely to have been struck from the outside and Sinai-based militants are not believed to possess the technology to shoot down a jet from a cruising altitude above 30,000 feet. Sinai Province has killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police since Sisi, as army chief, toppled Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. Sisi was elected president last year on promises he would stabilise Egypt and rebuild its shattered economy. Critics sayhis tough crackdown on Islamists will only create more radicals in Egypt, which has fought militants for decades.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1029,"Nov 04, 2015 04:45AM ET",Fed faces patchwork recovery despite near-normal labor markets ,nan,"By Howard SchneiderALEXANDER CITY, Ala (Reuters) - As gleaming new factories turn out Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft and Hyundai (KS:005380) cars in Alabama's urban centers, this small town that once was home to Russell Athletics shows the dilemma now faced by U.S. policymakers.Economic recovery has spread wide, with 34 states reaching new employment highs this year and thousands of counties now close to unemployment rates of the boom years earlier this decade, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data. The U.S. Federal Reserve has played a central role in engineering that recovery and has become progressively less worried about the nation's job market, interpreting the slowdown in payrolls' growth as a sign of near-full employment.But Russell's abandoned headquarters in Alexander City stands as a reminder of forces the Fed's massive easy money campaign is ill-equipped to confront. What is needed now is more akin to hand-to-hand combat, state and local officials say. What Alexander City could use, for example, is a $4 million rail spur to connect its industrial parks with the nearby rail line, or more state help in paying the grading and utility connection costs to entice would-be investors, says former mayor Don McClellan. Or perhaps, he suggests, programs to boost the community college's retraining of mid-career workers among thousands who lost jobs as Russell's operations wound down for good after a 2006 takeover by Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa).""It is much harder to recruit here,"" says McClellan, now regional development chief.""When the state lands white collar jobs, it is in the metro areas."" As 2016 presidential candidates from billionaire Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders square off over the economy, the debate is not just about the number of jobs. The contenders and Fed officials alike also fret about sluggish wage growth, low productivity and the quality of positions being created.Yet Fed officials, who discuss whether to raise rates for the first time in a decade, recognize that for all their power they may lack the tools to address such concerns.""An interest rate hike is not going to affect job training in Macon County, Georgia,"" said David Wiczer, an economist at the St. Louis Fed who studies labor market issues.HEALING SCARS AND DARK SPOTS U.S. state and county statistics show the spread of recovery, allaying some of the fears about permanent scars from the crisis. But they also show some persistent spots of high unemployment.Among more than 800 large counties surveyed annually by the U.S. Census, nearly 700 had by last year virtually returned to 2007 unemployment rates - a group that has most likely grown given a steady climb in payrolls this year. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/1Wm3hcB)Some states, however, continue to struggle, whether with legacies of uneven development and racial segregation, or longer-term changes in the U.S. and global economies. Alabama and nine other states , accounting for just over 16 percent of national economic output both have yet to return to pre-crisis employment levels and have above-average unemployment rates.(Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/1Wm32y7)In West Virginia, coal mine closures have weighed on employment for more than three decades; in Illinois and Pennsylvania the decline of heavy manufacturing has left its mark. In Alabama, the loss of textile jobs has swelled unemployment rolls, while jobless rates in a dozen or so heavily African American ""Black Belt"" counties remain in the teens. As of September, the state had about 57,000 fewer jobs than in 2007, a 3 percent shortfall. Its labor force is down too and its adult population growing slower than the country as a whole. Alexander City is a case in point. That this town of less than 15,000 ended up with an 85,000 square foot (7,900 square meter)Fortune 500 headquarters, with an atrium waterfall and apartments for visiting executives, was an accident of history. What later became Russell Athletics began as a small sewing operation that rose to national prominence making team-branded sports jerseys. The company began shifting jobs overseas in the late 1990s and closed its headquarters in 2010, leaving only a token presence.""When Russell started downsizing. ..we did not have big brother to take care of us anymore,"" says McClellan. To fill that void one needs well-targeted investments that would not just create jobs in the near-term, but improve productivity in the long run, local officials say.Yet, unlike the Fed, which used its virtually unlimited firepower to churn out trillions of dollars in monetary stimulus, local, state and federal governments lack such leeway.Political battles over the nation's debt ceiling hamper federal spending while local authorities face hard budget constraints.A budget shortfall made Alabama dip into its education fund this year to pay other expenses, while financial summaries show the state's $1.3 billion transportation budget consumed mostly with maintaining existing roads and bridges.That leaves small-bore initiatives, such as $11.5 million in training, small business support, investment incentives and other projects announced last month for the ""Black Belt"" counties.Further to the north, in Alexander City, McClellan said the region was expanding community college programs to retrain older workers, and has recruited auto parts suppliers for the Hyundai plant in Montgomery and a Kia Motors Corp. (KS:000270) factory just across the Georgia state line. Spencer Lucker, spokesman for the Delta Regional Authority, a small federal rural development agency for the Mississippi Delta region, says Alabama's problems are typical - with pockets of high unemployment where most new jobs are created by small business start-ups.""It is a general pattern across most of our states,"" Lucker says. ""What we have been focused on, is building out pockets of entrepreneurship (and) it is a slow process.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1030,"Oct 30, 2015 07:40PM ET",Boeing likely to match Airbus on single-aisle output: source,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is likely to broadly match European rival Airbus SA (PA:AIR) in notching up production of single-aisle aircraft to 60 a month, but the timing of Boeing's move remains uncertain, according to a person familiar with the situation.Airbus said on Friday it would lift monthly output of its top-selling A320 to 60 in mid-2019, a 20 percent jump over its prior target of 50, and a move seen pressuring Boeing to match with its competing 737 jetliner.Boeing is talking with suppliers about how soon they could keep up with 60 a month for the 737, the source said, having already determined the higher rate is feasible.""That's where the discussion is,"" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. Boeing declined to comment.Boeing and Airbus are leapfrogging each others' plans to lift output of single-aisle planes as they work through backlogs that stretch out eight to 10 years. Rising production gives suppliers more work and shortens the time airlines have to wait for new aircraft. The move also ""could stoke concerns over narrow-body oversupply, especially if Boeing matches,"" RBC analyst Robert Stallard said in a note. Last week, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts that the company sees scope to lift rates beyond the current 52-a-month target. ""However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes,"" he cautioned, referring to determining return on investment of any production shift.Both plane makers produce 42 single-aisles a month now. Boeing has said it plans to hit 52 a month in 2018.In June, engine makers voiced concern about the ability of suppliers to keep up with rising output. But those worries have eased in recent months, and regulators appear poised to certify the engines and as airworthy this year, two sources said.Airbus builds A320s in France, Germany and China, and recently opened a factory in Mobile, Alabama, that is due to deliver its first plane to JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) in the first quarter of 2016. Boeing has retooled its 737 plant in Renton, Washington, to create a third assembly line; each is capable of producing 21 planes a month, giving Boeing potential to go to 62 a month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1031,"Oct 30, 2015 08:14AM ET",World stocks on course for best month in four years,nan,"By Jamie McGeeverLONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose on Friday and were on course for their best month in four years, as global central banks kept stimulus policies intact and many hinted at further steps to re-energize their economies.That has helped soothe concern over higher borrowing costs in the United States as the Federal Reserve prepares to tighten rates, possibly by the end of the year.The dollar slipped for a second day, notably against the yen after the Bank of Japan left policy unchanged. Government bond yields also slipped back after two days of Fed-fueled increases.European stocks got an early boost from corporate earnings, with results from France's  Renault  (PA:RENA),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Airbus (PA:AIR) in particular getting the thumbs up from investors. The pan-European index of leading 300 shares was last down 0.3 percent on the day at 1,480 points (FTEU3), Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) were down 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) was down 0.2 percent.U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street, which is poised for its best monthly performance in four years. (N) (ESc1)Despite having slipped into red by midday the FTSEurofirst index (FTEU3) was set for its best monthly performance since mid-2009, rising around 8 percent in October.""Continued expectation of easier central bank policy has helped underpin equity markets after a turbulent few months,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.""Investors are veering between confidence that the U.S. economy is still performing well enough to withstand a rate rise, to an expectation that if it's not, the Fed will remain on hold,"" he said.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was down 0.1 percent but poised to gain more than 7 percent for October, its best showing since January 2012.MSCI's leading global equity index (MIWD00000PUS) was up 0.15 percent on Friday, bringing its monthly gain up to around 8 percent, its biggest since October 2011.Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) ended up 0.8 percent, its highest in more than two months, buoyed by a media report that the government is considering a supplementary budget of over $25 billion. EURO ZONE NOFLATION The BOJ's decision to keep monetary policy steady was in line with most expectations, but some investors had speculated the central bank would deliver some additional steps to support Japan's economy. The BOJ also trimmed its price and growth forecasts on Friday, and many still expect it to eventually deliver more easing.U.S. data released overnight showed gross domestic product in July-September increased at a 1.5 percent annual rate. That was just shy of the consensus forecast for 1.6 percent growth and slowing from a 3.9 percent rise in the second quarter. But solid consumer spending kept alive the possibility that the Fed could deliver an interest rate increase in December.Although the Fed held policy steady on Wednesday, it left the door open to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 when it meets Dec. 15-16.In currencies, the dollar fell against the yen after the BOJ policy decision, slipping to an intraday low of 120.29, and was last down about 0.6 percent at 120.45 yen . The euro also regained ground from the dollar, rising 0.3 percent to $1.1005  after euro zone inflation edged up to 0 percent in October from -0.1 percent the month before.""Absent any negative commodity price shock going forward, September likely marked a trough for headline inflation,"" JP Morgan's Raphael Brun-Aguerre wrote in a note to clients.The euro is still down about 1.5 percent for the month, after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi took a surprisingly dovish stance that suggested further monetary easing steps were possible in December.China's yuan chalked up its biggest daily rise against the dollar since its one-off revaluation in July 2005, after suspected intervention by the Chinese central bank through state banks. It rose around 0.6 percent, pushing the dollar down to 6.3172 yuan .Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also slipped back from this week's highs. The 10-year yield was down two basis points at 2.15 percent (US10YT=RR), having climbed 15 basis points on Wednesday and Thursday. The two-year yield was down a basis point at 0.72 percent (US2YT=RR).Crude oil futures clawed back earlier losses and were last in the black.

1033,"Oct 30, 2015 03:30AM ET",Exclusive: AirAsia founder began buyout talks as share fall put loans at risk - sources,nan,"By Saeed Azhar and Anshuman DagaSINGAPORE (Reuters) - AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes began talks with bankers to take Asia's No.1 budget airline private after a plunge in its stock price put $200 million worth of loans borrowed against AirAsia's shares at risk, people familiar with the situation told Reuters. The Malaysian entrepreneur and his business partner Kamarudin Meranun, respectively Group CEO and Chairman of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), borrowed the money against their 19 percent indirect holding in AirAsia from  Credit Suisse  (VX:CSGN) and CIMB (KL:CIMB) to help fund private ventures, people familiar with the situation said.A fall in AirAsia's share price though has led to a breach of the loans' collateral terms, according to two sources, and is one reason why the two businessmen have begun talks for a possible management-led buyout.Fernandes and Kamarudin did not reply to emails sent by Reuters or phone calls made to them. A Malaysia-based spokeswoman at AirAsia declined comment.The existence of the loans, which has not been publicly disclosed as the transaction is private, shows how the future of the airline, a key client of Airbus in Asia, is tied to the other investments of its founders.Two sources with knowledge of the situation said the loans were taken to help finance the 2011 purchase by Fernandes' holding company, Tune Group, of English soccer club Queens Park Rangers and to build up the Caterham Formula One team, two ventures which have subsequently struggled.Share-backed loans, common among Asian tycoons, require a large amount of collateral as they are subject to stock market volatility.It was not clear if Fernandes and his partners had been formally asked by the lenders to immediately provide more cash.There is no evidence Fernandes and Kamarudin, who have built a business empire with a value that exceeds the worth of the share-backed loans, would be unable to repay the money, although some of their wealth is tied up in sports and other private ventures. One source familiar with the situation said Fernandes would still be able to have a significant stake in AirAsia even after a privatization and continue to lead it. A Hong Kong-based spokesman at Credit Suisse declined to comment. A CIMB spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Fernandes and his businesses are also long-standing clients of Credit Suisse and CIMB, which are both involved in the privatisation talks, several sources said.SPORTS VENTURES Fernandes ceased funding the Caterham team last year and later sold it. The team eventually went into administration, while loss-making Queens Park Rangers were relegated from England's top league in May this year. In June, research firm GMT Research said AirAsia used transactions with its associate companies to inflate earnings and said it needed to be recapitalized, triggering a sell-off in the carrier's shares that by late August had shrunk the value of the founders' stake to around $100 million.AirAsia has responded by saying it has a strong balance sheet and does not need additional capital.The fall and its impact on the loans caused Fernandes to discuss a privatisation and restructuring plan of AirAsia, the airline he had built over 10 years from a two-plane operation into a billion-dollar business, two sources said.All sources interviewed by Reuters declined to be identified because the discussions are private.AirAsia's shares have partially regained ground since the summer. Its market value is currently about $1 billion. The privatisation plan, now under discussion, envisages Fernandes and his partner selling their AirAsia stake, held through holding company Tune, to a special purpose vehicle, to allow them to pay off the loans, said one of the sources.Sources say AirAsia has also been in talks with lessors, including cash-rich Chinese companies, to sell a stake in its leasing subsidiary. This comes as AirAsia has been selling portions of its related businesses, including half of its stake in a joint venture with online travel company  Expedia  Inc (O:EXPE).Fernandes, the face of the no-frills budget carrier's rise, has also built, through the Tune Group, a sprawling empire that includes a chain of budget hotels, an insurance firm, a mobile phone group and a school.GMT Research's June report came when AirAsia, already under pressure from slowing tourist flows in Asia, was facing challenges from the December 2014 crash of an Airbus Group (PA:AIR) jet operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate that killed 162 people.The report helped push the airline's shares to their lowest levels since 2008.Fernandes has steadfastly defended the company's finances and outlook and said the market was undervaluing AirAsia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1034,"Oct 30, 2015 12:30AM ET",Quebec's $1 billion lifeline to Bombardier a 'gamble on the unknown',nan,"By Allison Lampert and Kevin DoughertyMONTREAL/QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - Quebec's $1 billion bailout for aerospace company  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is meant to protect thousands of jobs in one of the province's top industries, but risks worsening the finances of Canada's most indebted province if it fails.The deal would give Quebec's Liberal-run government a 49.5 percent stake in Bombardier's troubled CSeries jet program, according to the announcement on Thursday, easing shareholder fears about the company's future but triggering an outcry from taxpayer advocates and opposition politicians.""This is what we call corporate welfare,"" said Aaron Wudrick, the federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, adding the deal could lead to long-term costs for Quebec taxpayers if it fails. The province, which has practically frozen money for social services and education as it tries to balance its budget in the current fiscal year, had a deficit of C$2.35 billion for the last year ended March 31. There is also public disenchantment following a wide-ranging corruption probe into the awarding of construction contracts. But the fortunes of Quebec's aerospace sector are closely tied to those of Bombardier, a household name in the province. Its 18,000-strong workforce in Quebec is largely aerospace-focused and its presence in the province helps support many smaller part vendors and suppliers in the region.The aerospace industry makes up about 10 percent of Quebec's export revenues, about 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product, and about 40,000 jobs that pay double the provincial average - making it an economic lynchpin.Bombardier is majority-owned by the Bombardier-Beaudoin family, which has traditionally had close connections with the political establishment in Quebec.""The decision to do nothing, it's something we couldn't even consider,"" Quebec Economy Minister Jacques Daoust told Reuters after announcing the deal. ""The day that Bombardier is in difficulty, the entire aerospace industry is in difficulty.""Quebec is pumping money into its financing arm Investissement Quebec to support the CSeries project, but is not making a broader investment in Bombardier which has a profitable rail unit. It is the biggest investment to date made by Investissement Quebec, which holds stakes in several other companies deemed critical to Quebec's economic development, such as the Stornoway diamond mine and the Alouette aluminum smelter.Bombardier's narrow-body CSeries line of jets, which is set to compete against Boeing (N:BA) Co's BA.N 737 planes and Airbus Group's (PA:AIR) A319 and A320 jets, has been delayed for years and is billions of dollars over budget. The struggle to get the CSeries project done and in the air has left Bombardier saddled with more than $9 billion in debt.The gamble faces further big risks as new orders for the CSeries jet have dried up in a soft market. Bombardier touted the fuel economy of the CSeries, which has a 20 percent fuel burn advantage over comparable planes, as a key selling point. But that advantage has been lessened by lower oil prices and competition from new generation planes built by Boeing and Airbus that have been outfitted with fuel efficient engines. In a bid to raise cash, Bombardier has been looking at a wide range of options, including the sale of a stake in the CSeries and the sale of a minority stake in its rail arm.AUTOS BAILOUTCredit analysts likened the Quebec deal to the $13.7 billion federal and provincial bailout of Canada's autos industry in Ontario during the financial crisis. ""If you look at what happened in Ontario, you would probably conclude that it did work out in that case,"" said Douglas Offerman, a senior director at Fitch Ratings. ""I think (the Quebec) deal speaks to the province's desire to ensure that it remains a center for aerospace.""""Doing something, or not doing something … both decisions in some respects are a gamble on the unknown,"" he said.DBRS Quebec debt analyst Travis Shaw said the investment was ""not unmanageable"" for the province but more information was required to gauge whether it could affect Quebec's plan to balance its budget.Daoust, who said the investment would not impact the province's budget, said Quebec's risk is limited to the $1 billion investment in the CSeries. He said it would generate returns if the program is a success, but lead to losses if it fails. ""It's a risky situation, but it's a two-way street,"" he said. ""We took it from the positive side."" Daoust said the province has no obligation to put in additional investment if Bombardier's expenses rise more than expected. Bombardier's CEO Alain Bellemaire said the issue of the company's dual class share structure - which has been criticized by investors and analysts - did not come up in its negotiations with Quebec on the CSeries.

1035,"Oct 29, 2015 03:20PM ET","Virgin America tops third-quarter estimates, expects unit revenue decline",nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) -  Virgin America Inc  (O:VA) on Thursday said lower fuel costs helped its profit jump in the third quarter, but forecast that the money it makes per mile would fall in the fourth quarter as it expands flight capacity amid intense competition.The Burlingame, California-based airline earned $71.9 million in the quarter, up 73 percent from a year earlier. Excluding special items, it earned $73 million, or $1.64 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $67 million, or $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.However, it said a key indicator of the business's long-term health would fall in the fourth quarter. It expects passenger unit revenue, which compares sales to capacity, will fall between 3 percent and 5 percent from a year ago.That is in part because Virgin America expects to add two single-aisle planes into service in the quarter, contributing to an uptick in capacity between 9.5 percent and 10.5 percent from a year earlier. Its fleet totaled 55 planes at the end of the third quarter.Capacity has also outpaced demand in some cities to which Virgin America flies, particularly Dallas, pushing down fares.Chief Executive David Cush said in an interview that plans by  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) to roll out cheap fares with more restrictions in 2016 could intensify competition.The result is passenger unit revenue guidance that's ""definitely worse"" than anticipated, said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel.The same measure fell 2.7 percent in the third quarter.More growth is in the airline's future.Chief Financial Officer Peter Hunt said in the same interview that Virgin America aims to expand capacity by around 10 percent per year. It is considering service to new cities such as Phoenix, Houston and Denver to attract business travelers.Cush said Virgin America is ""very interested"" in leasing several A321 planes made by Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR), which would be the largest in its fleet and would help it fly more customers to slot-constrained airports.Virgin America forecast unit costs excluding fuel, profit-sharing and special items will rise between 2 percent and 3 percent in the fourth quarter because of higher wages and benefits.In the third quarter, the airline's operating profit margin was 18.2 percent, up 5.3 points from a year ago, as the average price of its largest variable expense, fuel, fell 38.7 percent.Shares were up 0.2 percent at $35.23 in late Nasdaq trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1036,"Oct 29, 2015 01:43PM ET",Boeing lands international 787 orders worth $3.5 billion,nan,"SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) landed orders from two foreign carriers for its high-tech 787 Dreamliner on Thursday worth more than $3.5 billion at list prices.The deals with  El Al  Israel Airlines Ltd (TA:ELAL) and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) mean that 59 airlines and leasing companies have now ordered Boeing's latest jetliner. The orders came as rival Airbus (PA:AIR) on Thursday sold 100 of its single-aisle A320s and 30 of its widebody A330s to China. Qantas' commitment to the 787 had been in doubt after it canceled 35 orders for the stretched 787-9 model in 2012 amid financial losses. At the time, it kept 15 orders for smaller 787-8s for its Jetstar Airways subsidiary. In August the mainline Australian carrier said it intended to use 787-9s as it overhauled its international fleet. The Qantas order announced on Thursday includes five 787-9 Dreamliners worth $1.3 billion, and conversion of three 787-8s from Jetstar into 787-9s.El Al ordered nine 787s, including three firm orders for 787-9s. The order, valued at more than $2.2 billion, is the largest in the airline's history and keeps El Al an all-Boeing airline. El Al said it also intends to lease six more 787s as part of its plan to increase capacity.The models for the rest of El Al's order will be determined as the contracts are finalized, Boeing said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1039,"Oct 21, 2015 05:40PM ET","Exclusive: China-made regional jet set for delivery, but no U.S. certification",nan,"By Siva Govindasamy and Matthew MillerSINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's first domestically designed passenger jet will be delivered without U.S. certification, a potential dent to both the aircraft's international credibility and to joint safety efforts by Chinese and U.S. regulators.The Comac ARJ-21 regional jet, which can seat up to 90 passengers, received the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) type certification last December and will be delivered to launch customer Chengdu Airlines shortly, two people familiar with the plane's program told Reuters.The plane will fly without U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification despite a five-year effort to have the FAA endorse CAAC's certification procedures, the people said.An FAA type certificate would have boosted the reputation of the airplane's developer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) and cleared the way for the plane to be sold and operated globally - though expectations for foreign sales had been low. Without it, the aircraft can operate only in China and some Asian, African and South American countries that recognize the CAAC's certificate. Chengdu Airlines, a low-cost carrier, is expected to fly the plane on commercial domestic operations in the first quarter of 2016. Comac has received nearly 350 orders for the ARJ-21, mainly from Chinese airlines and leasing firms.SHADOWINGSince 2010, the FAA has undertaken a shadow certification process to assess the CAAC's ability to conduct a technical assessment of aircraft. But tensions arose between the two regulators last year over various technical and bureaucratic issues, before the process ended in early 2015, those familiar with the program said.People close to Comac believe the FAA also was dragging its feet in part because of bilateral political and economic considerations. ""While the CAAC wanted to learn from the FAA, they felt the Americans were too rigid and unnecessarily delaying things. And the longer the delay, the greater the embarrassment to the Chinese,"" said one of those individuals.However, a CAAC official responsible for certification and people close to the FAA stressed that the two regulators were still working to resolve outstanding issues as a ""top priority"".In an emailed response to Reuters for this article, the FAA said the ARJ-21 was never intended to be certificated by the FAA under the shadow evaluation process, and Comac planned a derivative model of the plane to comply with FAA standards.""The FAA enjoys a good working relationship with CAAC and we continue to work together to develop a path to work towards certification of the derivative model of the ARJ-21 and, possibly, the C919,"" the FAA said referring to a narrow-body jet China is developing to compete with the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 and Boeing (N:BA) 737 models.Also, the FAA said it could certify an airplane after it enters service if it can be shown to comply with all relevant airworthiness and manufacturing standards.AVIATION COOPERATIONPutting the ARJ-21 into service without FAA certification would be a setback to U.S. and China aviation cooperation, arguably one of the outstanding achievements since the two governments re-established diplomatic relations in 1979.Chinese airlines have bought hundreds of Boeing jets as the country's aviation sector opened up and boomed, and Boeing plans to open a completions and delivery centre in China for its 737 aircraft, its first plant outside the United States.U.S. aerospace firms have also invested heavily in China, and companies such as  General Electric  (N:GE), Rockwell Collins (N:COL), Honeywell (N:HON) and United Technologies (N:UTX) are suppliers for the ARJ-21 and C919 jet.""It could be seen as a loss of face for the Chinese given they deem FAA certification a key rite of passage for what will be the first domestically built jet to enter commercial service,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal, an industry news and data service.Comac could eventually ask the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to certify the ARJ-21 once it has been delivered, and ask it to help with the C919 as well, the people familiar with the program said.""Given the effort and prestige China is pouring into the C919, getting FAA or EASA certification is a definite requirement both for the image of the program and the ambition to garner foreign sales,"" said Waldron.""We don't know if and when the Chinese authority will apply to us for a certification,"" an EASA spokesman said.""LEARNING EXPERIENCE""China has been working for 40 years to produce and deliver a homegrown commercial airliner.It first developed the Y-10, a four-engined jet, in the 1970s but never delivered it to customers. It has exported some MA-60 turboprop planes, a civil version of the license-produced Soviet-designed Antonov AN-24 military transport.Comac plans to eventually upgrade the ARJ-21 so it's closer in performance to regional jets made by Embraer (SA:EMBR3), Mitsubishi Aircraft (T:8058) and Bombardier (TO:BBDb).The current version of the ARJ-21 and the program itself is a ""learning experience,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. ""Any airline forced to operate this jet will be at a severe competitive disadvantage against any airline with a modern aircraft.""That means China's hopes may rest on the C919.Comac aims to complete its flight test and certification program in less than half the time it took with the ARJ-21, say those familiar with the company's plans.""It has engaged foreign suppliers experienced in global aircraft programs with Airbus and Boeing much earlier, and they're far more involved in the C919,"" said one of those familiar with the program.""FAA or EASA certification would legitimize the program and create interesting new opportunities for China's aerospace sector. Such certification would be a watershed development,"" added Waldron at Flightglobal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1040,"Oct 20, 2015 12:10PM ET",Airbus taps Siemens executive to run defense business,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Georgina ProdhanPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has named  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) executive Dirk Hoke as the next head of its Defence and Space division, recruiting an industrial high-flyer with no previous aerospace experience to regenerate its second-largest division.Hoke, 46, will join Europe's largest aerospace group in January and progressively take over from Bernhard Gerwert, who is due to retire in mid-2016, Airbus said on Tuesday.The recruitment of the former  Renault  (PA:RENA) research engineer from his role as head of Siemens' Customer Services Division will reduce the average age of the 15-member Airbus Group executive committee, populated mainly by aerospace veterans in their late fifties or older, to below 55.He will learn the ropes during the first quarter of next year and take over from Gerwert on April 1, Airbus said, adding that Gerwert will continue to advise him until June at least.Hoke's appointment reflects efforts by Airbus CEO Tom Enders to reach beyond aerospace as it contends with competition from other high-tech companies and pressures to adapt to digital manufacturing techniques.Enders said Hoke is ""well equipped for a world and business environment that is ever more accelerating"" and noted his experience in project management and services.Speaking to Siemens investors in 2013, Hoke hailed a ""manufacturing renaissance"" but emphasized the importance of reducing lead times from concept to market -- a perennial headache for a defense industry that is plagued by costly delays.At Airbus he will face challenges including slow deliveries of the A400M military airlifter and questions over strategy for drones and the long-term future of the Eurofighter jet, which is also backed by BAE Systems (L:BAES) and  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI).He joins at a tough time for Europe's defense industry, which is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back military spending. The Munich-based Defence & Space division was recently combined and slimmed down under Gerwert to focus on warplanes, missiles, satellites and space rockets.It reported a loss on flat revenue in the first half but remains the group's second-largest division by sales and orders behind the commercial aircraft business. By recruiting from one of a handful of German groups famed for grooming the country's elite managers, analysts said that Enders appeared to have recognized the lack of a younger generation of German-born industrial leaders inside his group.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1042,"Oct 16, 2015 01:29AM ET",Bombardier running out of options as family resists pressure to reduce control ,nan,"By Allison Lampert, Andrea Shalal and Tim HepherMONTREAL/WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Bombardier (TO:BBDb) is running out of options as the Canadian aircraft maker seeks to raise the cash for the new jet that potentially would allow it to challenge the supremacy of Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) in global jetliner sales, according to several sources with knowledge of the situation.The sources said for Bombardier to persuade investors to provide more capital, the Bombardier-Beaudoin family will probably have to reduce its 53 percent voting control of a company which was founded by snowmobile inventor Joseph-Armand Bombardier in 1942 and moved into train and plane manufacturing through acquisitions made by his son-in-law Laurent Beaudoin.The company recently failed to get Airbus to take on much of the future cost of the new plane, the CSeries. Airbus pulled out of discussions to buy a controlling stake in the program last week after they were first reported by Reuters.Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau declined to comment on any specific discussions, saying that the company is ""exploring initiatives such as a potential participation in industry consolidation, but we will not discuss our activities in this regard or speculate on potential outcomes."" Development costs for the CSeries program have soared to $5.4 billion, from an earlier projection of $3.2 billion and Bombardier is likely to continue burning through cash for some years even after it is expected to go into service next year, according to analysts and aerospace industry executives.The family's deep ties in Quebec – it is at the heart of the French-Canadian province's political establishment – may not be as much help as it has been in the past. While Quebec's government has said it will support Bombardier and its 18,000-strong workforce in the province, the Quebec public pension plan Caisse de depot et placement has been unwilling to increase its stake in Bombardier, according to a source at Caisse with knowledge of discussions. The fund, whose mandate includes contributing to local economic development, owns around 2.2 pct of the manufacturer's class B shares and 1.8 pct of class A, making it a top five shareholder in both.Another source said the relationship between Caisse and Bombardier ""has been tense and confrontational"" after Caisse requested early this year that the family agree to reduce the power of its 85 percent stake in the super-voting ""A"" shares so that they only have six times the number of votes as the ""B"" shares rather than the current ten times. That would have reduced the family's voting stake to around 42 percent.The family rejected that and in response Caisse declined to serve as the lead investor for a C$3.35 billion (US$2.59 billion) debt and equity capital raising in February, said this source, who has direct knowledge of Bombardier's financial issues. ""They lack negotiating power,"" said the Caisse source in reference to both Bombardier and the controlling family. ""It's like you lend money to a friend who says everything's fine – only to come back a month later and ask for more money.""Caisse spokesman Maxime Chagnon said ""we have a longstanding relationship with Bombardier and it continues."" He declined to comment on any request for a change in Bombardier's voting structure. STRATEGY QUESTIONED Some other major shareholders are also far from convinced by Bombardier's plans. ""There's a lot of confusion. I don't see a clear strategy. By now they should have one. So it's very concerning,"" said a fund manager at another top shareholder, speaking on condition of anonymity.Bombardier's Rondeau said that the company has a ""very good"" relationship with Caisse. Asked about Caisse requesting a change in the voting structure, Rondeau said: ""You'll have to ask the Caisse about that."" Bombardier's Executive Chairman Pierre Beaudoin, who is the founder's grandson, declined to comment. The family's foundation, established by the founder's widow in 1965 to continue his charitable works, referred queries to the company. With Airbus out of the picture, a longer shot is that talks with a Chinese investor over the CSeries program can be revived and ushered through a Canadian foreign investment review. Discussions ended three to four weeks ago, one of the sources said, though it was unclear why. The source did not name the Chinese investor.Getting a deal approved that involves the transfer of aerospace technology to the Chinese will be complicated, but it may not be impossible to get support from the Canadian and the Quebec governments. Bombardier does plan to raise cash from its rail unit, with plans to list a minority stake in Frankfurt. This is its most valuable asset and is expected to be much more attractive to investors than the aircraft arm.The company had $3.1 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but faces additional costs of at least $1 billion to $2 billion to complete certification of the CSeries and cover early production losses in the first two to three years of delivery, according to  Credit Suisse  (VX:CSGN) aerospace analyst Rob Spingarn. The plane may not be profitable for four years or more, according to a source briefed on the company's current financial situation. The company's debt burden has increased to $9 billion and its share price has dropped 58 percent since the beginning of the year, valuing the entire company at just C$3.76 billion. ""LONG PUTT""The company was advised two years ago by Goldman Sachs (N:GS), its longtime investment bank, to cancel the program because ""continuing to fund the CSeries was a long putt,"" one person familiar with those discussions said. Bombardier's Rondeau denied that Goldman provided such advice.The new jet will target the 110-130 seat market, competing directly against the next generation Airbus A319neo and Boeing's 737 MAX family of jets. Until now, Bombardier's biggest jet has been the CRJ, the largest of which has 104 seats.Bombardier's Vice President of Business Acquisition, Ross Mitchell, emphasized the company's ""100 percent"" commitment to the jet in Berlin on Wednesday. While Bombardier has 243 firm orders for the jet, that is below its launch target of 300, according to company announcements, and it hasn't announced a new firm order in more than a year.At least one Bombardier CSeries customer, who has a firm order, plans to ask for a discount on options for additional aircraft. ""Looking at the contract we signed, is the option price the price you would negotiate today, or is there room for improvement there?"" said a top executive at the customer. Bombardier invited Airbus chiefs to see the plane at the Paris Airshow in June, in a standard industry courtesy. The chat was warm enough to encourage Bombardier officials to formally approach Airbus, said several sources familiar with the matter. Bombardier would have probably written off some of its development costs for the jet as part of any deal.Bombardier, though, got a mixed reaction at Airbus, with some executives at the European plane maker open to expanding its portfolio for a minimal outlay but others wary of diluting both profit margins and attention to other projects. ""The value for us wasn't clear enough,"" a source close to Airbus said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1043,"Oct 16, 2015 12:19AM ET",Delta CEO warning prompts questions about Boeing 777 production levels,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim HepherNEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - An airline's warning of a ""bubble"" in the market for used jetliners shows how vulnerable  Boeing Co  (N:BA) may be because of slowing sales of its widebody 777 jets, and fueled speculation that it may have to cut the plane's production rate.Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) CEO Richard Anderson said on Wednesday he expects prices for used twin-aisle jets to fall, and that the weakness will spread to single-aisle planes, presenting airlines with ""some huge buying opportunities.""Boeing, which is due to report its third-quarter earnings next Wednesday, needs to secure orders for about 200 more 777s, at its current rate of production, before its successor, the 777X, enters service in 2020. Orders for the current generation of 777 aircraft have fallen from 194 in 2011 to 63 in 2014 and just 34 so far this year. Boeing, which declined to comment for this article, has repeatedly said it is confident of making the transition to the new model without cutting production. But some industry consultants and aircraft appraisers see Boeing struggling to achieve those sales and expect it to cut its current 8.3-per-month production rate. That could hurt profits and cash flow as it delivers fewer planes. ""Boeing is going to have to slow down the production rate,"" said Gueric Dechavanne, a vice president at appraisal firm Collateral Verifications.Falling prices for used widebody planes, especially Boeing's older 777-200ER, are making new sales more difficult. Prices for 777-200ERs are down about 20 percent over the last year, said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at UK-based Ascend, an aviation appraisal and consulting firm.Ascend estimates 27 such aircraft are parked and out of service, representing about 7 percent of the global fleet. Around 40 of the aircraft will be available on the market within the next 12 months, the firm predicts.""Availability has increased, while demand is weak,"" Morris said. Some of Airbus's A330 long-haul jets also face slower demand. That is partly because of interest in a fuel-efficient successor, known as the A330neo and due out in 2017. But Airbus believes it has adjusted for this by twice cutting planned production rates.Airbus declined to comment. WHY PAY RETAIL? The comments by Delta's Anderson triggered a plunge in the shares of Boeing, Airbus (PA:AIR) and some big suppliers, such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (N:SPR), a major parts maker.Boeing and Spirit shares recovered some of those losses on Thursday as some on Wall Street played down the talk of a bubble. While demand for widebodies is soft, ""we believe the magnitude of that pressure...was grossly overstated,""  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) analyst Sam Pearlstein wrote on Thursday.""My wife wants that three-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for $500,000 and she has as much a chance of getting it as Mr. Anderson does at getting a $10 million, 10-year-old B777,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel, referring to a price the Delta chief cited on Wednesday. Most analysts said that they didn't agree with Anderson's warning that the weakness could spread to narrowbody jets, given huge demand for the smaller planes. A Delta spokesman declined to elaborate on Anderson's comments but said the airline's fleet strategy was ""opportunistic."" Modern aircraft are built to stay in service for 25 years or more and are often traded between airlines during their lives, providing values that serve as a barometer of jet prices. Low fuel prices have encouraged some airlines to think twice about spending billions of dollars on new fuel-saving models. Cheap used planes can help airlines bridge the few years until they can get the fuel-efficient 777Xs or A330neos. Airlines have to tack on $20 million to $30 million to the sale price of a used plane to refresh the cabin and overhaul the engines, but even with those costs the used planes are significantly cheaper than a new one. A 10-year-old 777-200ER or A330-200 currently costs about $47.5 million and prices are falling, down about 12 percent and five percent from last year, respectively, according to Collateral Verifications data. Cheaper used planes probably won't affect new plane prices much, some industry experts said. Manufacturers are keen to preserve profit margins for new planes by avoiding deep discounting. And airlines that want the most efficient plane ""are still willing to pay a significant price for new,"" Dechavanne said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

An Airbus spokeswoman said the company plans to build four A320-family aircraft a month at the factory by 2017, and there were ""currently no plans to change that rate."" Airbus has a backlog of 5,502 orders for A320-family planes, or nearly 11 years of production. Airlines ordering new planes face a long wait for them, and both Boeing and Airbus plan to increase rates to help shorten delivery times.""Because of the backlog, they've got to figure out a way to increase production,"" Stimpson said of Airbus.Airbus, which also builds A320s in France, Germany and China, has said the newest plant in Mobile will be its most efficient. It plans to increase global A320 production to 46 a month next year from 42 now. U.S. rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) also plans to lift production of its 737 plane to 47 a month in 2017 from 42 currently.Stimpson and Mobile are using the new $600 million Airbus factory as part of an effort to rebrand the city and attract businesses and jobs, Stimpson said during a visit to New York City.

1046,"Oct 13, 2015 04:40PM ET","Beyond MH17, a century of air crash probes and new pressures",nan,"By Tim HepherLONDON (Reuters) - As the spotlight falls on Dutch crash investigators and their high=profile probe into the downing of a Malaysian airliner, air accident detectives worldwide are waging a much more discreet daily battle to keep flying safe.The Dutch team's findings, concluding that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine in 2014, provoked an angry reaction on Tuesday from Russia, which dismissed their report as biased.But despite the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17, the disappearance of sister plane MH370 and an apparent Germanwings suicide crash in the Alps, the last year has brought the lowest accident rate in memory.This is in large part due to the work of the crash investigators, who are quietly marking the centenary of the creation in Britain of the world's first crash analysis agency.Investigators now are having to juggle growing challenges from conflict zones to drones, dizzying automation, poor pilot training and questions over their own independence.Topping the list, a series of incidents in which pilots erred when abruptly handed back control has drawn attention to a loss of skills brought about by modern reliance on computers. ""I don't think there is any replacement for more flying around and getting experience,"" Keith Conradi, Britain's chief air accident investigator, told Reuters in a recent interview.""The issue of automation is a real one. I do get concerned that it could bite us,"" said Conradi, whose Air Accidents Investigation Branch marks its centenary on Wednesday.TRAINING IS KEY ISSUEAt a recent gathering of global investigators, France's BEA investigation agency presented a damning report about an incident in 2014 when an ill-trained, fatigued and poorly regulated crew overshot the runway at Lyon.Over 180 passengers and crew had a lucky escape when their jet stopped short of a 15 metre-deep hole in the ground - itself the result of a regulatory anomaly. It was later filled in.""Everyone agrees that training is the number one issue today,"" BEA Director Remi Jouty told Reuters. European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) says that each new generation of computers halves the accident rate. But the complexity of modern aircraft systems can tax even the resources of investigators when things go wrong.""The speed of technology is very hard for investigators to follow. It is no longer possible to know all the systems, you need the experts from industry,"" Ulf Kramer, head of Germany's Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), said.That worries some investigators who point out they are reliant on manufacturers to help them discover potential flaws.""We have the same overall objectives but our short-term objectives can be different,"" Jouty said. SKILL SHORTAGESThe degree of reliance on the industry's own investigators' firepower emerged during the grounding of Boeing's high-tech 787 Dreamliner jets in 2013 after a series of battery problems.As its flagship product remained grounded, the U.S. company produced a ""man-year"" of data every day to try to find the root cause of the battery problems, a feat far beyond the capacity of all but the largest government safety agencies.Investigators fret about other potential threats to their independence - from politicians turning up at crash sites to pressures from media, lawyers and family groups.Many countries have yet to set up independent air crash investigation agencies, which are recommended by the United Nations' aviation arm as a means of keeping flying safe. Record numbers of planes on order have meanwhile led to shortages of pilots and mechanics and encouraged some airlines to take short cuts in recruiting staff.""The entire industry faces severe shortages in both fields,"" said Frank del Gandio, a former FAA official who heads the International Society of Air Safety Investigators (ISASI), which devoted a recent annual safety summit to issues of independence.Still, he and other safety veterans say the system of factual and blame-free reports dating back to World War One, coupled with new technology, has saved countless lives.A result of that success is that the ""go teams"" of forensic crash experts are being called into action less than before and more attention is being spent on learning from lesser incidents.""We don't have a lot of accidents now. When I started as an investigator in 1980 I did 45 accidents and incidents in five years. You get some investigators now who won't do 45 if they live to be 200,"" Del Gandio said. ""Aviation is safe. You are in more danger going home in a car than in an airplane."" (This story has been refiled to fix spelling in third paragraph)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It also offers passenger-to-freight conversions of its mid-sized 767.""The next step we are looking at is what we want to do in the single-aisle market, where we see demand for over 1,000 conversions over the next 20 years,"" Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Reuters in an interview.""We are looking at potentially pursuing a freighter conversion program for the 737-800. We see potential especially in the express market in the U.S. and China.""Until now, only outside companies have carried out conversions on 737s, as well as some 757s.

1054,"Sep 28, 2015 01:49PM ET",Airbus supersalesman Leahy pushes back talk of retirement,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) sales chief John Leahy, on whose watch the European planemaker has sold planes worth a trillion dollars, is set to remain in his post, pushing aside earlier talk of retirement, two people with knowledge of the decision said.Leahy, who turned 65 in August, has told colleagues he will stay in one of aerospace's most visible and highest-paid jobs for a ""few more years"", they said.An Airbus spokesman said it did not comment on rumours about individual executives.Leahy said in June he was thinking about whether to retire after more than two decades as top Airbus salesman, during which it rose to equal and, until recently, surpass U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) as the world's largest planemaker.""I am 65 and I do have to decide whether I have to retire or not, but one has to worry about one's health and what you do for a living too,"" he told a news conference.He was speaking after closing the Paris Airshow with a trademark deal to sell 110 planes to Hungary's Wizzair (L:WIZZ), accelerating negotiations to win the premier event rather than risk a rare defeat to Boeing on home soil.The all-night negotiations demonstrated a winner-takes-all approach that has significantly boosted Airbus's market share and secured thousands of European jobs, but which has raised sporadic concerns among analysts over pricing and margins.Both Airbus and Boeing have accused each other of starting price wars during Leahy's tenure.Leahy joined Airbus in 1985 and made a reputation for cutting innovative ""walkaway"" deals to boost its market share from 18 percent, when he became sales chief in 1994, to around 50 percent.The New Yorker has outlasted half a dozen Airbus CEOs and numerous Boeing counterparts, but recently Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier has taken a bigger profile in international successes.The replacement of such a key figure would be a watershed moment for Airbus, which has fallen back to second place in terms of deliveries against Boeing but continues to outsell it.Bregier appeared to give Leahy free rein at the June news conference, telling him ""you will retire within 15 years"".Leahy is one of the industry's best-known figures but also a polarising one whose taped speeches are used to fire up opponents.His contant jabs at ""my friends in Seattle"" are fiercely resented by many Boeing executives, who have hit back with a more aggressive approach and a series of major wins under Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner in recent years.Leahy's decision to remain guarantees more competition, but critics say Airbus may be storing up longer-term difficulties by relying too much on his hard-charging style. ""The longer he stays, the harder it will be for them when he leaves,"" an industry source said, asking not to be named.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1055,"Sep 25, 2015 12:46PM ET",Exclusive: Airbus tells A320 suppliers to cut prices 10 percent,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) is pressing suppliers on its A320 jet program to slash prices by at least 10 percent by 2019 in order to make the company's main cash cow more competitive, three people familiar with the matter said.The demand for austerity echoes rival Boeing's (N:BA) cost-cutting Partner for Success initiative, which has redrawn the relationship between suppliers and the world's biggest planemaker as the industry gears up for record output.Airbus' cuts are just one part of an internal efficiency program called SCOPe+ that also seeks savings through a close look at procurement and the way planes are developed and sold, according to suppliers and an Airbus document seen by Reuters.Airbus has told suppliers that the prospect of increased volumes and a longer lifespan for its best-selling jet, which has enjoyed a surge in sales due to an important makeover, means it is time to ""review all options"" in its supply chain.This includes a fresh look at the company's procurement strategy that could include extra use of dual sourcing for crucial parts: a strategy designed both to reduce costs and to reduce the risks of shortfalls as production increases.Airbus is also looking at further shifting its business model to allow airlines less choice over accessories that they previously ordered direct, known as Buyer Furnished Equipment.Also involved is a longer-term effort to weave manufacturing costs into the design process to prevent unintended overruns in costs on the factory floor, a tool known as ""Redesign to Cost."" Though Airbus has confirmed the existence of the SCOPe+ initiative, its details have not been publicly disclosed.The initiative ""is part of Airbus' long-term commitment towards boosting competitiveness through operational efficiency and continuous improvement,"" a spokeswoman said. TUG OF WAR In 2014, Airbus spent about 13 billion euros on parts for its A320 family of jets, which compete with Boeing's 737 in the busiest part of the $120 billion-a-year aircraft market.Each plane contains three million parts.Mounting pressure on suppliers for price cuts comes as Airbus and Boeing are raising production of their single-aisle models to around 50 aircraft a month each, up from 42 a month, and pondering a further step-up to 60 a month.Such increases in volume are traditionally the aerospace industry's most valuable lever for driving down unit costs.But the SCOPe+ and Partner for Success programs aim to complement this with direct contributions from suppliers, driving profit margins further up industry's food chain. Boeing has told suppliers to cut prices by 15 percent or lose business.While planemakers lead the industry in terms of revenues and operating profits, the top 20 companies in the aerospace sector by operating margin are all suppliers, according to Deloitte.That rankles with manufacturers who argue their willingness to gamble on hugely popular upgrades of the A320 and Boeing 737 jets is driving record sales and creating wealth across the industry that ought to be shared through lower parts prices.But many small suppliers argue the efficiency campaigns mask a grab for part of their profit margins. They say they face their own challenges in investing in equipment to support higher production, with no guarantee how long the boom will last.Some are pushing for higher, not lower, prices.The increased tension is the latest evidence of a shift in industry focus. After a decade of bold developments, Airbus and Boeing are putting their energy into upgrading existing models. With fewer new projects in the pipeline, they have less leverage to demand better terms from suppliers in return for a place on the next new plane and observers say this has led to a growing cost battle over existing programs.""There is a balance of power between prime contractors and the supply chain. Those who supply things that can be dual-sourced like aerostructures feel price pressure. But a lot of the supply chain is single-sourced and it is harder for those suppliers to see why they should give anything up,"" said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus opened a jetliner assembly line in China in 2008.Boeing shares were down 1.28 percent at $129.99 in afternoon trading in New York.McNerney, who stepped down as chief executive on July 1, also made his first public remarks on Boeing's new Chinese facility.

1057,"Sep 22, 2015 03:32PM ET",Russia seen building up two more military facilities in Syria: Jane's,nan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite photos taken in mid-September and obtained by IHS Jane's show Russian forces developing two additional military facilities near Syria's Mediterranean coast, Rob Munks, editor of IHS Jane's Intelligence Review, said on Tuesday.Munks said the previously undisclosed work was taking place at a weapons storage facility and a military base north of Latakia, suggesting Russia is preparing to place troops at both locations.Russia has been dramatically increasing its forces at an air base south of Latakia, a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including positioning combat planes and helicopters as well as tanks and accommodation blocks. Washington has been wary of Moscow's support for Assad and U.S. officials have said such deepening ties are troubling even as the United States and Russia have their eye on fighting the Islamic State militant group. Jane's, a defense intelligence provider, acquired the images from a commercial satellite division of Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) SE, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the imagery.Munks told Reuters one of the sites was located about 4 miles (7 km) north of Latakia and the second was 2 miles (3 km) west of that. The images showed construction of new buildings and grading of terrain, as well as the presence of new tents typically used by Russian military units.One of the facilities is adjacent to a surface-to-air missile site, Munks added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1058,"Sep 17, 2015 11:38AM ET",Boeing rivals step up pressure for UK spy plane competition ,nan,"By Sarah Young and Tim HepherLONDON (Reuters) - Global defense companies are clamoring for the chance to compete with Boeing (N:BA) for a multi-billion-dollar contract to provide Britain with submarine-hunting aircraft, as the UK government ponders a gap left by recent defense cuts.At a time of rising Western tensions with Russia -- whose submarines are suspected of entering Swedish and Finnish waters -- Britain is struggling to carry out its own aerial hunts for such boats since scrapping its Nimrod spy-plane program in 2010.Defence Minister Michael Fallon confirmed on Wednesday that a British government defense and security review due to conclude in November could state the need for a new maritime patrol aircraft.Until recently, Boeing (N:BA) was widely seen as a shoo-in with its P-8 Poseidon, an off-the-shelf solution based on its best-selling 737 passenger jet. But rivals queued up at a major defense exhibition this week to press Britain to run a competition, worried that the return towards Cold War levels of tension could favor a rushed deal.With few defense deals up for grabs due to spending cuts, any competition is likely to attract a flood of offers with jetmakers vying against turboprop makers, though Britain has not yet said exactly what type of missions should be carried out.""We very much hope for competition, but we need to know what the question is before we can provide the answer,"" Paul Kahn, president of Airbus Group UK (PA:AIR), told Reuters on the sidelines of the DSEI exhibition in London.The European aerospace group wants to compete against Boeing with its C-295 military turbo-prop aircraft.  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) entered the fray this week with plans to upgrade the C-130J Hercules transport aircraft already owned by the Royal Air Force, while Italy's  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI), L-3 (N:LLL) of the United States, Sweden's Saab (ST:SAABb) and Japan's Kawasaki are also potential contenders.Brian Burridge, Britain's former commander in Iraq and now senior vice president UK corporate for Finmeccanica, said the case for competition after five years of uncertainty was ""compelling"".The politically sensitive decision could affect hundreds of jobs but many are calling for a broader debate about whether Britain wants to combine the maritime role with other sensitive missions such as land surveillance and special forces work in order to make the project more efficient.""The government is under great pressure to restore some kind of maritime patrol capability as fast as possible and therefore Boeing presenting a package ... seems to be quite a good short-term solution,"" said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank.""Is that the correct answer for the long term? I think this is where the real thinking and capability studies have to come. It seems to me there is a need for a combination of manned and unmanned platforms.""U.S. contractor  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC) is expected to propose a solution involving some unmanned assets, but rivals such as Lockheed say it would need a manned aircraft to go after any submarines spotted by unmanned aerial vehicles.Northrop declined to comment.Boeing said it would ""support whatever the government decides"" in its upcoming defense review.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(Reuters) - Airbus Group SA (PA:AIR) opened its first jetliner factory on U.S. soil on Monday and does not anticipate taking a hit to aircraft orders from the economic slowdown in China, Chief Executive Tom Enders said.The $600 million plant in Alabama will help Airbus meet plans to churn out 50 narrow body jets a month by 2017, up from 42 currently. Airbus is considering lifting that to 60 or more to meet a backlog of more than 5,400 planes. Enders said he had no concern about a slowdown in demand, including from China's recent economic weakness. If it came, Alabama would not be alone on the cutting block. ""We would always do that in a balanced way,"" he said in an interview at a ribbon cutting ceremony. ""There's no political pressures or anything. But I have no reason that we are slowing down. Our challenge right now is to bring up production.""China in June placed a landmark order for dozens of Airbus wide-body jets, a deal worth at least $11 billion at list prices that paves the way for a second European aircraft plant in the world's fastest-growing aviation market.China also is a major buyer of narrow body Airbus aircraft, and Airbus has built a factory in China to produce those planes, similar to the one opened Monday in the United States to serve the North American market.""Obviously we watch our markets with great interest,"" Enders said. ""But at this point I have no reason to believe that the Chinese market is breaking down or anything like that.""Enders also said the Toulouse, France-based company is ""happy with the current euro-dollar relationship"" and has no plans to change its foreign-exchange hedging strategy.Rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) has indicated it is looking at building a facility in China to paint and finish its competing 737 narrow-body jets, and could announce it later this month when Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to visit Seattle. In the interview, Enders said the U.S. plant, which employs 260, could help with military sales.""This factory certainly has a lot of industrial credibility,"" he said. ""So should an opportunity arise on the military side some years from now (the factory and workforce) will certainly not hurt our credibility for a military project.""Airbus said it sited the Mobile plant on 116 acres and has an additional 116 acres available nearby for expansion.Airbus aims to make the U.S. factory its most cost efficient plant. But the bigger payoff is with burnishing its brand as a U.S. manufacturer. Monday's ceremony included video clips praising Airbus from dozens of U.S. elected officials, airline heads and manufacturing companies.""The relationship (with Airbus) is already extremely strong,""  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) chief Doug Parker said in a clip.

""We still think we'll make the delivery on the original schedule."" Workers told Reuters that the program was eight weeks behind in some stations due to problems with tools.Eccleston said the production delay was ""a few weeks. It's not eight weeks. It's actually a bit less than that but it depends on tool to tool.""Airbus formally opened the $600 million factory in Mobile, Alabama, on Monday. It is due to produce four Airbus jetliners a month starting in late 2017. It is the second such factory Airbus has built outside its home base of Europe and is designed to the most efficient.While the plant is crucial to meeting production targets, its larger significance is symbolic, Eccleston said. Much like foreign automakers who have set up factories in U.S. states, Airbus hopes that the plant will help it sell to American customers. The company is aiming for 50 percent of the U.S. market. Its current order book will take it to 40 percent, up from 20 percent before the factory, and Airbus' newest single-aisle models, were announced.Airbus expects to deliver the first U.S.-made A321 aircraft to JetBlue early in the second quarter of 2016, Eccleston said. A second A321 for  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) will be delivered later in 2016. The A321 is the largest model in the Airbus A320 narrow-bodied family and competes with Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737.Allan McArtor, Chairman and Chief Executive of Airbus Group Inc, the European planemaker's U.S. unit, blamed the delay on a supplier.

1063,"Sep 13, 2015 09:15PM ET",Airbus says U.S. factory will be world's most efficient,nan,"By Alwyn ScottMOBILE, Ala. (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) said on Sunday that its first U.S. factory, due to formally open on Monday, will be the most efficient in the world and will focus on building the largest version of the company's single-aisle aircraft.The elegant, skylit factory on 116 acres here will be capable of making up to eight A320 family jetliners a month, though Airbus said it has no plans for that level of production.The factory is a potent challenge to rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA). Both companies now make 42 single-aisle planes a month and plan to lift output sharply to fill back orders for new planes. Airbus originally planned to produce mainly smaller A320s in Mobile, but the larger A321 version, which seats up to 240 passengers, has outsold the Boeing rival. ""This is where the U.S. market is going,"" said Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas.Boeing makes its competing 737 jetliner at a single factory in Renton, Washington, and plans to lift the rate to 52 a month in 2018. Airbus, with A320 facilities in Germany, France and China, plans to lift production to 50 a month in 2017. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Brégier said demand easily supports producing 60 a month, and Airbus expects to decide this year whether to target that rate. If it does, it would add a fourth assembly line in Germany before raising production further in Alabama, he said. The new U.S. plant is scheduled to be producing four planes a month by late 2017, and gives Airbus the ability to go higher just by adding work shifts and small capital investments.""We can go to eight (a month) with very little adjustment,"" said Timo Zaremba, product quality manager for the U.S. factory.More than half of Mobile's production will be the larger A321 jet and that would likely rise to three-quarters, Brégier added.The U.S. presence gives Airbus a strong card to play in selling to U.S. airlines. Already Airbus' current backlog will double its U.S. market share to 40 percent. The Mobile plant will supply North American airlines, with the first two planes going to JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) starting in the second quarter of 2016.Airbus said it introduced several efficient techniques in the factory, taking ideas from existing plants. Among them: a machine that installs the 2,400 rivets that attach wings to the fuselage. Those improvements will be copied by other factories.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) set up a booth at the Saturday celebration near the $600 million facility, a family-focused event complete with free red-white-and-blue t-shirts and a fireworks display.The machinists' low-key presence highlighted the new Airbus factory's significance to a commercial aircraft industry that's in transition from a unionized, centralized past to a future where rivals Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus build planes around the world, in factories that may no longer be union shops.The IAM, which represents about 35,000 Boeing employees, said it is taking a soft approach at Airbus: offering information but not promising to create a bargaining unit at the company. About two dozen union members, in t-shirts that said ""union values"" and ""blue collar hero,"" handed out information to workers on Saturday.""We don't want to shove it down their throats,"" said Alfredo Granado, an IAM grand lodge representative from Texas who was at the event. ""Airbus said whatever employees want to do, it's their choice,"" Granado added. ""I hope it stays that way.""Airbus prefers a direct relationship with employees, spokesman Clay McConnell said. ""But if our employees ultimately decide they want to choose a union, that's their right.""Alabama is a right-to-work state, where employees are not required to join a union. Union members are 10.8 percent of the state's workforce, federal statistics show, compared with 2.2 percent in South Carolina and 16.8 percent in Washington, where rival  Boeing Co  has jetliner factories. Boeing's South Carolina plant is not unionized.The Airbus plant will employ about 1,000 when it reaches full production by 2018. Airbus has hired about 260 production workers so far. A few workers voiced frustration at discovering they earn less than European counterparts.""I make $17.85 an hour,"" said one worker, adding he had more experience than German workers who make $21 or $22 an hour. ""If we were in the low to mid-20s, there'd be no complaints,"" he said.Airbus said its pay is competitive with other manufacturing in the area. Federal data show Alabama employers pay on average $30 an hour for aircraft mechanics and $23 an hour for aircraft assembly workers, and about $16 for general assemblers, which includes auto workers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The governor's office, labor leaders and the industry association told Reuters they had not heard of the plan.The International Association of Machinists District 751 said it was concerned about potential job losses. Boeing had not shared details of the plan, it also said.Boeing declined to comment on the report, but issued a statement that left open the possibility, saying that it is always looking to expand and improve productivity.""One way we do this is by working with partners around the world, including in China, our largest international market,"" the company said. ""However, we do not comment on options we may be exploring.""Moving work to China from Boeing's plane-production stronghold in the U.S. Pacific Northwest would represent a bold step for the Chicago-based company, which so far has set up one full assembly line outside Washington state, in South Carolina. But the move would be in line with increased global sourcing of aerospace parts and supplies. Foreign contracts and operations are seen as helpful in winning fierce sales competitions with European rival Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) NV.Airbus is due to inaugurate this weekend its first U.S. final assembly line, in Mobile, Alabama. The $600 million factory, which sports a large U.S. flag, allows Airbus to lay claim to employing American workers, as foreign automakers did after building U.S. plants. Airbus, with major manufacturing in Toulouse, France, also has final assembly lines in Hamburg, Germany, and Tianjin, China. Boeing also has relied on foreign suppliers to help cement sales relationships. Three Japanese industrial giants produce portions of Boeing's 777 and 787 aircraft, and Japan's major airlines have been almost exclusively Boeing customers.According to Aviation Week, Boeing's China facility would paint 737 aircraft built at its Renton, Washington, factory, conduct flight testing, and perform some interior installation.But the move could conflict with a deal Boeing struck with machinists in 2011. In exchange for ratifying a contract, Boeing said it would build the 737 ""in its existing Renton facility.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1066,"Sep 04, 2015 03:17PM ET",Boeing sticks with 747 production plans despite sales drought,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Friday it is sticking to current production plans for its 747 jumbo jet despite a canceled order that left no net new orders for the plane in 20 months.Nippon Cargo Airlines Ltd, a unit of Nippon Yusen (T:9101), canceled orders for four 747 freighters on Sept. 1, Boeing said, leaving no net new orders from this year or last. Boeing now has just 25 firm 747 orders, equal to about two years of production, for the $379 million jumbo.The cancellation will have ""no impact on production rates,"" Boeing spokesman Doug Alder told Reuters.The slump in sales of very large aircraft has raised questions about how long Boeing and European rival Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR) can keep building double-decker planes, with 2015 a make-or-break year for both.Airbus' competing A380 has booked no orders since 2014 from commercial airlines and has 148 orders in backlog. Airbus is considering upgrading the 10-year-old plane's engines to stimulate sales.If the sales slump continues, Boeing could face the prospect of taking an accounting charge of $1 billion or more on the 747-8 program, said Myles Walton, an analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn). It was unclear how long Boeing could go without an order before triggering such an action. ""There's a judgment certainly on the part of the company, its auditors and conversations with customers,"" he said.Boeing has flagged the charge risk in quarterly filings, and said Friday there was no change regarding that due to Nippon's cancellation.The 747 does have some sales prospects. Boeing won a commitment in June for 20 747s from Russian cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group. The U.S. Air Force also agreed to buy an unspecified number of 747s for the Air Force One presidential fleet, which currently has two planes. Neither commitment has been converted to a firm order.To keep 747 assembly running, Boeing has notched down output and cut costs. Output is due to fall to one plane monthly in March from 1.3. A level below one is considered difficult to sustain.To some extent, the 747 and A380 are victims of engineering success. Long-range twin-engine planes have largely eclipsed the capabilities of the less-fuel-efficient four-engine 747 and A380. A weak cargo market also has cut 747 freighter sales.Boeing says at least 143 older freighters will need to be replaced and sees demand for 540 very large aircraft over the next 20 years. Airbus sees a market for 1,551 such planes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It valued the aircraft demand at $950 billion.""Despite the current volatility in China's financial market, we see strong growth in the country's aviation sector over the long term,"" Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters in Beijing.Boeing estimates that China's commercial airplane fleet will nearly triple over the next 20 years, from 2,570 aircraft in 2014 to 7,210 aircraft in 2034. By that time, Tinseth said, China will be the world's largest domestic air travel market. ""We've really seen no slowing in the trajectory of traffic here in China,"" he added.Both Boeing and rival Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) are relying on China to fuel growth in their order books.Airbus, which claims a 50 percent market share with more than 1,180 aircraft in operation with Chinese airlines, in July announced plans to set up a completion and delivery center for its A330 jets in Tianjin, a crucial build out of its assembly facility now in operation.Boeing estimated China will buy a total of 4,630 single-aisle airplanes during the 20-year period, driven in part by the growth of new carriers and low-cost airlines.Additional demand for 1,510 widebody airplanes, including 50 large wide-body aircraft, will come as larger numbers of Chinese middle-class tourists travel overseas on long-haul flights, Boeing said.Separately, Tinseth said that Boeing is ""working very hard"" to lobby the U.S. government on the future of EXIM, the U.S. government's export credit agency, whose government charter lapsed on June 30.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Other large A320 customers include low-cost carriers such as Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and Indonesia's Lion Air.It is also the second-largest order by value for Airbus.The A320neo is the re-engined and upgraded variant of the A320 family of planes and competes against Boeing's upgraded (N:BA) 737 Max in the narrowbody market segment.Boeing has projected that narrowbody aircraft, which are used on flights of up to around five hours, will account for 70 percent of the planes required over the next 20 years. IndiGo's deal extends the Airbus lead against Boeing in the orders for the upgraded narrowbody aircraft.Boeing has secured 2,831 orders for its 737 Max plane, according to data on its website, while Airbus said that it has over 4,100 orders for the A320neo with this order.Founded in 2006 by travel entrepreneur Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, a former chief executive of U.S. Airways, IndiGo has placed a series of aggressive orders for Airbus jets as it tries to win a bigger share of India's fast-growing aviation market.IndiGo flies one in three of India's air travelers. Its owner, InterGlobe Aviation, file in June a draft prospectus for an initial public offering. It had said in the prospectus that the terms of the 250 aircraft order had expired, raising concerns about the deal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Residents provided information that the aircraft crashed into Tangok mountain.""There was no immediate word on whether anyone survived.Earlier, the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) said a twin-turboprop plane had lost contact with air traffic control as it flew over the forested area of eastern Indonesia but efforts to trace it were difficult because of failing light.Trigana Air Operations Director Beni Sumaryanto said that within 30 minutes of hearing that the aircraft was missing, the airline sent another plane to scour the same flight path but it had found nothing because of bad weather, local media reported. According to the official BASARNAS Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, the aircraft, a short-haul ATR 42-300 airliner belonging to Trigana Air Service and built in France and Italy, was carrying 44 adult passengers, five crew and five children and infants.The plane was flying between Jayapura's Sentani Airport and Oksibil, due south of Jayapura, the capital of Papua province.Air transport is commonly used in Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, where land travel is often impossible.According to the Aviation Safety Network, an online database, the ATR 42-300 that went missing made its first flight 27 years ago. ATR is a joint venture between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italian aerospace firm  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI).The airline has been on the EU's list of banned carriers since 2007. Airlines on the list are barred from operating in European airspace due to either concerns about safety standards or the regulatory environment in their country of registration.The airline has a fleet of 14 aircraft, according to the airfleets.com database. These include 10 ATR aircraft and four Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Classics. These have an average age of 26.6 years, according to the database.Trigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Excluding this latest incident, it has written off 10 aircraft.Airline officials were not immediately available to respond to enquiries from Reuters.Indonesia has a patchy aviation safety record and has seen two major plane crashes in the past year, including an AirAsia flight that went down in the Java Sea, killing all on board.The AirAsia crash prompted the Indonesian government to introduce regulations aimed at improving safety.Indonesia's president promised a review of the ageing air force fleet in July after a military transport plane crashed in the north of the country, killing more than 100 people.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1082,"Aug 08, 2015 03:11PM ET",Buffett's Berkshire nears deal for Precision Castparts: WSJ,nan,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) is nearing an agreement to buy Precision Castparts Corp (N:PCP), in what could be the company's largest purchase ever, the Wall Street Journal said on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.The purchase of Precision Castparts, which makes aircraft components and energy-production equipment, could be announced as soon as next week and cost more than $30 billion, assuming typical premiums for mergers, the newspaper said. Precision Castparts' market value was $26.7 billion on Friday.Neither Berkshire nor Precision Castparts was immediately available for comment.Berkshire is one of Precision Castparts' largest shareholders, with a roughly 3 percent stake worth $882 million as of March 31, according to securities filings.Though it began building that stake in 2012, it remains among the smaller investments in Berkshire's portfolio. Such investments are normally picked by Buffett's investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.The addition of Precision Castparts would extend Buffett's decade-long push into the industrial sector, where he has bought such companies as parts maker Marmon, Israeli toolmaker Iscar, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol.He considers those companies among his ""Powerhouse Five"" collection of non-insurance businesses that contribute greatly to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's bottom line.Precision Castparts makes components such as nuts, bolts and other fasteners for aerospace companies such as Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), an industry that accounts for roughly 70 percent of sales. It also makes products such as pipes and fittings for power and industrial companies.The company reported a profit of $1.53 billion on net sales of $10 billion for its fiscal year ended March 29.But it has struggled with slack demand in some businesses, and last month missed analysts' quarterly profit forecasts as Chief Executive Officer Mark Donegan lamented a ""challenging"" oil and gas environment.Precision Castparts shares have fallen 29 percent since June 2014, and have lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) by close to 30 percentage points over the last five years.Berkshire shares have also lagged that index over five years, but by a smaller percentage.A purchase would likely let Berkshire deploy much of its $66.59 billion of cash, while still leaving the $20 billion cushion Buffett wants.Berkshire's biggest purchase is the $26.5 billion takeover in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad it did not already own. It has more than 80 operating businesses.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1083,"Aug 05, 2015 04:56AM ET","Skymark creditors pick ANA to lead turnaround plan, reject Delta proposal",nan,"By Maki Shiraki and Tim KellyTOKYO (Reuters) - ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) has won creditor backing to lead a turnaround of bankrupt Japanese discount carrier Skymark Airlines Inc [SKALF.PK], defeating a plan that proposed Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) as its sponsor.The victory gives Japan's largest carrier access to Skymark's 36 landing slots at Tokyo's crowded Haneda airport, helping it cement its domestic dominance over  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201).For debt holders seeking to recoup their money, ANA is ""less risky"" than Delta, a creditor told Reuters ahead of the decision.ANA operates airlines in Japan, has already discussed business plans with Skymark and is close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, the creditor added, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Political backing helped ANA garner 11 of 16 new international landing slots at Haneda in 2013.More than 170 creditors voted on the proposals in two rounds - the first weighted by amount owed, while the second gave each creditor an equal vote. ANA, which has offered to buy 16.5 percent of Skymark, won 60.5 percent of the first round and more than three quarters of the second.""Delta is a mega carrier and therefore a daunting opponent, but it had a number of hurdles to overcome,"" Toyuki Nagamine, a director at ANA said at a press briefing with representatives from Skymark and its financial backer private equity firm, Integral Corp, which supported ANA.For Delta, the decision is a lost opportunity to gain a bigger presence in Japan where it does not have an alliance partner.Barring any upheld objections from creditors, Integral's ANA-sponsored revival plan will be implemented after 30 days.""While this is not the result we had hoped for, as Skymark's single largest creditor, Intrepid will continue to focus on working constructively with key stakeholders,"" Franklin Pray, chief executive of Intrepid Aviation said in a statement.Intrepid had proposed Delta as a sponsor after it fell out with ANA over a failed deal to lease the airline planes.Skymark's failure came after its finances were stretched by plans to fly Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) A380 superjumbos on overseas routes. Airbus demanded a $710 million cancellation fee after the airline was unable to keep up with payments.Airbus, Skymark's second-biggest creditor, sided with ANA, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier in the day.Tokyo District Court has recognized Skymark liabilities of 152.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion) while a further 157 billion yen remains under dispute.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1085,"Aug 04, 2015 11:26AM ET",Paris-Tokyo in three hours: Airbus wins patent for hypersonic plane,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has won a patent for a hypersonic plane, but Concorde's hydrogen-powered successor is unlikely to leave the drawing board any time soon.The European planemaker's proposal would slash the journey time from Paris to Tokyo to under three hours, from 12 hours.The idea, first published in 2011, is to use three different kinds of engine power to hop, skip and jump above the atmosphere, yet taking off from a regular runway. It has now won approval from the U.S. Patent Office.The concept comes as commercial space companies such as Virgin Galactic pursue plans for low-level space flights. Its ""gothic delta wing"" echoes the elegant curves of Concorde.But Airbus dampened any hopes of a quick return to the days of the Anglo-French supersonic jet, which was taken out of service in 2003 due to high operating costs.""Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property,"" a spokesman said by email.""These patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualization, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realised technology or product.""By climbing almost vertically, the new ""ultra-rapid air vehicle's"" designers hope to avoid the supersonic boom that hampered Concorde's deployment beyond the North Atlantic, where it flew at twice the speed of sound for over 20 years. The hypersonic plane would take off using a regular jet engine, before rocket boosters kick in to start a sharp ascent, sending the plane soaring above the atmosphere.Ramjet engines, currently used in missiles, would then take the plane up to altitudes of some 30km as the plane cruises at speeds up to Mach 4.5 (approximately 4,780 km), or 4.5 times the speed of sound. The turbojets would reignite to enable landing.Announcing a similar proposal in 2011, Airbus Group, then known as EADS, said it would take 30-40 years to enter service, if at all. But the patent is designed to put down a marker for technology that could be useful in other developments.Airbus says it is working on two hypersonic projects, one with Japanese partners and another with Russian and Australian involvement, with the aim of conquering speeds up to Mach 6.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Iran will buy a total of 80-90 planes per year from the two aviation giants in the first phase of renovating its air fleet,"" said Mohammad Khodakarami, the caretaker director of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, according to IRNA.Last month's nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers has raised the prospect of banking and trade sanctions on Iran being lifted, perhaps around the end of this year, which would mean a chance to renew a fleet of commercial aircraft whose average age of 23 years is almost twice the international average.""We will purchase planes from Boeing and Airbus in equal numbers,"" Khodakarami was quoted as saying, adding that Iran would initially need to add at least 80 planes to its fleet each year. That would mean a total of 300 planes within five years, he added.Iran will finance the purchases through mechanisms including leasing, foreign loans and state funds, Khodakarami said.Iranian and Western industry officials had earlier estimated that Iran, a country of 80 million people, would need a total of 400 aircraft in the next decade, assuming implementation of the nuclear deal proceeds smoothly and the sanctions are lifted.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1090,"Jul 30, 2015 04:06PM ET",Airbus seeks to rebuild trust as A400M systems fall short,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group has told buyer nations of the A400M transporter aircraft that it cannot deliver all of its high-tech defenses according to plan, casting a shadow over some of its military uses as Europe battles growing instability on its borders.The troop and cargo lifter was developed at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion) for seven European NATO nations and is already in service with French forces in Mali. Other core buyers include Belgium, Britain, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey. Malaysia is so far the only export customer.Some of the state-of-the-art systems designed to warn of threats such as missiles or hostile radar are more difficult than expected to develop, handing buyers a choice between taking planes or waiting for upgrades, European defense sources said.But after years of political disputes and technical problems, a new military-aircraft management at Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is working flat out to rebuild trust worn down by delays and overruns that are typical of large defense projects.An internal audit and regular updates appear to be paying off, people close to the talks said, with fewer visible signs of tensions that have led to costly stand-offs in the past.A new setback came with the fatal crash of a plane being prepared for delivery to Turkey in May. Investigators are looking into a possible accidental data wipe.Ankara is negotiating with other A400M buyers to see whether it could get a replacement aircraft by swapping deliveries as it steps up its military role in the region, defense sources said.Although production is back to normal, a clampdown on some testing after the crash led to new development delays of up to three months, erasing the remaining ""buffer,"" they said.Even though the destroyed plane was insured, some analysts expect Airbus to take a further modest provision on the A400M with its results on Friday, adding to 4.76 billion euros of charges already generated by Europe's biggest defense project.Airbus declined any comment ahead of the results.SUMMER NEGOTIATIONSA senior executive told Reuters in comments published this week that Airbus was confident of meeting the upper end of its revised production goal of 13 to 17 planes this year, following the accident, but declined further comment.The group appears certain it can deliver 13 of those planes, leaving 10 to deliver for the rest of the year.The remaining four are the subject of negotiations over how many customized features should be slotted in and when, with France, Germany and Britain seen at the center of the debate.Airbus met buyer nations this week and several weeks of negotiations lie ahead, sources in two capitals said.Although some of the plane's advanced defenses will be later than planned, European defense sources say buyers have been assured it can tackle shoulder-held weapons held by non-state actors that are one of the region's pressing threats.One of the A400M's other roles is dropping parachutists.Free-jumping from the side doors has been approved but dropping paratroopers from both sides at once to speed up penetration of territory has introduced the risk of collision. Airbus is testing new parachutes to try to avoid this.Despite the flaws, supporters stress the A400M, which shot to the attention of the public in an action movie premiere last week, remains more sophisticated even than some fighters.However, Airbus has had to admit to buyers that refueling helicopters will be 'mission impossible' any time soon, because the shape of the plane subjects choppers to too much turbulence when tethered on their relatively short fuel hoses.France, which views this as crucial for its special forces, is considering buying  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130s, one of the planes the A400M was designed to replace, to address this gap.The setback could raise questions over ambitions to export the plane to the United States which uses C-130s to refill Black Hawks, though future research might overcome this -- at a cost.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1091,"Jul 29, 2015 08:12PM ET",Boeing may move work abroad with Ex-Im future uncertain: chairman,nan,"By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chairman Jim McNerney on Wednesday said the aircraft maker is actively looking at moving ""key pieces"" of its operations to other countries given uncertainty about the future of the Export-Import Bank, whose charter expired on June 30.""We are now forced to think about this differently,"" McNerney told hundreds of executives and diplomats during an interview hosted by the Economic Club of Washington.McNerney, who retired as the company's chief executive on July 1, said Boeing might consider sites in countries that offer export credits, but gave no details about which operations could be affected or when the company had launched its review.The International Association of Machinists District 751, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing workers, blasted McNerney's threat to move jobs overseas. ""The only Boeing job that should leave this country is his,"" said Jon Holden, who heads Boeing's largest union.America's largest exporter, Boeing employs 165,000 people.""Boeing's fear mongering undermines the company's remarkable products and it won't win converts in Congress,"" said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America, a sister organization of the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative policy and is one of the most vocal critics of the bank.The Ex-Im Bank was created during the Great Depression to lend money to U.S. exporters and their foreign customers. Its charter lapsed after conservatives in the U.S. Congress cast it as a promoter of ""crony capitalism"" for multinationals such as Boeing and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).Hopes of reviving the trade bank were dashed on Tuesday as Congress moved toward a short-term extension of highway funding without a provision to renew the bank's charter. That means the bank's fate hangs in the balance through September or October, McNerney said.Uncertainty about the availability of export credits is already weighing on sales of a range of Boeing products, including commercial satellites, according to sources familiar with the situation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the business negotiations.McNerney's comments reflect U.S. industry's growing frustration about deep partisan divides that have paralyzed Congress since the rise of the right-wing Tea Party in 2010 and the imposition of mandatory spending cuts that have hit revenues at the defense division of Boeing and other arms makers.GE's chief executive, Jeff Immelt, last month told the Economic Club his company would move manufacturing jobs to Canada and Europe if the Ex-Im bank closed.McNerney said he was more worried than ever that Congress could fail to reauthorize the bank, given what he called the ""very, very frustrating"" refusal of a small minority of lawmakers to accept majority congressional support for the bank.""People just playing politics – they're not connected to the real world anymore,"" McNerney said at the event, which was attended by the Russian, Dutch and Malaysian ambassadors.McNerney, who led an effort to bring more manufacturing in-house after problems linked to the company's strategy of outsourcing work on the 787 Dreamliner, said he was rethinking his efforts to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States.""I'm beginning to think that maybe I made the wrong decision,"" said McNerney, who led the company for 10 years.Boeing recently signed a deal with major Japanese suppliers, giving them 21 percent of the 777X content, down from 35 percent for the 787.Boeing's main rival, Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), has opened manufacturing facilities in China and the United States in recent years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We have to place an order so we have a long-term business plan in place. The focus is now on sizeable growth,"" he said.There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a firm order.SpiceJet's expansion plans come after India's second-largest low-cost carrier almost collapsed, before being bailed out by new chairman Ajay Singh in January.SpiceJet has less than 20 Boeing narrow-body jets, while its market share has shrunk to 12 percent in June from around 20 percent a year ago after it cut capacity to stay in business.India's airlines are expanding their fleets as they compete to win a bigger slice of what is one of world's fasting growing markets for air travel but one where most players are plagued by losses as the fight for passengers pushes ticket prices below costs.Rival IndiGo, which is profitable and the largest Indian airline by market share, has kept costs low in part by placing large orders for a single type of plane through the sale and leaseback model.Koteshwar said any new order would largely be on a sale and leaseback model, and that a big order would help it to keep future costs lower.""SpiceJet has always been constrained by the lack of long-term orders. This will give us economies of scale and for our vendors and suppliers to see that we are growing,"" he said.SpiceJet reported a 718.5 million rupee net profit on Tuesday for the three months ending in June, against a 1.24 billion rupee loss last year, after falling oil prices and a cost-cutting drive outweighed a slump in revenues.Its shares were up 3.2 percent at 1250 IST on Wednesday, outpacing a 0.3 percent rise in the wider market (BSESN).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1094,"Jul 24, 2015 11:13AM ET",Boeing looks at pricey titanium in bid to stem 787 losses,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which loses about $23 million on every 787 Dreamliner passenger jet that leaves the factory, is trying to stem the losses by cutting the use of one of its signature ingredients: titanium.The strong, lightweight alloy used extensively on the 787 costs seven times more than aluminum, and accounts for about $17 million of the cost of the $260 million plane, according to industry sources.The push to reduce titanium costs is part of a broader, long-running effort by Boeing to make the 787 profitable that includes pressing suppliers for price cuts and adjusting assembly lines to improve efficiency, said Bob Noble, vice president of Partnering for Success, Boeing's supplier cost-cutting program.Boeing's other commercial planes are profitable, and on Wednesday, Boeing repeated its pledge to break even on the 787 this year on a cash basis. With titanium making up 15 percent of the 259,000 pounds an empty 787 weighs, far more than other Boeing jetliners, the material is under special scrutiny, industry experts said.The world's largest plane maker hasn't disclosed how many billions it invested to develop the 787, which was introduced in 2011, but it has spent more than $30 billion on production, tooling and one-time costs. And it has curbed its ambitions for future planes. Former chief executive Jim McNerney said last year Boeing didn't plan any more ""moonshots"" like the 787.As the Chicago-based company races to increase the pace of plane manufacturing, investors and analysts want it to lift its profits by churning out more 787s while cutting costs.""Aerospace titanium at $20 to $25 a pound is front and center, especially when you have the cost problems that you do on the 787,"" said Kevin Michaels, a vice president with ICF International, a publicly traded management, technology and policy consulting firm based in Fairfax, Virginia.787 COSTS RISECommercial jetliner programs typically lose money in the early years of production until the heavy upfront investments in engineering and production are repaid. Boeing's accounting spreads those costs over a large block of planes the company expects to deliver. Investors expressed concern in April when the 787's deferred production cost balance reached $26.9 billion, about $2 billion more than earlier targets. The tally is a gauge of the losses Boeing has built up making 787s so far. Boeing said the 787 deferred cost balance will keep rising until 2016, when the company plans to begin turning out 12 of the planes a month, up from 10 currently. At that point, Boeing expects the balance will start decreasing. Overall, Boeing said it earns a operating profit margin of 10.5 per cent in its commercial jetliner business, including sales of planes and related services.The 787 represents Boeing's bid to reinvent the civilian jetliner, using lightweight carbon fiber and new engines to allow it fly farther and burn 20 percent less fuel than current jets made largely of aluminum. Unlike aluminum, which corrodes when it comes into contact with carbon fiber, titanium works well with carbon fiber and expands minimally in response to the large temperature swings the big jets experience.But the 787 now faces dual competition from Airbus: its own carbon-composite plane, the A350, and a low-cost alternative, the A330neo, based on an older aluminum design updated with new, fuel-efficient engines.Those are likely to keep price pressure on both plane makers, ""especially in a low oil price environment,"" said Russell Solomon, aerospace analyst at Moody's Investor Service. While the rising level of deferred costs affects the 787's ultimate profitability, Solomon said, ""it's the ongoing cost that we're really paying attention to."" As part of its cost-reduction effort, Boeing considered shifting to less costly aluminum for seat tracks on the 787, industry sources say. Boeing said it didn't end up making the change, but declined to say why.Boeing has changed the cockpit window frame to aluminum from titanium, and has changed the frames of some doors to composite from titanium. Special coatings or materials are used to prevent aluminum corrosion, experts said. It wasn't known how much Boeing saved by the change. Boeing declined to comment.Boeing said it also is ""aggressively pursuing"" recycling to recapture the waste metal ""chips"" created as titanium parts are machined into finished shapes. BUYING 40 POUNDS TO GET 1The company is looking for even greater savings in its supply chain and production methods. The changes are not likely to affect raw metal prices, but could reduce the sales of some suppliers, and stem concern about supply constraints from Russia, experts said.One large 787 piece, used to help join the wings to the body, shows the potential for saving. The piece, known as the double plus chord, requires Boeing to buy about 40 pounds of titanium for every pound that ends up flying on the aircraft, said Bill Bihlman, president of metal consultancy Aerolytics LLC. After the piece is forged, a large amount of the outside must be ground off, leaving interior metal with intact grain and strength. Add in the high cost of machining hard metals like titanium, and the value of such pieces soars.""You can see why there's so much emphasis on titanium,"" Bihlman said.Noble, the Boeing official, declined to discuss specific parts, but said pieces with high ""buy-to-fly"" ratios are a focus. ""There are a whole lot of strategies we can use to reduce the buy-to-fly,"" he said.But substituting other metals won't be easy, Bihlman said. Steel weighs 65 percent more than titanium, and aluminum lacks titanium's strength and has the corrosion problem.But even though the titanium savings may ultimately be modest, Bihlman said, Boeing will wring them out ""because they have to.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1095,"Jul 23, 2015 01:32PM ET","Rheinmetall, Thales interested in Airbus sensor business ",nan,"By Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German defense group  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG) and French peer  Thales  (PA:TCFP) are among several groups interested in a defense electronics business that plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) is selling in an effort to streamline its operations, sources familiar with the transaction said. The two companies as well as U.S.-based Raytheon (N:RTN) and a number of private equity groups including Carlyle (O:CG), Bridgepoint, CVC, KKR (N:KKR), KPS and Triton are expected to hand in tentative offers for the Airbus business by a Friday deadline, they said. The price tag on the sale, dubbed ""Orlando"", which is led by investment bank Evercore (N:EVR), may reach up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), the people said. Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace group, is currently selling several businesses to focus its defense division on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites.Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine declined to comment on any specific talks, but told analysts that such opportunities were difficult to predict. ""Defense deals can only be opportunistic; it is too complex to make firm bets on a defense deal,"" he said in a conference call when asked about the company's criteria for expansion.A Rheinmetall spokesman said the company was following the divestment activities of Airbus, declining to comment further. The other companies and private equity investors all declined to comment. Europe's defense industry is struggling as most governments are keeping a lid on military spending and the asset sales are part of efforts announced by Airbus last year to sell half a dozen businesses with combined annual revenues of around 2 billion euros. The move breaks with the company's previous efforts to diversify into security activities and halts investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals. The business up for sale under the ""Orlando"" deal makes components for radars, optronics, electronic warfare and border control applications and has about 100 million euros in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on 1 billion euros in sales. The products are used, for example, in surveillance or for equipment that helps pilots to fly in fog or at night.Acquiring the business would allow Airbus's European defense peers to boost activities in an important area. But after looking at the initial information packages on the deal, some potential buyers said they doubted the business's financial prospects and did not expect it to sell at a high valuation.Although widely seen as a less likely outcome, defense sources said selling the sensors business to a non-European buyer would deal a further blow to the controversial Euro Hawk reconnaissance drone, which has been in limbo since Germany canceled it in 2013 over high costs. There have been reports that Berlin might revive the drone, developed by U.S. contractor  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC). But giving up manufacturing control of the drone's sensors could erode its European content and make other alternatives more attractive.The will to keep technology and jobs within certain regions, may hand German bidders good chances, as the business is significantly Germany-based, one of the sources said.But a third person said that any buyer would be sensitive to these matters and the nationality of the bidders did not really say much about qualities as a long-term owner.VIZADA In a separate deal, led by Lazard (N:LAZ), Airbus is selling part of its satellite communications arm Vizada and has attracted interest from groups including Thales and  Alcatel  (PA:ALUA) in a potential 700-800 million euro deal, people familiar with that transaction said. Disposals of other smaller businesses are also gaining pace. Airbus is in talks with a German investor over the sale of its ESG Elektroniksystem und Logistik business, which has about 250 million euros in sales, a person familiar with the matter said. Atlas Elektronik, a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG), also remains on the list of possible disposals. The German steelmaker is ready to buy the remaining stake in the supplier of sonar systems for maritime security it does not already own, but only at a price it deems reasonable, a person familiar with that process said.Last month, Airbus also sold a further stake in Elbe Flugzeugwerke to Singapore-based ST Aerospace, which now controls 55 percent of the maker of freight aeroplane components.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This certainly gives you confidence that they're going to get there,"" said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Boeing's shares jumped 1.5 percent to $147.31 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Revenue rose 11 percent to $24.54 billion, reflecting an 18 percent gain at Boeing's commercial aircraft business, as it delivered a record 197 planes. Defense revenue fell 3 percent, and profit margins dipped less than some analysts had feared, as Pentagon spending remains under pressure.Deferred costs on Boeing's 787 program rose by another $790 million, to $27.7 billion, but analysts said that rise was widely expected. The 787 program still loses money on each plane, which has focused investors' attention on cash flow. It is expected to begin generating cash next year.The Chicago-based company announced a charge of 77 cents per share related to the tanker program last week. As a result, it cut its full year earnings forecast on Wednesday by 50 cents a share, to $7.70 to $7.90 a share, less than the charge, suggesting it can make up for the tanker costs in other areas. ""The tanker charge is still a drag to both earnings and cash this year, and presents risk going forward,"" RBC analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a note. Core earnings, which exclude pension and other costs, fell to $1.62 per share from $2.42. But that exceeded analysts' average estimate of $1.37 a share, which included the tanker charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The tanker charge is the second Boeing has taken on the troubled project, bringing the total after-tax charges to just over $800 million.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Airbus hopes the increased presence in China would lead to more demand for the profitable but ageing wide-body A330 jets. In a statement posted on its website, the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone, said it expects construction of the plant to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017, with the first plane to be delivered to customers in early 2018.The plant will help further China's goal of building its own jets to cater to what is expected to become the world's biggest air transport market. Currently it depends mostly on imported jets from Airbus and Boeing (N:BA). Facilities for cabin decoration, painting, and flight testing of the A330 series would also be established in the next 10 years, the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone said. The agreement to build the A330 plant, which will be capable of fitting out 2 planes a month, came after China placed an order for 45 A330 aircraft worth at least $11 billion, together with provisional purchases of another 30 planes.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Customers typically receive an undisclosed discount off the list prices.FedEx said the aircraft will be delivered by Boeing for its FedEx Express arm over the fiscal years 2018-2023. The latest deal brings FedEx's firm orders for 767Fs to 106 and extends the company's drive to modernize its fleet.""Acquiring additional 767F aircraft...will enable us to reduce structural costs, improve our fuel efficiency and enhance the reliability of our global network,"" David J. Bronczek, president and chief executive officer of FedEx Express, said in the statement.The air cargo business has remained soft compared to the general aviation business since the 2008 global financial crisis. Weak demand, overcapacity and competition from the belly space of passenger planes has driven down yields and reduced the need for dedicated freighters.Boeing, however, has forecast that global air freight traffic will still grow at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, doubling cargo traffic over the next 20 years.FedEx had a fleet of 641 freighter aircraft as of May 31, according to data on its website. In addition to the 767F orders, it has also committed to 18 Boeing 777 freighters.On Tuesday, Boeing said that Taiwan's EVA Air had finalised an order for five 777 freighters worth $1.5 billion.""We appreciate the confidence that FedEx has shown in the 767,"" a Boeing spokesman said in a statement.The 767Fs will replace a number of older freighters, including Boeing MD10s and MD11s as well as Airbus Group (PA:AIR) A300-600s and A310s, which FedEx plans to retire in the coming years.While the passenger version of the 767 is being replaced by next-generation Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 aircraft, the freighter version remains in demand among cargo firms.

1099,"Jul 17, 2015 04:12PM ET","Boeing to take big U.S. tanker charge, says will hit profit",nan,"By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Friday it will take a $536 million after-tax charge in its second-quarter results to deal with problems in the fuel system on the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker it is developing for the U.S. Air Force.The Chicago-based company said the charge, which amounts to 77 cents per share, would result in lower earnings for the full year. It said added funds were needed to cover higher costs for development, certification and initial production of the tanker aircraft, while keeping the $49 billion, 179-aircraft program on track for initial deliveries of 18 tankers by August 2017.This is the second charge Boeing has taken on the KC-46 tanker, one of its biggest defense development efforts, bringing the total after-tax charges to just over $800 million, with the pre-tax bill reaching nearly $1.3 billion.The world's biggest commercial planemaker, which is also a major defense contractor, beat European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to win the contract in 2011, capping a nearly decade-long saga that saw two senior former Boeing executives serve prison terms for violating federal ethics rules.Boeing had long rejected U.S. Air Force estimates that it would cost the company over $1 billion more than expected to develop and test the refueling planes, but unexpected problems over the past year changed the situation, analysts said.Brigadier General Duke Richardson, who runs the program for the Air Force, said he remained optimistic that Boeing would meet its delivery targets and that the first fully integrated KC-46 tanker would fly in September, as planned.""While we have more heavy lifting coming up, we believe it is achievable and do not see any technical showstoppers,"" he said in a statement.Boeing must absorb the additional costs of development of the program since U.S. government costs are capped at $4.9 billion under a fixed-price contract. The company's shares were down 1.1 percent at $146.89 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Boeing said it would adjust its earnings per share outlook when it reports results on July 22, but said its outlook for revenue and cash flow would remain unchanged.The tanker investment will have a cash impact this year, but Boeing ""will make up for it in other ways"" to maintain its full-year cash outlook, said company spokesman Bernard Choi.Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc, who rates Boeing a buy with a $165 price target, said the charge was not a surprise, and investors were relieved that Boeing did not announce any further charges or problems with its 787 commercial airliner program. Losses on the 787 continue to rise, though the pace is slowing as Boeing improves the production system.Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Boeing knowingly underestimated its KC-46 development costs to prevent Airbus from winning the deal, but the losses were larger than the company initially expected.Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's former defense chief who took over as chief executive on July 1, said the longer-term outlook for the program remained upbeat, and it should turn a profit once the development phase is completed.Boeing said the extra spending was needed to fix the tanker's integrated fuel system, which delivers fuel to the aircraft itself and is also used for refueling other aircraft in mid-air after problems emerged during testing. It said testing of non-fuel system components is 90 percent complete, and it is making progress on its overall ground and flight test program. Boeing has forecast a long-term $80 billion market for refueling planes. Airbus beat Boeing to win a big South Korean tanker competition earlier this month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1100,"Jul 13, 2015 06:45PM ET",Delta offers to invest in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines: media,nan,"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) has offered to invest in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines Inc  as part of a restructuring plan for the budget carrier, according to a Japanese media report.The move has the potential to increase competition in Japan by allowing Delta to funnel international travelers via Tokyo to more Japanese cities that Skymark serves. A deal would give Delta a roughly 20-percent stake, although terms must still be concluded and approved by Skymark's creditors, according to the report by Nikkei Asian Review.A Delta spokeswoman said, ""It would be premature for us to comment on the matter."" Delta's President Ed Bastian said last month that the Atlanta-based airline had been approached about making the investment.Skymark could not immediately be reached for comment.Skymark holds many landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many travelers prefer to Narita International Airport because it is closer to Tokyo's downtown. Skymark's slots are for domestic routes only.If the deal succeeds, Delta could attempt to build Haneda as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles. Currently, Delta's connecting opportunities are limited because it has no alliance partner in Japan.Rival U.S. carrier United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) has an alliance with Japan's ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202), and rival  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has an alliance with  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201).Planemaker Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) and aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation Ltd (N:INTR) are the biggest creditors to Skymark, which ran into financial trouble after embarking on an ambitious expansion that included buying Airbus A380 jumbo jets.There are two restructuring plans for Skymark currently on the table, one involving ANA Holdings investing in Skymark, and one proposed by Intrepid. Creditor approval is key for either Skymark restructuring plan to go ahead.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But it signed an accord on Wednesday promising to study potential purchases from Boeing as it expands.VietJet did not provide details and industry sources said any potential sales would meet stiff competition from Airbus.The airline signed a contract for six more Airbus A321 jets worth $682 million last month, part of a bumper order of up to 100 planes over 10 years worth over $9 billion.In Washington on Wednesday, VietJet struck a preliminary deal with Honeywell Aerospace, part of Honeywell International (N:HON), to buy parts worth $56 million for Airbus jets.It also announced a preliminary deal with U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) to provide advice and arrange export credit agency (ECA) financing for VietJet's current and future fleet.Although the source of the ECA funding was not mentioned in a statement coinciding with the Washington signing ceremony, VietJet has said it expects to rely on European export credits to help fund at least 30 percent of its Airbus deliveries.JPMorgan advised Emirates on an ECA-backed Sukuk bond issued in Britain.So far, however, industry sources say VietJet has not used export credits from European governments that support Airbus, relying heavily on sale-and-lease back transactions instead.The deal comes days after the equivalent U.S. agency, the Export-Import Bank, saw its charter expire amid a political battle over its future.Boeing said this week a permanent loss of such financing would put it at a disadvantage. On Wednesday, a Boeing spokesman said VietJet was among airlines concerned over ExIm's future.VietJet posted a $24.7 million profit in 2014 and has said it expects that to more than double this year.It wants to boost its presence in Asia with new routes and joint ventures but has yet to announce how it plans to raise capital. VietJet said in April it would have an initial public offering this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1104,"Jul 06, 2015 08:24PM ET",Boeing says loss of Ex-Im Bank would be competitive disadvantage,nan,"By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Loss of U.S. Export-Import Bank financing would put  Boeing Co  (N:BA) at a ""huge competitive disadvantage"" since its rivals still have access to such financing support, the head of the company's commercial aircraft division told reporters on Monday.Ray Conner, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the planemaker was seeking to reassure its customers that the U.S. Congress would soon reauthorize the bank's charter, but said the lapse of the charter at the end of last month created some doubt.""We absolutely need Ex-Im Bank to compete on a level playing field,"" Conner said after a ceremony marking delivery of the first 787 Dreamliner to Vietnam Airlines, an aircraft that was purchased with the help of Ex-Im financing. Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist party, attended the ceremony at Ronald Reagan National Airport, along with 200 other U.S. and Vietnamese officials and industry executives. ""To not have that, we're just tying one hand behind our back, as far as I'm concerned,"" Conner said. ""The competition is not going to back away from that kind of financing.""John Wojick, Boeing senior vice president for global sales and marketing, said Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and China's aircraft makers had access to trade credits to help finance their sales. Conner said some rivals were capitalizing on the situation by highlighting uncertainty about whether Boeing's customers would have access to trade credits in the future.Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg told Reuters the bank's staff was putting together an orderly liquidation plan and completing transactions that had already been approved, but the lapse of the bank's charter meant it could not work on any new deals.Seven conservative Republican senators last week demanded the bank disclose plans to begin liquidating its assets after its charter expired amid congressional inaction.Ex-Im has said it will stay open to continue servicing $112 billion in existing obligations. The agency's operating budget has been approved through Sept. 30.Democrats and moderate Republicans hope to revive the trade bank later this month by attaching charter renewal legislation to a ""must-pass"" highway and rail transit funding bill.Deputy Secretary of Commerce Bruce Andrews told Reuters the Obama administration was concerned about the lapse of the bank's charter and hoped lawmakers would restart the bank soon. ""By unilaterally disarming and shutting down the Export-Import Bank, it creates a market advantage for our competitors from (countries like) China, Germany and Japan,"" Andrews said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1105,"Jul 02, 2015 07:09AM ET","'Wow, pulled back wrong throttle:' captain of crashed TransAsia plane",nan,"By Faith Hung and Siva GovindasamyTAIPEI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The pilot flying a TransAsia Airways (TW:6702) ATR mistakenly switched off the plane's only working engine seconds before it crashed in February, killing 43 people, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council (ASC) said in its latest report on Thursday.The ASC's report also showed that Captain Liao Jian-zong had failed simulator training in May 2014, in part because he had insufficient knowledge of how to deal with an engine flame-out on take-off.""Wow, pulled back the wrong side throttle,"" Liao, 41, was heard to say on voice recordings seconds before the crash.There appeared to be confusion in the cockpit as the two captains tried to regain control of the plane after one engine lost power about three minutes into the doomed flight.Liao reduced the throttle on the working engine but did not appear to realize his mistake until it was too late.He tried to restart the engines several times before a junior first officer in the cockpit said: ""Impact, impact, brace for impact.""Those were the chilling last words heard on the data recordings, according to the latest report of the ASC's investigation into the Feb. 4 crash.Seconds later the almost new ATR 72-600, which had 58 people on board, crashed upside down into a shallow river in Taipei after it lurched between buildings, clipping an overpass and a taxi.Fifteen people survived but all three pilots and 40 passengers and other crew died in the second crash involving a TransAsia ATR plane in a year.A source with direct knowledge of the report told Reuters on Wednesday the working engine had been shut off.FAILED SIMULATOR TRAININGThe ASC report, which neither assigns responsibility nor suggests recommendations, paints a more detailed picture than a preliminary report released days after the crash.Liao, a former air force pilot, began flying commercial aircraft in 2009 and joined TransAsia the following year. He was promoted to captain in August 2014 and joined the ATR 72-600 fleet in November.He had a total of 4,914 flight hours on ATR 72 planes.However, the report showed that Liao failed the simulator check in May 2014 when he was being evaluated for promotion. Assessors found he had a tendency not to complete procedures and checks, and his ""cockpit management and flight planning"" were also found wanting.However, he passed after a second simulator check on June 29 and 30 and was promoted to captain, although similar problems were detected during training from July 2-10 last year.Instructors commented that he was ""prone to be nervous and may make oral errors during the engine start procedure"" and displayed a ""lack of confidence"", the report shows.Issues cropped up again during training for the ATR 72-600 in November, when an instructor said Liao ""may need extra training"" when dealing with an engine failure after take-off.After the crash, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration put TransAsia's ATR pilots through oral proficiency tests on how to handle an aircraft during engine failure.All but one of the pilots passed the tests, although some needed more than one attempt. The lone failure was demoted in rank to vice captain from captain.The airline now has 61 ATR pilots.TransAsia president Fred Wu told a media conference later on Thursday the airline would buy an ATR flight simulator, bring in outside experts to evaluate pilots, and launch a safety improvement program with Airbus (PA:AIR).ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italian aerospace firm  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI).The airline has reached a settlement with the families of seven passengers, and negotiations were underway with the rest, said TransAsia CEO Peter Chen.A draft of the final report will be issued in November with the final report, which will include the cause of the crash and recommendations, to be completed in April 2016.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That compared with $379 million for the larger 747-8, which has struggled to attract orders.Boeing said the price increases reflect higher wages as well as rising costs for materials, parts and services. The 2.9 percent increase from 2014 prices compares with a 3.1 percent increase last year from 2013 and a 1.6 percent increase in 2013.By comparison, rival plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) lifted its list prices by 3.3 percent in January. The cheapest Airbus plane, the single-aisle A318, now lists for $6.3 million less than the least expensive Boeing plane, the 737-700, which lists for $80.6 million. At the top end, the largest Airbus plane, the A380, lists for $428 million.Airlines typically receive steep discounts from list prices, but the figures are used for valuing orders. Price increases are an annual exercise, and Boeing said the timing of the latest increase was not related to Dennis Muilenburg taking on the role of chief executive on Wednesday.

1107,"Jul 01, 2015 02:05PM ET",Aero-engine makers seek boost from major Airbus China deal,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - After Airbus's (PA:AIR) success it was the turn of engine makers to seek a boost from China's spending power on Tuesday as a major plane order generates lucrative follow-on opportunities.China placed an order for 45 A330 wide-body passenger jets on Tuesday, with plans for a possible further 30 aircraft in a deal worth between $11 billion and $18 billion.The order has now unleashed a battle between engine makers to win contracts with Chinese airlines who may ultimately benefit from the government-managed aircraft purchase, industry sources said on Wednesday.Engines are generally sold separately from aircraft.The aircraft ordered by China are current-generation A330s, which are available with a choice of engines from three manufacturers:  General Electric  (N:GE), United Technologies' (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit and Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR).Rolls-Royce is currently the market leader with its Trent 700 engine, but the Chinese order presents one of the largest available opportunities for rivals, notably GE, to jump in before Airbus switches to an exclusively Rolls-powered version of the A330, with a new engine, from late 2017.Rolls-Royce appears to have the edge going into the sales battle, a person closely watching the discussions said. The outsider is seen as Pratt & Whitney which is focused on completing a new engine design for smaller jets and has not been forceful in pushing its A330 engine in recent years.Pratt & Whitney said it continued to support the PW4000 engines designed for aircraft such as the A330, and that it did not as a policy comment on specific order discussions. GE and Rolls did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Shares in Airbus (PA:AIR) rose as much as 5 percent on the aircraft order, which eased uncertainty over future production rates for one of its most profitable models.Shares in Rolls-Royce rose 2.4 percent.SOUTH AFRICAN SWAPAirbus has won orders for 71 A330 aircraft in recent weeks and is on course to lift this beyond 100 if the second part of the China order and other pending deals are completed.It had an unfilled order backlog for 168 current-version A330s at end-May and analysts say it needs to increase this to around 300 to make a smooth transition to the new A330neo.After 20 orders from Saudi Arabia and at least 45 from China, it is closing in on a deal with South African Airways to swap an order for 10 smaller A320s for five A330s, industry sources said.Airbus has also won six orders for a military air tanker version of the A330 in the past week, including four from South Korea and two more from Australia.In addition it will seek to finalize a draft order for two A330s from Rwandair after the airline was reported to have won a loan from an African regional bank to finance the deal.After a renaissance in sales driven by delays in deliveries of rival Boeing's (N:BA) new 787 Dreamliner, which have since abated, the 20-year-old A330 has also been helped by lower oil prices.But industry sources say squeezing out the remaining sales is complicated by fragile second-hand values for the current A330 model as Airbus gets ready to develop the new A330neo.Airbus may need to discount sharply, but by doing so it risks alienating those existing owners who depend on solid secondary market values to realize their investments, a senior aircraft market executive said.Airbus has meanwhile carried out a cut in A330 output to nine a month from 10, originally planned for the fourth quarter, a spokesman said. It plans to reduce this further to six a month in the first quarter of next year, but the major Chinese order has dispelled concerns that it could have to cut even more.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We hope to have more orders in the future, but it's a project which makes a lot of sense and which gives us an advantage against our competition,"" Bregier told Reuters.The agreement to build a plant capable of fitting out 2 A330s a month is due to be signed during a visit to Toulouse by Li on Thursday, but that part of the Chinese premier's visit has been overshadowed by a threatened air traffic controllers' strike.Industry sources have said Airbus originally hoped to sell as many as 200 A330s to China, gambling on a 'Regional' version of its A330 long-haul jet to help deal with domestic congestion.The final transaction is still large enough to secure production of one of Airbus's most profitable planes, but one which is heading towards a revamp after 20 years in the market.Coming on top of a recent sale of 20 A330 planes to Saudi Arabia, it lifts uncertainty over Airbus's ability to meet recently reduced production targets while it prepares for the transition to the revised A330neo model from late 2017.""This should help us a lot to maintain a production rate of six a month that we announced for the transition,"" Bregier said. Airbus said the order for 45 jets was the largest for the A330 from China, which is projected to order a total of 5,300 jetliners over the next 20 years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1113,"Jun 23, 2015 12:24AM ET",JetBlue adds premium class to Boston flights on corporate demand,nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp on Tuesday said it will add its premium ""Mint"" class to transcontinental flights from Boston, the first new city for a service that JetBlue credits with helping it steal share from competitors.JetBlue will offer Mint service, the airline's answer to first and business class, on flights from Boston to San Francisco starting March 2016 and to Los Angeles starting in the fall of that year. On each route it will operate up to three round-trips daily on Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) SE A321 aircraft.The move reflects the budget airline's plan to roll out Mint to more cities since it entered the lucrative market for premium travel a year ago, starting with Mint between New York and the California hubs. JetBlue says it has won corporate customers in part because its Mint seats, which recline fully into beds, are priced below competitors' business-class fares. ""Corporate travel managers from companies that had never been willing to talk to us before (are) calling us and saying, 'Can we talk to you guys about a deal?'"" Marty St. George, executive vice president for commercial and planning, said in an interview.St. George said JetBlue has raised Mint prices at least twice because seats have sold out too fast, noting that higher prices will keep more tickets available for last-minute bookings. Dave Clark, the airline's vice president for network planning, said in an interview that JetBlue would consider additional West Coast destinations for Mint but would stop short of placing it on all transcontinental routes, which cannot necessarily sustain demand for the premium seats. ""We'll grow this as much as we can,"" he said.JetBlue also said it will operate an average of 118 daily flights from Boston in January 2016, up from 111 a year earlier. It also will start flying to Nashville for the first time, with service from Boston and Fort Lauderdale beginning in the spring of that year.Clark said the New York-based airline's guidance for 7 to 9 percent capacity growth in 2015 remains unchanged.JetBlue is the only major U.S. airline to forecast positive unit revenue growth this quarter, which Clark attributed to results from Mint, Fort Lauderdale and Boston, where it is the largest carrier. He added that JetBlue has fed on incoming traffic from international partners such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL], lining up schedules to connect with the airline.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Pooling our requirements should be done intelligently and not in a highly politicized, nationally fragmented way,"" said Enders, adding that he supported European co-operation.""This is something I will look for to be employed on this (surveillance drone) project.

1116,"Jun 18, 2015 03:55PM ET",Airbus steals show with last-minute $14 billion Wizz deal,nan,"By Victoria Bryan and Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) won the Paris Airshow with a last-minute $14 billion deal to sell 110 jets to Hungary's Wizz Air on Thursday, diverting attention from a growing industry debate over how quickly a record backlog of jet orders can be built.The deal, sealed in an all-night negotiating session with ordered-in pizza, avoided a rare defeat for the France-based planemaker at its home arena and is expected to be followed by orders for dozens of A330 jets from China in weeks to come.Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) CEO Jozsef Varadi made light of the marathon but is likely to have received a steep discount for his A321neo jets, after Boeing (N:BA) bid aggressively and Airbus appeared to be facing a disappointing end to a subdued week.""I don't like these air shows, because every time I come I buy something,"" Varadi joked in front of beaming Airbus officials at a hurriedly arranged news conference.Airbus ended the trade part of the June 15-21 show with orders and commitments for 421 aircraft worth $57 billion, against 331 aircraft worth $50.2 billion for Boeing. In terms of firm orders, Boeing came out on top with 154 worth $20.2 billion, against 124 for Airbus worth $16.3 billion.Although the competition had been running behind the scenes for some months, a Wizz Air deal was not expected to be ready in time for the show. ""This was higher than I personally expected,"" Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus Group's planemaking division, said of the total orders. Going into the show, Airbus had the lead over Boeing in plane orders, with 247 so far this year versus Boeing's 175. That had looked set to change at Le Bourget outside Paris as Boeing sold 100 jets to leasing company AerCap (N:AER).Boeing also produced a flourish apparently timed to coincide with the show, announcing a preliminary deal for 20 of its 747-8 freighters from Russian cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group.The deal supplies a lifeline to a programme that had been running out of orders.Many analysts believe the commercial jet market is slowing after riding out the financial crisis due to demand in Asia.But Airbus and Boeing executives expressed confidence in the market and said they were on course to reach their targets of selling at least as many planes as they make this year.Many delegates described the show as muted, with the focus on how manufacturers and suppliers can execute on almost a decade's worth of orders, rather than on winning new deals. SUPPLIER TENSIONSThe show revealed some tensions between planemakers and suppliers.  General Electric  (N:GE) said it wanted to secure a record increase in engine production for single-aisle planes before deciding whether it could go higher, echoing comments from partner  Safran  (PA:SAF).""One gets the feeling the airframers are pushing up against the limits of what the supply chain is willing to do,"" analyst Nick Cunningham said. Bregier said suppliers risked losing business if they did not wish to go along with still-higher production rates and sales chief John Leahy pointed out Airbus had two engine suppliers for its single-aisle planes. ""In this business we need to take risks and I have to educate my partners that when I take risks, these risks are well under control and they have to share that with me,"" Bregier said.Airbus shares, down 3 percent earlier on Thursday as the euro strengthened against the U.S. dollar, pared gains and closed down 0.5 percent. Boeing shares traded up 1 percent. Manufacturers made no major product announcements at the show. Airbus said it was still considering whether to re-engine or slightly stretch its A380 superjumbo and reiterated it was studying whether to expand its A350-1000 twin-engined long-haul jet, but no decision is expected soon.Boeing said it had not yet decided whether to invest in a middle-market jet to fill a gap in a potentially lucrative part of the market, which includes its 757, which is nearing retirement.The new management of smaller planemaker Bombardier (TO:BBDb) showed off the new CSeries jet for the first time at an air show. It did not win any new orders for the plane, which represents its push to compete in the market for smaller narrow-body jets dominated by Boeing and Airbus.The Canadian firm had tempered expectations in advance of the show, saying it did not expect any orders for the CSeries in Paris. It did, though, announce test results showing the plane performing better than expected.""They need to be getting orders at this stage so they helped brace the market for it, but it's not good news anyway,"" said Espirito Santo Investment Bank analyst Edward Stacey.Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) had a solid show with 50 orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong said that the move would help the company fill a gap in its network that was being exploited by rivals like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Qantas Airways Ltd.After the company discontinued its 19-hour non-stop service from Singapore to New York in 2013 because it was not profitable, the trip became five hours longer for its passengers.Singapore Airlines currently flies to four American cities -- Los Angeles and San Francisco via Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo; and New York via Frankfurt; and Houston with a stop in Moscow.""We, of course, want it as soon as possible,"" Goh said in an interview with Bloomberg, adding: ""There isn’t really a commercially viable aircraft that could fly nonstop.""Two years back, the carrier employed a four-engine 100-seat Airbus A340-500 for non-stop flights from Los Angeles and Newark in New Jersey to Singapore, but the route proved to be unsustainable. ""Although disappointing that we will be halting these services, we remain very committed to the US market,"" Goh said in 2012, announcing the discontinuation of the service. ""We will also continue to explore additional options to enhance our US services.""Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based aerospace consultant Teal Group, said, according to Bloomberg, that using a twin-engine plane would be more economical as they are made for the long haul.""It’s really a question of economics,"" Aboulafia reportedly said, adding: ""The last generation of very long-range jets, particularly the A340-500, was simply not efficient, which is what killed Singapore’s Newark service.""At the time, the Newark service was about 16,700 kilometers (9,941 miles) long and the Los Angeles flight was more than 14,000 kilometers.Airbus’ A350, which signed a deal with Qatar Airways in January, can travel up to 8,200 nautical miles, while Boeing’s 777-200LRs can travel 8,625 nautical miles. However, currently the topmost choice among wide-body jetliners remains the upgraded version 777X, which is not in operation yet but can fly over 9,300 nautical miles. As of now, Qantas Airways’ flight from Sydney to Dallas Fort Worth with the Airbus A-380 jumbo is the longest non-stop flight to the U.S.Singapore Airlines is also trying to increase partnerships with other airlines like Air New Zealand Ltd. and Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. to get more destinations on its plate. It is planning to develop hubs outside Singapore to get a wider network connectivity.The company's planes will be empowered with new technology that would allow its flights to make the non-stop journey between Singapore and the U.S. ""We’re among the earlier adopters of new technology,"" Goh reportedly said, adding: ""That certainly puts us in a very good position to compete and also to take advantage of those technology to serve new points."""

Conceived as a plan to help Russia develop a foothold in the global planemaking business, Superjet's Russian-built SSJ100 operated its first commercial flight in 2011 and since then just over 50 of the 100 seat-aircraft have been delivered.""We need to offer a stretched version,"" Superjet Executive Vice President Eugene Andrachnikov said in an interview at the Paris air show onboard a Superjet soon to be delivered to Mexican carrier Interjet.""We are contemplating that this will be in operation by 2020,"" he added.Internal talks were ongoing about the bigger jet, the executive said, and he expected a decision to be made by the end of the year.The larger jet being considered by Superjet, which competes with regional planes made by Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb), would have 120 seats and be powered by the same engine as the SSJ100 but with a different wing.""We're discussing financing with shareholders, we need to persuade them of the market need,"" Andrachnikov said. Aviation consultancy Flightglobal Ascend has forecast a market for 4,071 regional jets worth $128.3 billion by 2033.In the meantime, talks with potential new customers for the SSJ100 continued, Andrachnikov said, adding he expected to win a first order in China some time next year, given an expected boost from a joint Russian-Chinese leasing company being set up. Sukhoi is part of state-owned United Aircraft Corp (UAC), an umbrella corporation Russian President Vladimir Putin created in 2006 to revive the country's aircraft industry in partnership with Italy's Finmeccanica.Under EU sanctions on Russia, UAC, which produces MiG and Sukhoi warplanes, is barred from raising new capital in Europe via securities with a maturity of more than 30 days, but Andrachnikov shrugged off the impact.""We don't feel or sense any kind of tension in this regard, so we keep rolling,"" he said.UAC said on Monday it was working on a new wide-body aircraft with a Chinese company which it wanted to be flying by 2025, as part of an ambitious project to take on Western planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1119,"Jun 16, 2015 10:04AM ET",Commercial plane orders slow; jetmakers focus on backlog,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Andrea ShalalPARIS (Reuters) - The boom in commercial plane orders of recent years appears to be giving way to a more sustainable pace of demand at the 2015 Paris air show, with jetmakers increasingly focused on lifting production to meet their record backlog of sales.U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) continued to unveil a steady stream of deals on Tuesday, day two of the aerospace industry's main annual gathering.Boeing announced the biggest firm order of the event so far, with Dutch aircraft leasing company AerCap (N:AER) buying 100 737 MAX 8 jets in a deal worth $10.7 billion at list prices, confirming a Reuters report.Industry sources also said Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) would split a $6 billion order for 60 jets between Airbus and Boeing.However, the number and size of the deals to date is below that of many recent trade shows, when cheap borrowing costs and strong growth in passenger numbers encouraged airlines to splash out on new, more fuel-efficient planes.""The market is definitely slowing,"" said Sash Tusa, aerospace and defense analyst at Agency Partners. ""There are fewer orders this week than there have been at any air show in recent years. Manufacturers are going to have to fight much harder for what's available.""Some moderation in demand had been widely anticipated. Industry sources told Reuters on the eve of the show that, barring any last-minute surprises, Airbus and Boeing might struggle to announce 500 orders between them, compared with 697 at the Farnborough event last year with which Paris takes turns.There seems little prospect of a sharp deterioration in demand, however. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet sales on Monday, citing the rapid expansion of airlines in Asia and the Middle East and echoing a similarly upbeat outlook from Boeing last week.But the biggest challenge facing planemakers now is to ramp up production to meet the record $1.8 billion of orders they have booked for the coming decade. Boeing is already planning to increase output of its popular 737 narrow-body jet to 52 a month in 2018 from 42 currently. Its commercial airplanes chief, Ray Conner, said on Tuesday the company would be cautious about taking any decision to raise production towards 60 a month - a level mooted as possible for both Airbus and Boeing.PRUDENT ON PRODUCTION""We are going to be very prudent in how we approach any rates above 52. It feels like the demand is higher than that, but that can be short-lived. So we are ... going to see how things progress,"" he told reporters. ""The worst thing for any of us is to oversupply; our intention is to not oversupply.""Conner also issued a warning to Airbus following reports the European group might apply for government loans to develop a revamped version of its A380 superjumbo.""Whether they go forward with that, we will address as it comes along. That would not be in line with what the WTO (World Trade Organization) has said,"" he said.The United States and Europe have been in a long-running trade dispute over mutual accusations of aircraft subsidies, with the row now evolving into one over whether each side has complied with WTO rulings. In a bid to revive flagging sales of the A380, the world's biggest passenger jet, Airbus is in talks with customers about possibly adding new engines or making a version with about 50 more seats.Away from passenger jets, Airbus said on Tuesday it would start a two-year development phase for a new helicopter aimed at improving fuel-efficiency and comfort for civilian customers in markets such as search and rescue and the energy sector.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Reuters previously reported Airbus Helicopters planned to launch development of the X6, a long-awaited follow-up to its H225 Super Puma model, at the Paris show after the resolution of a standoff between parent Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and the French government over funding for the project.Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the X6 -- a so-called ""heavy"" helicopter -- would primarily target the oil and gas industry as well as search and rescue services, and would meet customer demands for more comfortable helicopters that can go further. ""It will be smoother, more comfortable, lower levels of noise ... And a much higher level of fuel efficiency,"" he said.He also said the X6 would be the company's first civil helicopter to feature Airbus's fly-by-wire technology, found in Airbus jets and which uses computers to fly the aircraft within safe limits.Faury said he was ""keeping an eye"" on the potential sale of Sikorsky. United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) said on Monday it was exiting the helicopter business and would decide by the end of the third quarter whether to spin off or sell its $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit, the U.S. military's largest helicopter maker.Faury added Airbus Helicopters was getting some demands to postpone deliveries to customers due to the tough oil and gas market, but that there had been no cancellations so far.He said the need for energy companies to reduce costs was even driving them to look at newer, more efficient helicopters, pointing to an order on Monday from lessor Milestone Aviation for H175 helicopters.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The rest will stay on the ground until replacements are needed, said OneWeb, based in Britain's Channel Islands.Bankrolled in part by Richard Branson's London-based Virgin Group and chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, the project will cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, OneWeb founder and Chief Executive Officer Greg Wyler said. Airbus Defense and Space will build the first 10 spacecraft at its Toulouse, France, facility, before shifting production to an undisclosed site in the United States, Airbus said.Several other companies were vying for the spacecraft contract, including Thales Alenia Space, Space Systems/Loral,  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's Space Systems and OHB of Germany, the industry trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology reported.Some of OneWeb's satellites will be flown by Branson's space company, Virgin Galactic, which is developing a low-cost, small satellite launcher as well as a suborbital passenger spaceship.Wyler declined to disclose how much Virgin and Qualcomm are investing in the project. As part of the deal, unveiled in January, Branson and Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs joined OneWeb's board of directors.    Before starting OneWeb, Wyler co-founded satellite venture, O3b Networks, and briefly worked at Google Inc  on another project to beam Internet access from space.

1122,"Jun 15, 2015 09:32AM ET","Planemakers' order books bulge on Asia, Middle East demand",nan,"By Victoria Bryan and Sarah YoungPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) opened the Paris air show with a flurry of multi-billion-dollar plane deals on Monday as demand from Middle Eastern and Asian airlines swelled their already bulging order books.Airbus signed up Saudi Arabian Airlines to be the launch customer of its new A330-300 Regional aircraft, with the carrier committing to 20 of the planes as well as 30 A320neo jets in a deal worth about $8.2 billion at list prices.The European planemaker also said Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) had signed a letter of intent to buy 30 A350 XWB jets, potentially worth around $9 billion.The same airline, meanwhile, committed to buy up to 30 of Boeing's (N:BA) 787-9 Dreamliners and 30 737 MAX 8 jets in a deal that could be worth about $10.9 billion.Despite the activity, analysts expect this year's aerospace industry meeting to produce fewer blockbuster deals than in the recent past, with the focus turning to the task of producing the $1.8 trillion of jets already sold.Nonetheless, demand remains robust, particularly from fast-growing Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. Airbus on Monday raised its 20-year forecast for jet demand by nearly 4 percent to 32,600, driven by growth from these regions.That broadly echoed Boeing's assessment of the market last week.Unlike Boeing, Airbus sounded upbeat about prospects for four-engined superjumbos, including its A380 - the world's biggest passenger plane, which has so far failed to live up to sales expectations. ""Very large aircraft are required over the next 20 years, we can't just increase efficiency,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy told a news conference, pointing to airport congestion as a reason to use larger planes.In a bid to revive interest in the A380, Airbus is in talks with customers about possibly putting new engines on the jet or making a version with about 50 more seats.BACKLOGBoeing said on the eve of the air show that it was exploring a potential market of more than 1,000 jets in a niche between its single-aisle 737 and wide-body 787, but had not decided whether to invest in a new plane.Many in the industry, however, are increasingly wary of an order backlog stretching out over almost a decade and of manufacturers' plans to keep pushing up output levels. GE Aviation (N:GE) said on Monday it wanted to secure a record increase in production of engines for Airbus and Boeing single-aisle aircraft before deciding whether it could guarantee going even higher.Heading into the air show, Airbus had a lead over Boeing in plane orders this year, with 247 versus Boeing's 175. Adding to Monday's flurry of deals, Qatar Airways ordered 10 Boeing 777-8X jets and four 777 freighters, valued at a total of $4.8 billion at list prices, while GE Capital Aviation Services ordered 60 Airbus A320neo aircraft valued at around $6.4 billion.Airbus's deal with Saudi Arabian Airlines comes after French President Francois Hollande met the head of the airline in May during a Gulf Arab leaders summit in Saudi Arabia.France, deemed to have the toughest stance among the six world powers negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program, has been able to nurture new commercial links with the region in the face of what some Gulf countries perceive as disengagement on the part of traditional ally the United States.At 7.10 a.m EDT, Airbus shares were up 0.4 percent at 60.67 euros in a European blue-chip index (FTEU3) down 1.1 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1123,"Jun 15, 2015 06:14AM ET","Exclusive: AirAsia CEO tells investors plans up to $300 million bonds, jet sales as shares skid",nan,"By Anshuman DagaSINGAPORE (Reuters) - AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA) Group Chief Executive Tony Fernandes has written to investors spooked by a report questioning accounting at Asia's biggest budget airline, saying it will raise funds at loss-making associates and may sell planes to cut group debt.In a response to AirAsia shares falling to five-year lows, the CEO said the group plans to issue as much as $150 million in convertible bonds at each of its Philippine and Indonesian associates. Fernandes, who has led AirAsia's rise to a billion-dollar business from a two-plane operation in 2002, wrote in his letter that the company may also sell and lease back up to 20 aircraft in the group's fleet this year.The comments in Fernandes' letter, sent on Monday and reviewed by Reuters, came days after Hong Kong-based firm GMT Research issued a report questioning AirAsia's accounting practices. In its report, GMT said AirAsia used transactions with associate companies to boost earnings, startling investors and leading the airline's shares to fall to a five-year intra-day low on June 12.Fernandes' plans also come as some analysts question a strategy they say hinges on a raft of associate airlines, some of which are losing money amid stiff competition and now overdue on loan repayments to AirAsia. AirAsia has become the world's second-worst performing large and mid-sized airline stock this year after Virgin America (O:VA), with a decline of 34 percent, Reuters data shows.""Some of the details here are still work-in-progress but what is written will more or less be reality,"" Fernandes said in the letter to investors. ""Due to the recent movement in our share price, we are sharing the details with you earlier than planned,"" he said, without making reference to the GMT report.AirAsia officials declined to comment on GMT's report or the letter from Fernandes.Though a leader in the world's fastest-growing aviation market, AirAsia has been hit by competition from the likes of the Jetstar unit of Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Indonesia's Lion Air, and slid to a net loss for October-December 2014 before rebounding on lower fuel costs. The carrier, the biggest Asian customer of plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR), is now taking on fewer new aircraft to manage capacity. On Monday, AirAsia's shares dropped as much as 3.9 percent, after falling a total of as much as 18 percent since GMT published its report on June 10.""AirAsia's regional airline associate ventures are turning out to be more problematic than we initially anticipated,"" HSBC analysts said last week in a report titled ""United We Fall.""""With the exception of Thai AirAsia, all the other airline ventures are loss-making and are being increasingly funded by the parent. Consequently, loans to associates doubled in 2014 (more than 50 percent overdue) and equaled half of AirAsia's equity value, the highest level in history.""AirAsia has previously said it plans to list the Philippine and Indonesian associates to raise funds to develop business, but has been hit by weaker demand and excess capacity in Southeast Asia.In his letter, Fernandes said the business is improving.""We believe that 2015 will be a very good year on the back of a better operating environment and a much more rational market. We have shown you good progress in 1Q15 ... We believe in results, not words,"" Fernandes said.GMT said on Monday that AirAsia's recent moves appear to be steps in the right direction, though other issues remain unsolved. ""It appears management shares our concerns about leverage across the group,"" Gillem Tulloch, the founder of the research firm told Reuters in an email.Fernandes said in the letter to investors that AirAsia is looking to take the loss-making associates in Philippines and Indonesia public in 2017, seeking valuations of about $700 million for the Indonesia firm and $600 million for the Philippines business.""I guess there is probably a bit of scepticism, they are saying 'We're going to be bringing in a couple of investors to invest in equity (in associate companies), and also in convertible bonds', so they can use the money raised to pay back into the company's balances,"" said Timothy Ross, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).""But I would ask, who is going to invest in a business that doesn't make any earnings, just to see their investment going up to the parent company?""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1124,"Jun 15, 2015 05:52AM ET",Airbus increases 20-year jet demand forecast,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) increased its 20-year forecast for jet demand by nearly 4 percent on Monday and was upbeat about prospects for superjumbos such as its troubled A380 plane, driven by growth in emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region and China.Airbus sees demand for 32,585 new planes worth $4.9 trillion, up from a previous forecast in September for 31,358 planes worth $4.6 trillion, it said at the Paris Airshow. The European firm trimmed its forecast for global passenger growth, predicting an annual average rate of 4.6 percent over the next 20 years, compared with last year's forecast for 4.7 percent.The growth of the middle class in developing countries would drive traffic growth, sales chief John Leahy said at a briefing.""When people have disposable income they use it to fly,"" he said.Last week, U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) similarly raised its long-term forecast for aircraft demand while trimming its prediction for traffic growth.Airbus increased its forecast for single-aisle jets to nearly 22,927, compared with a previous figure for 22,071, and said it expected demand for 9,658 new wide-body planes and freighters.Breaking down the figures for the wide-body category, Leahy said Airbus saw demand for 1,550 very large aircraft, an increase of 49 aircraft on its last forecast made in September.Last week, Boeing cut its forecast for very large aircraft -- planes with four-engines and including Airbus' A380 superjumbo, which is struggling for sales -- to 540 from 620 a year ago.""Very large aircraft are required over next 20 years, we can't just increase efficiency,"" Leahy said, pointing to airport congestion as a reason to use larger planes.Airbus planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier said on Friday that Boeing's decision to cut its forecast implied it was giving up on its 747-8, which has also been suffering slow sales. But Boeing officials at the air show said there was good demand for 747-8 freighters due to a pick-up in the cargo market.The focus at this year's Paris show, which runs from June 15-21 is on the supply chain and how the industry can cope with ramping up aircraft production to meet record backlogs.Airbus plans to increase production of its best-selling A320 single-aisle planes to 50 a month from the first quarter of 2017 and confirmed on Monday it was studying an increase beyond that.Leahy said he expected a decision to increase production to be made by the end of the year.Boeing is planning to move to a rate of 52 a month for its 737 jet in 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1126,"Jun 12, 2015 12:44AM ET",Exclusive: Two Zodiac aero plants in U.S. show why delays persist,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSANTA MARIA, California (Reuters) - At a  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC) seat factory in the small town of Santa Maria north of Los Angeles, workers on the assembly line frequently sit idle, waiting for parts to arrive.The factory's output has more than doubled in recent years, and much of the factory is working overtime shifts and weekends, workers say. But it still cannot keep pace with surging demand for fancy first- and business-class airline seats. Some products are almost a year behind schedule, according to people familiar with the operation.    The parts supply and other problems at the California factory offer explanations for Zodiac's warning to shareholders on Thursday that it likely would fail to meet its target of generating operating income close to last year's in the financial year ending on Aug. 31.Production delays at this and another Zodiac plant that makes cabin interiors also highlight the ongoing challenges the big aerospace supplier faces as it tries to keep pace with the ambitious production schedules at aircraft makers seeking to capitalize on a surge in global airlines' demand for new jets.     Zodiac said it is building 700 seats a day but is still 1,700 behind schedule, down from 6,000 in March. The delays have already slowed some jet deliveries, and they put at risk production plans at plane makers  Boeing Co  (N:BA), Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR),  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3).     Zodiac held to a promise to get the seat production problems ironed out by the end of August.""The fact that we have been able to reduce quite a lot of the delays on the most complicated seats gives us confidence in our capacity to reduce the (overall) delay,"" Zodiac Chief Executive Olivier Zarrouati said on a conference call on Thursday.        WAITING FOR PARTSIn Santa Maria, Zodiac is in the process of expanding operations into a nearby building, with a new warehouse and assembly lines. Boeing has sent dozens of people to help, and installed two office trailers outside the factory. Zodiac also is using computer stations and white boards to track production, according to people at the factory.""Missing parts were one of the principal causes of the delays,"" Zodiac said in response to questions from Reuters. ""Prevention of this type of problem is one of the pillars of the Focus plan that we are implementing.""Some work is being done in walkways, obstructing movement of fork lifts. In other areas, workers are so close together they bump into each other. And in some places, empty boxes and debris clutter the shop floor, people familiar with the operation say.Zodiac executives said Thursday that the costs to fix the seating business are running high. That's apparent at the Santa Maria plant, where the workforce has more than tripled in size to about 1,800 people from 500 several years ago. Hundreds of workers are employed sanding, painting and assembling seat shells.     Despite Zodiac's efforts, Santa Maria production still frequently stops because workers run out of supplies, according to workers and others familiar with the situation. ""People are standing around waiting for parts,"" an assembly worker said in an interview.FIGHTING FIRES The Santa Maria factory makes seat ""shells,"" fiberglass enclosures that wrap around premium seats, holding video screens and foot rests and creating personal space. Many airlines want customized shells, which require a lengthy certification process with regulators.Similar problems are affecting cabin interior parts such as lavatories and galleys. ""The problem we have is variability,"" said a worker at Zodiac's interiors factory in La Palma, California. ""It is difficult to run an assembly line when each one is so different. It makes us a firefighting department.""    Customer demands also are stringent. Seat shells must be cosmetically flawless when delivered. Any slip of a screwdriver - the assembly is done with hand tools - can scratch a finish and send the shell back for repainting or new veneer. New workers typically slip a few times as they learn.That points to another issue: Zodiac has hired contractors from around the country because the Santa Maria workforce of farm and construction workers lack manufacturing skills. Now some are leaving to take other work, adding to factory turnover. Zodiac customers say it has struggled to keep pace with the flood of orders. Deliveries of Boeing 787 jetliners to American Airlines (O:AAL), for example, were delayed from November 2014 to January 2015 awaiting shells from Zodiac, the airline said. Delays also affected American Airlines' retrofit of Boeing 777-200s. The shells were highly customized and took longer to produce than Zodiac estimated, people familiar with the program say. That was not uncommon with other airlines that ordered customized shells, these people said.Zodiac said the 777-200 deliveries now ""are almost in line with a revised schedule.""Boeing and Airbus have publicly chastised Zodiac for the delays. They also have restricted the work Zodiac can bid on until its operations improve.Zodiac said that move is ""understandable,"" but noted that airlines, not plane makers, choose seat suppliers. At the plane makers, frustrations remain. ""It is difficult,"" Airbus Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams said in a recent interview. ""It is probably not as bad as it was in October or November, but it is still challenging.""Boeing has said the costs of managing the problems are high. ""The reason we invest so much money in paying attention to the supply base is because it can have a significant impact on our production system,"" said Kent Fisher, who manages Boeing's supply chain. ""Including delaying (aircraft) deliveries.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing has said the jet would be available around 2030.Boeing's stock rose 1 percent to $143.02 in midday trading in New York.Single-aisle aircraft such as Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 will account for $2.7 trillion in the next 20 years, or 26,730 jets, Boeing said.It revised up its forecasts for twin-engine jets like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. But it again lowered its view of demand for four-engine jumbos: the Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 and Boeing 747. The companies disagree about demand for jets with seating for over 400 people.Boeing predicted deliveries of 540 of these planes in the next 20 years, down from 620 a year ago, leaving little room for the A380 which is struggling for orders.In its last forecast issued in 2014, Airbus predicted 1,500 deliveries of the A380 and 747 over 20 years.Boeing maintained its long-range forecast for average annual cargo traffic growth at 4.7 percent, but said the market was strengthening and that this trend would continue.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1129,"Jun 09, 2015 02:24PM ET",New effort to ease travel anxiety: assuring your bag fits in bin,nan,"By Alwyn ScottMIAMI (Reuters) - Air travelers are all too familiar with carry-on bag anxiety: the feeling sparked by last-minute and sometimes seemingly arbitrary decisions that a piece of luggage is too large to fit in the overhead bin.On Monday, the world's aviation trade organization, which also focuses on weighty issues such as flight safety and airline profitability, announced a new minimum luggage size standard and an effort to get world airlines to sign on to the move.The goal is to give airlines and passengers assurance that compliant bags can board the plane, no questions asked.""It'll reduce fights between gate agents and passengers,"" Thomas Windmuller, a vice president of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said at the group's annual meeting in Miami.However, the new size is slightly smaller than many current standards. At 21.5 inches (55 cm) by 13.5 inches (35 cm) by 7.5 inches (20 cm), including wheels, that is slightly smaller than the 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches that United Airlines (N:UAL), American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) currently allow. IATA worked with plane makers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) to find a size guaranteed to fit in bins of planes with 120 seats or more, at least a 737 or A319. Travelers on smaller regional aircraft still take the risk of bags being barred from boarding.IATA said it is talking with major luggage brands, including Tumi and Samsonite, on making bags at the new size, which it expects will be available this year. Manufacturer Crown Luggage of China has already produced sample suitcases, which IATA handed out at its three-day event.The new bags carry an IATA ""Cabin OK"" tag to tell gate agents and flight crews that the luggage is compliant. Each tag also has a unique tracking number that will allow owners to locate a lost bag via a website, okoban.com. So far, IATA said airlines interested in signing on to the standard include Brazil's Azul, Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL], Avianca (CN:AVT_p), Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293), China Eastern (SS:600115), China Southern (SS:600029) and Caribbean Airlines.IATA expects others to join in coming months, around the same time bags become available in stores.""I haven't come across an airline yet that said this is a terrible idea,"" said Windmuller. The program is voluntary, and airlines can refuse bags if they suddenly change a flight to a smaller aircraft.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The CSeries is nearing certification after years of delays and cost overruns, and two test planes will be at Paris, the jet's first air show appearance.""Paris, to be honest with you, it's one milestone, but it's not that critical,"" Bellemare said in an interview. ""It's a few days in a year. It's a few days in the life of a 20-, 25-year program.""Bellemare, who took over as chief executive of the Canadian company in February, did not say whether Bombardier was expecting to announce new orders at the event, seen as a key sales opportunity for plane makers.Bellemare acknowledged that Bombardier is under pressure to discount the CSeries. The mid-range CSeries has put it in competition with heavyweights Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), and even though certification looks all but certain, Bombardier has not announced a firm order since September.""Every time there's a new product coming to market, you have competitive pressure, you have people saying you have to discount the aircraft to get your fair share of the market,"" said Bellemare.Asked whether some CSeries deals might be loss-making in the short term, he said Bombardier will do what is responsible for customers, but also for shareholders.""We're not going to do deals that our shareholders won't want us to do because we're responsible leaders,"" he said.

There are two aircraft ready to start the delivery process as soon as the temporary suspension of the license has been lifted,"" an Airbus Defence & Space spokeswoman said on Sunday.On Saturday, Spain's defense minister was quoted as saying the Madrid authorities had scheduled a meeting with Airbus on Monday to pose a series of questions following the crash.""If the answers to the questions are positive, test flights of the grounded prototypes will be restarted and, from there, the authorization for the others will start being granted. It's all about allowing the company to implement the corrections they consider appropriate and to continue to operate, which is what we want,"" Pedro Morenes told newspaper El Pais.  He also warned against scapegoating Spanish workers over the incident.  ""As Fernando Alonso (head of Airbus' military aircraft division) said, this is not a problem of Seville, Toulouse or Hamburg, but of Airbus. The responsibility of this company's products is the company itself, independently of where they're produced.""A senior Airbus executive was quoted last month as blaming the crash on poor quality controls in Seville where the A400M is completed. The remarks ruffled feathers in Spain, where an investigation is continuing into the causes of the crash. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders sought on Sunday to smooth the concerns.""I fully agree with Pedro Morenes, it is a matter for Airbus as a whole and not just Sevilla or our hardworking and extremely dedicated people producing the A400M,"" Enders said in remarks relayed by the spokeswoman.He expressed full confidence in Alonso to take the right decisions on the A400M together with Spanish authorities.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1133,"Jun 05, 2015 06:34PM ET",Boeing predicts both strong air traffic and plane sales this year,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said it expects airline passenger traffic to rise more than 6 percent in 2015, possibly close to 6.5 percent, above its long-range forecast of about 5 percent.The world's largest plane maker said it still expects to book firm orders for at least 750 new airplanes this year, though it has booked only 136 net orders so far in 2015. ""We've got work to do,"" to hit the order target, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said in a series of briefings ahead of the Paris Airshow that starts June 15. ""We have a lot of things in the pipeline,"" he added, referring to potential orders. ""We're on plan.""Boeing's forecast is in line with actual growth in air travel. Figures released by the International Air Traffic Association (IATA) on Thursday show worldwide passenger traffic rose 6.3 percent in the first four months of 2015 compared with the same period last year. Boeing said 2014 growth was 6 percent.Orders and traffic growth are carefully watched by investors in Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR). The stocks of both companies have languished in recent weeks amid concern that the companies will not be able to keeping booking the record-setting orders they have in recent years.Boeing's widely watched forecast suggests that 160 million additional passengers will fly this year, and equates to a need for 900 new aircraft, not counting replacements, Tinseth said. Airbus and Boeing combined expect to deliver more than 1,300 new aircraft this year.Tinseth said Boeing expects cargo traffic to rise about 5 percent, and that should help the company sell more of its 747-8 freighters. IATA said cargo traffic rose 4.3 percent in the first four months of 2015, compared with the same period of 2014.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1134,"Jun 05, 2015 03:57AM ET","Exclusive: Vietnam eyes Western warplanes, patrol aircraft to counter China",nan,"By Siva GovindasamySINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam is in talks with European and U.S. contractors to buy fighter jets, maritime patrol planes and unarmed drones, sources said, as it looks to beef up its aerial defenses in the face of China's growing assertiveness in disputed waters.The battle-hardened country has already taken possession of three Russian-built Kilo-attack submarines and has three more on order as part of a $2.6 billion deal agreed in 2009. Upgrading its air force would give Vietnam one of the most potent militaries in Southeast Asia.The previously unreported aircraft discussions have involved Swedish defense contractor Saab (ST:SAABb), European consortium Eurofighter, the defense wing of Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and U.S. firms  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and Boeing (N:BA), said industry sources with direct knowledge of the talks. Defense contractors had made multiple visits to Vietnam in recent months although no deals were imminent, said the sources, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Some of the sources characterized the talks as ongoing.One Western defense contractor said Hanoi wanted to modernize its air force by replacing more than 100 ageing Russian MiG-21 fighters while reducing its reliance on Moscow for weapons for its roughly 480,000-strong military.Vietnam has ordered about a dozen more Russian Sukhoi Su-30 front-line fighters to supplement a fleet of older Su-27s and Su-30s.""We had indications they want to reduce their dependence on Russia. Their growing friendship with America and Europe will help them to do that,"" said the defense contractor.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, during a visit to Vietnam on Sunday, pledged $18 million to help Hanoi buy U.S. patrol boats. But any deal with Lockheed or Boeing would likely be the most significant involving a U.S. firm since Washington started easing a long-time embargo on the sale of lethal weapons to Vietnam in October.The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said it had forwarded questions from Reuters about the aircraft discussions to the appropriate authorities.Boeing said in an email it believed it had capabilities in ""intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms that may meet Vietnam's modernization needs"". It gave no specifics.Lockheed and Saab declined to comment. Eurofighter and Airbus did not respond to a request for comment.CHINESE OIL RIGWhile communist parties rule both Vietnam and China and annual trade has risen to nearly $60 billion, Vietnam has long been wary of China, especially over Beijing's claims to most of the South China Sea.China's placement of an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam for more than two months last year infuriated Vietnam and underscored the coastal country's need to upgrade its maritime patrol capabilities in particular. Vietnam's military budget is a state secret, although data collated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) put defense spending at $3.4 billion in 2013, more than double the amount a decade ago. Experts say actual spending could be much higher given the hardware acquired over recent years.Among the aircraft under discussion with Vietnam were Saab's Gripen E fourth-generation fighter jet as well as the Saab 340 or 2000 twin-engine turboprops fitted with maritime patrol and airborne early warning systems, said a source with direct knowledge of those talks.Vietnam had held talks over the Typhoon warplane made by Eurofighter as well as the F/A-50 light fighter jointly developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KS:047810) and Lockheed, separate sources said.Lockheed had discussed its Sea Hercules, the maritime patrol version of its C-130 transport plane.Meanwhile, an additional source said Boeing wanted to sell its maritime surveillance aircraft program, which involves putting state-of-the-art P-8 Poseidon plane surveillance technology, although not anti-submarine capabilities, on a business jet.Vietnam had also looked at unarmed surveillance drones made by Western and Asian contractors. VIETNAM WAR LEGACYVietnam has already started moving slowly away from Russia in recent years, buying Canadian Twin Otter amphibious planes and Airbus Defence CASA C-212 maritime patrol aircraft for its coastguard and Airbus C-295 transport planes.Airbus Defence had been in talks to offer maritime patrol and airborne early warning systems on the C-295, a source said. In addition, Airbus Helicopters had been in preliminary talks with the Vietnamese military.Despite increasingly warm ties with Washington, some experts said the legacy of the Vietnam War might make Hanoi wary about buying too much U.S. weaponry, possibly giving Sweden an edge.""There is no ideological bias (in Vietnam) with Sweden,"" said Tim Huxley, executive director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Asia.""The Gripen E will be a cost-effective option. Saab can offer a package that includes maritime patrol and airborne early warning aircraft.""However, one U.S. source familiar with Vietnam's goals said Hanoi saw Washington as a more reliable partner should tension with China escalate.""Vietnam is interested in building a much closer relationship with the United States, but they also don't want to anger China,"" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""They're looking for a balanced, phased, or step-by-step approach.'   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1135,"Jun 03, 2015 07:23AM ET",Airbus says three engines froze on crashed A400M ,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - The crew of an A400M military transporter that crashed last month tried in vain to regain control of three engines that froze due to a suspected software problem, according to details of investigations published on Wednesday.Initial findings on the crash released by Airbus confirmed that the immediate area for concern was the plane's engine control software, on which it recently ordered safety checks.It did not say what kind of problem may have caused the engines to freeze but it has ruled out a major structural design issue, focusing attention instead on the quality of final A400M assembly work.A spokeswoman said investigators were looking mainly at ""the different processes around the assembly of the aircraft, the engines and the preparations for first flight"".The A400M, designed as a troop and heavy cargo carrier for a group of European NATO nations, crashed shortly after takeoff on a test flight on May 9, killing four out of six crew.The aircraft was being prepared for delivery to Turkey.Airbus said 'black box' data and cockpit recordings indicated that three out of four of the plane's turboprop engines became stuck at high power shortly after takeoff.At first, the three affected engines ""did not respond to the crew's attempts to control the power setting in the normal way,"" Airbus said in a statement.Pilots succeeded in reducing power only after setting the thrust levers to 'idle,' only to find that the power had frozen once again as they tried to increase it, Airbus added.Investigators have found that all other systems worked correctly, Airbus said in a bulletin to the plane's operators.Spain, where the A400M is assembled, halted production test flights following the crash, effectively halting new deliveries.Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) Chief Executive Tom Enders voiced confidence last week that these could be restored soon if its initial premise on the cause of the accident proved correct.A senior Airbus executive was quoted shortly afterwards as saying the initial investigations had confirmed the crash was caused by a problem with the configuration of engine software.Wednesday's statement potentially clears the way for deliveries to resume but investigations into the precise sequence of events are expected to continue for some months.On May 19, Airbus asked nations that have taken delivery of the A400M - Britain, France, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia - to carry out checks on the 'Electronic Control Unit,' part of the digital system used to control the West's largest turboprop engines. Other buyers include Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1136,"Jun 02, 2015 04:32PM ET",Boeing starts building first 737 MAX jet on schedule,nan,"By Alwyn ScottRENTON, Washington (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday that it has started building its first 737 MAX single-aisle jetliner on schedule, an important milestone for a new plane model that accounts for nearly half of the company's plane orders.The first 737 MAX, a more fuel efficient version of Boeing's top-selling jet, is scheduled to be completed this year and begin flights tests in 2016. Customers will begin receiving the aircraft in the third quarter of 2017, Boeing said.The first wing spars, large structural pieces that run perpendicular to the fuselage, were loaded into drilling and riveting machines on May 29, beginning the building process, said Keith Leverkuhn, vice president and general manager of the 737 MAX program.Boeing is adding more automated machines as it begins assembly of the MAX, and as it prepares to increase production to 52 of its 737s a month in 2018, from 42 a month now.Some of the newest machines, which began making wings for current generation 737s in March, automate about 90 percent of the wing assembly process, up from 70 percent on older, legacy machines that Boeing has used for decades, Boeing said. Automation is crucial to reaching reach that rate, and possibly go higher, to 60 or more jets a month. Boeing's 737 wing factory is an obvious target. Most of the 100,000 rivet holes that are drilled and filled with fasteners per day, enough for two sets of wings, already are automated officials said. Boeing is studying whether to automate other parts of wing production line. It does not expect automation to reduce the number of workers needed. Rather it enables higher production rates while improving quality, Boeing said. ""Increased automation doesn't mean less jobs,"" said Barry Lewis, manufacturing operations leader for wings during a tour of the factory near Seattle. ""Increased automation means we can go higher in rates with a stable workforce.""Boeing has received 2,724 orders for the 737 MAX, which competes with Airbus' (PA:AIR) A320neo. Boeing has 5,667 unfilled orders for commercial aircraft.The 737 MAX promises to be 20 percent more fuel efficient than the current 737, and to have operating costs that are eight percent lower than its nearest competitor, Boeing says.Boeing shares rose 2.1 percent to $144.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1138,"Jun 01, 2015 05:53AM ET","Malaysia Airlines CEO says carrier 'technically bankrupt', set to cut jobs, routes",nan,"By Al-Zaquan Amer HamzahKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The newly appointed chief executive of loss-making Malaysia Airlines said on Monday the carrier is ""technically bankrupt"", underlining the case for a restructuring to cut a third of jobs, scrap some international routes and review its long-haul fleet.""We are technically bankrupt...the decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014,"" Christoph Mueller said, speaking at a news conference. Already squeezed into years of losses by stiff regional competition, the carrier was seriously affected last year by two separate jet disasters.Mueller was making his first public appearance as CEO since being hired last month by the carrier's owner, Malaysian state fund Khazanah, to lead the restructuring. Khazanah, previously the majority owner, took the airline private last year as part of a 6 billion Malaysian ringgit ($1.63 billion) plan aimed at returning it to profit within three years.The carrier on Monday said its new legal entity is Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB), replacing the previous Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), with Mueller promising to unveil a full corporate rebranding in future. The carrier also confirmed previously disclosed plans to cut 6,000 jobs, shrinking its workforce to 14,000, are now being implemented. ""We will remain a full service international carrier connecting continents,"" Mueller said, adding that while some international routes will go there were no plans to turn it into a regional carrier. He also said there would be no cutbacks in domestic network. Capacity measures would include ""reducing aircraft size on certain routes, reducing frequency on certain routes, and certain cases abandoning the route altogether,"" he said.As part of the restructuring, the airline will review the fleet of 13  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 777-200ER jets it uses on some long-haul routes, while planning to find buyers for two of six Airbus Group (PA:AIR) A380 aircraft it currently operates on flights to destinations like London. It plans to keep the remainder of its fleet intact. Before joining the Malaysian carrier, the 52-year-old German national successfully restructured Ireland's state-backed  Aer Lingus  (IR:AERL) [AERLI.UL] and spearheaded a revamp at Lufthansa (DE:LHAG). The executive told Reuters in an interview last week that he was aiming for a much smaller network and fleet, as well as a sharper focus on cost-cutting.In its last earnings announcement as a public company, the airline recorded its worst quarterly loss since late 2011 as passenger numbers and yields dropped further after the loss of the two jets.Flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers and crew, disappeared in March last year, in what has become one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history. Last July, Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, and all 298 aboard were killed.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It will be headed by Tim Dombrowski, 54, formerly a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.The European group also said it had recruited Google executive and former U.S. aeronautics researcher Paul Eremenko, 35, to run an innovation center in Silicon Valley.Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders announced the center's creation on Wednesday, saying it would provide promising avenues for technology it might otherwise miss.It is the latest evidence of efforts by planemakers to woo technologists as potential partners and comes weeks after Enders took the company's top management team to California to see what lessons could be learned from the digital revolution. Enders was quoted as saying after a previous visit to Silicon Valley last year that the aerospace industry must work more closely with high-tech companies - some of which, like Google, are encroaching on its turf through drone projects.Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s Chief Executive Jim McNerney said last year it wanted it to be more like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the way it innovates, rather than doing a ""moonshot"" development every 25 years.Both planemakers have talked of the need to introduce improvements more quickly, without waiting for all-new plane developments that take years and cost around $15 billion.Though the highly safety-regulated and capital-intensive aerospace industry will always be conservative about the major bets that drive plane developments, Enders wants Airbus to learn to act ""more quickly and with more courage"", an aide said.Aerospace companies say they are increasingly thinking about software rather than hardware throughout their businesses.Although next month will still see hundreds of jet orders at the Paris Airshow, the focus of competition between Airbus and Boeing is shifting quickly towards the way they build planes now that each has almost a decade's worth of orders to fulfill.On Thursday, Airbus presented to journalists its plans for a futuristic factory in which humans, robots and cobots - or collaborative robots - interact to make planes more smoothly and cheaply, but acknowledged it would not happen overnight.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1144,"May 28, 2015 08:29PM ET","Airbus debates new A320 output hike, suffers test glitch",nan,"By Tim HepherTOULOUSE (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is leaning toward a new hike in production of its A320 jet, raising the stakes in a battle with Boeing to translate record orders into tangible deliveries, but has yet to decide on the risks of handling unprecedented volumes.Europe's largest aerospace firm indicated the chances were rising that it would increase production targets again just months after setting an output goal of 50 medium-haul aircraft a month by early 2017, compared with 42 a month now.The debate is the latest evidence of a prolonged upcycle in the aerospace industry as demand soars from new players in emerging markets and established airlines renew older fleets.But a decision on whether to increase output again depends mainly on whether suppliers can keep pace with the challenges of producing a 150-seat jetliner every few hours, just as other civil aerospace firms are ramping up volumes worldwide.At a media briefing on Thursday, company officials conveyed different levels of urgency about the decision, which would only follow a thorough analysis of several tiers of suppliers.Sales chief John Leahy said likely demand already exceeded the planemaker's existing production goal of 50 planes a month and the market could absorb over 60, possibly as many as 63. He expected Airbus to take a decision this year.But chief operating officer Tom Williams said there were still ""hot spots"" in the supply chain and that he would not be ""boxed in"" to setting a deadline for the decision.He said that supply chain risks were by definition increasing as the industry tackles ever greater volumes.ENGINE GLITCHMedium-haul planes are significant sources of cash for both Airbus and Boeing (N:BA). Aviation market sources see scope for several hundred more orders at next month's Paris Airshow.If agreed, the next Airbus output hike could take place from 2018, putting pressure on Boeing to follow suit.Demand has been boosted by the transition to new fuel-saving models of both the A320 and rival 737. Airbus said a glitch with a small part in new Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines had disrupted A320neo flight testing.The setback is unlikely to delay first delivery, due at end-2015, but requires some parts to be replaced, it said.Airbus sounded marginally more optimistic than before on the larger A330, another cash cow for the company.It had spooked investors last year with plans to cut A330 production to 6 a month from a planned level of 9 as it waits for development of a new revamped version. In January, it did not rule out taking this down further but Williams and others said they now felt comfortable with the target of six due to a number of sales in the pipeline.Airbus meanwhile said it had still not decided whether to improve its even larger but slow-selling A380 with new engines as requested by Dubai's Emirates, which has expressed interest in up to 200 of the planes if Airbus decides to build them.But it began to address one of the problems overshadowing such a decision: what to do about a surge of second-hand A380s that might come onto the market when those revamped A380neo models replace earlier A380s already in the Emirates fleet.Bregier and strategy chief Kiran Rao said there could be a future for second-hand superjumbos among long-haul, low-cost carriers due to what would by then be much lower costs.Such a plane could help them open new markets, they said.Critics say wide-body jets have proved risky for low-cost carriers that demand flexible operations and quick turnarounds, and that the 544-seat A380 could prove even more challenging.Airbus says its flexibility has been under-estimated.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But controversy over the lifetime cost of operating the French plane blocked a final deal.""I again conveyed to the defense minister the interest of the Eurofighter nations in continuing talks, should the Indian side be interested,"" German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said.""That was taken on board positively,"" she added, after meeting her counterpart, Manohar Parrikar, on Wednesday evening.Germany has taken the lead in the sales pitch to India for the Eurofighter, made by Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) and BAE Systems (LONDON:BAES).A spokesman for the Indian defense ministry said the focus now was on finalizing the government-to-government deal for 36 ready-to-fly Rafales.Von der Leyen said Berlin was also willing to support a project initiated by India last autumn to build six submarines at an estimated cost of 530 billion rupees ($8.3 billion).In a first stage, local shipyards would have to prove their fitness to build the diesel-electric subs, before being invited to bid for the deal, possibly with foreign partners.""There is an Indian interest in industrial cooperation in building submarines,"" von der Leyen said. ""Talks are already under way and I made it clear that German industry is supported by the German government.""Initial talks on submarine cooperation were under way involving ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, a unit of ThyssenKrupp AG, German media reported.Von der Leyen met Modi on Thursday and said the two had touched on the issue of defense equipment, but the conversation focused on sharing knowledge on high-technology areas.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is powered by the West's largest turboprop engines, designed by Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) of Germany.Problems in developing the engines, and particularly in certifying the engine control software, contributed to three years of delays and a new cash injection by governments in 2010.The Electronic Control Unit is one of two pieces of complex software that make up the engine control system, or FADEC, whose development was led by Munich-based MTU Aero Engines.The crash came amid new delays in fitting the aircraft with military systems and raised further questions over the timing of deliveries after Spain suspended pre-delivery test flights.Airbus has said the deliveries are ""under review"". The A400M has been delivered so far to Britain, France, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia, which is so far the only export customer.

1150,"May 13, 2015 06:53PM ET",United Airlines to lease up to 25 used aircraft from AerCap Holdings,nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) on Wednesday announced plans to lease up to 25 used aircraft from AerCap Holdings NV, one of the world's largest aircraft lessors (N:AER), to reduce its dependence on smaller, 50-seat jets.The Chicago-based airline said it expects delivery of 11 used Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR) A319 aircraft over the next two years, with the right to add up to 14 more of the single-isle planes over the next five years, subject to certain conditions.The additions are part of a broader fleet reorganization United unveiled last month that aims to match bigger planes with markets of growing demand, without increasing its spending or capacity forecasts. Integral to the plan is removing 50-seat jets flown by United's regional contractors, which can waste more fuel per passenger than larger planes. The carrier said it will take 130 of these aircraft off its schedule by the end of 2015, with more cuts to come later.As an example, United said it now might fly two A319s, which have more than 120 seats, on a route that currently operates with three 70-seat jets. It then could use those 70-seaters on routes in which it currently uses the 50-seat planes.""Our flexible fleet plan allows us to opportunistically add used aircraft when the economics are attractive,"" United's Fleet Vice President Ron Baur said in a statement.Cheap fuel prices, down more than 40 percent since June, have made it increasingly affordable to fly old, less fuel-efficient jets.China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) currently operates the A319s that United will lease, with first deliveries starting in early 2016.United said it will add new seats, overhead-bin extensions and Wi-Fi to the planes, and it will perform checks so they align with its maintenance program.United said last month that the lease of 10 to 20 used narrowbody aircraft would not alter its forecast for yearly capital expenditures of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion over the next three to four years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1151,"May 12, 2015 04:03PM ET","Boeing says efficiency supports strong outlook, despite hurdles",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) - Citing steady demand from airlines,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it is capable of raising 737 jetliner output by 43 percent to 60 a month, as it gave a rosy outlook despite concerns about orders, overall production and defense spending.Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said market fundamentals that support higher jetliner production are unchanged, despite recent deferrals of aircraft deliveries by American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Continental Holdings (N:UAL), which he termed normal fleet optimization decisions.Aircraft prices have ""not deteriorated,"" even for 737 and 777 models that are being replaced by new versions, he told Boeing's annual investor conference in Chicago. Plane makers, including rival Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR), typically offer heavy discounts to sell end-of-production models to avoid cutting output.Boeing faces curbs on defense spending, slowing commercial aircraft orders after record years, and a possible loss of export financing if Congress fails to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank.But McNerney and other top executives of the world's largest plane maker said they would be able to keep profits rising because of the work they are doing to lift productivity, lower costs and make smaller, less expensive innovations in products.McNerney reaffirmed Boeing's goal of generating more than $9 billion in operating cash flow this year, and said that figure will increase in 2016 and beyond. He also said Boeing's defense business would be at the right scale even if it did not win ongoing competitions for major new programs such as the Long Range Strike Bomber. ""It's hard to believe we wouldn't get one of them,"" he said. But ""we would still be an at scale"" as a defense business, and would have the commercial airplane business. ""We don't have to panic,"" he said.MARGIN QUESTIONSBoeing's profit margins are expected to fall in 2015, hit by plane development costs and output of relatively low margin 747 and 787 airplanes. Margins will resume their climb in later years, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said. Countering concerns about a bubble in jetliner demand, Boeing said it sees scope to raise output sharply.""We can go to 60 a month,"" Commercial Airplane Chief Executive Ray Conner said, referring to 737 production, currently at 42 a month and set to reach 52 a month in 2018. Conner did not say Boeing has plans to use that capacity, but some analysts said such rates now appear very likely.Productivity improvements in Boeing's factories have protected it should demand falter, executives stressed. The 737 factory has slashed production time by more than half. If plane output had to be notched down in a global crisis, profit margins would not fall as much as in the past, Conner said.Boeing stock was down 0.2 percent at $145.61 in afternoon trading, suggesting investors remain concerned about the company's challenges.Ken Herbert, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said investors are focused on Boeing's volatile cash flow.

Germany's Der Spiegel magazine reported that one of the survivors had said the plane suffered ""multiple engine trouble"" shortly after takeoff.A source familiar with the matter confirmed that engines were one of the areas under scrutiny following the testimony but stressed it was too early to say what had caused the crash, with the crucial black box flight recorders yet to be analyzed.Airbus declined to comment. ""We have to wait for the results of the investigation,"" a spokeswoman said.Shares in Europe's largest aerospace group, which hit a record high in April, fell as much as 4.5 percent before closing at 62.09 euros, down 2.1 percent. The A400M Atlas was developed for seven European NATO nations -- Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey -- at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion).So far Malaysia is the only export customer.The plane entered service in 2013, more than three years behind schedule, and just 12 of 174 aircraft sold have been delivered.Problems in the development of the West's largest turboprop engines helped to generate billions of euros of cost overruns and a bailout by the seven launch nations in 2010.New technical problems with A400M military features surfaced last year, leading to fresh delays and a management shake-up.People with direct knowledge of the matter have said the plane suffered engine problems on its maiden flight in December 2009, delaying its landing in front of hundreds of VIPs.The engines were supplied by a European consortium of Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), MTU Aero Engines of Germany (DE:MTXGn) and Spanish aerospace firm Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP). The consortium was picked after European politicians objected to Airbus's proposal of an imported engine from Canada.MTU, which had borne the brunt of criticism over the earlier development problems, declined to comment on Spiegel's report.FRESH CONCERNAnalysts said the first A400M accident raised fresh concerns about deliveries and long-term exports of the plane, but Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders reaffirmed the company's commitment to the program as he paid tribute to the crew.In a letter to staff seen by Reuters, Enders said testing would resume as planned on Tuesday to ""demonstrate to our customers, the air forces, that we fully trust this great transport plane and are as committed to the program and the further ramp-up of deliveries and capabilities as ever.""Enders asked the company's 137,000 employees to observe a minute's silence for the captain, co-pilot and two test engineers who died in the crash. Two others remain in hospital.""The men who lost their lives in Sevilla were great professionals; they knew about the risks of their job and they would not want us to stop flying,"" he said.A memorial service was expected to be held in Seville's cathedral on Tuesday.In February, Airbus took 551 million euros in charges for the latest A400M delays, bringing the total company charges over the lifetime of the project to more than 4.75 billion euros.""Airbus can ill afford more delays,"" Hamburg stockbroker Berenberg said in a note.""Longer-term, this latest development will almost certainly hamper the ability to sell A400M in the export markets, the only way this program will ever make any money.""People close to the project expressed concerns over the impact of the crash on morale in the Spanish production plant.The crashed aircraft was due to be delivered to Turkey and was on its maiden test flight when it plowed into a field one mile (1.6 km) north of Seville's San Pablo airport.Alonso, the newly promoted head of Airbus Group's military aircraft business, said Airbus stood ready to assist investigators following the recovery of two black boxes.""At the same time we will give our total support to the investigating authorities and urge them for initial results as soon as possible,"" Alonso said in a staff memo.But the status of the investigation remained uncertain, with conflicting reports about who would be responsible for the probe. Three sources said the black boxes were being held by judicial authorities, delaying a start to the enquiry.A person briefed on the matter said late on Monday that the Spanish government had commissioned the country's military authorities to carry out the crash investigation.(This story has been refiled to add dropped reference to closing shares)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1159,"May 09, 2015 04:59PM ET","Airbus A400M military transporter crashes on test flight, killing four",nan,"By Marcelo del PozoSEVILLE, Spain (Reuters) - An Airbus (PA:AIR) A400M military transport plane crashed outside Seville on Saturday, killing four test crew and prompting Britain and Germany to ground Europe's new troop and cargo carrier.The aircraft was due to be delivered to another NATO customer, Turkey, and was on its maiden test flight when it crashed in a field one mile (1.6 km) north of Seville's San Pablo airport. It was the first ever crash of an A400M.Airbus said four Spanish employees had been killed and two surviving crew were in hospital in serious condition. The newspaper El Pais said the crew had detected a fault and asked permission to land, but hit an electricity pylon while attempting an emergency landing. Tracking data from the Flightradar24 website indicated the plane had wheeled to the left before coming down.An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on possible causes. Airbus said it had sent a team to investigate.The crash delivers a fresh blow to Europe's largest defense project, which is still struggling to overcome delays and cost overruns that led to a bailout by European governments in 2010.Britain and Germany said they were suspending A400M flights while they awaited more information on what caused the crash.A plume of black smoke rose from the site, where hardly anything was left of the plane amid black, scorched earth.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, speaking to journalists near the site, asked for maximum transparency from Airbus on the reasons for the crash. ""An incident like this is not the best for our industry ... It remains to be seen if it was purely circumstantial or if a mistake was made,"" he said, adding that the Spanish defense minister would meet his German and French counterparts on Sunday to discuss the incident.The A400M Atlas was developed for Spain and six other European NATO nations - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Turkey - at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion), making it Europe's biggest single arms contract. It entered service in 2013 after a delay of more than three years.BUYER COMPLAINTSThe launch nations have ordered a total of 170 A400Ms. Malaysia, the plane's only export customer, has ordered four.The planes, costing just over 100 million euros each, are assembled in Spain, which has long sought to emerge from France and Germany's shadow within Europe's largest aerospace company.Problems in delivering the planes on time, and with all the required military features on board, resurfaced last year, triggering a management shake-up and more financial charges.After receiving stinging criticism from both Germany and Turkey over the delays, Airbus hoped it was finally turning the corner, with an executive saying last week that it hoped soon to get a second export customer soon..There was no immediate word on whether the accident would result in the halting of test flights, which could mean further delivery delays, nor whether the A400M would be grounded by its other current operators: France, Malaysia and Turkey.Designed to put troops and heavy equipment into remote battlefields or carry out humanitarian missions, the aircraft was intended to fill a gap between the smaller  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 Hercules and the Boeing (N:BA) C-17 cargo jet.It is powered by the West's largest turboprop engines, supplied by Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), MTU Aero Engines of Germany (DE:MTXGn) and Spanish aerospace firm Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP). Problems in developing these were blamed for much of the delay.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1161,"May 07, 2015 12:13PM ET","Airbus surges past Boeing in orders, lags in deliveries",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Matt SmithPARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has moved ahead of U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) in their race for aircraft orders thanks to a large Latin American win, setting the tone for what could be a fiercely competitive Paris Airshow next month. The European planemaker won orders for 229 aircraft between January and April. After cancellations, net orders totaled 209, it said on Thursday.The surge came after Colombia's Avianca confirmed an order for 100 Airbus jets in a $10 billion deal.Also on Thursday, Boeing said it had won 153 orders this year, up to May 5, or 128 after adjusting for cancellations.Boeing remained ahead on deliveries after handing 250 planes to customers in the first four months of 2015, compared with Airbus's total of 196.Airbus deliveries of 7 A380 superjumbos so far this year included the 159th delivery since the double-decker entered service in 2007.Last month's handover to Etihad Airways, coinciding with the tenth anniversary since the world's largest airliner first took flight, took A380 deliveries beyond the half-way point compared with the total of the twin-deck planes it has sold.Airbus is studying whether to revamp the A380 to boost sales and says it is confident of replenishing the order pipeline even before that decision.On Wednesday, the head of Qatar Airways said in Dubai he would not order more A380s without an ""absolute rethink"" by Airbus, adding that any revamp of the existing model would need to generate 10-15 percent fuel savings.However, he praised the newer twin-engined A350-900 compared to Boeing's 787, which he said was only now coming out of early teething problems.Qatar is the only A350 operator so far, with two in service. It operates the Boeing 787 and has ordered the larger 777X.""I commend Airbus, they learned a lot from their mistakes ... When you compare the A350 to the 787, the former is head and shoulders above Boeing,"" Al Baker told a news conference.But he issued a warning to Airbus about an emerging market for 400-seat planes, sandwiched between the largest model of A350, which seats 369 people, and the 544-seat A380.""Unless Airbus goes a step higher than A350-1000, the (Boeing) 777-9X will be the backbone of a lot of airlines,"" he said. The 777-9X aims to carry 406 passengers from 2020.Airbus has delivered one A350 this year as it ramps up production and says it is targeting 15 deliveries by end-year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1162,"May 06, 2015 11:40AM ET",Germanwings pilot rehearsed crash on outbound flight,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - The Germanwings co-pilot suspected of deliberately crashing a jet in the French Alps rehearsed the fatal maneuver on the morning of the disaster, and had twice been refused medical papers needed to fly, investigators said on Wednesday.The French BEA accident investigation agency said the co-pilot had five times set the autopilot to take the Airbus down to just 100 feet while the captain was out of the cockpit on the outbound flight to Barcelona from Duesseldorf.But the brief twists of an altitude dial, mimicking those which crashed the A320 on its way back to the German city 2-3 hours later, would not have been noticed by passengers or controllers because they were quickly reversed and were masked by the fact that the jet had already started an authorized descent, the BEA said.A preliminary report on the return flight that crashed on March 24, killing all 150 people on board, confirmed a growing picture of painstaking preparations carried out by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz.""I can't speculate on what was happening inside his head; all I can say is that he changed this button to the minimum setting of 100 feet and he did it several times,"" said Remi Jouty, director of the French BEA accident investigation agency.""These very brief actions on the previous flight were a sort of rehearsal of the maneuver,"" he said.Digging into data and cockpit recordings recovered from the jet's ""black boxes"", the BEA gave the most detailed picture so far on what happened in the cockpit of return flight 9525.The 27-year-old co-pilot was in charge of flying the plane on the return leg, a routine practice that allows pilots to build up experience. Shortly after the A320 reached cruise height, the captain told Lubitz he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over the radio, the BEA said. No reason was given, but Jouty noted it is normal for pilots to leave the cockpit to go to the toilet, for example.Just over 30 seconds after the door closed, leaving Lubitz alone in the cockpit for the second time that day, he entered the instruction he had rehearsed.By turning a dial, he ordered the plane's autopilot to descend to 100 feet, the BEA said. This was the lowest setting possible and enough to crash into mountains ahead. He then altered another dial to speed the jet up.The report listed numerous warnings that went unanswered as the jet sped lower. These included four attempts to reach him from outside the cockpit by interphone and a crescendo of calls and knocks that ended with ""violent blows"" on the door.As the jet steadily lost height, Marseille air traffic controllers tried 11 times to contact the Germanwings jet.Just over two minutes before the crash the French military weighed in, trying three times to contact the crew on an emergency frequency, followed by a call from another plane.Finally the aircraft's ground-proximity warning system kicked into life, urging the co-pilot to ""pull up"".MEDICAL REBUFFReviewing Lubitz's training and career, the BEA said his professional level was judged to be ""above standard"".However, it said the aeromedical center of Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, twice refused to renew his medical certificate in 2009 when he was undergoing treatment for depression. Lubitz broke off his pilot training from November 2008 to August 2009 due to his illness. After gaining a certificate in July 2009, Lubitz's pilot's license, which is always valid for one year only, contained a note requiring aeromedical doctors to contact licensing authorities before the certificate could be extended or renewed. Investigators in Germany have found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash, indicating that Lubitz was concealing an illness from his employers. They also uncovered Internet searches made by Lubitz in the week before the tragedy on suicide methods and cockpit door security.The German government plans to name a former diplomat, Steffen Rudolph, as an ombudsman for relatives of the victims, government sources told Reuters. The BEA will issue a final report in about a year that may include recommendations on cockpit doors and the handling of pilots' medical records by the airline industry.The French agency declined to speculate on any recommendations but said it would examine the balance to be struck between medical confidentiality and air safety.It promised also to look at where to draw the line between the need to prevent possible attacks by passengers and the need to prevent a repeat of incidents such as the Germanwings crash.Cockpit doors were specially strengthened to protect pilots after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.The BEA said it had found six previous accidents since 1980 in which deliberate actions by crew may have played a part.These included a remarkably similar crash of an Embraer 190 jet in Namibia in 2013 in which 33 people died after the co-pilot left the captain alone in the cockpit. The jet was ordered to the ground by changing autopilot altitude settings.On at least two other occasions, there were two pilots in the cockpit but one was not able to counter the other's actions.Many airlines have recently made it compulsory to have two people in the cockpit to help prevent accidents, but Jouty said accident records suggested this would not be an automatic cure.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The expansion comes as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc press for a temporary freeze on new Gulf airline service to the United States.The U.S. airlines and their unions have alleged that Qatar Airways, Emirates airline and Etihad Airways have received more than $40 billion in subsidies from their home governments in the last decade. This, they say, has allowed the Gulf carriers to drive down ticket prices and begin pushing competitors out of key markets.The Gulf carriers have denied the allegations and said U.S. airlines are losing market share due to poor service.Qatar Airways said it would fly two-aisle Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777 aircraft to Los Angeles and Atlanta. It would fly a two-aisle Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) NV 350-900 XWB aircraft on its Boston route and for its second New York flight.Los Angeles service begins January 1, 2016, followed by Boston on March 16 and Atlanta on July 1.While the Obama administration said it would begin reviewing interested parties' comments on the subsidy claims by the end of May, the three U.S. airlines have charged the Gulf carriers with taking advantage of the waiting period, with Emirates adding new flights to Orlando, Boston and Seattle.""These additional flights and capacity increases will exacerbate the existing harm to U.S. airlines by diverting even more passengers away from U.S. airlines' services to Gulf carriers' subsidized services,"" the chief executives of the three U.S. airlines said in a joint April 17 letter to the administration.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a related development, federal prosecutor Harald Range himself will be questioned by a parliamentary committee looking into the affair in Berlin on Wednesday.Der Spiegel magazine said the BND helped the U.S. National Security Agency over at least 10 years, embarrassing Germany and upsetting many in a country where surveillance is a sensitive topic due to abuses by the Nazis and the East German Stasi. The magazine also reported that in 2013 the BND ordered staff to delete 12,000 internet ""selectors"" -- IP addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of German government officials -- that it had been tracking for the NSA.Opposition members of parliament for the Greens and Left party have requested more information from Merkel's government about the BND's assistance to the NSA. German media said there were indications EU governments and agencies, especially France, were the targets of the BND's spying for the NSA.""This appears to be reaching a criminal dimension,"" Christian Stroebele, a senior Greens member of parliament, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) AIR.PA said on Thursday it planned to complain to the German authorities over reports that the country's foreign intelligence agency had helped the United States to spy on it and other European firms.At the heart of the controversy is the scope of cooperation between the BND and NSA that began in 2002 after the September 11, 2001 attacks -- and how long the Chancellor's office was aware of BND's activities on behalf of the NSA.It is an especially touchy issue in Germany because Merkel and many Germans reacted strongly in 2013 to reports that the NSA had long been tapping Merkel's cell phone. ""Spying among friends is not at all acceptable,"" she said at the time.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1166,"May 01, 2015 06:32PM ET",FAA considers beyond-line-of-sight drone initiatives: sources,nan,"By David MorganWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are talking to drone makers and service providers about testing commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's visual line of sight, currently banned for safety reasons, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.The potential partnerships between the Federal Aviation Administration and industry would be a milestone in developing unmanned aircraft that could be used for a variety of business applications such as delivering packages, monitoring crops or inspecting energy transmission pipelines. It also raises the likelihood that beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years.The proposed FAA rules unveiled in February would lift the current near-ban on commercial drones. But the proposals, as written, still would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by e-commerce company Amazon.com (O:AMZN) because they require drones to remain within an operators visual line of sight as a safety measure.However, while the FAA works to finalize regulations, companies can win agency approval to use commercial drones on a case by case basis. Up to now, the agency has not approved drones capable of flying beyond an operator's line of sight. Beyond-line-of-sight operations use on-board cameras to enable an operator to make course changes to avoid obstacles, including other aircraft.The FAA's consideration of BVLOS operations comes amid intense pressure from Congress and companies who say the technology, originally developed for the military, is already being used in other countries. Failure to adopt the technology, they argue, could stifle the nascent U.S. market for commercial drones.The agency has heard from lobbyists representing a broad industrial base ranging from aerospace manufacturers  Boeing Co  (N:BA), Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), high-tech firms  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and  iRobot Corp  (O:IRBT) to the national gas pipeline and agriculture industries.In an announcement that could come as early as next week, the FAA is expected to set out plans for partnering with industry on commercial BVLOS operations, according to the people familiar with the matter. The agency would seek to limit safety risks by allowing flights only under restricted conditions, such as uninhabited agricultural land in remote locations.A FAA spokeswoman declined to comment. Sources said the new operations could be similar to BVLOS flights that the University of Alaska has been conducting over the past five years in remote regions above the Arctic Circle, where unmanned aerial systems are used with FAA approval to map sea ice, monitor marine life and inspect oil and gas installations. The partnerships would be the latest among several FAA moves in recent months to ease restrictions on commercial drones in the United States.In April, the FAA loosened its requirement for outdoor testing to occur at designated test sites, by granting Amazon approval to test drones outdoors at a company-owned site. Amazon, other companies and drone industry groups have also used a public comment period on the proposed regulations to urge the agency to allow drones to fly beyond line of sight.""BVLOS technology has matured to the point that BVLOS operations are now permitted in some of other countries... where operations have been conducted for years, with high levels of safety,"" commented the Small UAV Coalition, whose members include Amazon,  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL), and smaller drone companies.The coalition asked FAA to permit certain BVLOS operations ""in the relatively near term"", rather than waiting for the proposed rules to be finalized over the next two years. ""The agency is likely to receive requests from small UAS operators seeking to conduct (beyond line of sight) operations ... long before the rule is finalized,"" Amazon said last week in a comment to the FAA.But the Air Line Pilots Association, which opposes beyond line of sight operations because of safety reasons, said such operations would come with ""unacceptable risk.""""The use of an on-board camera cannot replace the awareness provided by direct observation by the operator/pilot or designated visual observer.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1167,"Apr 28, 2015 05:12PM ET",Boeing looks to car industry expert for jet production savings,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alwyn Scott(Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) plans to use newer and more standardised manufacturing techniques for its new 777X jetliner, paving the way for ""significant"" savings as it gradually feeds the changes back into existing assembly lines, a senior executive said.The approach will draw increasingly on lessons learned from outside the aerospace industry and comes as the focus of the intense rivalry between Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) shifts toward production strategies after a record boom in orders.""I think the 777X will be our first opportunity to show the ideas that we have to date,"" said Walter Odisho, Boeing's vice president of manufacturing and safety, referring to the world's largest twin-engined jet that is due to enter service in 2020.""However, we also have the capability to affect the other programs that we have in place ... In many cases we're looking to standardize our approach,"" he told Reuters.Odisho, 52, was speaking in his first interview since joining Boeing in December 2013 from Toyota (T:7203), where he oversaw manufacturing at the carmaker's $6 billion plant in Kentucky.While standardised production is common in the auto industry it is rarer in aerospace, where volumes are lower and airlines demand more customization but where output is rising fast.Odisho said planemakers need to make production ""more repeatable and predictable"".He declined to estimate cost savings from the shift toward ""Advanced Manufacturing,"" an innovative set of production tools that can include robotics, but called them significant.""The idea of achieving significant savings in a single action is a fallacy. We'll take the opportunities and when you add them all up together, I think they will amount to quite significant improvements,"" Odisho said.Boeing has long relied on Toyota-inspired ""lean"" production methods to improve efficiency, but Odisho has been hired to help push car industry thinking deeper into its manufacturing plants.That matches an approach taken at Airbus, where car industry executives in senior positions are more evident. .""I think we are beginning the journey,"" Odisho said. ""There are areas ... such as drilling where we have a lot of repetitive motion.""FACTORY MOVEMENTIt is not just about automation, however.Odisho observes the factory like a choreographer, with an eye on the overall shape of the performance.""Think of it as a robot. Because robots are automated they can go through many types of motion that are wasteful. But in order to utilize robots correctly we need to be thoughtful about the movements that their arms make,"" he said.""If we can apply the same thinking (to the factory) ... then we can affect the process to a high degree,"" he said.For example, Odisho is urging a fresh look at the flow of parts.""If we can develop a system where we have direct deliveries to our lines and in an orientation which our operators will use to simply secure instead of handling parts, we have tremendous opportunities,"" he said.Improving the sequencing of parts reduces inventory and eases cashflow, a recent focus for investors. And it means less space is needed to store them, lowering overheads.Boeing's planemaking chief Ray Conner has challenged engineers to think about ""build quality"" when designing aircraft so they can be produced more affordably.Odisho says a clean-sheet design for a 21st-century aircraft plant would weave a single thread from the drawing board to the parts cart on the factory floor.""I would look at material flow, I would look at processes, I would look at the design of the airplane with people in mind - how the work would be performed. I would design the airplane with specific areas of automation in mind,"" Odisho said.Could the buffer of several days for holding parts in aircraft plants ever hit auto-industry levels of as low as two hours ?""Ultimately I think we will see that day,"" Odisho said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He said the government would not comment on whether media reports on the BND helping U.S. agencies were accurate. But he noted: ""There is still no evidence of mass surveillance of German and European citizens.""Magazine Der Spiegel reported in its online edition that BND officials indirectly helped the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to spy on European targets, including German interests, over a period of more than 10 years.BND officials provided intelligence data in up to 40,000 instances after U.S. requests, the report said, adding that one of the NSA targets was the Franco-German aerospace company EADS, which renamed itself Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) last year.Der Spiegel said BND officials passed Internet IP addresses as well as mobile phone numbers to the NSA. These issues were first detected internally in 2008 but were not fully reported to the chancellery until last month, it said. A BND spokesman declined to comment on the report.Revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Washington carried out large-scale electronic espionage in Europe provoked outrage in Germany.

1171,"Apr 23, 2015 08:02AM ET",United Airlines swaps ten Boeing Dreamliners for 777-300ER jets,nan,"By Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - United Airlines said Thursday that it has swapped 10 orders of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 Dreamliners for 10 larger 777-300ER jets, marking a victory for the plane manufacturer as it seeks to sell out the 777 planes before their production ends.The news follows months of speculation that Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) would make the swap, which allows it to move aircraft on to different routes to better fit customer demand. The carrier also said Thursday that it plans to retire 130 of its more than 200 50-seat planes by the end of 2015 as part of its fleet reorganization.For Boeing, the deal signals steady demand for its widebody 777 aircraft before the company switches to production of the new 777X model later this decade. Boeing said Wednesday that its 777 production line is sold out for 2016 and half sold out in 2017, with sales extending into 2018.While Boeing said Wednesday that it has won 25 firm orders and commitments for 777s so far this year - just short of half of its target - it was not immediately clear whether United's swap added to the count or already was part of it.Analysts have expressed concern that Boeing might have to cut prices to shore up any production gap.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1172,"Apr 23, 2015 07:12AM ET","Airbus moves ahead with defense electronics, other asset sales",nan,"By Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has started approaching potential buyers for electronics and other assets it wants to sell to focus its defense division on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites, three sources familiar with the matter said.Europe's largest aerospace group hopes to attract private equity buyers for defense electronics businesses such as radar, optronics and avionics supplies, as well as for part of its satellite communications unit, the people said. Separately, Airbus has begun contacting potential buyers of jetliner supplier PFW, which it rescued in 2011, they added.Europe's defense industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut military spending, and the asset sales are part of efforts announced by Airbus last year to sell half a dozen businesses with combined annual revenues of around 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion).The move breaks with its previous efforts to diversify into security activities and halts investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals.Airbus has asked investment bank Evercore (N:EVR) to organize the sale of some electronics businesses with combined sales of about 1 billion euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 80-100 million euros, the sources said. These units specialize in radars for surveillance purposes, in avionics solutions -- for example helping pilots to fly in fog or at night -- and in optronics such as telescopes.Information packets on the units, which could sell for 800 million to 1 billion euros, will go out to potential bidders within the next couple of weeks, the sources said. Buyout groups such as Carlyle, Bridgepoint, Apax, CVC and KKR are expected to be interested, they added.Separately, Airbus has asked Lazard (N:LAZ) to find a buyer for the commercial part of its satellite-communications services unit Vizada, while intending to keep the government satellite-communications services business. Airbus bought the whole business from Apax for $960 million in 2011.Additionally, investment banking boutique Moelis is running the sale of Fairchild Controls, a small asset left over from Lagardere's 1989 acquisition of the defense and space activities of Fairchild Industries. Lagardere later helped to found EADS, last year renamed Airbus Group.In yet another transaction, Airbus has asked buyout groups and peers to bid for PFW Aerospace in a potential 300-500 million euro deal, the sources said.The German company, which supplies jetliner parts to both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), was always seen as a temporary part of Airbus, and the sale indicates concerns over this part of its supply chain have eased.Airbus' units ESG, Atlas Elektronik and AvDef also remain up for sale, while the group last month sold its aerospace engineering business Rostock System Technik (RST) to German peer Ferchau Engineering.Airbus confirmed a part of Vizada was up for sale, but declined to comment on other divestments. Potential bidders and the banks declined to comment, except for Moelis, Carlyle, CVC and KKR which were not immediately available.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A pound invested in the company's stock a couple of years later would have been worth 18 pounds ($27) by the time he left.East's engineering background with ARM is also seen as a key attribute as Rolls-Royce looks to develop quieter and more efficient engines for aircraft made by Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR), Edison Research analyst Roger Johnston said.TOP GAINERRolls-Royce shares, which have fallen 19 percent since the start of 2014, were the top gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index (FTSE) at 1204 GMT, up 3 percent at 10.36 pounds.Rishton, 57, steps down after a difficult period for the 131-year-old company. A decade of strong profit and revenue growth came to an end last year, followed by a warning in February that profit would fall by as much as 13 percent this year.Chairman Davis acknowledged there had been shareholder disquiet around the time of the profit warnings, but Rishton's decision to stand down was entirely his own. Rishton said that after 14 years of being a CEO and CFO he was ""leaving for a change of lifestyle"".East will also take over in the midst of a restructuring program, with 2,600 jobs being cut from a global total of about 55,000, as the group attempts to compete with bigger and more profitable U.S. rival  General Electric  (N:GE).He will be helped, however, by last week's momentum-boosting order to supply engines for 50 Airbus A380 planes for Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL]. The $9.2 billion deal is the biggest in the British company's history.East declined to give details about his strategy before he starts in the role, but he said that ""the transformations absolutely need to continue and be driven through to conclusion"".He will receive a base salary of 925,000 pounds ($1.4 million) a year, plus a pension and performance-related bonus, the company said, adding that the benefits are in line with or below those offered to Rishton.($1 = 0.6650 pounds)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1175,"Apr 21, 2015 05:58PM ET","Poland to buy U.S. Patriot missiles, French helicopters",nan,"By Wiktor Szary and Marcin GoettigWARSAW (Reuters) - Poland said on Tuesday it would buy Raytheon Co's Patriot missiles from the United States and provisionally selected French Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) helicopters as it speeds up the modernization of its military amid tensions with Russia.The choice of suppliers, in deals potentially worth $8 billion, strikes a trans-Atlantic balance as Eastern Europe's largest economy re-arms itself on NATO's frontline while edging toward a bigger role in Europe's defense industry.""For the armed forces' technical modernization and the Polish armed forces' resilience to be effective, the so-called anti-missile shield ... had to become the priority of priorities,"" said Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski.Poland will enter exclusive talks with the U.S. government on the Patriot missile defense system. It plans to buy eight missile batteries by 2025, including two within three years of signing.A consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA was also competing for the $5 billion missile defense contract - the largest in Poland's military history.The United States said it welcomed the announcement from its stalwart NATO ally.The program ""is expected to generate at least $2.5 billion in U.S. export content - that means supporting American jobs at home and growing our manufacturing base,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula last year prompted great concern among NATO members in Eastern Europe.Since the end of the Cold War, Poland has usually kept closer defense and security ties with the United States.But in the past few years, policymakers have been lobbying for a stronger security relationship with the rest of Europe, especially after the Obama administration scaled back its missile defense shield plans in Eastern Europe.AIRBUS STATUSPoland also named the Caracal EC725 of Airbus Helicopters as its preferred choice in a $3 billion utility helicopter tender, subject to army testing, dropping U.S. and Italian competitors.It trimmed the potential order from an original 70 helicopters to 50. This would still represent Poland's biggest defense acquisition from Western Europe since the end of the Cold War. Deliveries could begin as early as 2017.The helicopter decision was seen as delicate because rival bidders Sikorsky, United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX)'s helicopter unit in the United States, and AgustaWestland, owned by Italy's Finmeccanica, have factories in Poland whose unions had warned of job losses.A French defense official said the Caracal helicopters and their Turbomeca engines would both be assembled in Poland as part of a wide-ranging industrial pact. Airbus has offered what could evolve into ""fifth nation"" status for Poland alongside its Western European founders to support its bid.The official said Poland had monitored France's decision last year to suspend delivery of warships to Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, but denied any explicit link between that move and Poland's decision to buy French hardware.Poland said that because of ""changing security circumstances,"" it had decided to speed up a separate acquisition of attack helicopters.Four companies have expressed interest in supplying some 30 units in a deal already brought forward by two years in light of the crisis in Ukraine.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1177,"Apr 17, 2015 09:22AM ET","Airbus upbeat on jet market, still studying A380 upgrade",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) sees continued strength in the aircraft market and may be able to increase production of its most popular jets beyond their planned rates if that trend continues, the head of the European planemaker said on Friday.Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the plane making unit of Airbus Group, said he believed Airbus would eventually recapture the top plane making slot from Boeing (NYSE:BA) as its new A350 jet comes into its own, but market share came second to profitable growth.Airbus is well placed to deliver 15 of the wide-body A350 planes this year and continues to expect more orders than deliveries in 2015, he said in Paris at a briefing to French aerospace media association AJPAE.Airbus plans to raise output of its best-selling A320 model to 50 planes a month from 42 month between now and 2017 and has talked of pushing output even further to 60 or beyond. Rival Boeing is on a similar course with its competing 737 jet.""The market is very strong and we have said we can produce 50 (A320s) a month by 2017 and if the market remains supported there is the possibility to go higher,"" Bregier said.Asked if he could give a theoretical estimate of how long it would take to reach such levels, he said it would depend on the supply chain but agreed with a suggestion that it could be around 2020, adding ""we are far from doing the studies on that.""Airbus and Boeing are increasingly reliant on such models to drive profits and provide the cash needed to complete new jets or carry out upgrades to other types of aircraft.Bregier reiterated Airbus would not abandon the much larger A380 after an order slump for that model, but said it would take a careful look at the business case before deciding whether to revamp it with new engines as requested by Dubai's Emirates.""We are working on the evolution of the aircraft and I have said there will be aerodynamic and engine options, just as there are across the portfolio, but we must launch them at the right time and when we believe there is a business case.""He said there was no connection between the study of an upgrade and the decision by Emirates to place a large engine order with Rolls-Royce for the existing version of A380.There has been speculation that Emirates' decision to drop its traditional U.S. engine supplier strengthened the chances that Rolls-Royce (L:RR) would agree to re-engine the A380.Airbus is in the midst of upgrades to its two other models, the medium-haul A320 and the long-range A330.Bregier said the first upgraded A320neo with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines would be delivered by the end of the year and that the first flight tests with alternative engines from CFM (N:GE) (PA:SAF) should take place before June's Paris Airshow.Bregier said the weak euro would not have much short-term impact on Airbus due to hedging, but that it would provide immediate benefits to small export-oriented parts suppliers.Some of those smaller companies in the supply chain may stop offshoring work to cheaper locations and start repatriating work to Europe as a result of currency moves, he added."
1178,"Apr 17, 2015 08:52AM ET",Rolls-Royce wins $9.2 billion order from Emirates for A380 engines,nan,"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) has won a $9.2 billion deal to supply engines for 50 A380 aircraft for Dubai's Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL], the largest order in its history and giving it a boost after a torrid year of profit warnings. Shares in the British company rose an initial 2 percent after Friday's announcement, which Rolls-Royce said was the biggest order placed with a British company outside the defense sector.It is the first time the Gulf carrier has ordered Rolls-Royce engines for its superjumbo fleet, the rest of which is powered by Engine Alliance, a joint venture of  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).Announcing the deal at a press conference attended by Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rishton and Emirates President Tim Clark, the companies said the aircraft in question would enter service from 2016.Though a shift in engine supplier is rare, the deal had been flagged by Clark in March, when he said he was considering Rolls-Royce engines for the aircraft. The selection could raise hopes that Rolls will win more orders from Emirates. Emirates, the leading buyer of the A380 jet with 140 orders, has said that if Airbus (PA:AIR) goes ahead with a revamp of its A380 superjumbo it would place a big order for that model. Clark has said he expected any so-called A380neo to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines based on its Trent XWB engine.""As far as the neo is concerned, we await the deliberations from Toulouse,"" Clark told reporters on Friday, referring to Airbus headquarters.Rolls-Royce was also awaiting Airbus's decision on the A380 upgrade, the CEO said. ""We have said that if they do, we will support that. We think that we can find a business case for it.""The contract signed on Friday for the classic A380 includes a long-term ""Totalcare"" package, which means Rolls-Royce will also provide service and maintenance to Emirates.Rolls-Royce is the world's second-largest maker of aeroengines after GE, but its outlook has been hit by canceled orders in other parts of its business, where it makes power systems for the oil and gas, marine and industrial sectors.It warned in February that profits this year could fall by as much as 13 percent, on top of an 8 percent drop last year, saying the low oil price had increased uncertainty. In its aerospace division, the company is in the throes of a cost-cutting program, aiming to shed 2,600 jobs to try to improve profitability. Rishton said the new order would help secure jobs but the 2,600 planned cuts would still go ahead.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1183,"Apr 16, 2015 01:52AM ET","The jumbo jet faces a make or break year at Boeing, Airbus",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim HepherSeattle/Paris (Reuters) - The jumbo jet, for many years the workhorse of modern air travel, could be close to running out of runway.Last year, there were zero orders placed by commercial airlines for new Boeing 747s or Airbus A380s, reflecting a fundamental shift in the industry toward smaller, twin-engine planes. Smaller planes cost less to fly than the stately, four-engine jumbos, which can carry as many as 525 passengers.The slump in sales of the jets has raised questions over how long manufacturers can sustain production. It has also fueled internal debate in both companies over the future of the planes, sources said.The outcome of those discussions will affect the value of existing fleets and thousands of production jobs at the plane makers and their many parts suppliers.Sales forces at Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) are fighting for potential orders plane by plane as they seek to keep production going beyond the end of the decade, said other aviation market sources. The aircraft makers are offering discounts of at least 50 percent from catalog prices of around $400 million for a jumbo jet, those sources said. Airbus has said it is also considering a revamp to make its 'superjumbo' more attractive to buyers.Boeing in September plans to slow the pace of production of its latest 747-8 model to an average of 1.3 planes a month from 1.5 currently. At that rate the orders it already has in hand will only keep the production line going for 2 1/2 years.The crunch, though, will come earlier because it can take up to two years from ordering the first part to finishing a jet, and no one wants to start the process if it is unclear whether the plane will be completed and delivered to a customer.""I can see demand for the 747-8 in small numbers, but you have got to ask if they can keep the production line open if they don't get some new orders,"" said Tony Whitty, chief executive of UK-based aircraft re-marketing firm Cabot Aviation, which trades, manages and leases jets. ""You also wonder at what price they are selling."" LONG DESCENTUse of the 747 has dropped steadily over the last two decades, reflecting the rise of two-engine jets that have come close to matching its range. Over the same period production of large twin-engined jets like the Boeing 777 has risen seven-fold. Last year, Boeing booked 283 new orders for the 777 and now has a backlog of 547 orders.Airbus is more upbeat than Boeing about the prospects for jumbo jets but both now agree it has become a niche category. Airlines still need jumbo jets but only for certain polar flights - where a two-engine jet may be less safe than a four-engine jumbo because of the lack of places for an emergency landing - and busy routes where landing slots are scarce.The risk is most visible for Boeing, where investors could face a $1 billion accounting charge if 747 production is shut down, according to company disclosures.Boeing recently received a high-profile boost with a provisional order for two new jets to serve as Air Force One for the U.S. President but the 747's future depends a lot more on sales of the much-less glamorous windowless freight model. That has a unique hinged nose and can carry very large equipment, such as oil drilling rigs.So far this year, Boeing has sold three.  Atlas Air Worldwide  (O:AAWW) recently said it plans to order more for its cargo fleet, but wouldn't say when or how many. The world's biggest 747 freight customer, Cargolux [CLUX.UL], also says it likes the plane, but has a pending order for only three.A sustained upturn in air freight traffic could secure the 747 a longer future. International freight traffic rose 4.8 percent last year, but volume has only just recovered from a collapse in 2009 during the financial crisis. CARGO HAULERBoeing reckons some 143 older freighters will need to be replaced, stretching demand for the 747 through the 2020s, the program vice president, Bruce Dickinson, said in an interview.""We know there is a long-term market for this airplane and some of the unique things it can do,"" Dickinson said from his office overlooking the 747 production line at the giant Everett plant near Seattle.But Boeing's effort to sell new 747s is overshadowed by the many older 747s available for lease, which have suddenly been made more attractive because of a big slide in fuel prices since the middle of last year. Leasing companies say there is scant interest in new 747-8s when 82 freighters are baking in desert parking lots.The older planes can be leased for as little as $400,000 a month, compared with up to $1.4 million in monthly lease payments for a new 747-8 freighter, experts say.""That's a pretty big difference,"" said Gueric Dechavanne, vice president at Collateral Verifications, a Connecticut-based aircraft appraisal firm.Some companies have extended 747 leases for three to four years, said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of leasing company AerCap (N:AER).""It's a challenge to lease a freighter,"" Kelly told Reuters. ""It's definitely a challenge to sell them.""Airbus's A380 is a newer plane – its first flight was almost exactly 10 years ago - and has become a mainstay of Middle East carriers that offer opulent suites to first class passengers. But the drop in demand is prompting Airbus to weigh whether to revamp the plane with new engines, or carry on with the existing model. Airbus has 161 orders for the planes in hand, or more than five years of production. But it acknowledges that not all of those jets will be delivered, leaving it with barely three years of guaranteed output. Given the long lead times, Airbus must bring in more orders soon to avoid having to taper production.""We are always looking at product improvements, but there is so much untapped potential in the existing aircraft,"" said Airbus marketing head Chris Emerson.Airbus could announce an A380 revamp as early as the Dubai Airshow in November, but must first find a way to assure investors it can recover several billion dollars of development costs, sources said. Analysts say on option could be to apply for more European government loans, though that risks exacerbating trade tensions with the United States.Top customer Emirates is offering to double its planned purchase of 140 A380s if Airbus carries out the improvements, which the Dubai carrier's Chief Executive Tim Clark tells Reuters will be ""extremely good for the (airline's) bottom line.""But Airbus's board is unlikely to back a new A380 model for just one customer."
1184,"Apr 15, 2015 05:31PM ET","Airbus plans exceptional 10 percent buyback, new legal status",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) will ask shareholders to approve an exceptional share buyback of up to 10 percent of its capital at its annual meeting on May 27, the aerospace group said on Wednesday.The move is designed to allow the board of Europe's largest aerospace company flexibility to distribute part of the proceeds from divestments, it said in a statement.The exceptional buyback comes on top of a separate share repurchase program covering up to 10 percent of the company's capital, which would be renewed under a separate resolution. The existing program is mainly linked to employee share schemes.Airbus Group does not intend to hold more than 10 percent of its own share capital as a result of both buybacks, it said, adding that the shares acquired through the exceptional buyback would be ""promptly canceled"".Airbus is also pressing ahead with previously announced plans to adopt ""European Company"" status.Holding company Airbus Group N.V. would be renamed Airbus Group SE and would keep its registered seat and head office in Amsterdam.""The main purpose of this move is to reflect, in its legalform, the diversified operational presence of the group in different European countries,"" the statement said.The planemaker would remain listed in Paris, Frankfurt and Spain.A European Company is governed by European Union law that is applicable in all 28 member states. The regime is designed to smooth the governance of companies formed from cross-border mergers or with their principal operations in several countries.Airbus Group dropped the word ""European"" from its title when it changed its name from European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS) last year to embrace its planemaking brand, but its leaders continue to stress its European credentials.Formed from an international merger in 2000, it was plagued for years by Franco-German in-fighting that has receded under Chief Executive Tom Enders and his predecessor Louis Gallois.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1190,"Apr 12, 2015 03:11PM ET",Airbus needs more time to decide on A380 changes: paper,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) will not abandon its A380 jumbo jet program despite slow sales, its chief executive told Les Echos newspaper, and needs more time to decide whether to redesign its engines as major customer Emirates Airline has requested.Emirates, the leading buyer of the existing A380 jet with 140 orders, has been pushing Airbus to revamp the plane with newer engines, a move that could lower the number of seats airlines must sell to break even.Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier appeared to rebuff the request in the interview with Les Echos published online on Sunday.""We are already working on ways to make the A380 more attractive economically by adding seats while preserving the amazing comfort of the plane,"" he said.""Long-term, the question will be how to improve its performance by working on aerodynamics and motorization. But we will not do that until a good business plan can be found. That is not the case now and we have no intention to spend indiscriminately.""The CEO added that the A380 program would break even by the end of the year, and that Airbus hoped to maintain its financial performance. On Airbus' other new relatively new model, the A350, Bregier said that Qatar Airways has seen no issues with the plane after two months of service. Airbus aims to deliver about 15 A350s this year and eventually up to 10 per month by 2018.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1191,"Apr 08, 2015 07:07PM ET",Airbus eyes new seat choices as economy traffic booms,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Victoria BryanPARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) plans to offer airlines more choice in the way they configure their planes, and sees carriers opting for different levels of comfort within their economy cabins, a senior Airbus executive said on Wednesday.It also plans to redefine the capacity of its wide-body jets to add premium economy to the traditional economy and business classes to recognize market trends, Chris Emerson, head of marketing at Airbus, said in a telephone interview.Airbus now offers 8-abreast seating as the standard coach-class layout on its widebody A330, for example, but can offer 9 seats per row where airlines want to offer a leaner product in exchange for lower fares.Nine-abreast is of particular interest to Asian airlines serving price-sensitive customers, Emerson said.There is also interest in a 10-abreast A350 rather than the normal 9-abreast layout for that jet, he said.""Ninety percent of global air traffic is in the economy segment,"" he said. Airlines have long had the option to configure their cabins as they wish, but choices have been relatively slim.Emerson said that airlines would increasingly look at offering differing comfort levels within the economy cabin.""We see more and more segmentation in the market.""Besides offering choices to passengers, seats have long been the center of a deeper PR battle between Airbus and Boeing.Each accuses the other of squeezing in passengers to make their planes seem more efficient on paper.The new claims are likely to rekindle the debate days ahead of a major jet interiors show in Germany.In 2013, Airbus launched a campaign to persuade airlines to insist on economy class seats that were at least 18 inches wide, arguing that Boeing was squeezing passengers with narrower configurations to make its economic performance claims stick. Boeing officials deny this and say their rival has lost the argument because the wider fuselage on jets like the 777 allows for more seats in each row, without sacrificing comfort. Although it still says 18 inches is the standard, Airbus is giving more weight to the option to have higher density seating to give airlines flexibility. It has coined the terms ""Budget Economy"" or ""Max Abreast"" seating versus Comfort Economy.Currently, 10 percent of Airbus wide-body planes are in the ""Max Abreast"" configuration, Emerson said. He said 60 percent of Boeing planes were configured this way.""That comparison doesn't work because Boeing airplanes are designed with a higher standard and level of comfort,"" a Boeing spokesman said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1192,"Apr 07, 2015 05:51PM ET",Lapsed tenders hurt Modi's 'Make in India' defense industry push,nan,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Tommy WilkesNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian firms have spurned some $15 billion worth of government tenders to make a range of weapons since 2013, Defense Ministry officials say, in a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his drive to wean the country off imported arms.Executives cited unrealistic quality demands from a military short of planes, tanks and guns as a key reason for their reluctance to bid for projects. Complicating things further, the military doesn't want weapons from Indian firms with no track record in defense manufacturing, experts said.Irked by India's status as the world's biggest arms importer, Modi wants to build an advanced defense industry but almost a year into his ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to turn the country into a manufacturing powerhouse, not one large domestic weapons project has been awarded. Tenders for anything from air defense guns to surface-to-air missiles to transport planes have lapsed, Defense Ministry officials told Reuters. The tenders total around $15 billion according to a Reuters compilation of offers since early 2013.""'Make in India' is a laudable aim, but it's moving rather slowly. It's not a switch you can press and everything will fall into place,"" said Vivek Rae, head of procurement at the Defense Ministry from 2010-2012.Anil Ambani, the billionaire chairman of the Reliance Group, recounted at a recent conference how Modi asked him if he knew India didn't make tear gas shells. ""Even the tears we shed are foreign,"" Ambani quoted the nationalist leader, who took office last May, as saying. Modi wants to build a strong military after years of neglect that military planners say has left India vulnerable should rivals China and Pakistan ever launch a combined attack, although experts say this is highly unlikely. India is being challenged, however, in its Indian Ocean backyard, where China's more modernized navy is starting to assert itself.Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said new defense production policies will be unveiled this month to address the concerns of private firms: opaque procedures, unrealistic quality requirements and slow decision-making. ""We're trying to simplify procedures, create a level-playing field but still there are many cases of zero participation in tenders,"" said G. Mohan Kumar, the defense production secretary leading the localization drive.The military declined to comment, referring queries to the Defense Ministry, which controls procurement.RINGFENCING PROJECTSIndia gets 70 percent of its arms from abroad. For decades, it has bought off-the-shelf equipment mainly from Russia, which offered to assemble some weaponry locally but little in the way of technology transfers.Modi has vowed to change that by ringfencing $100 billion worth of defense deals for domestic companies over the next decade under which they can build on their own or with foreign partners. Last year the government asked several Indian companies to show interest in an estimated $1.7 billion deal to replace 1960s-era Swedish air defense guns, but only one said it could meet the requirements, said one of the Defense Ministry officials. He declined to identify the company.The head of one firm which told the government it was not interested in the project said the military laid down ""impossible"" requirements by insisting on technology that only foreign manufacturers had. He declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of defense issues.In November, the government put an estimated $2 billion proposal to replace its aging fleet of Avro cargo planes on ice after the tender attracted only one bidder, a partnership between Europe's Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) and India's Tata Sons.""Even if there is an alternative better solution, as per current practice the requirements cannot be changed, or if they are changed it is questioned,"" said M.V. Kotwal, head of defense business at infrastructure group Larsen and Toubro. ""The flexibility is not there.""Over the past 18 months, 41 requests for expressions of interest for naval projects alone fell through because of problems relating to manufacturing requirements, the Defense Ministry official added. JUMPSTARTTrying to move projects along, Modi's government in February approved an $8 billion proposal to build warships in India that had been awaiting cabinet signoff since 2012.It has also ordered an accelerated local program to build six diesel-electric submarines, in addition to six similar vessels that French firm DCNS is assembling in Mumbai port to replace India's aging underwater fleet. A Defense Ministry committee submitted a report last month identifying five private and state-run shipyards where the submarines could be built with a foreign partner. It will now invite expressions of interest for the $8.5 billion project.Experts said one problem is that some military officers eye technology only available in the west, without understanding what Indian firms can produce.""The armed forces are reluctant to accept hardware that doesn't have a record in operational conditions. Indian companies have no track record,"" said Bharat Karnad at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.Retired vice admiral Premvir Das added that to expect Indian companies to manufacture major defense platforms in the forseeable future is to ""live in a dreamland"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Both planemakers have set targets suggesting a slowdown this year.In the first quarter, the bulk of Airbus's new business fell in March when  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) finalised orders for 55 aircraft including 25 revamped A330 wide-body models.Philippine Airlines upgraded orders for 10 A321 jets to the A321neo, a re-engined 185-seat variant of the Airbus narrowbody family due to enter service in late 2016.Airbus logged 134 plane deliveries in the first quarter including one of its newest model, the A350, and four A380s.Deliveries slipped from 141 in the first quarter of last year as A320-family volumes dipped to 109 aircraft from 111 a year earlier and the wide-body A330 slipped to 20 from 28.Boeing last week posted 184 first-quarter deliveries, up from 161 a year earlier due partly to a jump in production of its 787 Dreamliner.

It intends to resume organizing and refile for an authorization vote in 12 months. The IAM filed for an election in January, saying it had about 12,000 authorization cards representing 60 percent of Delta's 20,000 flight attendants.On Monday, the union said in a statement that the ""number of questionable cards makes our showing of interest borderline."" Withdrawing the application starts a 12-month waiting period before the union can file for another election, the union said. That track is faster than waiting several months for the NMB to make a determination, then starting the 12-month clock, the union said.In a notice to employees, Delta said the union's statements ""appear to validate the many concerns raised by many of you when the IAM filed for the election.""The IAM also is seeking to organize workers at Boeing Co facilities in South Carolina and Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) NV facilities in Alabama.

1196,"Apr 03, 2015 03:11PM ET",Germanwings co-pilot increased speed as jet went down,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - The pilot at the controls of a Germanwings jet that crashed in the French Alps accelerated the plane into the mountainside, killing all 150 people on board, according to French investigators.France's BEA crash investigation agency declined to confirm growing evidence against the co-pilot before completing its own analysis, but the chilling new detail from a newly recovered second 'black box' seemed to corroborate prosecutors' claims that he killed himself and everyone else deliberately.""A first reading shows that the pilot in the cockpit used the automatic pilot to put the airplane on a descent towards an altitude of 100 feet,"" the BEA said in a statement.""Then several times the pilot modified the automatic pilot settings to increase the speed of the airplane as it descended.""Based on cockpit audio recordings from the first black box, recovered hours after the March 24 crash, prosecutors believe 27-year-old German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and veered the plane into a descent.As he barricaded himself at the Airbus A320's controls, he appears to have ignored efforts by his senior colleague to bash his way through the cockpit door of the 24-year-old jet, which had been reinforced under rules to protect pilots after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.The latest evidence on the plane's speed was extracted from a charred and badly dented flight data recorder discovered among wreckage on Thursday, nine days after the worst aviation disaster in France since the 2000 Concorde crash.The box arrived at BEA headquarters outside Paris under police guard on Thursday evening and investigators immediately set to work reconstructing the last moments of flight 9525 to Duesseldorf.The BEA's purely factual description of the initial data focused on the autopilot, which is governed by a set of knobs sitting on a console between the two pilots.But the brief actions described by the BEA lent technical weight to a picture painted by prosecutors of methodical and cool-headed actions as the aircraft hurtled for eight minutes toward the ground under the control of a trained pilot.""The autopilot was reprogrammed several times to increase the speed during the descent,"" a BEA spokeswoman said.ANALYZING DATAThe flight data recorder monitors hundreds of parameters, including any commands made directly from the co-pilot's seat. As well as inputs to shared controls such as the autopilot, it may record seat movements that might prove which pilot remained at the controls while the other left the cockpit.The BEA now faces the laborious task of synchronizing the flight data extracted from thermally protected memory strips with the earlier cockpit audio recordings and radar tracks.The agency's spokeswoman said it would ""days or even weeks"" to finish analyzing the data.The BEA, whose mandate is to prevent future accidents rather than attribute blame, signaled its intention earlier this week to complete its own safety investigation and deliver a final report, whatever the outcome of separate judicial probes. It said it would focus on cockpit door mechanisms and pilot screening, in a sign that it could issue recommendations that some experts say may prompt a rethink on regulation worldwide.Lubitz's motives remain a mystery but investigators have uncovered evidence that he had made suicide preparations.German prosecutors said on Thursday that Lubitz had made Internet searches on ways to commit suicide in the days ahead of the crash as well as searches about cockpit doors and safety precautions.Germanwings parent Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has said Lubitz told its flight school in 2009 he had gone through a period of severe depression. As part of their crash probe, German prosecutors searched the offices of five doctors whose help Lubitz had sought, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1197,"Mar 31, 2015 05:35PM ET",Lufthansa flight school knew of crash pilot's depression,nan,"By Victoria BryanBERLIN (Reuters) - The German pilot who crashed a plane in the French Alps last week, killing 150 people, told officials at a Lufthansa training school in 2009 that he had gone through a period of severe depression, the airline said on Tuesday.The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane.The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims.Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a ""previous episode of severe depression,"" Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school.Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot's license.They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him.Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. PSYCHIATRIC SCREENING Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft.For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz's statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters.""Based on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,"" Green wrote in an email. ""I do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.""European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots.French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry.""In these cases, when you're acting for families, they're keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,"" Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

PAC-3 missiles will be bought from the United States.South Korea has been trying to bolster its arsenal in the face of a missile threat from North Korea.""Once the Patriot upgrades are completed, the warheads of North Korean ballistic missiles can be struck directly, and minimizing damage to the ground,"" DAPA said in a statement.Reclusive North Korea sporadically test fires missiles on the Korean peninsula, most recently in protest against annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises.The KF-X mid-level fighter jet program will aim to develop jets to replace aging F-4 and F-5 fighters by 2025, as well as adding air defense for its sole foreign partner, Indonesia, which is paying a fifth of the development cost. KAI beat out Korean Air Lines (KS:003490), which had partnered with Airbus (PA:AIR). The PAC-3 missiles will be built by Lockheed Martin. The total upgrade is expected to cost about 1.3 trillion won ($1.18 billion), two people with knowledge of the matter said.Both declined to be identified because the details of the projects are confidential. With South Korea's arms procurement budget increasingly constrained, some analysts have questioned the viability of the fighter jet project. A state-run South Korean think tank estimated the KF-X program would need an additional 10 trillion won for production.Indonesia agreed last year to pay 20 percent of the development costs.DAPA's estimated budget requirement for arms procurement in 2016-2020 was 96 trillion won, up from 72 trillion won DAPA estimated for 2015-2019, Yonhap reported this month. The budget has already been hit by high-profile purchases such as the 40 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets for 7.34 trillion won finalised last year, and four in-flight refueling tankers for about 1.4 trillion won under negotiation.DAPA declined to comment on the cost of the projects, or on Lockheed's involvement.Lockheed Martin said it was committed to supporting the KF-X program but did not have any immediate comment on the Patriot upgrade.

""We have no information of our own on that,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said.A spokesman for state prosecutors in Duesseldorf declined to comment on Sunday on the various media reports, adding there would be no official statement before Monday.The mass circulation Bild am Sonntag said investigators had found evidence that Lubitz feared losing his eyesight, apparently because of a detached retina.However, it was unclear whether this was due to an organic failure or psychosomatic illness, when physical problems are thought to be caused or aggravated by psychological factors such as stress.""FOR GOD'S SAKE""Investigators have retrieved cockpit voice recordings from one of the A320 jet's ""black boxes"", which they say show Lubitz locked himself alone in the cockpit, before causing the jet to crash in southern France as it headed to Duesseldorf from Barcelona.Bild am Sonntag reported that the voice recorder data showed that the locked-out captain said to his colleague inside the cockpit: ""For God's sake, open the door.""The pilot can then be heard trying to smash the door down. Even when he yells: ""Open the damn door!"" Lubitz does not give an answer as passengers' screams can be heard in the background just seconds before the fatal crash, the paper said.The newspaper also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher at a secondary school in a small town near Duesseldorf, had recently told students she was expecting a baby.On Saturday, Bild published an interview with a woman who said she had a relationship with Lubitz in 2014 and that he told her about planning a spectacular gesture so ""everyone will know my name and remember it"".AIRBUS BOSS CRITICIZES MEDIA The chief executive of Airbus (PA:AIR), which made the aircraft that Lubitz crashed, criticized uninformed experts sounding off about the disaster on television talk shows and he called for better oversight of the media.""Some (experts) speculated without any facts, fantasized and lied. That makes a mockery of the victims,"" Tom Enders was quoted as saying by Bild am Sonntag.Airbus has not been in the crosshairs of investigators following the crash as evidence early on pointed to a deliberate act by Lubitz, but French investigators warned on Saturday that it was too early to rule out other explanations for the crash.Berlin aims to review safety rules for airlines in cooperation with the industry. ""There are high safety standards in the aviation sector, but they still need regular updating,"" Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told Bild am Sonntag.Several airlines, including Lufthansa, have changed their rules since the crash and now require two crew members in the cockpit at all times, a measure already mandatory in the United States but not in Europe.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1201,"Mar 26, 2015 11:02PM ET",Airlines introduce two-person cockpit rule after Alps crash,nan,"By Victoria Bryan and Tim HepherBERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines rushed on Thursday to change their rules so as to require a second crew member in the cockpit at all times, hours after French prosecutors suggested a co-pilot who barricaded himself alone at the controls of a jetliner had crashed it on purpose.The United States already requires two crew members to be in the cabin at all times, but many other countries do not, allowing pilots to leave the flight deck, for example to use the toilet, as long as one pilot is at the controls.That is precisely what French prosecutors suspect happened on the Germanwings flight on Tuesday. They say Andreas Lubitz, 27, locked the captain out and appears to have set the controls to crash into a mountain, killing all 150 people on board.Airlines including Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC), Britain's easyJet (L:EZJ),  Air Canada  (TO:AC), Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) and Air Berlin (DE:AB1) all said within hours that they had introduced a requirement that two crew members be in the cockpit at all times. Canada said it would immediately impose such a rule on all its airlines while those that already had such rules in place, including Ryanair (I:RYA), rushed to reassure customers.Among the companies that did not announce such a policy change was Germanwings parent Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), whose CEO Carsten Spohr said he believed it was unnecessary.""I don't see any need to change our procedures here,"" Spohr told journalists. ""It was a one-off case. But we will look at it with the various experts at Lufthansa and the authorities. We shouldn't lose ourselves in short-term measures.""His comments drew criticism on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with some people demanding the airline introduce the two person-rule.I'M FLYING WITH YOU""@lufthansa will you insist on having 2 crew in the cockpit at all times from today? I'm flying with you this weekend...,"" asked Twitter user @kazababes.Later on Thursday Spohr told German broadcaster ARD that Lufthansa would sit down with other German carriers and the country's aviation authority on Friday to discuss the matter. ""We will see whether there are measures that can be taken quickly to further improve safety,"" he said.Germany's aviation association BDL said all airlines in the country, including Lufthansa, had agreed to discuss such rule changes.""Today we spoke with all our members about possible consequences,"" BDL managing director Matthias von Randow told Reuters. ""We will therefore look at introducing these new procedures without delay.""Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said they have strict, multi-layered systems in place to protect the cockpit but declined to comment further. The incident is likely to provoke further debate about the future of cockpit protections. Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, regulators have required cockpit doors to be impenetrable when locked from the inside.But the idea that pilots themselves could be a danger creates reason to re-examine such policies, said retired French crash investigator Alain Bouillard.""Today we have the reverse question: should we be blocking doors?"" he said. Last year's disappearance of Malaysia Airlines 370 raised such questions, although whether the pilots played any role in that plane's disappearance has never been confirmed.LAM Flight TM-470 crashed in Namibia in November 2013 after what investigators said were ""intentional actions by the pilot"" after the first officer left the flight deck, causing the death of 33 people. An Egypt Air flight 990 from Los Angeles to Cairo crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 217 on board, in 1999. The cause is disputed but U.S. investigators determined the probable cause was deliberate action by the relief first officer. U.S.-based Adams Rite Aerospace, a unit of Transdigm (N:TDG) which supplies systems to secure cockpit doors on all Airbus planes, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Acquaintances described Lubitz as an affable young man who had given no sign of harboring harmful intent.According to Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, Lubitz acted ""for a reason we cannot fathom right now but which looks like intent to destroy this aircraft"".Setting the plane's controls for rapid descent was an act that ""could only have been voluntary"", Robin said. ""He had... no reason to stop the pilot-in-command from coming back into the cockpit. He had no reason to refuse to answer to the air controller who was alerting him on the loss of altitude.""The captain, who had stepped out of the cockpit, probably to use the toilet, tried to force his way back in: ""You can hear banging to try to smash the door down,"" Robin said.Describing sound recordings from one of the plane's black boxes, Robin said most of the passengers would not have been aware of their fate until the very end.""Only toward the end do you hear screams,"" he said. ""And bear in mind that death would have been instantaneous...the aircraft was literally smashed to bits.""FlightRadar24, an online air tracking service that uses satellite data, said it had found evidence the autopilot was abruptly switched from cruising height to maintain an altitude of just 100 feet, the lowest possible setting. The plane crashed at about 6,000 feet.""Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 you can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting,"" Fredrik Lindahl, chief executive of the Swedish tracking service, said.The CEO of Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said its air crew were picked carefully and subjected to psychological vetting.""No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said.Attention will now focus on the motivations of Lubitz, a German national who joined the budget carrier in September 2013 and had just 630 hours of flying time - compared with the 6,000 hours of the flight captain, named in German media only as ""Patrick S."" in accordance with usual practice.""SUICIDE"" THE WRONG WORDRobin said there were no grounds to suspect that Lubitz was carrying out a terrorist attack. ""Suicide"" was also the wrong word to describe actions which killed so many other people, the prosecutor added: ""I don't necessarily call it suicide when you have responsibility for 100 or so lives.""The family of the co-pilot arrived in France for a tribute alongside other victims but was being kept apart from the others, Robin said.Police set up guard outside Lubitz's house in Montabaur, Germany. Acquaintances in the town said they were stunned. ""I'm just speechless. I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me,"" said Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of the local flight club where Lubitz received his flying license years ago.""He was a lot of fun, even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet. He was just another boy like so many others here.""A photo on Lubitz's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which was later taken down, shows a smiling young man posing in front of San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge.Robin said the conversation between the two pilots before the captain left the cockpit started normally but that Lubitz's replies became ""laconic"" as they started readying what would have been the normal descent to the airport of Duesseldorf.""His responses become very brief. There is no proper exchange as such,"" he said.Investigators were still searching for the second of the two black boxes on Thursday in the ravine where the plane crashed, 100 km (65 miles) from Nice, which would contain data from the plane's instruments.Pilots may temporarily leave the cockpit at certain times and in certain circumstances, such as while the aircraft is cruising, according to German aviation law. Cockpit doors can be opened from the outside with a code, in line with regulations introduced after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but the code can be overridden from inside the cockpit. Lufthansa's CEO said that either the pilot had entered the code incorrectly, or the co-pilot inside had overridden it.Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris. Madrid revised down on Thursday the number of Spanish victims to 50 from 51 previously.As well as Germans and Spaniards, victims included three Americans, a Moroccan and citizens of Britain, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Iran and the Netherlands, officials said. However, DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.The families of victims were being flown to Marseille on Thursday before being taken up to the zone close to the crash site. Chapels had been prepared for them with a view of the mountain where their relatives died.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,"" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter.Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard.Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said.French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms.Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. ""We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,"" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters.In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: ""A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.""It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world's most used passenger jets.It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December.SHARP DESCENTGermanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference.Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday.Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground.The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUDAs helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in.""There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,"" an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a ""dark day for Lufthansa"".""My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,"" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there.Family members arrived at Barcelona's El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others' shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff.In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. ""The families knew each other,"" he told Reuters. ""The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.""King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened.In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the ""awful tragedy"".Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's  Safran  (PARIS:SAF).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1210,"Mar 22, 2015 08:55AM ET",U.S. multinationals set to face much more pain from strong dollar,nan,"By Sinead CarewNEW YORK (Reuters) - The surging value of the U.S. dollar may be posing the biggest threat to U.S. corporate earnings since the 2008 financial crisis, hurting results at most U.S.-based multinationals. Some on Wall Street are even talking about an earnings recession.The dollar's gain of 22 percent in the past 12 months against a basket of major currencies has landed a double whammy on U.S. companies with big sales abroad. Revenue and earnings from foreign markets are worth less when translated into greenbacks and their costs become relatively less competitive against rivals producing in countries with declining currencies.Dollar moves of this magnitude in the past have resulted in what Bank of America/Merrill Lynch strategists term an ""earnings recession,"" which is generally defined as at least two successive quarters of declining earnings from the year-earlier quarters. The brokerage says that a 25 percent gain in the U.S. dollar in a 12-month period has historically coincided with a 10 percent decline in the market's earnings per share.That hasn't happened yet - but the downward trend is clear. Wall Street analysts currently estimate earnings growth of 1.3 percent for 2015, down from a forecast of 8.1 percent at the beginning of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 500's earnings per share are expected to drop 3.1 percent in the first quarter and 0.7 percent in the second quarter before recovering modestly in the second-half of the year.Nearly one-fifth of S&P 500 companies have warned on earnings for the first quarter, with at least 49 companies mentioning the effects of the dollar on results, according to Thomson Reuters.""This is just the beginning,"" said Richard Bernstein, veteran Wall Street strategist and now CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. ""This impact of the dollar on U.S. earnings could last for three to seven years. It may not happen every quarter but there's a secular risk to U.S. earnings, primarily to multinationals, as the dollar appreciates.""Expectations for S&P 500 earnings are expected to keep falling as companies tally the dollar impact on results in the next few weeks.Take chemicals producer DuPont (N:DD), for example. On Jan. 27, the company forecast full-year earnings of $4.00 to $4.20 for 2015 after a 60-cent negative drag from the dollar, based on its level on Jan. 23. Since that time, the dollar index (DXY), which measures the dollar against six different major currencies – the euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc, Swedish krona and Canadian dollar - has gained nearly 3.5 percent. Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander estimated in a March 11 note that DuPont's currency hit for 2015 earnings will be an additional 5 to 10 cents. Dupont, whose quarterly results are due on April 21, declined to comment.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its expectations for U.S. economic growth and inflation over the next two years in what was widely seen as an acknowledgment that the soaring dollar has stalled its plan to start raising interest rates.That temporarily arrested the dollar's sharp gains, but many strategists see the greenback continuing to rally, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicting the euro will fall more than 10 percent in the next 12 months to $0.95 from $1.082 late on Friday.International revenues account for about one-third of S&P 500 sales, according to Goldman Sachs data, and more than 40 percent for technology, materials, energy and industrial companies. The dollar's gains are a boon for rivals in Europe and elsewhere that have more of their costs in currencies, such as the euro, that have declined and will get the translation benefits from dollar sales.For instance, European aircraft maker Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR) could eventually see an improvement in margins as it translates dollar revenues back into euros. Its hedging of sales at a much lower dollar exchange rate will, though, delay the full impact for years. The company may also have room to price more competitively to win major contests against rival Boeing (N:BA), though it may prefer to focus on boosting profits rather than increasing market share.    BIG COMPANIES WARN North American public companies could give up more than $25 billion in revenues in the first quarter alone, because of currency-related volatility, said Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FiREapps, a foreign exchange data analytics firm in Phoenix, Arizona. The fourth-quarter effect was about $18.66 billion, according to Koester. Among those that have warned are technology giant  IBM  (N:IBM), semiconductor maker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), apparel retailer Michael Kors (N:KORS), fashion accessories company Fossil Group (O:FOSL), and industrial conglomerate Honeywell (N:HON), all of which have said results would be hit by  currency issues.Companies have been rushing to increase their protection against further dollar strength through increased hedging, though that adds to costs and if mismanaged can create risks of its own.""We have seen a huge increase in the number of our clients that are hedging – they have doubled or tripled. We have also seen a huge increase in the percentage of their exposure that they're hedging,"" said David Pierce, director of business development at GPS Capital Markets, a Salt Lake City-based corporate FX brokerage firm that helps clients hedge currency exposure.While hedging helps multinational companies navigate volatile currency markets, most don't hedge 100 percent of their exposure. Also, badly designed or ill-timed programs can end in disaster, such as in 2008, when Brazil's pulp and paper manufacturer Aracruz lost more than $2 billion betting that the Brazilian real would continue to gain in value. Instead, the currency plunged against the dollar.The dollar's strength is a particular problem for companies with exposure to Latin America. A massive effective devaluation of Venezuela's bolivar has hurt companies including tissue and diaper maker Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which have had to sharply discount the value of their assets in Venezuela. And the weakness of the real and the Mexican peso will only add to issues in those markets. Companies who sell almost all their goods and services within the United might be the best hiding place against the impact of a strong dollar. A Goldman Sachs basket of domestic U.S.-focused companies has gained about 22 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 13 percent rise for the S&P 500.Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities and multi-asset strategies for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management in San Francisco, said investors have likely factored in the dollar's strength into this quarter's reports, but they should prepare for more negative effects over the rest of the year. ""It will have a bigger impact going forward. I expect the impact on third-quarter earnings to be much more dramatic,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1212,"Mar 18, 2015 10:41PM ET",U.S. to chart new territory in Gulf airline subsidy review,nan,"By Jeffrey DastinWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said Wednesday that it is in the early stages of studying claims that Gulf airlines have received market-distorting subsidies, a review involving uncharted territory for the U.S. government.No international trade rules or precedent by the United States exists for addressing airline subsidy claims, presenting a challenge for the administration as it determines how to proceed, a person familiar with the matter said. U.S. airlines contend that Gulf carriers can lower prices and offer more amenities on newer planes because of state subsidies.These issues do not fall under World Trade Organization rules but rather under bilateral ""Open Skies"" agreements that authorize commercial flying between countries.The agreements are silent on how to handle most subsidy claims, the source said. Yet alleged subsidies of more than $40 billion to Gulf airlines make the claim the largest that the administration has encountered and must be taken seriously, the source added.Last week, the administration asked U.S. airlines some 20 questions about the allegations.""The (U.S. government) interagency team did in fact ask the U.S. airlines and their consultants several technical and clarifying questions about the data and information contained in their report,"" U.S. Department of Transportation Press Secretary Ryan Daniels said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report.""However, we are in the early stages of thoroughly reviewing this matter in close coordination with our interagency partners,"" he said.The Obama administration has filed trade complaints on issues ranging from China's imposition of extra duties on American cars to India's ban on certain U.S. agricultural goods to allegedly protect against avian influenza.Aviation also has been at the center of a decade-old dispute in which the World Trade Organization found that planemakers from the United States and the European Union had received illegal subsidies.But Geneva-based watchdog's rules do not apply to air traffic rights or airline services, although it keeps these under review broadly.Meanwhile, the dispute between U.S. and Gulf airlines has escalated.On Tuesday, Emirates airline President Tim Clark promised to rebut the allegations, while Etihad Airways Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said the company received loans, not subsidies, from its government shareholder. Both had arranged meetings with Obama administration officials.Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (N:UAL), American Airlines (O:AAL) and their unions on Wednesday called on the administration to request a freeze on additional Gulf-airline flight departures to the United States.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1217,"Mar 13, 2015 12:51PM ET","Weak euro to help European companies, force U.S. rivals to adapt",nan,"By Tom Bergin and Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - The euro's slide toward parity with the dollar will provide a much-needed boost for European companies this year and force U.S. rivals to adapt their businesses or risk losing market share.While currency hedging arrangements mean the benefits may not be seen straight away, the currency's weakness has already cheered European chief executives by making their products cheaper overseas and lifting the value of dollar-based sales.""We have been handicapped by the strength of the euro, but now it seems that the wind is turning and we intend to make the most of this very positive currency effect that will help us deliver a nice increase of our sales and our profits in 2015,"" Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) told investors last month.Other companies predicting a tail wind from the around 20 percent drop in the value of the euro over the past six months to $1.06 on Friday include jet manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR), German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and French engineering groups Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and  Alstom  (PARIS:ALSO). Some U.S companies also see positives from the weaker euro, including lower borrowing costs, better performance at European units which export, stronger demand from Euro zone-based customers and, for the leisure sector, increased travel into the continent.However, most U.S. groups that discussed the currency in recent weeks including Apple (O:AAPL), Dupont (N:DD), Priceline (O:PCLN),  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and  General Electric  (N:GE), have warned they may face headwinds in Europe and elsewhere, and some, including Xerox (N:XRX), have cut earnings guidance as a result.These companies have said they are now looking to cut costs, increase the portion of inputs they source from inside the euro zone and adopt new pricing policies, to try and maintain market share and margins.""U.S. companies exporting goods to Europe could face margin pressure from price adjustments or promotions in Europe,"" said James Targett, analyst at Berenberg.With euro weakness likely to persist due to the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program and a likely hike in U.S. interest rates on the back of a stronger U.S. economy, longer term planning is a must.""You have to think about where your revenues are, where your manufacturing is and where you're buying your raw materials from,"" he added.TIME LAGMany companies said hedging contracts would mean the impact of the lower euro would take time to feed through. Paris-based Alstom and Swiss-headquartered engineer ABB, which has manufacturing plants in the euro zone, said it may not be felt until the second half of the year. Airbus said it was fully hedged for 2015, 2016 and ""largely"" for 2017, leading analysts to predict it could be 2018 before the group experienced any meaningful uplift.In the meantime, the weaker euro may actually weigh on some European companies' earnings because companies must report drops in the values of hedging instruments, which move in the opposite direction to companies' revenues. ""In itself, the drop in the euro is some good news. It should have a positive impact on our revenues, and our operating income. But, of course, in the short term it will have -- it will be a drag on our profitability rate,"" Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci and Puma owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), said on an analyst call last month.Kering said it was switching to the use of options, paying a premium to hedge against currency moves, rather than entering swap contracts which must be revalued each quarter with the changes in value put through the user's profit and loss account.U.S .companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and PepsiCo (N:PEP). said hedging would mitigate their losses in the short term. However, businesses are also looking at how they can reconfigure their operations to limit the hit from a weaker euro and capitalize on any opportunities.A number of companies said they would look at cutting costs. Others said they would try and push through euro price rises in Europe to try and compensate for the fact the euro is now worth less, although deflationary pressures across the continent means companies have little pricing power.U.S. conglomerate 3M (N:MMM) said it was looking at pegging some prices to the dollar and even renegotiating the prices at which it purchases goods.REGIONAL SELF-SUFFICIENCYMany companies said they were considering locking the benefits of the euro into their supply chain. ABB (VX:ABBN) CEO Uli Spiesshofer said his company was looking at ""taking further advantage of euro-based suppliers"". Nick Gangestad, CFO of 3M said his company was aim for more ""regional self-sufficiency"".This strategy may reduce costs in the short term but it poses risks.""The downside to this, however, is that local sourcing fails to leverage global scale and could make procurement less efficient. Scale is great for pricing power,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.For some U.S. companies, the lower currency will be a boon for long-struggling European subsidiaries. U.S.-based Caterpillar said it had been forced to downsize its excavator plant in Grenoble in recent years but that the weak euro could help drive its recovery.""A euro at parity (to the dollar) will just be a great tailwind for that… the currency benefit will just be gravy on that,"" CEO Doug Oberhelman said.Philip Morris International (N:PM), which has a significant portion of its debt denominated in euros, said they were also benefiting from lower borrowing costs, since meeting the coupons on euro debt was now cheaper in dollar terms.For a small number of U.S. companies, the euro drop may even be a net positive, operationally. Europe-based hotels' higher reliance on external visitors than those in the United States meant the draw of the weaker European currency may outweigh the costs of a stronger dollar in putting tourists off.""Roughly 30 percent of our European lodging demand comes from outside Europe, with about 20 points from North America and 6 points from Asia,"" said Arne Sorenson, Marriott International, Inc. CEO. ""In the United States, for example, 95 percent of our business is US business; 5 percent is inbound business.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1220,"Mar 10, 2015 11:48PM ET",Lessors see demand for Boeing 757 jet replacement,nan,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing companies are encouraging Boeing (N:BA) to build a jet to replace its discontinued 757, but stress the priority of all planemakers must be to deliver on existing orders for bread-and-butter models after a series of delays.Steven Udvar-Hazy, chief executive officer of  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) and widely seen as one of the industry's most influential figures, told a conference there would be demand for a new jet that seats 200 to 250 people in the next eight to 12 years.That timeline leaves room for Boeing to focus on upgrading its smaller 737, which provides much of the Chicago-based company's cash, while also giving engine makers time to develop improvements aimed at significant further fuel savings.But it could represent a shift of emphasis for Boeing, which has recently been telling investors that it favors incremental improvements to existing models rather than major new products.The last 757 was delivered a decade ago but it remains popular with U.S. airlines due to its range and performance, while its larger contemporary, the 767, is being replaced by the 787 Dreamliner.""In the Boeing family, there might be a gap between the largest 737 and the smallest 787 as the 767 fades away,"" Udvar-Hazy said at a conference organized by the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT).Until recently, it faced little challenge but Airbus (PA:AIR) has begun encroaching on the small but potentially lucrative segment with the largest version of its A320 family.Boeing told this week's ISTAT gathering that it was talking to customers about an aircraft slightly larger than a 757 with 20 percent more range, but did not say whether it favored a narrowbody or, considered more likely, a small twin-aisle jet.It has also previously said it will not build a direct successor to the single-aisle 737 MAX until 2030, but has not ruled out a small twin-aisle plane that some in the industry say could also seed technology for the next generation of smaller planes.Jeff Knittel, president of CIT Transportation and International Finance (N:CIT), said Boeing's best bet would be to offer a family of aircraft rather than just one model if it did anything to fill the gap between small and big jets.Lessors meanwhile saw overall stability in the aircraft market despite recent concerns about lower oil prices and a possible hike in US interest rates. But they urged manufacturers to watch execution and ensure smooth ramp-ups in production.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(http://bit.ly/18wBK0n)The International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA), which represents more than 100,000 pilots worldwide, joined the aircraft makers in issuing the paper.The paper cites recent testing by the Federal Aviation Administration that shows batteries packed in containers emit explosive gases when overheated.During the tests, a buildup of gases inside the containers led to explosions and violent fires which the aircraft fire protection systems were unable to suppress or extinguish.The Rechargeable Battery Association said in a statement that lithium-ion battery makers were committed to the safe transport of lithium batteries and the association would continue to work with industry and government officials, AP reported.The call for the ban pertains only to cargo shipments and applies to both lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries.Two major U.S. airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, recently decided not to accept rechargeable battery shipments, AP said.Representatives at ICAO, the Federal Aviation Administration, IFALPA and the Rechargeable Battery Association were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1223,"Mar 09, 2015 06:37PM ET","Boeing to improve 777, studies options for midsized jet",nan,"By Tim HepherPHOENIX (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) pledged on Monday to improve the efficiency and seating capacity of its 777 jetliner to shore up production of its most profitable airliner as it switches to a newer model.The 777 ""mini-jumbo"" is due for an extensive upgrade from 2020 with new engines and wings, but in the meantime Boeing needs to boost sales of the existing version to avoid having to cut production, which would undermine a key source of cash.Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at the planemaker division, told financiers that from the third quarter of 2016, the 777 would be delivered with a 2 percent gain in fuel efficiency thanks mainly to an aerodynamic facelift.Additionally, Boeing will make room for 14 extra seats.""This combination of improvement in fuel efficiency and more seats will yield about a 5 percent improvement in efficiency per seat,"" he told the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (Istat) conference in Arizona.Participants said the decision to spruce up the existing model is designed to allay speculation that Boeing may have to cut production and aims to underpin the value investors place on 777s in the resale market, which affects prices of new planes.Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said last month it would have to capture 40 to 60 orders a year to maintain production at a record 8.3 aircraft a month.Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) was forced last month to announce a 40 percent cut in production of the smaller A330, after failing to win enough orders to secure a smooth transition to a newer model that is due to enter service in 2017.Tinseth said Boeing was confident it could ""work through a successful transition"" for the 777.He also gave a glimpse of Boeing's research into a possible new mid-market product between its narrow-body and wide-body jets.There has been speculation about Boeing's plans to replace the 757, a jet popular with U.S. carriers that seats up to 240 people on transcontinental routes or across the Atlantic.Airbus has been encroaching into a niche traditionally dominated by Boeing with its A321neo.Tinseth said Boeing was looking beyond a pure replacement for the 757, which had already been covered by airline orders for the A321 or the largest type of Boeing 737.But he said customers had expressed interest in a jet bigger than a 757 and with 20 percent more range.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1224,"Mar 09, 2015 02:40PM ET",Airbus sales chief says well placed for further output hikes,nan,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Airbus, which recently announced an output increase for its A320 jet family, has amassed enough excess orders through overboooking to justify further production increases at some point in the future, its sales chief said on Monday.Airbus last month announced plans to increase output of its best-selling jet family to 50 aircraft a month in 2017, up from 42 a month now.""It does appear that we have more than enough overbooking to comfortably cover rates above 50, perhaps above 60 (a month),"" John Leahy told the Istat air finance conference.Such a decision would be ""way out in the future"" and would depend on Airbus Group's (PA:AIR) board, he added.Aircraft manufacturers sell more jets than they plan to produce in order to anticipate airline bankruptcies or changes in fleet plans: a process of overbooking that mirrors the way airlines oversell seats to reduce their exposure to ""no-shows"".   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Its first 90 A380 aircraft are supplied with engines from Engine Alliance, a joint venture between  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).Airbus has said it would only look at putting different engines on the A380 if it made business sense.Emirates canceled an order for 70 Airbus A350 aircraft last year, saying the plane did not fit its original specifications. Clark said Emirates was now looking at both Airbus A350s and the 787 from rival Boeing (N:BA) for a twin-aisle order.""We'd be looking at 50 to 70.

1230,"Mar 02, 2015 11:11PM ET","United Airlines sees fit for Boeing 777-300ER planes, not yet 777X",nan,"(Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) has no immediate interest in purchasing 777X aircraft from Boeing Co (N:BA) but instead views the plane's predecessor, the 777-300ER, as a potentially good fit for its network, the carrier's Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey, told Reuters in an interview Monday.While Rainey has said in the past that the 777-300ER interests United, he said on Monday that the aircraft could be a quick fix in markets where United needs additional seats to satisfy demand so customers are not forced to book on United's competitors. United currently is considering whether to swap Boeing 787 Dreamliners it has on order for its first 777-300ER aircraft, which can fit more seats.The swap would be a victory for Boeing, which has long insisted it can sell the 100 777-300ERs it plans to produce per year before it shifts toward building the 777X, starting in 2017. Analysts have expressed concern that Boeing might have to cut prices or production as it makes this switch.Rainey said United is not interested in the more expensive 777X, to be outfitted with General Electric (N:GE) engines, ""at this moment, but there was a point in time when I would have given the same answer about the (777)-300ER, so things do change.""He clarified that a deal would exchange planes on order without adding new purchases to United's books. The airline has yet to make a decision on the swap, which would not be a ""massive"" conversion, Rainey said.Still, Rainey added that 777-300ERs could arrive sooner than the similarly sized Airbus (PA:AIR) A350-1000s that United has ordered for first delivery in 2018. It also could complement United's plans to take two, still-larger Boeing 747 aircraft out of its fleet this year.""One thing that you could see is that we could consolidate all of the 747 flying in one area, and that would have a cascading effect with the 777-300ER in other markets and the 787 somewhere else,"" Rainey said.""This isn't necessarily a statement about the 787,"" he said, adding that the routes on which Dreamliners fly, such as Denver-Tokyo, ""work very well.""Rainey said United does not currently have an interest in new 747-8 purchases.Instead, he said, United would like to see a replacement for the discontinued Boeing 757 aircraft, which ""has a particular sweet spot in our network,"" adding that the Airbus A321neo equivalent had ""issues"" but he did not elaborate.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This cash must also allow us to increase our production capacity.""Airbus is developing revamped versions of the A320 and A330 aircraft, two significant sources of cash. It is also considering a similar upgrade for its A380 superjumbo to revive weak sales.Airbus last week announced an increase in production of its A320 medium-haul family and a drop in output of the larger A330.Enders said the aerospace industry must learn from technology companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN.O) and Facebook. Some have been investing in unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites.""They demonstrate that we must make better use of one our assets: data. Aerospace companies churn a considerable amount of information in research, technology, production, purchasing, marketing and also by flying.""Mastering artificial intelligence could usher in a new era of pilotless planes, he said, apparently referring to transport.""It seems like science fiction, but it could come a lot more quickly than people think.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

European shares bucked a softer trend in Asian and U.S. markets as a sharp overnight pullback in crude oil prices dampened risk appetite there. Brent crude was up 1.24 percent by 0420 ET on Friday.The FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,561.60 points, with strong annual results from Airbus Group (PA:AIR), the world's second-largest aerospace company, spurring the rally.About two-thirds of the way into Europe's earnings season, 55 percent of companies have met or beaten profit forecasts. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow by 19.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be Europe's best season in 3-1/2 years. ""The rally in stocks is so strong that we could see a capitulation of the shorts at some point, which would push the market even higher. Clearly some indexes have reached frothy valuation levels, but we're still long in the short term,"" said Mirabaud Securities senior equity sales trader John Plassard in Geneva.The FTSEurofirst 300 index is up 14 percent so far this year as the prospect of the ECB's quantitative easing program drove core European bond yields into or close to negative territory pushing investors into higher-yielding assets such as equities.Euro zone inflation data for February due at 1300 is expected to underline the ECB's Jan. 22 decision to embark on a 60 billion euro monthly securities buying program to fend off deflation and revive the euro zone economy. European government bond yields held near record lows before the data expected to show consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in February.

We are still calling for a June rate hike and the market is not pricing that. (The markets) are looking for a hike much later. So yes, we think the dollar will outperform,"" said Hamish Pepper, strategist at Barclays (LONDON:BARC).The dollar eased 0.1 percent against the yen to 119.30 yen <USD/JPY>, but remained above Thursday's low of 118.68 yen.Investors are now waiting for revised fourth quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due later on Friday for another health check of the world's largest economy.Economists polled by Reuters expected U.S. growth in the fourth quarter to be revised down to 2.1 percent from a preliminary 2.6 percent.

December's figure was revised to a 1.6% increase from a previously estimated 1.5% gain.But investors remained cautious as both the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank warned that Greece’s reform plans are not detailed enough and said Athens will need to do more to secure the release of further bailout funds.Financial stocks were broadly higher, as French lenders BNP Paribas (PARIS:BNPP) and Societe Generale (PARIS:SOGN) advanced 0.81% and 0.57%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank (XETRA:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (XETRA:CBKG) rallied 0.60% and 1.29%.Among peripheral lenders, Italy's Unicredit (MILAN:CRDI) and Intesa Sanpaolo (MILAN:ISP) gained 0.38% and 1.53% respectively, while Spanish banks Banco Santander (MADRID:SAN) and BBVA (MADRID:BBVA) rose 0.21% and 0.29%.Elsewhere, Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) soared 6.35% after the European aerospace company reported a 15% increase in annual profit. The group also said it plans to boost monthly production of its A320 single-aisle aircraft to 50 a month by 2017.On the downside, BASF SE (XETRA:BASFN) saw shares tumble 1% after the German chemical maker reported fourth-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' estimates.In London, FTSE 100 dipped 0.01% weighed by losses in the financial sector.Shares in HSBC Holdings (LONDON:HSBA) eased 0.02% and Barclays (LONDON:BARC) dropped 0.38%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland (LONDON:RBS) plummeted 1.85%.Lloyds Banking (LONDON:LLOY) overperformed however, as shares jumped 1.24% after the U.K. lender said it will resume dividend payments and reported its first annual profit in five years.Mining stocks were also broadly lower as Glencore Xstrata (LONDON:GLEN) slipped 0.16% and Bhp Billiton (LONDON:BLT) fell 0.24%, while Fresnillo (LONDON:FRES) and Rio Tinto (LONDON:RIO) declined 0.67% and 0.69% respectively.Meanwhile, International Airlines Group (LONDON:ICAG) led gains on the index, with shares up 4.83% after the airline company said that 2014 annual pre-tax profit climbed to £601 million, helped by the introduction of more efficient aircraft and lower fuel prices in the fourth quarter.In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a steady to lower open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.06% dip, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.12% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.10% loss.Later in the day, Germany and Spain were to release preliminary data on consumer price inflation.

But calls for the United States to tamper with Open Skies agreements with the Gulf nations have angered other U.S. companies that benefit from the pacts. The agreements eliminate barriers that would block some FedEx operations and slow the expansion of carriers like Emirates that have showered Boeing with orders. A counteroffensive from Boeing, Fedex and others could make it easier for the White House to resist renegotiating the agreements.""I think the entry into the fray of Boeing and the others as countervailing pressures to the airlines will make it easier politically for the administration to do what I believe the Department of Transportation wants to do, namely, to continue to pursue its successful Open Skies strategy,"" said New York University law professor Michael E. Levine.  Boeing, which like European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) has filled its order book with commitments from Gulf carriers, opposes drastic changes to the Qatar and U.A.E. agreements.""Boeing supports a commercial-aviation industry based on open and fair competition, and Open Skies has long been a key factor in this, benefiting both U.S. and international airlines,"" Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx said in a statement. Other companies were more blunt in taking on the top U.S. airlines, long big Boeing customers.""The U.S. should not capitulate to the interests of a few carriers who stand ready to put their narrow, protectionist interests ahead of the economic benefits that Open Skies provides,"" David Bronczeck, chief executive of FedEx's Express air cargo unit said in a Feb. 18 letter to the heads of the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation and Commerce.JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, also wrote a letter to the same departments opposing tampering with Open Skies.Delta, United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc (O:AAL) say in the report - which has been reviewed by Reuters but not yet been made public - that they support Open Skies agreements but not their abuse through subsidies. Yet the top U.S. carriers have long been ambivalent toward liberalizing air travel.""The major U.S. carriers have opposed Open Skies and deregulation all along the way, even from the word go, and yet have been major beneficiaries due to domestic consolidation and also globally in terms of market access,"" said Peter Harbison, chairman of Sydney-based CAPA-Centre for Aviation, an independent aviation consultancy.'SHODDY' SERVICE BLAMEDEmirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways deny the U.S. airlines' accusations about unfair subsidies. So far, the Obama administration says it is reviewing the U.S. airlines' claims but has made no decisions.In an interview with Reuters Wednesday, Emirates [EMIRA.UL] President Tim Clark hinted at possible legal action over potential commercial harm done by the U.S. airlines' campaign. The clash between Delta and the Gulf airlines has taken a caustic turn, including remarks by Delta's chief executive that were perceived as linking the Gulf carriers with the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.Clark also called his U.S. rivals' service ""shoddy"" and said they would do better to focus on improving their own product.U.S. consumer groups such as the Business Travel Coalition agree that Delta and its U.S. cohorts have only themselves to blame for the market share loss, a contention disputed by Delta.Still, the U.S. airlines may have one trump card to play in the form of Americans for Fair Skies, an organization opposed to Gulf subsidies that is the project of former Air Line Pilots Association President and former Delta captain, Lee Moak.

1237,"Feb 25, 2015 11:19PM ET",Australian researchers unveil world's first 3D printed jet engine,nan,"By Jane WardellSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian researchers unveiled the world's first 3D-printed jet engine on Thursday, a manufacturing breakthrough that could lead to cheaper, lighter and more fuel-efficient jets.Engineers at Monash University and its commercial arm are making top-secret prototypes for Boeing Co, Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) NV, Raytheon Co and  Safran  (PARIS:SAF) SA in a development that could be the savior of Australia's struggling manufacturing sector. ""This will allow aerospace companies to compress their development cycles because we are making these prototype engines three or four times faster than normal,"" said Simon Marriott, chief executive of Amaero Engineering, the private company set up by Monash to commercialize the product.Marriott said Amaero plans to have printed engine components in flight tests within the next 12 months and certified for commercial use within the next two to three years. Australia has the potential to corner the market. It has one of only three of the necessary large-format 3D metal printers in the world - France and Germany have the other two - and is the only place that makes the materials for use in the machine.It is also the world leader in terms of intellectual property (IP) regarding 3D printing for manufacturing. ""We have personnel that have 10 years experience on this equipment and that gives us a huge advantage,"" Marriott told Reuters by phone from the Avalon Airshow outside Melbourne.3D printing makes products by layering material until a three-dimensional object is created. Automotive and aerospace companies use it for producing prototypes as well as creating specialized tools, moldings and some end-use parts.Marriott declined to comment in detail on Amaero's contracts with companies, including Boeing and Airbus, citing commercial confidentiality. Those contracts are expected to pay in part for the building of further large format printers, at a cost of around A$3.5 million ($2.75 million) each, to ramp up production of jet engine components.3D printing can cut production times for components from three months to just six days. Ian Smith, Monash University's vice-provost for research, said it was very different to the melting, molding and carving of the past. ""This way we can very quickly get a final product, so the advantages of this technology are, firstly, for rapid prototyping and making a large number of prototypes quickly,"" Smith said. ""Secondly, for being able to make bespoke parts that you wouldn't be able to with classic engineering technologies.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1238,"Feb 25, 2015 10:19AM ET",Emirates airline urges U.S. to ignore subsidy claims,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - The head of Dubai's Emirates has hit back at U.S. airlines in an increasingly bitter subsidy spat and urged Washington to block their calls to renegotiate Open Skies agreements.In an interview with Reuters, Tim Clark, president of the world's largest international carrier, also urged the U.S. government to think about the impact on its aerospace industry, which has been boosted in recent years by orders from the Gulf.He was responding to allegations of trade-distorting Gulf subsidies made by the three largest U.S. airlines, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), American Airlines and United Airlines (N:UAL).In a 55-page dossier presented to the U.S. government, they have called for the renegotiation or suspension of Open Skies liberalization deals with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.Open Skies deals broadly give airlines from each side the right to fly wherever and whenever they want. U.S. airlines say the system puts them at a disadvantage because their market is far bigger.Furthermore, they say Gulf states broke the trade deals by pouring $40 billion of alleged subsidies into their carriers, something Gulf nations and airlines have repeatedly denied.And they complain that three Gulf carriers -- Emirates and Etihad of the UAE and Qatar Airways - switched strategy after the deals were negotiated to become global hubs threatening the rest of the industry, rather than ordinary national carriers.Clark denied that Emirates, founded in 1985, had changed its spots and said its growth and strategy were discussed openly during the trade talks that led to the 1999 Open Skies deal.He said it was the United States that had pioneered such agreements and Emirates had invested heavily in aircraft, notably from U.S. manufacturer Boeing (N:BA), as a result.""So on what basis would they call for negotiations, because they laid the ground rules in the first place?"" Emirates has ordered a total of 289 Boeing wide-body jets, including 199 that have yet to be delivered. It is also the largest single customer of European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).""We have invested heavily in the U.S. aerospace industry and a lot of what we have done with regard to market access has allowed us to go and place these orders, for which we have contracts in place,"" Clark said.""I don't want to be seen as threatening or intimidatory but I am hoping that the U.S. government thinks about all of this.""Clark said the airline could provide a ""cast iron defense"" against subsidy claims and hinted at possible legal action over the criticisms, voiced especially by Delta.""Delta is maligning us, leading people down a path which is based on unsubstantiated false allegations and that is very serious. It could be commercially damaging to us and if it is we will consider ... all our options,"" Clark said.He called for publication and a right of response to the 55-page report.He also rejected claims that Gulf carriers had been able to take market share from U.S. airlines, saying it was they that had missed the boat on globalization.""When the world started to knit together and energize, and all these people started traveling, where were the American carriers then?,"" he said.""They go in and out of India and say the fares are too low. OK, that's your problem: maybe your costs are too high, Richard,"" he said, in a swipe at Delta CEO Richard Anderson.The U.S. airlines say the Gulf carriers use aggressive pricing to poach customers, but Emirates and its Gulf rivals maintain passengers are attracted by modern planes and better service.""Emirates does its own thing. It supplies a quality product which knocks spots off any American product,"" Clark said. ""Why should we match their prices when we don't need to?""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Squeezed by intense competition in Southeast Asia's crowded aviation business, the airline has lost money for the last five quarters.Ismail was speaking after the affiliate of Asia's largest budget carrier, AirAsia (KL:AIRA), reported its fourth-quarter net loss widened, hit by a weaker ringgit and charges from fuel contracts that sent shares sliding to an all-time low. Benyamin was named acting CEO for an indefinite period after former chief Azran Osman Rani resigned following a management reshuffle last month.The executive said the company is focused on returning to net profit in 2015, without disclosing a numerical target. Despite a drop in its passenger numbers following the end-December crash of a jet operated by its Indonesia affiliate, AirAsia X expects an operating profit in the first three months of this year after October-December generated its first quarterly earnings at that level since third-quarter 2013.Kamarudin Meranun, the CEO of AirAsia X Group, which includes other carriers, said in a separate interview that there were no plans for additional fund-raising after a $109 million rights issue that was announced in January in a move to bolster AirAsia X's balance sheet - now closely watched by analysts.Acting CEO Benyamin said the airline may look at deferring some plane orders and selling delivery slots. ""If there are reasonable and keen buyers for those aircraft, we may sell the slots,"" he said.AirAsia X will also assess capacity requirement based on plane orders and deliveries coming up in the next few years, he said. This would include looking again at orders for Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 and A330neos, Benyamin said.

There can be a lag between supplier schedules and aircraft production.No final decision has been taken, and it remains unclear, following an internal debate at the planemaker over the timing of output increases, whether Airbus Group (PA:AIR) will announce new levels alongside its 2014 results on Friday.A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment.Airbus jet division Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier last month declared the supply chain ""stable"" in a sign of potential output hikes, but acknowledged differences between sales and production teams about when to take the next step.He promised a decision by June.Another industry source said it was not a matter of 'if' but 'when' Airbus would increase output despite growing analyst warnings that the commercial aerospace cycle has peaked.Airbus shares were down 1.6 percent at 52 euros by 5.37 a.m. ET.Raising output involves an orchestrated effort by hundreds of suppliers just as the planemaker embarks on the delicate task of switching to a revamped A320, starting late 2015.Airbus and Boeing have been battling for market share between their best-selling models since announcing fuel-saving upgrades earlier this decade. They are now locking in production plans to translate orders into revenue.Boeing last year announced plans to raise production of its 737 model to 52 a month in 2018 from 42 now. It plans to reach 47 a month in 2017. Industry sources say it has started consulting suppliers on whether they could eventually handle 58 a month.The medium-haul jets are a significant source of cash for both companies.Airbus is also reviewing production of the larger A330, which faces competition from Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.It makes 10 A330s a month and plans to trim this to nine. Analysts believe it could have to cut to as few as six.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1242,"Feb 18, 2015 10:59AM ET","Boeing CEO vows to maintain cash to shareholders, 777 production rate",nan,"By Alwyn Scott(Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) will keep returning significant cash to shareholders and will not cut production of wide-body 777 jetliners as it shifts to a new version later this decade, Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on Wednesday.The transition from the 777 to the new 777X will happen ""without a hit to production rates,"" McNerney told an investor conference hosted by Barclays (LONDON:BARC) Plc in Miami, addressing a key concern about the company's future performance.His remarks suggested that Boeing believes it can generate cash by delivering already-sold aircraft while winning new sales.McNerney said Boeing can keep returning about 80 percent of free cash flow to investors while maintaining competitive research and development spending relative to rival Airbus (PA:AIR). Boeing has long insisted it can sell the remaining 777-300ER planes it plans to produce at the current output of 100 a year.But analysts worry that Boeing may be forced to cut prices or production as it makes the switch to the new plane. Airbus has said it will cut A330 jet output to nine a month from 10, as it introduces the revamped A330neo. Analysts believe Airbus could have to cut A330 production to six a month.McNerney said Boeing has a strategy to maintain pricing of the 777 while still selling out the remaining planned production slots.He brushed aside fears that low oil prices and the strong dollar will dent aircraft orders or profits, noting that most airlines do not want to delay getting new aircraft and they see the enduring value of the planes over their long life spans.He predicted slow to moderate growth in the defense and space businesses, with profit margins in the low double digits.The company remains focused on cutting costs with its suppliers and increasing organic growth and productivity rather than making major acquisitions. Boeing is about 40 percent through cost-cutting discussions with suppliers dubbed ""Partnering for Success,"" McNerney said, but once those are finished, ""we'll do it again.""Addressing concerns about rising deferred production costs for the 787, McNerney said it reflects investments to improve long-term productivity and that labor costs are ""coming down more slowly than we anticipated.""He said a replacement for the 757 is not needed in the short or medium term since Boeing's other aircraft cover most 757 flight routes. He said it is not clear what customers want to replace the jet, discontinued in 2005, other than a slightly larger version.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Le Monde said the final page outlining the modalities would be signed on Monday by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and French officials, possibly President Francois Hollande or Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.A French government official said the talks had not ended. ""The Egyptian president has not made his decision on the French offer,"" he said. ""The discussions are not finished, the dialogue continues.""Egyptian government officials and Dassault executives could not immediately be reached for comment. The deal includes 24 Rafale jets, a Fremm naval frigate and MBDA air-to-air missiles.The contract with Egypt would be the first overseas for the Rafale 14 years after it entered service and three years after manufacturer Dassault Aviation entered exclusive negotiations to sell 126 of the combat jets to India.Delays in finalising the Indian contract are expected to be discussed at a major Indian air show starting on Feb. 18.Dassault, which is also in negotiations to sell the Rafale to Qatar, is under increasing pressure to sell the jet overseas.The French government said last year it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets, taking just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 a year. .Paris and Cairo have enjoyed close economic ties in the past but turmoil in the north African state since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011 left Western governments wary of signing contracts, especially in defence.With the recent rise to power of Sisi, ties have improved. Both sides are concerned by the rise of jihadist groups in Libya and Egypt.France secured its first major military contract in Egypt in about 20 years in 2014 with a 1 billion-euro ($1.35 billion) deal to sell four naval frigates.The Fremm is built by state-controlled DCNS, which is 35 percent owned by French group Thales. MBDA is a venture of Airbus Group, Britain's BAE Systems and Finmeccanica of Italy. ($1 = 0.8812 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1246,"Feb 11, 2015 06:24PM ET",U.S. becomes hot spot for aerospace manufacturing,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) - The aerospace industry is shifting more manufacturing investment to the United States after a decade in which production jobs in the sector flowed to China and other emerging economies, according to a new study.Consultancy ICF International analyzed more than 2,000 investment transactions made since 2000, and found 28 manufacturing investments in the United States from 2012 to 2013, compared with eight each in China and Mexico, and four in Brazil. A decade earlier, Mexico led the pack with 10 investments, compared with just six investments in the United States. ICF said its data show a strong flow into China, India, Brazil, Mexico and other emerging markets until 2012. In the last three years, investment has shifted toward the United States.""The U.S. at this point in time has become the hot spot in aerospace manufacturing,"" Kevin Michaels, a vice president at ICF, said at the annual Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference this week. ""Comparative advantage is a fleeting thing. Three years ago it looked like everything was heading to China. Now that's changed.""Commercial aircraft manufacturers are under intense pressure to reduce costs within the supply chain to offset falling inflation-adjusted prices for plane tickets. U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co (N:BA) is moving more production in-house to U.S. plants, reducing the outsourcing used for the 787 Dreamliner. Rival Airbus (PA:AIR) is building an assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.For example, Boeing found a 787 air duct made near Seattle was being shipped to Italy, reboxed and shipped to the 787 factory in Charleston, South Carolina, to be installed.""We unwound that,"" Kent Fisher, vice president of supplier management at Boeing, said at the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference Wednesday. ""Now we have a direct relationship and the part ships directly to Charleston.""Labor cost savings that prompted work to move offshore have narrowed as wages have risen overseas and companies in developed countries installed robots to automate production and reduce touch labor.Different regions of the United States are stepping up efforts to win aerospace investments. This year, for the first time, a northwest Florida economic development group is the primary sponsor of the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference. Florida wants to recruit companies to build the aerospace industry in Florida, said Jennifer Conoley, economic development representative for Gulf Power Co . ""It was a way to get in front of the audience,"" Conoley said of the $15,000 sponsorship from Florida's Great Northwest, an association of groups representing the Florida panhandle.The Florida panhandle region is surrounded by five major aircraft facilities, including Boeing, Airbus, Gulfstream and two Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) plants, has 60,000 aerospace and defense workers, numerous military bases and more than 500 aerospace and defense companies.So far, most companies looking to set up there are European suppliers that need to be close to the Airbus factory in Mobile, though some Pacific Northwest companies are looking, she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The aircraft then lurched over buildings and banked sharply to the left before crashing upside down in the shallow river.Officials in Taiwan and industry analysts say evidence presented so far raises questions over whether the crew may have accidentally cut the wrong engine. ""There must have been something wrong with what the crew did,"" said a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) official, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""It's a very big deal to turn off one engine after take- off. It needs to be double checked by the crew.""It was the second TransAsia ATR crash in seven months, and the fifth involving the airline since 1995, raising questions about safety standards at Taiwan's third largest carrier.The CAA said the flight tests would only involve TransAsia's 71 ATR pilots, and not those who fly its Airbus aircraft. Pilots from China Airlines and EVA Air, Taiwan's two largest airlines, were not being tested. The CAA official said the test results would be released on Wednesday.The move has been questioned by Taiwan's pilots' union, which said crashes happen due to a combination of factors.""The CAA and the ASC can't just jump to a conclusion like that,"" said Lee Ping-chung, secretary general of the union. ""It could be mechanical, the weather, airline's management of pilots and how tired pilots are."" TransAsia said on Sunday it would cancel 52 flights Monday and Tuesday, in addition to the 90 already canceled following the crash. Rescuers have recovered 40 bodies, with three still missing. Fifteen people survived.A fuller preliminary report on the crash will be available in the next 30 days, with a final one expected in the next three to six months.(This version of the story corrects spelling of TransAsia in the intro and removes extraneous word in penultimate para)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Others, including a young child, were taken to shore in inflatable boats. Emergency rescue officials crowded around the partially submerged fuselage of flight GE235, lying on its side in the river, trying to help those on board.The plane missed apartment buildings by meters, though it was not clear if that was luck or whether the pilot was aiming for the river. Footage showed a van skidding to a halt on the damaged overpass after barely missing the plane's wing, with small pieces of the aircraft scattered along the road.The chief executive of TransAsia, Peter Chen, bowed deeply at a televised news conference as he apologized to passengers and crew. TransAsia's shares closed down 6.9 percent in heavy trade, its biggest percentage decline since late 2011.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said his government had offered Taiwan any help necessary following the crash.""MAYDAY MAYDAY""The last communication from one of the aircraft's pilots was ""Mayday Mayday engine flameout,"" according to an air traffic control recording on liveatc.net.A flameout occurs when the fuel supply to the engine is interrupted or when there is faulty combustion, resulting in an engine failure. Twin-engined aircraft, however, are usually able to keep flying even when one engine has failed.The plane was powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW127M engines. Pratt & Whitney is part of United Technologies (N:UTX). The head of Taiwan's civil aviation authority, Lin Tyh-ming, said the aircraft last underwent maintenance on Jan. 26. The pilot had 4,916 flying hours under his belt and the co-pilot had 6,922 hours, he said. Taipei's downtown Songshan airport, the smaller of the city's two airports, provides mostly domestic flights but also connections to Japan, China and South Korea.A statement from China's Taiwan Affairs Office said 31 of those on board were tourists from the southeastern city of Xiamen, which lies close to Taiwan's Kinmen island.The crash is the latest in a string of mishaps to hit Asian carriers in the past 12 months. An AirAsia (KL:AIRA) jet bound for Singapore crashed soon after taking off from the Indonesian city of Surabaya on Dec. 28, killing all 162 people on board.The disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines (KL:MASM) jet last March, and the downing of a sister plane over Ukraine four months later with a combined loss of 537 lives, have dominated a United Nations safety conference this week.TransAsia is Taiwan's third-largest carrier. One of its ATR 72-500 planes crashed while trying to land at Penghu Island last July, killing 48 of the 58 passengers and crew on board.Taiwan has had a poor aviation safety record in recent years, including the disintegration of a China Airlines (TW:2610) 747 on a flight from Taipei to Hong Kong in 2002, killing 225.The almost brand-new plane involved in Wednesday's mishap was among the first of the ATR 72-600s, the latest variant of the turboprop aircraft, that TransAsia received in 2014 as part of an order of eight aircraft two years earlier. The 72-seat aircraft are mainly used to connect the capital, Taipei, with smaller cities and islands. ATR is a joint venture between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italy's Finmeccanica (MI:SIFI).France, where the aircraft was designed and built, said it was sending investigators to help with Taiwan's accident probe.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1252,"Jan 31, 2015 06:54AM ET",AirAsia captain left seat before jet lost control: sources,nan,"By Siva Govindasamy, Kanupriya Kapoor and Tim HepherSINGAPORE/JAKARTA/PARIS (Reuters) - The captain of the AirAsia jet that crashed into the sea in December was out of his seat conducting an unusual procedure when his co-pilot apparently lost control, and by the time he returned it was too late to save the plane, two people familiar with the investigation said.Details emerging of the final moments of Flight QZ8501 are likely to focus attention partly on maintenance, procedures and training, though Indonesian officials have not ruled out any cause and stress it is too early to draw firm conclusions.The Airbus A320 jet plunged into the Java Sea while en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on Dec. 28, killing all 162 people on board.People familiar with the matter said earlier this week that investigators were examining maintenance records of one of the automated systems, the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC), and the way the pilots reacted to any outage.One person familiar with the matter said the captain had flown on the same plane with the intermittently faulty device days earlier. There was no independent confirmation of this.After trying to reset this device, pilots pulled a circuit-breaker to cut its power, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.People familiar with the matter said it was the Indonesian captain Iriyanto who took this step, rather than his less experienced French co-pilot Remy Plesel, who was flying the plane.AirAsia (KL:AIRA) said it would not comment while the matter was under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) of Indonesia. The NTSC has said it is too early to say what role either human factors or equipment may have played in the crash, which is still being investigated.Experts say the loss of the FAC would not directly alter the trajectory of the aircraft but would remove flight envelope protection, which prevents a pilot from taking a plane beyond its safety limits, and require the crew to fly it manually.The decision to cut off the FAC has surprised people following the investigation because the usual procedure for resetting it is to press a button on the overhead panel.""You can reset the FAC, but to cut all power to it is very unusual,"" said one A320 pilot, who declined to be identified. ""You don't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency. I don't know if there was one in this case, but it is very unusual.""It is also significant because to pull the circuit breaker the captain had to rise from his seat.""STARTLED""The circuit breakers are on a wall panel immediately behind the co-pilot and hard or impossible to reach from the seated position on the left side, where the captain sits, according to two experienced pilots and published diagrams of the cockpit.Shortly afterwards the plane went into a sharp climb from which investigators have said it stalled or lost lift. ""It appears he (the co-pilot) was surprised or startled by this,"" said a person familiar with the investigation, referring to the decision to cut power to the affected computer.The captain eventually resumed the controls, but a person familiar with the matter said he was not in a position to intervene immediately to recover the aircraft from its upset.""The co-pilot pulled the plane up, and by the time the captain regained the controls it was too late,"" one of the people familiar with the investigation said.Tatang Kurniadi, chief of Indonesia's NTSC, told Reuters there had been no delay in the captain resuming the controls but declined further comment. The head of the investigation, Mardjono Siswosuwarno, told reporters this week it was too early to say whether the accident involved pilot error or a mechanical fault. Indonesia has issued some of the factual circumstances, but not released its preliminary accident report.The NTSC said on Thursday the jet was in sound condition and all crew members were properly certified.Airbus declined to comment.Lawyers for the family of the French co-pilot say they have filed a lawsuit against AirAsia in Paris for ""endangering the lives of others"" by flying the route without official authorization on that day. Investigators have said the accident was not related to the permit issue.AirAsia did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. Air accidents typically give rise to conflicting liability claims, and the 2009 crash of an Air France jet is still working its way through the French judicial system.Although more is becoming known about the chain of events, people familiar with the investigation warned against making assumptions on the accident's cause, which needed more analysis.Safety experts say air crashes are most often caused by a chain of events, each of which is necessary but not sufficient to explain the underlying causes of the accident.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1253,"Jan 30, 2015 06:33PM ET",Aviation leaders seek new safety mandate after deadly 2014,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Allison MartellMONTREAL (Reuters) - Aviation leaders will try to secure a mandate to implement new safety standards when they meet next week after a string of high-profile accidents around the world made 2014 the deadliest year for commercial airlines in almost a decade.Efforts to adopt new standards for global plane tracking and co-operation on the risks of flying over conflict zones will dominate the meeting on safety in Montreal from Feb. 2-5, weeks ahead of the anniversary of the disappearance of flight MH370, the Malaysian Airlines jet with 239 people on board.Regulators and officials at the meeting will have to juggle political sensitivities and arguments over the budgets of cash-squeezed airlines.""Issues such as flight restrictions over conflict zones can only be tackled at a global or regional level,"" Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency, said.""The global aviation regulatory system should also act more quickly to address the recommendations for safety improvement made by accident investigators,"" he told Reuters ahead of the talks at the International Civil Aviation Organization. While statistics suggest flying is safer than ever in proportion to the amount of traffic, 924 people were killed in passenger accidents last year, the worst for loss of life since 2005, shaking perceptions of air travel worldwide. Last year's disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet, and the downing of a sister plane on flight MH17 over Ukraine with a combined loss of 539 lives, pose one of the biggest challenges to the 70-year-old U.N. organization since security threats in the 1970s and 1980s.""Like hijackings in the 1970s, the Korean Airlines 007 fighter jet shootdown, and the Pan Am 103 bombing, the downing of MH17 represents an abhorrent, watershed moment in civil aviation history,"" said Pillsbury Law partner Kenneth Quinn, a former U.S. official who took part in a task force on the issue.Airlines have called for controls on weapons such as the high-altitude ground-to-air missile suspected of shooting down MH17 over eastern Ukraine last July, and greater sharing of intelligence information on threats.MH17 was hit during fighting between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The United States said the plane was hit with a ground-to-air missile by rebels. Russia says a Ukrainian military aircraft downed it.NO FAIL-SAFE METHODS ICAO, one of the international institutions which sprang out of World War II, is credited with making it safer to fly by ensuring coordination in standards across the globe. But getting collaboration when it comes to disputed territory can be tough. Some major intelligence agencies were invited to take part in preparatory ICAO talks on conflict zones but didn't show up, two people familiar with the discussions said.Faced with the reluctance of most countries to share highly sensitive information, ICAO has proposed overhauling a system of notices to pilots to ensure that what data already exists is more widely available and able to be cross-checked.""No system for identifying, verifying, and sharing threat information is fail-safe, but a centralized database at ICAO at least ensures that identified threat information gets shared on a more widespread and timely basis,"" Quinn said.That is likely to disappoint airlines that have said it is the responsibility of states to tell them what they know.On tracking, however, airlines have displayed divisions over the costs of installing new systems, while several competing business groups will be lobbying on the sidelines of ICAO.Senior officials involved in the discussions said the recent AirAsia crash was not part of the UN debate because the jet was within controlled airspace and its flight recorders were found relatively quickly after delays mainly due to bad weather.Next week's conference is likely to call for planes to send tracking signals at regular intervals in normal flight and to speed them up when they get into trouble. It is also looking at ejectable black boxes as one way to aid searches and solve mysteries like that of the missing MH370.But in December, the International Air Transport Association, which represents over 200 carriers, refused to back a call by an industry-wide committee that had met under its own leadership to install existing systems on its planes within 12 months.A strong ICAO mandate to impose flight tracking would also need national measures to take effect. The European Union is expected to move quickly to make them law, an EU official said.But some delegates have expressed concerns that the global response to last year's shock events could be weakened if there is only patchy compliance with the new recommendations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1257,"Jan 29, 2015 05:15AM ET",French co-pilot flying AirAsia jet before crash: investigators,nan,"By Kanupriya Kapoor and Fergus JensenJAKARTA (Reuters) - The French first officer of an AirAsia (KL:AIRA) passenger jet that crashed into the sea last month was at the controls just before the accident, Indonesia's lead investigator said on Thursday.The Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 vanished from radar screens in bad weather on Dec. 28, less than half way into a two-hour flight from Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya to Singapore. All 162 people on board were killed.""The second-in-command, popularly known as the co-pilot, who usually sits to the right of the cockpit, at the time, he was flying the plane,"" said National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) investigator Mardjono Siswosuwarno, referring to first officer Remi Plesel.""The captain, sitting to the left, was the pilot monitoring.""Data from the black box flight data recorder has provided the accident probe with a ""pretty clear picture"" of what happened in the last moments of AirAsia flight QZ8501, Siswosuwarno said, although few details have been made public.Indonesia has previously said the aircraft climbed abruptly from its cruising height and then stalled, or lost lift, before plunging out of control into the sea.Using a hand-held model of an A320 officials demonstrated to reporters how the aircraft veered left and climbed steeply to more then 37,000 ft (11,300 metres), before rapidly losing altitude in the moments before the crash.Captain Iriyanto, 53, an Indonesia air force veteran with about 20,000 flying hours logged, was believed to have taken over control of the aircraft from the less experienced Plesel when it started to ascend and then descend, officials said.The stall warning - an automated voice that repeats the words ""stall, stall"" - had sounded in the cockpit. The aircraft was still in a stall when the black box recordings ended seconds before impact, Siswosuwarno said.SOUND CONDITIONIndonesia's meteorological bureau said soon after the crash that seasonal tropical storms were likely a factor, prompting speculation that there might be parallels with the loss of Air France flight AF447 over the Atlantic in 2009.Icing on the airframe of AF447 caused the pilots to lose air speed readings, and the crew's reaction put the plane into a stall from which it never recovered.Investigators were still studying if there was any icing on the AirAsia plane's air speed indicators, and any other similarities to AF447, Mardjono said.Last week, the head of the NTSC said there were ""no similarities"" with AF447, and sources familiar with the investigation have told Reuters icing on the air speed indicators does not seem to have been an issue with QZ8501. Investigators said the cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed that the plane had been cruising at a stable altitude before the accident. The aircraft was in sound condition when it took off, and all crew members were properly certified, they said.""The plane was flying before the incident within the limits of its weight and balance envelope,"" Mardjono said. ""While the flight crew had valid licences and medical certificates.""NTSC chief Tatang Kurniadi told the same Jakarta news conference that Indonesia submitted its preliminary report on the crash to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Wednesday, as required under global aviation rules.The report, which has not been made public, was purely factual and contained no analysis, he said, adding that the full, final report would take at least six to seven months to complete.On Wednesday, Indonesia said the search for dozens of victims still unaccounted for could end within days if no more bodies were found.A multinational search and recovery operation has found 70 bodies in the Java Sea and had hoped to find more after finding the fuselage of the plane. But days of rough weather and poor underwater visibility hampered navy divers' efforts.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1258,"Jan 28, 2015 06:03PM ET",Air Force picks Boeing 747-8 to replace Air Force One ,nan,"By Andrea Shalal and Alwyn ScottWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Wednesday it would use Boeing Co's (N:BA) commercial 747-8 airliner to replace its current fleet of two Air Force One presidential aircraft, one of the most visible symbols of the United States. The decision comes a month after Boeing said it would slow production of the four-engine 747-8 aircraft to 1.3 a month from 1.5 a month because of declining orders.""The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission,"" said Air Force Secretary Deborah James in a statement.Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of building presidential aircraft.The Air Force said it intended to award a sole source contract to Boeing, but they must still negotiate a contract and the modifications needed to adapt the jet for presidential use.The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs. Details about the new contract, including cost, were not released.It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the plane's planned 30-year life.James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable.The Air Force decision was widely expected since the only other suitable four-engine jet is the A380 built by Airbus (PA:AIR) in Toulouse, France.The 747-8 is the only four-engine commercial jet Boeing makes, providing an extra margin of flight safety over the more standard twin-engine planes.But the Air Force order for a few 747s might not extend the life of the 747 program, which has failed to capture much business in recent years.Boeing was clearly trying to preserve production so it could fill the Air Force order, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.Now that the firm order is there, he said, it might be an opportunity for the program to end. The double-decker plane entered service in 1970, undergoing a major overhaul in 2012, with new engines and a longer fuselage.But last year, Boeing did not get orders for 747s, despite booking a record 1,432 net orders for commercial aircraft. At the end of 2014, Boeing had 36 unfilled orders for the plane, which lists at about $370 million.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He reports to Domingo Urena-Raso, the head of Airbus's recently reorganized military aircraft activities, part of the Airbus Defence & Space division which is also in the midst of restructuring.The latest delays come against the backdrop of tensions between Airbus and Germany over sweeping defense cuts.A total of 170 A400Ms have been ordered by seven partner nations, which also include Belgium, Britain, France, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey."

At 6:17 a.m. on Dec. 28, three minutes after air traffic control unsuccessfully tried to make contact and asked nearby aircraft to try to locate QZ8501, the A320 turned to the left and it began to climb from its altitude of 32,000 ft (9,750 meters), Jonan told a parliamentary hearing.The rate of the climb increased rapidly within seconds to 6,000 ft a minute, before accelerating further to 8,400 ft a minute and finally 11,100 ft. The aircraft reached 37,600 ft just 54 seconds after it began to climb before it appeared to stall.The aircraft began to fall at 6:18 a.m., dropping 1,500 ft in the first 6 seconds before reaching a rate of descent of 7,900 ft per minute until it reached 24,000 ft, at which point it disappeared from the radar.Pilots and industry observers told Reuters that if an aircraft makes a rapid climb and start to lose speed, it would be likely to stall and suffer from a loss of control.Indications the aircraft stalled aerodynamically imply the cockpit would have been filled with warnings alerting pilots to the danger, calling for them to tip the nose of the plane downwards in order to restore lift.Airbus pilots say such warnings include an automated voice saying ""Stall Stall"" as well as an audible electronic signal and red warning light. In the 2009 crash of an Air France jet in the Atlantic, pilots appeared to ignore the warnings, prompting industry-wide efforts to reform pilot training.Based on Jonan's data, there did not appear to have been a controlled descent in the case of QZ8501 and the aircraft appeared to have fallen rapidly before crashing into the sea, according to pilots and industry observers.Bad weather in the area has been cited a possible factor in the crash, with the other aircraft close by at that time flying at altitudes of between 34,000 and 39,000 ft.The investigators were looking into why this was the case, as well as QZ8501 pilots' reaction to the storms and clouds in the area, according to a source close to the investigation. Industry experts say that the margin for error at higher altitudes is smaller than at take-off or lower down.While the A320's systems usually prevent pilots from doing anything outside usual safe flight parameter, these protections can be disabled in some circumstances, handing control to the pilots and leaving it to manual flying skills.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1265,"Jan 21, 2015 12:31PM ET","Boeing executive sees strong demand for 737 MAX, confident on 777",nan,"By Tim HepherDUBLIN (Reuters) - Demand for fuel-efficient narrowbody jetliners like the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX remains ""very strong"" despite the recent oil price slump, the planemaker's top salesman said on Wednesday.Although lower oil prices might make some airlines hesitate about upgrading their fleets, the overall boost to the economy from cheaper energy is sustaining new jet demand, he said.In an interview with Reuters, John Wojick, Boeing's vice president for global sales & marketing, echoed a consensus among participants at a Dublin finance gathering that the slide in oil prices would not significantly undermine new jet demand.""We don't think the decrease in oil prices drives a significant change in demand for new fuel efficient equipment,"" Wojick said.Pricing for aircraft like the narrowbody 737 MAX, a revamped version of Boeing's best-selling model with fuel-saving engines, remains ""solid"", he added.Delegates at this week's Airline Economics conference said the drop in oil could reduce the premium Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) can get for the 737 MAX or competing A320neo, compared with current versions, as the benefits become harder to sell.Wojick agreed prices for current models might go up as airlines hold them longer than planned, but added, ""the demand for incremental airplanes actually goes up because more people want to travel and it becomes more affordable"".Even with oil prices at $40 a barrel, it makes sense to upgrade to new technology, Wojick said. He said oil had been at $40 when Boeing launched its 787 Dreamliner, though industry sources say the business case assumed roughly twice that level.Boeing's top sales executive also said he was not worried by a lead taken by Europe's Airbus in sales of the revamped narrowbody jets, seen as a cash cow for both groups.Many analysts say Airbus is winning the battle for narrowbody sales while Boeing is ahead on long-haul aircraft.Wojick reiterated he was confident Boeing would fill an order gap for the current version of its large twin-engined 777 pending the arrival of a new model in 2020. Boeing has filled about half of the gap with 278 Boeing 777-300ERs left to build.""We are working on continuing to fill that backlog. We have done a good job for 2015 and 2016 and continue to work on 2017."" The challenge of completing the order 'bridge' eased on Tuesday when United Airlines (N:UAL) confirmed reports it was considering whether to exchange some existing orders for the 777-300ER.Wojick said Boeing had no plans to add seats to the future 777X after Airbus suggested it would add 20 seats to its future A350-1000 to lower costs per seat. It will keep its 777-8X at 350 seats and 777-9X at 406, he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Now route permits must be obtained 4 months before the flight and airlines will not be allowed to sell tickets before that.""The transport ministry has suspended AirAsia's Surabaya-Singapore licence for flying on a Sunday, for which it did not have permission. However, the ministry has said this had no bearing on the crash. Jonan added applications for route permits and air transport licences would be moved online next month. The ministry had also recommended that wages for operations personnel like maintenance and safety inspection officials be raised, he said.President Joko Widodo has called for an urgent overhaul of the Indonesian aviation sector, which is among the fastest-growing in the region but has seen airlines with patchy safety records mushroom to cater to demand from a growing middle class.Analysts say infrastructure has failed to keep up with the boom in air travel in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, leading to overcrowded airports.Investigators have yet to determine why the Airbus A320-200 crashed into the Java Sea about 40 minutes into its flight, but bad weather is believed to have played a factor.""The plane, during the last minutes, went up faster than normal speed ... after then, it stalled. That is according to the data from the radar,"" Jonan said.A source familiar with the investigation's initial findings told Reuters last month that radar data appeared to show Flight QZ8501 made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus' limits.Investigators are analysing data from the aircraft's two ""black box"" flight recorders to determine exactly why it crashed. They said on Monday they had found no evidence so far that terrorism played a part in the disaster.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1268,"Jan 16, 2015 06:00PM ET",Exclusive: GE finances first A350 powered by rival Rolls-Royce,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - When the Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 jet made its commercial debut with Qatar Airways this week, the event marked a milestone for engine supplier Rolls-Royce (L:RR), but slipping unnoticed under the radar with financing was its arch-rival General Electric (N:GE).Although powered by the latest generation of Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines, the first of a new series of jets on which the company has bet its civil business is owned by GE's aircraft leasing arm GECAS, Reuters has learned.The rare decision to invest in rival technology highlights the complexities of keeping ahead in a highly concentrated aviation industry, with GECAS seen as keen to diversify its portfolio even though its parent GE is perceived in the industry as more and more aligned with Airbus rival Boeing (N:BA).The deal also completes a series of twists in the history of Airbus's newest jet: a journey that insiders say has helped to reshape transatlantic aerospace competition.In this case, the world's largest lessor agreed to buy the aircraft from the airline immediately on delivery and rent it back, a routine type of financing called sale-and-leaseback. It is not the first aircraft equipped with rival engines to end up on GECAS's books but such deals are usually kept low key and seldom if ever happen on a high-profile debut of a new jet.The first A350 was delivered to Qatar Airways in a lavish ceremony last month in which Rolls-Royce had a starring role, but GE's involvement in the financing was not mentioned.The head of the airline confirmed the deal to Reuters.""We have had much interest in taking Qatar Airways' airplanes and leasing them back to us. The deal with GECAS was the best for the airline and so we concluded with them,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said after the first revenue flight.Rolls and GE compete fiercely for engine sales and the A350's Trent XWB represents half the UK firm's civil order book.Industry sources say there could be several reasons for GE getting involved in the A350. Qatar has a large fleet of GE-powered Boeing 777s and the relationship is crucial, both in engines and financing.Yet the move highlights a delicate balancing act as GECAS seeks to diversify assets to reduce risk, even as its parent GE forges ever closer ties with Boeing.Such juggling is becoming more difficult as the aerospace industry becomes increasingly polarized, but analysts say the pressure to keep leasing portfolios balanced will keep growing.""If you want a successful wide-body leasing strategy you have no option but to take aircraft with GE and Rolls-Royce engines,"" said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend.JUST FRENEMIESAirlines prefer to have a choice of engine supplier and engine makers have historically supported competing aircraft manufacturers in a convoluted world of industrial ""frenemies"".But designing big twinjets is increasingly a game played between Boeing and GE on one hand and Airbus and Rolls-Royce on the other as engine firms cut exclusive deals to pay huge costs.At the heart of this realignment is the story of the A350. In 2004, faced with what was to become the Boeing 787, Airbus's first response was to offer new GE engines on its A330.But customers including Al Baker rejected a ""quick fix"" and urged Airbus to invest in a newer family that would also offer an alternative to the larger Boeing 777. GE and Airbus disagreed, however, over whether both markets could be served by one family of planes and engines. Airbus's subsequent decision to build an all-new family led to a parting of ways between Airbus and GE on the A350 project and opened the door to Rolls-Royce as sole engine supplier.""That somewhat polluted the relationship between Airbus and GE,"" said a person who closely monitored the negotiations.A U-turn by Airbus last year only served to deepen the new alignment: Airbus now planned to upgrade the A330 anyway, but this time with Rolls instead of the original partner, GE.This year could see Airbus upgrading its A380 superjumbo with engines from Rolls-Royce, bringing further polarization.""It's a bad thing: it goes against globalization that helps drive the business,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.GE denied any cooling of ties with Airbus, saying it remains a major engine supplier for best-selling A320s through Franco-U.S. venture CFM (PA:SAF).""CFM is far and away Airbus's largest engine supplier across its current and future aircraft models. It's a huge relationship,"" a spokesman said.Rolls-Royce and GECAS declined to comment.(This version of the story has been refiled to remove formatting error, adds GECAS declined to comment)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""A marker was placed on the engine. Beside the engine is the fuselage, the wing and a lot of debris,"" Ony Soeryo Wibowo, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Committee, told Reuters.Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on Dec. 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the city of Surabaya to Singapore. All 162 people on board were killed.So far 50 bodies have been plucked from the Java Sea, with most brought to Surabaya for identification. Searchers believe more bodies will be found in the plane's fuselage.Divers will check the wreckage for bodies on Thursday, said Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency. Indonesian investigators started examining on Wednesday the black box flight recorders recovered from the Airbus A320-200, and hope to unlock initial clues to the cause of the disaster within days.Divers retrieved the flight data and cockpit voice recorders this week from the plane's sunken wreckage.The recorders were lifted from the bottom of the Java Sea and sent to the capital, Jakarta, for analysis. Both were found to be in relatively good condition.""In one week, I think we will be getting a reading,"" Mardjono Siswosuwarno, head investigator for the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), told Reuters. The so-called black boxes - which are actually orange - contain a wealth of data that will be crucial for investigators piecing together the sequence of events that led to the plane plunging into the sea. The flight data recorder took only 15 minutes to download, but investigators will now need to analyze up to 25 hours of data and several thousand flight parameters covering things such as flying speed, altitude, fuel consumption, air pressure changes and inputs to the aircrafts controls.""We are feeling relieved but there is still a lot of work ahead of us to analyze it,"" said Siswosuwarno.Investigators were also expected on Wednesday to begin downloading data from the cockpit voice recorder, which retains the last two hours of conversations on the flight deck and between the pilots and air traffic controllers.As is standard procedure, the NTSC will file a preliminary report, which will be made public, to the International Civil Aviation Organization within 30 days. A final report on the crash is not expected to be published for at least a year, Siswosuwarno said.After the recovery of the two black boxes, Indonesia is expected to scale back search and rescue operations in the Java Sea.But government officials sought to reassure victims' families that efforts to retrieve the remains of their loved ones would continue.""We understand if the search becomes smaller ... but the bodies have to be found,"" said Frangky Chandry, whose younger brother was on the plane. ""We want to bury our family. That's what we want.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1271,"Jan 13, 2015 06:39AM ET",Airbus says beats Boeing in 2014 order race,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus clung to the top spot in commercial plane orders by confirming it outsold Boeing last year, while failing to close a gap in deliveries that leaves its U.S. rival as the world's largest plane manufacturer for the third year running.The unexpected lead in aircraft orders, confirming a Reuters report last week, comes after an unprecedented surge that saw the planemaker book over 400 plane orders in December.Airbus said on Tuesday that it won 1,456 net orders in 2014, down from 1,503 a year earlier but enough to pass Boeing's total of 1,432. Gross orders totaled 1,796, against 1,550 for Boeing, giving Airbus a 54 percent market share.The Airbus Group unit delivered a company record of 629 aircraft in 2014, up slightly from 626 a year earlier but lagging behind Boeing's industry high of 723.It aims to deliver slightly more aircraft this year, Airbus unit head Fabrice Bregier told a news conference.Airbus shares, which in December suffered their worst ever one-day plunge in more than six years after the planemaker predicted flat profits in 2016, were up 0.3 percent at 45.10 euros by 1101 GMT. The stock is up 9 percent this month.Total deliveries by the two plane giants rose 6 percent to a record 1,352 aircraft, reflecting fleet renewals and the rapid growth of Asia as an aviation hub. But some analysts say demand may have peaked as plummeting oil prices - although good for most airlines - reveal broader economic concerns.Deliveries of the A320 narrowbody jet family, which generates much of Airbus's cash, slipped to 490 aircraft from 493 a year earlier but trumped deliveries of the Boeing 737 range, ending a deficit seen between January and November.Airbus said net widebody orders totaled 135 in 2014, a 60 percent fall on the previous year, and behind Boeing's total of 328 for the year. Airbus was dealt a blow in June when Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s.Airbus delivered 30 A380 superjumbos, a model whose future direction has been left uncertain as the company tries to win sales. ""We are confident that the A380's best days lie ahead,"" Bregier said.He added that while upgrades to the superjumbo such as new engines or a stretched version could be considered further down the line, the priority for now was to find customers for the current version.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1272,"Jan 09, 2015 06:57PM ET","After string of jet crashes, a struggle to re-train pilots",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher(Reuters) - As investigators hunt for what caused an AirAsia jet to crash in an equatorial storm on Dec 28, the aviation industry is still struggling to apply the lessons of accidents in similar weather over the past decade.It is too early to say whether the Airbus A320 crashed into the Java Sea due to pilot error, mechanical problems, freak weather or - as most often happens in aviation disasters - a combination of factors.But its apparently uncontrolled plunge, coming after a series of other fatal crashes blamed at least in part on loss of control, has refocused attention on whether pilot training programs need to improve. Critics say pilots don't get enough training on how to react when an airliner stalls or loses lift, and that changes in guidance about best practices have been slow.""The lessons have not been learned to this day,"" said David Learmount, one of the aviation industry's leading safety commentators. ""Everyone knows what the problem is, but nobody is doing anything about it.""Though rare, loss of pilot control ranks as the single biggest cause of air travel deaths. Two crashes in particular forced the issue - the 2009 losses of an Air France flight from Rio De Janeiro to Paris, and a Colgan Air turboprop near Buffalo, New York.In both, confused pilots ignored or countermanded warnings of an impending stall, a condition where a plane loses lift because the air flow over its wings is too slow.The Air France jet took a four-minute, 38,000 feet plunge into the ocean. Despite repeated stall alarms, the control stick was fatally yanked backwards. (http://reut.rs/nHRIZX)BACK TO BASICSClassic stall training calls for pilots to push the control stick forward, nosing the plane down so it will swoop lower and regain speed, which is effective but uncomfortable. But over the last 30 years, most airlines encouraged their pilots to hold the control stick broadly steady and gun the engines to power their way out of a stall, trying to keep the ride as level as possible.In examining stall crashes from that period, that procedure ""wouldn't have helped and would have led to more accidents than it prevented,"" said Claude Lelaie, a retired former chief test pilot at Airbus.In a rare joint move from 2009, Airbus and Boeing called for a return to robust cockpit procedures that prevailed ""when the old guys like me were being trained,"" Lelaie said. ""We were told to push the stick at the first sign of a stall.""But it took several years to set rules that ensure pilots receive regular refresher training and to root out the disputed cockpit procedures of past decades.The new voluntary guidelines by the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which coordinates safety, took effect just six weeks before the loss of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, and will take years to be implemented around the globe. New U.S. rules on pilot training do not take effect until 2019. Regulators will require flight simulators to better model stall behavior, changes that will also take years to implement.ICAO also has proposed that pilots refresh their stall training by flying small aerobatic planes. But Learmount and others said most airlines would be reluctant to pay for it.Changes in training cannot be made overnight because they can create other risks. Even minor adjustments must be thoroughly researched to avoid sowing the seeds of future accidents.The industry is wrestling with a steep drop in the time pilots spend manually flying. Pilots now typically steer for only a few minutes at takeoff and landing, and rely on autopilot for the lengthy, boring cruise phase of flight.When a sudden upset occurs - such as icing or powerful air currents from a storm - even the best pilots can experience a ""startle effect"" and may struggle to recall manual flying skills for that rare situation.A study by Australia's Griffith University found a person's ability to process information is significantly impaired for 30 seconds after being startled, so being trained to cope with the unexpected is as important as knowing cockpit theory.FLIGHT SIMULATORSFlight simulators pose another challenge. The machines are crucial because pilots get little or no in-flight training for stalls after basic training. But most simulators still cannot accurately model a plane's behavior in a full stall. The Federal Aviation Administration has pressing to make them better in a rule-making process that closed this week.Simulator makers want better data about stalls to improve their machines. But plane makers say airliner stalls are so unpredictable that the data would be of little value - a dispute that could also have implications for any potential liabilities. ""It's not clear how the simulation data will be collected,"" said Pat Anderson, director of flight research at Embry-Riddle Aeronautic University, the largest U.S. flight training school.Around the world, airlines, flight schools and governments vary widely in how swiftly and fully they adopt the changes. Some airlines train in-house and go beyond what's required. Others just meet minimum standards, said David Greenberg, a consultant and former head of flight operations at Delta Air Lines.

1275,"Jan 06, 2015 06:06PM ET",Boeing plane deliveries hit record; Airbus wins on orders,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) said on Tuesday that it delivered 723 jetliners in 2014, hitting its own target, setting an industry record and retaining its title as the world's biggest plane maker, besting rival Airbus Group (PA:AIR). But Boeing lost out to Airbus on new orders, according to a person familiar with the matter, a key contest in determining future market share. Boeing set company records by booking 1,550 gross orders and 1,432 net orders worth $232.7 billion at list prices in 2014. Net orders, which account for cancellations, rose 6 percent from the prior year. Airbus is expected to announce next week that it was ahead of Boeing on both gross orders and net orders, according to the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. Airbus is expecting ""one of the best years ever"" in orders, according to a source at the European plane maker, speaking earlier on Tuesday. In 2013, the company booked 1,619 gross orders and 1,503 net orders. While investors closely watch orders, deliveries measure the ability to convert orders into cash, since the bulk of aircraft payments come when airlines fly them away from the factory. Boeing's report suggested stable or growing production rates and also showed its progress in selling end-of-production jets as it transitions to newer models. The company delivered 126 of its 737s in the fourth quarter, for example, precisely hitting its target of 42 planes a month. In 2014, it delivered 485 of the jets, a record. Meanwhile, Boeing delivered its 787 at a rate of nearly 12 a month in the final quarter, up from about nine a month in the rest of the year, when production problems slowed output. That is above the current production rate of 10 a month. In hitting its forecast of between 715 and 725 deliveries in 2014, Boeing delivered 45 more 737s and one more 777 than in 2013. The performance supports keeping profit estimates above consensus, Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne Agee, said in a note. Boeing also booked 63 orders for 777 jets, putting it ""exactly where we wanted to be"" in selling out production as it transitions to the 777X at the end of the decade, said Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, in a blog post.

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on orders or deliveries ahead of an annual news conference on Jan 13.

1281,"Jan 04, 2015 12:55AM ET",More AirAsia wreckage found but weather frustrates divers,nan,"By Fergus Jensen and Nilufar Rizki PANGKALAN BUN/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - A multinational team searching for a crashed AirAsia passenger jet found another large underwater object believed to be part of the plane, but persistent bad weather hampered efforts on Sunday to locate its black box recorders and recover bodies of victims. Indonesian officials say five pieces of wreckage have now been pinpointed on the sea floor off Borneo, where the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320-200 crashed a week ago with 162 people on board. Divers were sent to investigate the debris early on Sunday, but diving had since been suspended due to bad weather, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, said. Flight QZ8501 crashed into the Java Sea last Sunday, about 40 minutes after taking off from Indonesia's second largest city Surabaya en route for Singapore. There were no survivors. Earlier Rukman Soleh, weather bureau chief in Pangkalan Bun, the southern Borneo town where the search operation is based, had said there could be a break later on Sunday in the wind and heavy seas that have dogged recovery efforts all week. ""Weather should provide the search effort with a window of opportunity today, with lower waves expected for the next two days,"" he said. Speaking at the same morning briefing for pilots, Air Force Lt Col Johnson Supriadi said efforts would be divided between recovering bodies and locating wreckage and the all-important cockpit voice and flight data recorders. Until investigators can examine the recorders the cause of the crash remains unknown, but the area is known for intense seasonal storms and BMKG, Indonesia's meteorological agency, has said bad weather was likely a factor. ""The flight document provided by the BMKG office shows fairly worrying weather conditions for the aircraft at cruising level on the chosen route,"" the agency said in a report. A source close to the investigation told Reuters that radar data appeared to show the aircraft made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the A320's limits. The Indonesian captain, a former air force fighter pilot, had 6,100 flying hours on the A320 and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, according to Indonesia AirAsia, 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia (KL:AIRA). SHALLOW WATER The objects that are the main focus of the search were located by ships about 90 nautical miles off the coast of Central Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo. The largest object is around 18 meters long. The suspected wreckage is lying in water around 30 meters (100 ft) deep, which experts say should make it relatively straightforward to recover if the rough weather abates. Efforts to capture images with remote operated vehicles (ROVs) were frustrated on Saturday by poor visibility. Thirty-one bodies of the mostly Indonesian passengers and crew have so far been recovered, including some still strapped in their seats. Many more may be still trapped in the fuselage of the aircraft. The crash was the first fatal accident suffered by the AirAsia budget group, whose Indonesian affiliate flies from at least 15 destinations across the sprawling archipelago. The airline has come under pressure from Indonesian authorities, who have suspended its Surabaya to Singapore operations saying the carrier only had a license to fly the route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Indonesia AirAsia said it would co-operate with the transport ministry whilst it investigates the license. A joint statement from Singapore's civil aviation authority (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group said that AirAsia had the necessary approvals to operate a daily flight between Surabaya and Singapore.

1283,"Dec 29, 2014 07:50AM ET",Indonesia says missing AirAsia plane could be at 'bottom of sea',nan,"By Gayatri Suroyo and Fergus Jensen SURABAYA, Indonesia/JAKARTA (Reuters) - A missing AirAsia jet carrying 162 people could be at the bottom of the sea after it was presumed to have crashed off the Indonesian coast, an official said on Monday, as countries around Asia sent ships and planes to help in the search. The Indonesia AirAsia plane, an Airbus A320-200, disappeared after its pilot failed to get permission to fly higher to avoid bad weather during a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore on Sunday. Flight QZ8501 did not issue a distress signal and disappeared over the Java Sea five minutes after requesting the change of course, which was refused because of heavy air traffic, officials said. ""Based on our coordinates, we expect it is in the sea, so for now (we think) it is on the sea floor,"" Soelistyo, head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, told reporters when asked about the missing plane's likely location. A senior Indonesian civil aviation source told Reuters that authorities had the flight's radar data and were waiting for search and rescue teams to find debris before they started their investigation into the cause. Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan said the search was focused on an area 70 nautical miles square between the island of Belitung, off Sumatra, and Borneo island. He said the sea was only 50 to 100 meters deep in the area, which would be a help in finding the plane. Ships were hunting around the clock but aircraft would suspend their operations at dusk, he added. Air force spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said searchers were checking a report of an oil slick off Belitung. Searchers had picked up an emergency locator signal off the south of Borneo but no subsequent signal was found, he said. On board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French. The disappearance caps a disastrous year for Malaysia-affiliated airlines, with Indonesia AirAsia 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline's Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002. The group's shares in Kuala Lumpur closed 8.5 percent lower. ANGER GROWING Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla, visiting relatives of people on the flight in Surabaya, told reporters the search by 30 ships and 15 aircraft, about halfway between Surabaya and Singapore, was being hampered by bad weather. Anger was growing among about 100 relatives at a crisis center at the airport in Indonesia's second-largest city. ""We only need clear information every hour on where they are going,"" said Franky Chandra, who has a sibling and three friends on the flight, referring to the search teams. ""We've been here for two days but the information is unclear. That's all we need."" Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea have sent ships and aircraft to join the search, and China offered to send planes and ships and any other help Indonesia needs. Soelistyo said Indonesia might not have the best technology to search underwater and had accepted offers of help from the United States, Britain and France. In 2007, it took Indonesia months to recover flight data recorders from a Boeing 737-400 operated by Indonesia's Adam Air which crashed off Sulawesi island, killing all 102 on board. Flight QZ8501 was traveling at 32,000 feet (9,753 meters) and had asked to fly at 38,000 feet to avoid clouds. Permission was not given at the time due to traffic in the area. Five minutes later, at 6.17 a.m. on Sunday (2317 GMT Saturday), the plane lost contact with air traffic control, transport officials said. Data from Flightradar24.com, which tracks airline flights in real time, showed several nearby aircraft were at altitudes ranging from 34,000 to 36,000 feet at the time, levels that are not unusual for cruising aircraft. Pilots and aviation experts said thunderstorms, and requests to gain altitude to avoid them, were not unusual in that area. ""The airplane's performance is directly related to the temperature outside and increasing altitude can lead to freezing of the static radar, giving pilots an erroneous radar reading,"" said a Qantas Airways pilot with 25 years' experience flying in the region. The resulting danger is that pilots take incorrect action to control the aircraft, said the pilot, who requested anonymity. WAS PLANE CLIMBING TOO SLOWLY? Online discussions among pilots centered on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the missing plane was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow in such weather conditions. ""At that altitude, that speed is exceedingly dangerous,"" Sydney-based aviation expert Geoff Thomas told Reuters. ""At that altitude, the thin air, the wings won't support the aircraft at that speed and you get an aerodynamic stall."" Safety authorities say accidents involving a loss of control, such as might occur in bad weather, are rare but almost always catastrophic.  The Indonesian pilot was experienced and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, the airline said. The aircraft had accumulated about 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. Malaysia AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes flew to Surabaya and, along with Indonesian officials, updated relatives at the crisis center at the airport.  ""My heart bleeds for all the relatives of my crew and our passengers. Nothing is more important to us,"" he said on Twitter.

1287,"Dec 19, 2014 06:30PM ET","Boeing on target for 787 deliveries, though costs are a concern",nan,"By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) has more than enough 787 Dreamliners in the production pipeline to meet its year-end delivery target of 110 aircraft, despite concerns a shortage of seats could cause the world's biggest aircraft maker to miss its target, according to industry experts and a Reuters review of its factory. A Reuters survey of jets in production at Boeing's factory in Everett this week showed 14 of the high-tech planes parked outside, and at least five undergoing assembly inside. Boeing has to deliver 14 787s in December to meet its year-end target, after delivering 96 through the end of November. The company has delivered eight 787s this month, leaving just six for the remainder of the year, according to industry sources and plane-spotting blog All Things 787. Concern about the target rose after French seat maker Zodiac Aerospace SA (PA:ZODC) said on Dec. 11 that production delays on seating would continue to affect its profits. Boeing declined to comment. The pace of 787 deliveries is important to Boeing investors as a gauge of progress in lowering the cost of building each jetliner. In theory, aircraft become cheaper to produce over time as workers learn procedures and iron out kinks on the factory floor. Three years after the 787 entered service, Boeing continues to lose as much as $30 million on each 787 it produces, according to Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group. He bases the figure on Boeing's deferred production cost, which reached $25.2 billion in the third quarter, more than analysts expected. ""The continued creep up in 787 deferred production costs means that profitability ramp-up of the program may be slower than previously expected,"" Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients at the time. Boeing has said it is incurring more deferred costs in part because it is buying parts for new variants of the 787 to ensure they are on hand when the factory needs them. Epstein expects Boeing to beginning digging out from those costs late next year or early next year, but that depends on smooth production and the steady delivery of 787s to customers.

1288,"Dec 19, 2014 02:26PM ET",EU widens trade row with new Boeing subsidy claim,nan,"By Tom Miles GENEVA (Reuters) - The European Union opened a new front in a decade-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Friday, launching a complaint at the World Trade Organization alleging illegal tax breaks in Boeing's (N:BA) home state of Washington. The EU said the Pacific coast state, historically the base for nearly all Boeing's plane manufacturing, broke global trade rules by offering tax incentives to persuade the company to manufacture its latest model, the 777X, there. The EU and United States have yet to resolve two parallel clashes involving mutual accusations of illegal subsidies for Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR), collectively the biggest and longest-running dispute in the WTO's history. Earlier this year, Reuters exclusively reported that the European Union was considering challenging the tax breaks, opening a new phase in the marathon dispute. The latest manoeuvres could deepen the bitter industrial contest as the 406-seat Boeing 777X, an expanded version of its profitable 777, competes with Europe's upcoming A350-1000. Airbus is due to deliver its first member of the new A350 family, the smaller A350-900, to Qatar Airways on Monday. In its new complaint, the EU said the WTO had ruled in 2012 that Washington state's support for Boeing and other aerospace firms until 2024 was illegal, and it was now challenging the extension of these alleged subsidies until 2040. ""The subsidies scheme extension is estimated to be worth $8.7 billion and will be the largest subsidy for the civil aerospace industry in U.S. history,"" the EU said in a statement. Washington state lawmakers extended the tax breaks during a brief special session in November 2013. The approval came after Boeing said the credits were necessary for the company to locate production of the 777X in the state. Washington state officials say the credits are available to all commercial aerospace producers and that in 2013, 460 firms claimed incentives under at least one of the programmes, including ""many European-owned aerospace suppliers"". The EU has in the past described such measures as a sham. Under WTO rules, the United States has 60 days to try to deal with the EU's concerns in bilateral talks. After that period, the EU could ask the WTO to set up a panel of three adjudicators to rule on its complaint. That would probably take until 2016 at least, although the WTO's dispute system is already congested, and any judgment could be followed by an appeal. A spokesman for Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said he was ""aware of the request for consultations"" and would continue to work with the U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR).

1289,"Dec 19, 2014 05:40AM ET",Hawaiian Air swap takes Airbus A330neo orders over 100,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Hawaiian Airlines has confirmed an order for six Airbus (PA:AIR) A330-800neo aircraft worth $1.5 billion at list prices, swapping them for a previous A350 order, the planemaker said on Friday. The order for a revamped version of the A330, with new Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines, brings to just over 100 the number of firm orders for the A330neo, a reworked version of Airbus's most-sold wide-body jet which was launched earlier this year. The A330neo is Airbus's alternative for the 250-300 seat market after sales of the smallest version of the new A350 aircraft family, the A350-800, proved disappointing. Hawaiian's new order replaces an order for six A350-800s, which would be worth $1.6 billion at today's list prices. Hawaiian's agreement to switch products is one of the determining factors in deciding whether Airbus can scrap the 270-seat A350-800 to focus on stronger-selling larger types of the new jet, the first of which will be delivered on Monday. Development of the A350-800 has been put on the back burner, but the fate of a total of 26 orders from Russia's Aeroflot (MM:AFLT), South Korean carrier Asiana Airlines (KS:020560) and Yemen's Yemenia must still be settled before Airbus can officially halt the smallest A350 variant. Because of recent improvements in the 20-year-old airframe and new engines, Airbus says the A330neo will be as efficient as the more modern 787 Dreamliner. Boeing (N:BA) disputes this and points to far greater sales of its carbon-composite jet. Airbus is awaiting confirmation of a total of 56 provisional A330neo orders from lessors Air Lease Corp (N:AL) and Avolon , Russian airline Transaero  and an unidentified Asian customer. It is said to be struggling, however, to find buyers for the existing version of A330, prompting it to predict last week it would have to cut production rates again in 2016 while hoping to recover when the re-engined A330neo comes on line. A further output cut had been widely forecast but a related warning of flat 2016 profits triggered a three-day slide in the European firm's stock. The shares were up 0.8 percent on Friday. Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) meanwhile said late on Thursday it would slow receipt of 10 Boeing 777s it has ordered due in 2015 and 2016 as it closes the year with a third profit warning Its finance director said deliveries of the newer Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, which arrive from 2017, were not affected.

1290,"Dec 17, 2014 05:22PM ET",Airbus reshuffle prepares planemaker for record jet output,nan,"By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - A management reshuffle at Airbus (PA:AIR) this week marks another step towards focusing Europe's biggest aerospace company on industrial performance rather than the political interests of key shareholders France and Germany, industry sources said. But Tuesday's announcement also includes a nod towards national sensitivities, while not letting these dominate the choice of industrial leadership as Airbus prepares to crank up production to meet an 8-year waiting list, they said. The Airbus Group (PA:AIR) jetmaking subsidiary's appointment of British aerospace veteran Tom Williams as chief operating officer, with a seat on the group executive committee, marks the first time a Briton has reached that level. It is the first time, too, that someone without a French or German passport has occupied the no.2 slot at the Airbus subsidiary, a post formerly reserved for the main shareholder countries under a power-sharing scheme only recently abandoned. People familiar with the company said Williams, 62, is the ultimate safe pair of hands and the obvious industrial successor to Gunter Butschek, who has resigned. Airbus has said it no longer matters what nationality its executives are, in contrast to in-fighting that marred the first decade after it was founded as EADS in 2000. But analysts say Airbus remains conscious of national sensitivities and changes announced to staff by Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier, ""in agreement with (group CEO) Tom Enders,"" reflect this without dropping the message that the once politically tarnished group has become a ""normal"" company. A miscue last week by the finance director Harald Wilhelm over the future of the A380, mentioning scenarios including cancellation, raised political eyebrows and prompted some analysts to ask whether Airbus divisions were resurfacing. The company strongly denied this. The pre-planned management changes elevate a trio of French, German and British industrial heavyweights as Airbus faces its biggest challenge: changing to a new version of A320 without slowing production and ramping up the A350 at a record rate. Williams, Frenchman Didier Evrard who has completed the A350 development and German procurement chief Klaus Richter will have key roles as the main battle with Boeing (N:BA) shifts towards supply chain and production strategies. The reshuffle also confirms the increasing importance of Airbus chief of staff Marc Fontaine, 48, a close aide to Bregier who joins the Toulouse management team with an expanded role. Richter's appointment to the main group executive board reflects a recent increased focus on supplier risks, but also offsets any disappointment Airbus's vocal German contingent may have about losing the no.2 role, industry sources said. Richter becomes the chief Airbus representative for Germany, a politically sensitive role with 20,000 jobs involved. Richter, who used to run BMW's (DE:BMWG) supply chain, has outlined greater use of standardised carmaking strategies as Airbus shifts towards 'series' output at higher volumes, albeit far below those of the auto industry. His new position reflects this. ""A procurement executive-board member is common in automotive; it is unheard of in aerospace,"" a senior aerospace industry source said. Airbus declined further comment on the changes. ""The big long-term challenge is volume. It is conceivable that a decade out Airbus could be delivering close to 100 aircraft a month,"" Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst at Edison Investment Research, said. Airbus currently delivers 40-50 aircraft a month. ""Automotives will be something they are keen to look at."" At Boeing, group supplier management falls under the broad responsibility of Chief Technology Officer John Tracy, a spokesman said, but there is no 'chief procurement officer'. Boeing pioneered the use in aerospace of ""Lean"" production techniques imported from Toyota in the 1990s, but U.S. aerospace executives trained in auto firms remain a relatively rare sight. Suppliers say Boeing recently, however, began searching for auto industry talent. ""The auto industry is 10-15 years ahead of aerospace in visibility and understanding the supplier and supplier's supplier,"" but is not a catch-all solution for jetmakers, Kevin Michaels, vice president at consultancy ICF International, said.

1291,"Dec 17, 2014 03:54PM ET",Boeing to make 754 commercial jet deliveries in 2015: trade group,nan,"By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) will deliver a record 754 commercial aircraft in 2015, an increase of up to 5.5 percent, the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association forecast on Wednesday, reflecting expectations of steadily rising production at the world's biggest plane maker. The Washington, D.C.-based trade group said its forecast is based on information supplied by Boeing, and comes amid concern that Boeing may have to cut production of some models to keep the assembly lines from running out of orders. The AIA forecast of 754 aircraft next year, contained in the group's 2014 annual report, is in line with Boeing's current production plans, which call for about 752 deliveries in 2015. That suggest no reductions or major increases are in Boeing's sights. Boeing has targeted 715 to 725 deliveries in 2014. However, Boeing told Reuters the AIA report does not preclude the Chicago-based company providing a different forecast when it gives its 2015 outlook in late January. Boeing said last week that it will cut the production rate of the 747-8 jumbo jet to 1.3 a month in September 2015 from 1.5 a month currently due to weak sales. Analysts have suggested that Boeing also may have to cut production of 777 ""mini-jumbo"" jetliners to keep that line operating as it transitions to the next-generation 777X model toward the end of the decade. At the same time, Boeing has been increasing output of 737 and 787 models. It is making 42 737s a month, and plans to increase production to 47 a month in 2017 and 52 a month in 2018. Boeing makes 10 787s a month and plans to increase output to 12 a month in 2016 and 14 a month by 2020. Investors closely watch Boeing's deliveries as a key measure of the aerospace company's ability to generate cash flow and profits. Boeing shares were up 0.01 percent at $124.26 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The AIA also forecast a 6 percent rise in overall U.S. civil aircraft sales in 2015, which would be slower than the 8 percent increase in 2014. The figure includes both commercial aircraft and private planes.  (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Christian Plumb) "
1292,"Dec 16, 2014 02:19PM ET",Tom Williams named Airbus unit no.2 as Butschek leaves,nan,"By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) on Tuesday announced the resignation of the no.2 at its planemaking unit, Chief Operating Officer Gunter Butschek, after 2-1/2 years in the role. Butschek will be succeeded by Tom Williams, executive vice president in charge of Airbus programs, who will in turn be replaced by A350 program chief Didier Evrard, who has completed development of the company's newest wide-body jet. In a letter to staff, Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the main planemaking subsidiary of Airbus, paid tribute to Butschek and said the former Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) executive had ""decided to pursue new opportunities outside of the company"". Airbus shares closed up 1 percent at 40.965 euros. Analysts said the reshuffle was not related to the fallout from a chaotic investor forum that hit Airbus shares last week. Butschek joined Airbus in 2011 and became chief operating officer of the planemaking business in June the following year. He was credited with expanding the use of car industry techniques in Airbus, a trend expected to continue under Klaus Richter, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive who remains in charge of procurement for the overall group but is promoted with Williams to the group executive committee. Despite this, aerospace industry sources say Butschek had not established himself as part of the planemaker's inner circle. A person close to him said he had left of his own volition. Butschek was not immediately available for comment. Williams, 62, is an aerospace veteran who began on the shop floor with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and held senior roles on the Eurofighter with BAE Systems (L:BAES), before transferring in 2000 to Airbus, in which BAE then had a stake. He has a reputation as a tough but effective troubleshooter and led the planemaker's response to the discovery of cracks in components of the wings of the A380 superjumbo jets in 2012. ""Whenever anything goes wrong, Tom is the go-to man,"" a former senior colleague said. Williams, who began as an apprentice in his native Scotland, once told Reuters: ""There is the official factory floor and the real factory floor; you have to know both."" The changes mean the A350, due to be delivered to Qatar Airways next week, will be reintegrated into the rest of Airbus as it shifts towards a production phase. Given the risks of building its first mainly carbon-composite airliner, and anxious not to repeat mistakes by rival Boeing (N:BA) in producing the 787 Dreamliner, Airbus had placed the project under a separate team led by Evrard, a Frenchman who successfully ran Europe's Storm Shadow cruise missile project.

It has in the past refused to take delivery of aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing (N:BA), citing what it describes as its exceptionally high standards. This year, it accepted the first delivery of an A380 superjumbo in September after a three-month delay blamed on a dispute over the quality of cabin fittings. In 2011, European cargo carrier Cargolux rejected delivery of a freighter version of Boeing's 747-8 shortly after Qatar Airways took a 35 percent stake in Cargolux, which it subsequently sold. The delay was blamed on a contractual spat over fuel consumption. The A350 is Airbus' newest, most technically advanced jet. The A350-900 is designed to seat 314 passengers and will be in direct competition with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. A larger model, the 350-seat A350-1000, which targets the ""mini-jumbo"" market occupied by the Boeing 777, is due to enter service in 2017 after its own safety certification process.

1298,"Nov 27, 2014 01:10PM ET",Airbus could shed full Dassault stake by end of 2015: sources,nan,"By Cyril Altmeyer and Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group and Dassault Aviation aim to oversee the complete sale of Airbus's 4.8 billion-euro stake in the French planemaker by the end of next year, two people familiar with the matter said. Plans to reduce the 46.3-percent stake were recently put on hold due to market volatility and Airbus Group said earlier this month there would be a second window of opportunity in early 2015. So far it has said it plans to sell around 10 percent to institutional investors, while family-controlled Dassault Aviation has won approval from its shareholders to buy back up to another 10 percent. But both sides agree the future of the entire shareholding should be settled by the end of next year, the sources said. ""The idea is to wrap up the entire operation by the end of 2015,"" one of the people said, asking not to be named. Airbus and Dassault Aviation both declined to comment. Airbus inherited its stake from former state-owned Aerospatiale, and holds it on behalf of the French government in an increasingly uncomfortable arrangement that led to a decision earlier this year that it was not a strategic shareholding. Unraveling the arrangement needs the agreement of the government and co-operation from Dassault.  Airbus, which has also come under pressure from at least one of its own fund shareholders to free up the resources tied up in Dassault, said recently it had held constructive talks with both the French government and Dassault on the issue.  Reducing its stake would result in an increase in Dassault's slender market float - currently 3 percent of the company, which makes Falcon business jets and Rafale warplanes. It remained unclear whether Airbus would seek to put all its remaining shareholding on the market or whether the Dassault family, which controls 50.6 percent of Dassault Aviation, would also buy part of the stock not included in the direct buyback. But one of the people familiar with the matter ruled out the emergence of a second industrial shareholder to take the place of Airbus. Family holding company Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault was not immediately available for comment. Activist hedge fund TCI wrote to Airbus Group, formerly known as EADS, in August 2013, urging it to sell its stake in Dassault and return the proceeds to Airbus shareholders.

1300,"Nov 21, 2014 04:45PM ET",Airbus Ends Perfect Week With Sale To Armée De L'Air,nan,"By Christopher Harress - European aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PARIS:AIR) has ended the week with around $17 billion worth of sales, beating out its fiercest rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) for a $14 billion Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) contract in the process. On Thursday, one day after the Delta order was announced, the French Minister for Defense announced a $3 billion deal to buy 12 Airbus A330 multi-role tanker amd transport aircraft for its military.The defense deal, which happens to mark 50 years of the French Air Force's nuclear wing, will see the first aircraft arrive in 2018, the second in 2019 and then two per year after that until the order is complete. The aircraft will replace the Boeing C-135FR tankers that France has been using since the 1960s.  The deal includes five years’ worth of development, support, training, spare parts and ground support equipment. It's a breath of fresh air for the military tanker version of the A330, whose main role is the in-flight refueling of other aircraft to extend their range. The European plane had prevailed over Boeing in a competition in 2008 for 179 tankers for the U.S. Air Force, but that order was invalidated and then reassigned to Boeing after the American company protested, alleging irregularities. A rematch was then won by Boeing in 2011.    The A330 tanker-transport version, known as the A330 MRTT , is already in service with the air forces of Great Britain, Australia and the United Arab Emirates. In the Delta deal, Airbus sold 25 of the advanced, stretched version of the A330, the A330-900, as well as 25 A350-900. Boeing was offering its 787 Dreamliner. That deal also nets Rolls-Royce $5 billion as the engine manufacturer. This comes at a pivotal time for the company as its share price was suffering from reductions in military orders over the past year.""When the most successful U.S. airline today ... says 'yes we want 50 more of your wide body planes', you can't debate the fact that it is a massive endorsement of your product line,"" John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, said of the Delta order. The deal hinged on quick delivery, and Airbus promised that it would begin delivering as early as 2019, ahead of what Boeing could offer with its 787 Dreamliner. "

Airbus said the plane's range would be about 100 nautical miles more than that of the 757-200W.The market for these single-aisle aircraft is crucial for both companies, as it will account for nearly 70 percent of new aircraft deliveries worth some $2.5 trillion over the next 20 years, according to Boeing's estimates.Airbus recently said demand for the larger A321 model is prompting it to start its production on U.S. soil with that model instead of the A320 as originally planned.Some airlines have been ""upgauging"" to larger jets to lower per-seat costs. The 321 seats about 185 passengers in a two-class configuration, compared with 150 for the A320.Boeing said it sees the single-aisle market centered around planes with 160 seats in a two-class configuration, about the size of the 737 MAX 8. The larger MAX 9 carries about 180 passengers in two classes.Tinseth said Boeing can already put an additional fuel tank on the 737 MAX 9. But the company does not see a business case in making an extended-range version of the plane.""Anything that you look at in that market segment to increase the range of that airplane, I think it would come with small returns,"" he said.Boeing's chief executive officer, Jim McNerney, said earlier this month that the company would bring out a 737 MAX replacement around 2030, with a new fuselage, wings and engines. That plane will also address the gap left by the 757.(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by David Gregorio and Leslie Adler)"
1303,"Nov 19, 2014 09:45PM ET",Delta Gives Airbus $13 Billion Aircraft Order,nan,"By Alberto Riva - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), the second-biggest airline in the world by passengers carried, has ordered 50 widebody long-range jets from Airbus (PARIS:AIR), dealing Boeing (NYSE:BA) a blow in one of the most hotly contested commercial aircraft competitions in recent years. The order, worth about $13 billion at list prices, is for 25 Airbus A350-900 and 25 A330-900, aviation news site Leeham News reported, citing two unidentified sources.Both the planes are twinjets designed to reduce fuel consumption compared to the previous generation of large passenger aircraft.The order adds to the sales success of the A350, the latest product from European consortium Airbus and the direct competitor of Chicago-based Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. The recently launched A330-900 is part of the A330neo family, a modified version of the A330 which has been in service with airlines for 20 years.    Boeing was offering the 787-9, the midsize model of its newest aircraft family. 787s have been in service for three years, while the A350 is entering service later this year or early in 2015, after delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways in December. The A330neo, which has not flown yet, is slated to enter service in 2017.Delta already has some 787s on order, in fact. The purchase of 18 Dreamliners had been made by Northwest Airlines, which merged with Delta in 2010, but those airplanes will not be delivered until 2020 after Northwest deferred the order due to economic difficulties.  The  A350-900 will join the Delta fleet before that date, since there are dozens of delivery slots available after Dubai-based Emirates Airline cancelled earlier this year an order for 70. The availability of early delivery slots, a plus in the market for large commercial jets which are booked many years in advance, may have helped tip the balance in favor of Boeing, analyst Michel Merluzeau told Bloomberg News.According to sources cited by Leeham, the longer-range A350  will be used on routes across the Pacific Ocean while the A330 will fly over the Atlantic. Delta already employs several current-model A330s  on Atlantic routes.The A350 seats up to 314 in a three-class configuration and can fly a full load of passengers and cargo up to 7,750 nautical miles, or 14,350 kilometers, making it one of the longest-range aircraft in the world, well suited for the long overwater stretches of Pacific routes.The A330-900, the larger of the two models making up the A330neo (for ""new engine option"") family, seats up to 310 in a three-class layout and can fly nonstop for up to 6,200 nautical miles or 11,500 km.Rolls Royce is the sole maker of engines for both the A350 and A330neo.  The A350 has a total of 750 orders; the A330neo, launched earlier this year, around 125, according to Airbus figures that do not include the Delta order. Boeing has sold 1,054 Dreamliners to date.  "
1304,"Nov 18, 2014 05:13PM ET",Airbus to deliver first A350 jetliner around December 12,nan,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus aims to deliver the first A350 jetliner to launch customer Qatar Airways by mid-December, the airline said on Tuesday. Gulf News quoted its chief executive Akbar Al Baker as saying the mid-sized jet would be delivered between Dec. 12 and 15‎ and appeared to rule out any last-minute hitches that might rattle investors in planemaker parent Airbus Group. ""Everything is perfect,"" he said, according to the Dubai-based newspaper. In the United States, a representative for the Gulf carrier said the aircraft would be delivered around Dec. 12. The A350, Airbus's newest plane and made with a carbon-fiber composite fuselage, is a direct competitor to Boeing's composite 787 Dreamliner. The long-range, twin-aisle plane received its certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week, after winning European safety approval in September.  The version of the jet certified by the FAA and European regulators, the A350-900, is designed to seat 314 passengers. Airbus has booked 750 orders for the A350, including 549 for the A350-900 and 169 for the larger A350-1000, which is due to enter service in 2017. The smaller A350-800 has 32 orders but is likely to be phased out to make way for the revamped A330neo. Airbus is planning a steep production increase, aiming to build three A350s per month by year-end, up from two a month currently. By the end of next year it plans to build five a month and to hit 10 a month by mid-2018. Airbus originally targeted entry to service in 2012 when it re-launched the current design of the A350 at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2006. It later slowed development, both to ensure its maturity and iron out problems including a glitch in wings production, but the schedule has been broadly stable for the past two years. The plane's successful test flight program, regulatory certification and impending first delivery have been well received by Airbus investors, helping shares rise more than 7 percent in the past month.

1313,"Nov 04, 2014 11:12AM ET","Rolls-Royce to cut 2,600 staff, appoints new finance chief",nan,"By Kate Holton LONDON (Reuters) - British engineer Rolls-Royce (L:RR) plans to cut 2,600 jobs to save money and has replaced its finance director, aiming to restore confidence following two profit warnings in eight months. The world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines said the job cuts, which will mostly come in the Aerospace division and will take 18 months to complete, were designed to save around 80 million pounds ($128 million) a year once the redundancy program was complete. Rolls-Royce, which dates back to 1884 and has around 55,000 staff worldwide, has traditionally had lower margins than market leader General Electric (N:GE), meaning it can be undercut by its rival. ""We are taking determined management action and accelerating our progress on cost,"" said Chief Executive John Rishton. ""The measures announced today will not be the last, however they will contribute towards Rolls-Royce becoming a stronger and more profitable company."" The majority of the aerospace jobs are in Britain and the United States and the need to cut numbers comes as the focus on Rolls' key Trent engines moves from a development to production phase, requiring fewer engineers. The development of new facilities has also made the group more efficient, requiring fewer staff, and a move to reorganize the group into two divisions has reduced the number of management jobs. The announcement comes almost three weeks after Rolls issued a major profit warning, saying deteriorating economic conditions meant profit would not rise next year as previously forecast, sending its shares plunging by 16 percent at the time. The warning was the second such downgrade in eight months and paved the way for another year of stagnation after more than a decade of strong growth. It also prompted concern that the company did not have sufficient visibility over its future earnings. SMITH STEPS UP Without giving any explanation, Rolls also said Finance Director Mark Morris had left after 27 year with the company and would be replaced by David Smith, who is promoted from finance director of the Aerospace division. Espirito Santo analyst Ed Stacey said investors would be looking for a clear message from the new finance director and tight control on all the financial metrics. ""The share price reaction shows that there's some optimism that he can deliver that,"" Stacey said. ""Some restructuring had already been indicated ... two weeks ago, the plan is probably not any better or worse than people had expected but what we have now is some concrete numbers, so it's eliminating uncertainty."" Shares in the group spiked on the news and were up 2 percent at 1426 GMT (9:26 a.m. EST). Rolls said in October that the market for its main aircraft engine business would strengthen but customers in the oil and gas, mining, construction, industrial and agricultural sectors were cancelling or delaying orders. Until this year, the company had enjoyed 11 years of strong profit and revenue growth, as soaring demand for fuel-efficient engines for passenger jets made by Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) boosted its civil aerospace unit, which accounted for 43 percent of sales in 2013. Rolls-Royce reassured investors that the outlook for its aero engine business remained good, thanks to increasing demand for travel in emerging economies and the need to replace older aircraft with new, fuel efficient models.

1315,"Oct 21, 2014 05:30PM ET","After huge jet orders, budget airlines eye rich seam of aircraft leasing",nan,"By Anshuman Daga and Tim Hepher SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - From Scandinavia to Southeast Asia, low-cost airlines have ordered record numbers of planes in recent years, redefining the jet industry. Now they plan to lease out scores of their new planes, re-ordering the aviation business all over again.Between them, Indonesia's Lion Air, Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) have ordered more than 1,400 Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) jets, worth about $140 billion at current list prices. They're about to test the growing market for rented planes, competing with established finance firms that lease out aircraft to cash-strapped carriers from China to the United States.Jet makers and the finance companies which dominate aircraft leasing question whether budget airlines have the know-how to succeed, and some in the industry wonder whether they have simply ordered more planes than they need. But the low-cost carriers' sights are trained on new revenue streams, and net profit margins of about 20 percent enjoyed by global aircraft lessors - well above the airline industry average.""It's the leasing companies that have made money in the last 10 years, not the airlines,"" Norwegian Air Shuttle's chief executive Bjorn Kjos told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to lessors who buy 30-40 percent of Airbus and Boeing planes. ""They have a fantastic bottom line. They earn all the money the airlines should have earned.""For would-be lessor budget carriers, whose orders have boosted aircraft production and secured thousands of jobs, renting out planes provides both insurance against a downturn and diversified revenues. Though such business remains in its infancy, it could also help them hedge currency risk, bringing in revenue in dollars that can also be used to buy jets.With over 900 jets worth $96 billion at current list prices on order or already delivered between them, Lion Air and Norwegian Air Shuttle in particular plan to become active in leasing. The trend has fueled concern that scores of jets could boomerang back onto the market, undercutting plane values and disrupting the global industry.To some, such moves confirm suspicions that too many planes have been sold to airlines that don't need them as Airbus and Boeing jostle for market share.""When people realize demand may not be as believed, things change. Looking for alternative things to do is one of the possible indicators of aircraft over-ordering,"" said Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at U.S. consultancy Avitas.NEW BREEDAirlines often rent out unused planes, when needed, to manage fleets. But few have successfully moved into leasing for its own sake, and many that have tried, like Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), eventually exited.What has changed is that low interest rates, high fuel prices in the recent past and growth in emerging markets have encouraged the new breed of budget carrier to place huge orders. Last week India's IndiGo followed suit with a record provisional Airbus deal.Add to this relentless Airbus-Boeing competition, and many say there hasn't been a better time to buy new jets at potentially huge bargains.""I am very confident that there aren't many leasing companies in the world that have a better purchase price than us,"" Norwegian CEO Kjos said.""When you purchase 100 aircraft you can get a fair discount. If you purchase 250 you get an even better discount. There aren't that many leasing companies that purchase 250.""Lion Air's Singapore-based lessor, Transportation Partners, aims to ramp up third-party leasing in 2015 and 2016 with a focus on China, Brazil, Japan and the United States, chief operating officer John Duffy told Reuters.""We are in some respects, the strategic hedge or the pressure valve. If planes coming into the group are identified as being surplus to requirements, then we have the right to lease them anywhere,"" Duffy said at an industry gathering.AirAsia started a leasing unit last month, aiming to form a venture with a leasing investor. ""People are looking for good rates of return with low risk. The asset class of airplanes is becoming a good asset class,"" Chief Executive Tony Fernandes told Reuters recently. The unit is expected to lease jets both to affiliated airlines and externally.LEASING RISKSIf successful, the low-cost carriers could in theory take business away from traditional lessors, particularly smaller players. That could in turn put pressure on lessors to cut their rates.""The historical success of airlines-as-lessors is mixed at best, but if these companies aggressively grow their leasing fleets we believe it could put marginal pressure on lease rates,"" Wells Fargo analyst Gary Liebowitz said in a report in August.Leasing executives are quick to flag potential risks. They say theirs is a highly specialized business in which problems like having too many jets grounded between rentals, or the wrong funding structure, can quickly escalate.""The skill sets that are needed to operate an efficient and profitable leasing company are not necessarily the same skills you may have when running an airline,"" said Jeffrey Knittel, president of CIT Transportation, a leasing unit of U.S. insurer CIT (N:CIT). Besides, some airlines are seen as reluctant to lease from competitors if that means sharing confidential data.Jet makers are meanwhile aware that traditional lessors remain among their most influential and loyal customers.""I do not encourage our customers to set up leasing companies,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said on the sidelines of a conference. ""The leasing model is a different model...I don't think airlines running part-time leasing companies is a good alternative.""Neither Airbus nor Boeing commented on specific airlines.For Boeing, ""The better question is whether this practice is practical,"" said marketing vice president Randy Tinseth. ""Leasing companies have infrastructure to support the placement, contracting, configuration and technical management of the assets – airlines do not.""(Additional reporting by Alister Doyle in OSLO and Siva Govindasamy in SINGAPORE; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)"

1317,"Oct 19, 2014 07:14AM ET",The $40 billion jet buying spree - IndiGo's big bet,nan,"By Tommy Wilkes and Tim Hepher NEW DELHI/PARIS (Reuters) - Almost four years ago a handful of people gathered in Airbus sales chief John Leahy's spacious country house outside Toulouse and argued long into the evening over curry and cigars. Last weekend they met up again at a Parisian hotel for more haggling, with breaks taken at a nearby cafe where the informality of old business friendships mingled with hard-nosed negotiations typical of the aircraft industry. The sum total of money discussed over these meals? About $40 billion at catalogue prices, and the bill was for 430 jets, all sold to the same Indian airline -- IndiGo, the low-cost carrier which has grown to become the country's biggest airline in eight years of operating. Represented according to insiders by co-founder Rakesh Gangwal and President Aditya Ghosh, IndiGo has now made aircraft industry history twice in four years -- each time by placing record orders for Airbus planes, including last Wednesday's announcement that it will buy 250 A320neo jets. The largest order in India's aviation history is IndiGo's most aggressive bet yet that Indian air travel is on the cusp of a huge expansion, and that the model that made it the nation's only profitable carrier will keep working as competition intensifies.  ""IndiGo is showing us the level of confidence it has in its own sustainability, in the long-term growth of aviation and in the future performance of the Indian economy,"" said Harsh Vardhan, chairman at Delhi-based Starair Consulting. Airline industry executives are hoping India's weak economy will rebound under new Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that the government will press for cuts to jet fuel tax and build more airports, slashing costs and opening up new markets. Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanization have made India one of the world's fastest-growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 percent in the next six years to exceed 217 million. According to Airbus executive vice-president and the president of its India operations Kiran Rao, optimism about growth in Indian aircraft demand is rising. But few airlines have translated that optimism into new orders on the scale of IndiGo's since most are losing money. ""People are too focused on India's negatives. IndiGo is aware of the challenges and it is adept at steering itself around them. That is how it became India's largest carrier,"" said one source familiar with the airline's thinking.  ""There is, however, a great deal of optimism about the future within the airline and that comes right from the top."" Ghosh told Reuters last week India was a ""highly underpenetrated market"" and that a lot of the new planes would be for growth rather than replacing older aircraft. STAYING IN PROFIT Despite more Indians flying, fierce competition and high costs have left airlines including SpiceJet, Jet Airways and state-run Air India losing cash fast. The sector will lose up to $1.4 billion more this financial year, according to consultancy CAPA. Privately held, IndiGo does not disclose its full accounts but is the only major Indian carrier which says it is profitable. It reported a sixfold rise in net profit to 7.87 billion rupees ($128 million) in the 2012-13 financial year, and has since expanded its market share to about 32 percent. Founded in 2006 by travel entrepreneur Rahul Bhatia and Gangwal, a former chief executive of U.S. Airways and an old hand in executing game-changing aircraft orders, IndiGo has relied almost entirely on the sale and leaseback model to fuel its growth. IndiGo buys a single line of planes in bulk at discounts, and then sells them to leasing companies around the time they are delivered, leasing the planes back and retiring the aircraft within six years to avoid depreciation and maintenance costs. This keeps capital costs low and its balance sheet light, and is a strategy some analysts say hands it up-front cash to meet operating costs and tips it into profitability as rivals succumb to losses. ""IndiGo is also a good customer and in a good cashflow position, which means that there is little chance of default. In India IndiGo is probably the best customer for lessors,"" said one person familiar with the leasing negotiations. IndiGo denies that the sale and leaseback model is the reason it makes money, and instead points to an advertising budget which is less than 1 percent of revenues, the fast turnaround of its fleet and its high level of seat sales as a proportion of capacity compared with its rivals. The airline says it will also stick to the standard low-cost operator's strategy of flying a single type of narrowbody plane within India and to a handful of overseas destinations. COMPETITION AND AMBITION IndiGo's ascent is not without its risks, however. An end to the era of cheap borrowing to finance its plane orders would raise its costs, and should India's fragile economic recovery wilt IndiGo would be left facing delivery of 250 Airbus planes from 2018 that it would struggle to fill. Increased competition in a notoriously cut-throat Indian market plagued by overcapacity could throw up the biggest hurdle to IndiGo's ambitions, analysts say. Once-profitable airlines like Jet, which went from market leader in the 1990s to today's sprawling international carrier, have turned loss-making in the last two years as fares fell faster than they could cut costs. Meanwhile Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia launched its first Indian flight in June, bringing in an airline which manages to operate with one of the lowest unit costs per kilometer flown in the industry. AirAsia India did not respond to requests for comment on IndiGo. ""The biggest risk for IndiGo is how the competition behaves, whether AirAsia and others respond more aggressively now,"" said Starair's Vardhan.

1325,"Oct 02, 2014 12:18PM ET",Boeing to raise monthly production of 737 jets to 52 in 2018,nan,"By Alwyn Scott (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) on Thursday announced plans to raise output of 737 jetliners beyond its already blistering production pace, saying global demand for new aircraft justifies it. The move to build a record 52 737s a month in 2018, from 42 currently, while widely expected, shows Boeing's confidence that its factory and its network of suppliers can step up to the fastest-ever rate for Boeing's single-aisle jet. The increase will push production of 737 aircraft to 624 a year in 2018, almost matching the 648 jetliners the company delivered last year across all four of its main models. While many suppliers will be able to meet the higher rate, they fear the increase won't last more than a couple of years, not long enough to justify the costs of increasing their capacity, said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who recently surveyed about 45 companies that supply Boeing. ""It is not ideal from a supplier standpoint because of the capital investment required and the negative financial implications of then taking rates down,"" he said. ""This significantly increases the risk, in the eyes of the suppliers."" But the largest suppliers and Boeing are being far more careful about over-straining suppliers than in prior business cycles, ""so this provides some level of assurance,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a note. The announcement comes just days after executives from Boeing and Airbus Group NV (PA:AIR) clashed over jet production strategy at an aviation gathering in Istanbul. The European planemaker questioned the viability of its rival's plans to raise output, while Boeing insisted it will only build enough jets its buyers and suppliers can handle. Airbus says it is considering increasing production of its narrow body A320 family to 46 a month in 2016 from 42. It plans to increase monthly production to 50 A320 planes later. Boeing had already announced plans to raise monthly production of 737 jets to 47 in 2017, and had signaled for weeks that it was studying a further step-up, citing ""incredible pressure"" from airlines, especially low-cost carriers, that are eager to refresh their fleets and expand amid rising air travel. Boeing said on Monday it would move about 2,000 jobs out of Washington state as it reorganizes its defense business in light of dwindling U.S. defense spending and other cost pressures, a move seen as a blow to the state's economy. Boeing's study of the market convinced the Chicago-based company that demand is strong enough to justify the rate increase. Boeing has 4,008 orders for 737 models, including its new fuel-saving 737 MAX series, due to enter service in 2017. That represents nearly eight years of production at the current rate of 42 a month. At the rate of 52 a month, the backlog would fall to 6.4 years, allowing Boeing to cut the amount of time airlines must wait for new planes. The decision to increase production ""reflects the appetite for airplanes like the 737 MAX and (current production) Next Generation 737,"" said Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing. ""Our thorough analysis tells us the single-aisle market continues to expand."" Boeing's shares, which have fallen nearly 9 percent this year, were down 0.4 percent at $124.11 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. However, shares of a key supplier were lower. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), which makes the 737 fuselage, was trading at $37.29 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 1.6 percent.

1326,"Sep 30, 2014 12:00PM ET",Airbus wins European approval for its new A350 jet,nan,"By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Planemaker Airbus won European safety approval on Tuesday for the A350, clearing the main regulatory hurdle before its newest and most technically advanced jet can start flying passengers.The European Aviation Safety Agency said Airbus, the planemaking unit of Airbus Group, had proved the jet's airworthiness in more than 60,000 hours of certification work including 250 hours spent with safety inspectors in the air.""We dealt with a very mature aircraft,"" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said.The version of the jet certified by EASA on Tuesday, the A350-900, is designed to seat 314 passengers and is due to enter service with Qatar Airways before the end of the year in direct competition with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.A larger model, the 350-seat A350-1000, which targets the ""mini-jumbo"" market occupied by the Boeing 777, is due to enter service in 2017 after a separate safety certification process.Development of a smaller model, the A350-800, has been effectively halted due to weak demand, prompting Airbus recently to upgrade its older A330 to address the 250-300-seat market.Asked how long it would take to deliver the first A350 to Qatar Airways, which recently delayed taking delivery of its first A380 in a dispute over cabin fittings, program chief Didier Evrard said the airline's first jet was ready to start pre-delivery trials, but declined to give a precise estimate.""It is a very cooperative phase with our customer and we are going to address it together,"" Evrard said.""It will be before the end of the year for sure,"" he said, referring to the planemaker's target for first delivery. ""It is a question of execution. There is no outstanding 'unknown',"" he added.Both Airbus and Boeing say their latest generation of long-distance mid-sized aircraft will cut fuel costs by at least 20 percent compared with traditional metallic aircraft.The A350 is the result of eight years of design and development work costing an estimated $15 billion and involving 213 suppliers.It went through several design changes as Airbus sought to counter its rival's lead in deliveries of wide-body aircraft, but Airbus says it is confident it has the right plane.Airbus has sold 750 of the A350 jets, worth $295 million to $340 million each at list prices, since their launch in 2006.That compares with 1,048 orders for the Dreamliner, which has been on the market longer, having been launched in 2004 and entered service in 2011.WAITING FOR ETOPSAlthough the A350 is ready for service, it will not be able to fly on the longest oceanic routes for which it was designed until Airbus also receives clearance for extended operations, which its executives expect to happen within days or weeks.A European safety official said the aircraft would be authorized to fly on virtually any world route.Airbus is also waiting for certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, but question marks remain over how quickly and extensively the U.S. regulator will grant extended operations after problems with the entry to service of the 787.The ability to fly long routes over water is determined by the amount of time an aircraft is allowed to operate on one engine in the event that the other engine fails.Industry sources said Airbus had asked European authorities to clear the A350 to fly for up to 370 minutes on one engine, exceeding the so-called ETOPS limit of 330 minutes on the 787.The global 787 fleet was grounded from January to April last year after two lithium-ion batteries burned out in separate incidents in Japan and the United States.Airbus had intended to use lithium-ion batteries, which weigh less than traditional power packs, for the A350 but switched back to traditional nickel-cadmium in the face of the 787 problems to prevent its own schedule slipping.Evrard said Airbus had agreed with EASA how to return to the lithium-ion technology and that this would happen in 2016.""We have flown the lithium battery for all development aircraft except the last one and we have accumulated experience in flight,"" he told reporters, adding he was ""absolutely"" certain they would be safe.Japan's transport authority said last week said it was unable to find the root cause of the overheating of a battery on a 787 owned by ANA Holdings in January 2103.Boeing says its reinforced battery system ensures the safety of the 787 Dreamliner.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Andrew Callus and Pravin Char)"

The company declined further comment. EASA was not immediately available for comment.Airbus had set a September target for the first flight of its upgraded A320neo, which took place on Thursday, and for the certification of the A350.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Jason Neely)"
1328,"Sep 25, 2014 08:28PM ET",Airbus says may win new A380 customer by year-end,nan,"By Tim Hepher TOULOUSE France (Reuters) - Airbus sees a ""distinct possibility"" of adding at least one new customer for its A380 superjumbo jet before the end of the year, the European planemaker's sales chief John Leahy told Reuters on Thursday. Currently, Airbus has a total of 318 orders from 19 customers for the world's largest passenger jet, which is designed to carry 525 passengers. ""That is a distinct possibility,"" Leahy said, when asked about industry speculation of a deal to add at least one new name to the order book for the slow selling plane.  He was speaking after Airbus on Wednesday revised down its demand forecast for the industry's largest category of aircraft, which includes the A380 and the Boeing 747-8, while revising up its overall 20-year jet demand forecast. Airbus lost one of its existing A380 customers in July when it revoked an order for six A380s from Japan's Skymark Airlines, which faced difficulties financing its purchase.  It booked a previously announced order for 20 aircraft in February from leasing company Amedeo, leaving a net tally of 14 orders so far this year. An order for 10 A380s from Hong Kong Airlines also hangs in the balance as the airline prepares to cancel the order, which has been moved to a part of the Airbus order book reserved for unnamed buyers, industry sources said in July. However, Airbus is working on adding up to two new buyers for the double-decker jet in coming months, financial industry delegates said at the Istat Europe conference earlier this week. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said on Thursday he was convinced that ""smart marketing"" would boost sales. The A380 sells for $414 million at list prices but airlines typically get large discounts for new plane orders. Because of its size, some airline executives view the A380 as risky in a fragile economy, but Bregier said it was profitable to fly. Both Airbus executives were speaking on the sidelines of the first flight of a smaller aircraft, the A320neo Speculation surfaced at an industry conference this week that Turkish Airlines could lease some A380s, either from another airline or lessor Amedeo or both. That would not immediately benefit Airbus directly but would be welcomed by the planemaker as a visible marketing boost. Turkish Airlines has ties through a codeshare agreement with Malaysia Airlines, an A380 operator that is looking for urgent solutions to bring in cash and restructure its operations following two aviation disasters. Asked at an air show in Istanbul on Thursday about the prospect of leasing some A380s, Turkish Airlines Chief Executive Temel Kotil said, ""There is nothing new to communicate on that."" Airbus is heavily dependent on three Gulf carriers that make up half of the A380s on order, dominated by a total of 140 planes ordered by Dubai carrier Emirates. It says it would buy even more if Airbus agreed to upgrade its engines to save fuel. ""This is not on the agenda right now. It is not a priority,"" Bregier told reporters, adding his goal was to sell the current model which was making a ""ton of money"" for key operators. ""We need to find a way to convince other airlines and we are confident we can do that. It is true that in a few years we have to ask ourselves what is next and how we continue to incrementally innovate the A380,"" Bregier added. Most industry watchers say Airbus will most likely bow to the demands by its top customer Emirates but that it faces a dilemma over timing. Delaying too long could inhibit a recovery of sales of its flagship product and moving too early could limit the amount of new technology available and strain engineering resources. Abu Dhabi's state-owned Etihad Airways meanwhile showed off its first A380 and unveiled its new branding as it seeks to up the battle in the luxury stakes and continue its rapid growth. Speaking in Hamburg on Thursday, Chief Executive James Hogan said it was too soon to say whether Etihad would increase its order for 10 superjumbos. Qatar Airways took delivery of its first of 10 A380s last week and hinted it could buy more later this year.

1329,"Sep 25, 2014 04:00PM ET",Airbus Group talks to interested parties on defense assets: CEO,nan,"TOULOUSE France (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has begun sounding out potential partners for parts of its defense and security business whose future was left undecided in a recent portfolio review, Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday. Airbus Group this month unveiled plans to sell various communications, sonar and software businesses with revenues of 2 billion euros and to focus its Defence and Space division on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites. The fate of a third group of assets, involving mainly its defense electronics and border security activities, was left undecided, but Airbus Group said it was not prepared to invest the money that would be needed to conquer a global position. ""The decision is that clearly this is not a core business for us and we have started to discuss with possibly interested parties,"" Enders told Reuters in an interview. Asked whether Airbus Group favored a disposal or joint-ventures for all or part of those activities, he said: ""It really depends on who has an interest and who wants to be buying this business or to be a majority partner and so on ... But the decision has been taken that this is not a core business for us in the future."" Enders said Airbus Group would work ""as soon as possible"" to formulate the next steps but was not bound by any particular timeline or sequence. He was speaking on the sidelines of the first flight of the Airbus civil planemaking subsidiary's A320neo, an aircraft whose popularity with airlines and Airbus stockholders -- alongside the failure of a bid to carry out a major defense merger in 2012 -- prompted the group to review its defense and space strategy. The shake-up marks a break with previous efforts to diversify into security activities and a halt to investment in defense electronics, in which Airbus lacks the scale of rivals. Europe's defense industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back on arms spending. Airbus Group, then known as EADS, responded in 2012 by trying to merge with UK defense firm BAE Systems (L:BAES) but the deal was blocked by Germany.

1330,"Sep 25, 2014 01:38PM ET",Airbus conducts maiden flight of hot-selling A320neo ,nan,"By Tim Hepher TOULOUSE France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) successfully staged the maiden test flight on Thursday of an upgraded passenger jet on which it expects to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue, buoyed by an increase in the company's jet demand forecast. The A320neo touched down in Toulouse, southwest France, 27 years after the original A320 first took to the skies and opened up fierce competition with Boeing's medium-haul 737 in a slice of the jet market estimated at $2 trillion over 20 years.Powered by a new type of jet engine from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), the A320neo flew for two hours and 22 minutes, kicking off a year of flight trials. The same family of aircraft will also offer a competing engine from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (N:GE) and Safran (PA:SAF). Airbus is aiming for savings of 15 percent per seat compared with the current generation of medium-haul passenger jets. It said this gap would increase to 20 percent by 2020 thanks in part to a further two percent improvement due to be delivered by Pratt & Whitney, on top of its 12 percent contribution to the current improvement. The rest will come by adding more seats. With airlines running on wafer-thin profit margins and spending about 40 percent of their operating costs on fuel, such savings are at the center of a huge sales battle. Rival Boeing is bringing out its own updated version of the 737 just over a year after Airbus and the two companies face a gradual threat to their duopoly at the small end of the market from new competitors in Canada, Brazil, China and Russia. A smooth entry to service will however cement their position as market leaders for years to come, analysts say, Shares in both companies have risen sharply since the decision to revamp their most-sold aircraft was announced in 2010 and 2011. Airbus shares rose over 2 percent on Thursday. Airbus has sold 3,257 A320neo aircraft and said it expects this to reach 3,500 by the end of the year. Together, Airbus and Boeing have sold well over 5,000 of the planes. Both companies have announced increases in production as a result, and are considering further increases to lift A320 or 737 production to 50 planes a month or beyond. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier however said it was in ""no rush"" to make a further output decision. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet demand on Wednesday, citing growth in emerging markets, with China on the brink of becoming the world's aviation powerhouse. The flight went ahead in September as planners hoped after last-minute signs of concern about the engine's readiness and the recent resumption of flight tests on Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) CSeries aircraft, which uses similar Pratt & Whitney engines. An engine blowout in May had halted CSeries flight testing. The companies indicated they were convinced that the Airbus version of the engine would not be affected by the same problems and that the aircraft would enter service with the same high reliability as the existing generation of small jets. ""It is a great engine that is going to change the economics of the airline industry,"" said Alain Bellemare, chief executive of UTC Propulsion and Aerospace Systems at Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies (N:UTX). ""We are highly confident in the performance of these engines,"" he told Reuters.

1331,"Sep 23, 2014 11:40PM ET",Aircraft lessors wary as new rivals crowd into aviation,nan,"By Tim Hepher ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing companies voiced confidence in steady jetliner demand, but warned new aviation investors that they may take a painful hit when central banks start unwinding their efforts to stimulate the economy.Deterred by poor returns elsewhere as interest rates remain at rock bottom, new money has been pouring into aviation in the hope of capturing greater profits thanks to a combination of ample liquidity and demand for jets.""Established lessors have enjoyed a positive interest rate environment but at the same time, the industry has been a magnet for money,"" said Steven Udvar-Hazy, chief executive of Air Lease Corp (N:AL), seen as a founder of the jet leasing industry.Aviation leasing companies account for up to 40 percent of aircraft being delivered and say they help to smooth swings in the market by renting out jets where demand is strongest. Many have overhauled their balance sheets to avoid new market shocks.But other investors such as sovereign wealth funds, private equity, real estate firms and non-specialist institutions are increasingly taking an interest in the $100 billion jet market.""The interest rate environment has been tremendously positive for the leasing community and airline industry,"" Udvar-Hazy told the Istat Europe air finance conference in Istanbul on Tuesday. ""The counter-effect is that low interest rates have attracted a lot of other investors.""An unofficial gauge of interest was the record attendance at this week's aviation conference, which drew over 1,000 jet traders, manufacturers and financiers to the Bosphorus. Over 40 percent polled in one session said they were attending the annual event for only the first or second time.It is Europe's version of an even larger U.S. gathering that started out three decades ago as a meeting of a group of second-hand jet sellers, which they nicknamed the ""Junkdealers' Ball"".Now, worldwide meetings of the International Society of Air Transport Aircraft Trading support an ecosystem with financial solutions for every part of the aircraft business, from loans for new jets to selling and leasing back their spare parts.""Five years ago, there would probably be 300 or 400 people in this room. We are closing on 1,100, so clearly there is interest in this space,"" said Jeff Knittel, president of CIT Transportation and International Finance (N:CIT).'WINNERS AND LOSERS'The arrival of upgraded, more efficient airliners has sparked sales of thousands of Airbus and Boeing jets, but delegates said cheap money had helped to keep the party going.The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero for more than five years, and this month said it will keep them there for a considerable time even after it ends its historic bond-buying program, which is to be wound down soon.Debt markets are not pricing in a U.S. rate rise before the second half of 2015, but aviation financiers are beginning to think about what happens when the tide turns.""The entire economy including airlines have got very used to low interest rates and no matter how (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen manages this process, I think it is going to be difficult and there will be winners and losers,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive officer of SMBC Aviation Capital.The risks are not limited to financiers but airlines that have placed risky bets for aircraft, he said.""If it is a gradual, predictable rate of change I think we can all cope with it... If it is radical we are all going to have to put on our seat belts,"" Udvar-Hazy said.Despite recent order cancellations and instability in the Middle East and Ukraine, manufacturers and most lessors say the aircraft market itself remained strong. But they could not agree whether there was room for further growth in an industry regularly subject to external effects such as wars or epidemics.Udvar-Hazy said there was strong demand and limited availability of the industry's benchmark narrow-body jets.But Philip Scruggs, president of AerCap (N:AER), the world's second-largest lessor, said the market had reached its top.Even for those confident the jetliner market will remain strong barring an abrupt rate hike or a deepening of China's economic slowdown, there are differences over how quickly Airbus and Boeing should raise production to meet that demand.Udvar-Hazy said he was worried about their ability to keep raising output without putting further pressure on their supply chains, amid shortages of items such as galleys and seats.(Editing by Ryan Woo)"
1332,"Sep 22, 2014 06:26PM ET","Airbus, Boeing spar over jet production strategy",nan,"By Tim Hepher ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing clashed over jet production on Monday, with the European planemaker questioning the viability of its rival's proposals to hike output and Boeing insisting it will only build the number of jets that its buyers and suppliers can handle. A debate over the sustainability of record production and burgeoning orders for jetliners dominated an aviation gathering in Istanbul, where a minority of participants expressed fears of a glut while most remained confident about air transport growth. Despite the economic downturn, aircraft demand has been rising as cash-starved airlines upgrade to new fuel-saving models and emerging markets give rise to a boom in air travel. Assembly lines for narrow body jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 are running faster than ever and both the world's leading planemakers are studying plans for further increases after switching to new fuel-saving models in mid-decade. But a senior Airbus AIR.PA executive warned against a ""Field of Dreams"" strategy of raising output in the hope of spurring more sales and vowed not to chase marginal deals. ""Smooth production is critically important to the manufacturers of aircraft ... but also to those who finance the aircraft,"" Leahy told the Istat Europe air finance conference. ""Running production up and chasing after orders and then doubling back down is not necessarily the right way to go,"" he said, pointing to a chart demonstrating greater historical production volatility at Boeing, which has been around longer. Airbus says it is considering increasing production of its A320 family from 42 a month now to 46 a month in 2016. It is looking at a future increase to 50 A320 planes a month. Boeing plans to increase to 47 a month in 2017 from 42 now and last week gave its strongest signal so far that it could increase production to some 52 aircraft a month by around 2018. Airbus says it tries to avoid excessive output swings and that it has kept output more stable during the major crises of the last decade. Boeing says it responds to market forces, though it is also less constrained by Europe's labour laws. ""Are we studying a (monthly) rate (of) 50? Of course we are. Are we implementing it? Not yet. Do we have the orders for it? Of course we do. The question is when do you commit, because we want to keep that (production) line smooth,"" Leahy said. A senior Boeing BA.N official denied that there was anything speculative or risky about its production plans. ""Today we are building 42 (737-family) airplanes a month and plan to go to 47 in 2017. We see very strong demand after that, in fact we see upward pressure in rates,"" said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""We don't make those decisions unless the demand is real, unless we know we can deliver the airplanes and unless we believe we can operate at that higher rate for a substantial period of time in order for us to recognise the benefits of the higher rate as well as our supply chain,"" he told Reuters. Airbus lags Boeing in orders this year but is ahead in total orders for the latest generation of narrow body models. Boeing says the race is tied over a comparable period. Leahy said Airbus's revamped A320neo would make its keenly awaited first flight in France on Thursday, following what industry sources have described as last-minute engine concerns. By increasing production, both planemakers can free up slots for earlier delivery to customers but industry experts say they can also boost margins as they divide costs between more units. ""It's a volume game,"" a senior industry executive said. Monday's exchanges reflect rivalry over market share between the planemakers as they seek to convert thousands of orders for new versions of their best-selling jets, some of which they admit may not materialize, into deliveries that drive revenues. Airbus has appeared less willing in the past than Boeing to ride the ups and downs of a cyclical industry and says it has learned how to smooth cycles through order management. But analysts say that could also penalize it when demand is highest. ""The risk is that this would permit Boeing to harvest more volume (and hence profit and cash) at the top of the cycle, perhaps to an extent that more than compensates for the cost of the steeper declines it would suffer in a downturn,"" said Nick Cunningham at UK-based research firm Agency Partners. Over the long term, both jetmakers agree demand will rise, and Airbus is expected to issue confident forecasts this week.  (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Jason Neely and Ken Wills) "

It makes 42 a month currently. Similarly, Airbus is studying making its rival A320 plane at a rate of 50 a month, compared with 42 at present.Plueger is in the business of supplying aircraft to airlines, so greater supply can reduce profit. But he forecast robust aircraft demand, saying fears of an ""order bubble"" are not borne out by data showing long-term sustainable growth in demand for jets, despite record order backlogs at Airbus and Boeing of seven to eight years.But he said aerospace supply-chain strains are showing, something he sees as a board member of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), one of Boeing's major suppliers and also a supplier to Airbus.All aerospace suppliers, including Spirit, ""are absolutely at maximum rates right now,"" he said. Increasing production rates further ""is going to be a tremendous stress and pressure on that supply chain.""""Most suppliers are going to have to spend a good amount of capital"" to match higher output levels that Boeing and Airbus are considering. The boards of those companies ""have got to be convinced that these ramp rates are here to stay for a long period of time.""Accordingly, aircraft makers need to listen carefully to suppliers and ""not go forward with over-ambitious production rates.""Airbus Americas President Barry Eccleston said in an interview that in the last 20 years, Airbus production rates have never dropped significantly, and that suppliers have always kept up with its rate increases. ""Everybody in our supply chain should be investing, because the demand is there,"" he said.Boeing said it constantly checks the market to ""make sure our rates are in line with supply and demand.""""We are confident in our plans to increase rate and in our supply chain's ability to ramp up with us,"" spokesman Doug Alder said.(Editing by Matthew Lewis and Grant McCool)"

He is no candidate for Safran CEO,"" Rainer Ohler, Airbus Group's head of corporate communications, said on his Twitter account.Lahoud's decision to stay out of the running is unlikely to quell speculation over who might replace aerospace engineer Jean-Paul Herteman, whose mandate at the helm of state-controlled Safran expires in 2015, a year in which he turns 65.The Airbus spokesman's intervention will also be read in France as coded reinforcement of support for Lahoud from Airbus CEO Tom Enders, following sporadic rumors of a split which resurfaced recently despite regular denials.At Safran, Herteman has so far declined to comment on whether he will seek to renew his mandate, which would need a change in the age limit at the next shareholder meeting, or seek to stay on as chairman, a role he currently combines with that of CEO.La Tribune newspaper recently named four internal executives considered ripe for the top job and said the names of two external candidates were also circulating, including those of Lahoud and Pascale Sourisse, head of international development at French defense firm Thales (PA:TCFP).While Safran insists it is carrying on business as usual, industry sources say the politically sensitive succession at Safran is likely to absorb the industry in coming months and could accelerate a reshuffling of top jobs in French defense.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by James Regan)"
1337,"Sep 16, 2014 07:00AM ET",Airbus To Streamline Defense And Space Business,nan,"By Avaneesh Pandey - Airbus Group EPA:AIR, on Tuesday, announced plans to streamline the operations of its defense and space division by selling its communications business and some of its subsidiaries and to focus on its “core businesses.”“Airbus Defence and Space has defined Space (Launchers & Satellites), Military Aircraft, Missiles and related Systems and Services as its future core businesses,” Airbus, which is Europe’s largest aerospace company, said in a statement released Tuesday.Under the new plan, Airbus will sell its communications business, including its Professional Mobile Radio division as well as its commercial satellite communications service, and many of its subsidiaries and stakes in companies such as Fairchild Controls, Rostock System and Atlas Elektronik.“Given the tight budgetary situation in our home countries and increasing competition on global markets, the portfolio review is an essential element to further develop our defence and space business and to ensure its competitiveness,” Bernhard Gerwert, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, said in the statement.The assets being sold account for a combined revenue of nearly $2.5 billion, according to a Reuters report.  “I want to make clear that this is not just about cutting more jobs or closing more sites, quite the contrary,” Gerwert told Reuters. “We’re focusing on certain businesses and are looking for someone who’s willing to develop and invest in these businesses.”In December last year, Airbus had announced 5,800 job cuts at its defense operations, making it the company’s biggest layoff in over five years. The layoffs accounted for nearly 15 percent of its workforce in the defense and space division, which currently employs 40,000 people and has annual revenue of nearly $18 billion, the company said."
1338,"Sep 16, 2014 04:49AM ET",Airbus to sell off business units in defense and space review,nan,"By Sabine Siebold and Tim Hepher BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has unveiled plans to sell half a dozen businesses with combined annual revenues of around 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), simplifying its Defense and Space division to focus on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites. Announcing the results of a portfolio review, Europe's largest aerospace group signaled a break with previous efforts to diversify into security activities and a halt to investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals. Europe's defense industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back on military spending. EADS, later renamed Airbus, responded in 2012 by trying to merge with Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES), but the deal was blocked by Germany. That, coupled with the stronger-than-expected growth of its jetliner business, led Airbus to drop a previous goal of having broadly balanced revenues from its commercial and defense arms, and launch a reassessment of its defense and space activities. The group said on Tuesday it would sell its Professional Mobile Radio secure communications assets and confirmed plans to sell a 49-percent stake in submarine supplier Atlas Elektronik, unwinding two efforts at diversification embarked on nine years ago. It said it would also consider selling other commercial and non-governmental satellite communications activities. Also up for sale are systems and software company ESG, as earlier reported by Reuters, and three smaller units: U.S.-based environmental systems supplier Fairchild Controls, German cabin simulator maker Rostock System-Technik and AvDef, a small aviation company in southern France that trains fighter pilots. In early trading, Airbus Group shares were down 0.7 percent, in line with the broader European market (FTEU3). The move comes weeks after a reorganization of space launcher activities jointly with France's Safran (PA:SAF) and leaves Airbus Group's share of the Eurofighter and MBDA missile consortia, as well its own A400M airlifter, at the center of a non-jetliner portfolio focused on aeronautics and space. ""We came to the conclusion that our division must focus on the following core businesses: Space, Military Aircraft, Missiles, and related Systems and Services,"" Bernhard Gerwert, head of the Defense & Space business, said in a letter to staff. ""These are the key areas in which we will further invest to strengthen our leading position."" The shake-up is likely to test the group's prickly relations with the German government, following warnings from group Chief Executive Tom Enders about the impact of Berlin's stringent export controls on defense jobs and industrial investment. In an interview, Gerwert played down the row, however. ""I want to make clear that this is not just about cutting more jobs or closing more sites, quite the contrary,"" he told Reuters. ""We're focusing on certain businesses and are looking for someone who's willing to develop and invest in these businesses."" But he said Airbus would no longer invest in defense electronics and security, something it would need to do in order to reach a global position. The group is overshadowed by competitors including France's Thales (PA:TCFP), Europe's largest defense electronics firm. THYSSENKRUPP EXPLORES ATLAS BUYOUT Airbus paired its defense and space unit a year ago under the brand of its best-known civil planemaking unit and announced a review of assets. The division had proforma sales of 14.4 billion euros in 2013, of which electronics made up 9 percent and communications, intelligence and security had 18 percent. Gerwert said he aimed to get the first indications of interest for the units being sold by the end of the year and to complete the first disposals in the first half of 2015. It is too early to say how many jobs would be affected and there was no financial goal for the sale proceeds, he said. The sale of Atlas Elektronik puts a coveted slice of Germany's defense industry back on the market after Airbus Group, then known as EADS, fended off competition from Thales to buy the sonar maker from BAE Systems in 2005. German press reports have identified Thales or Germany's Rheinmetall (DE:RHMG) as possible suitors for the stake, but Gerwert said he would first talk to majority shareholder ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG). Asked whether a buyer was already in sight, he said: ""No, not yet. TKMS (ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems) has a stake of 51 percent (and) we're holding 49 percent, so initial talks will certainly be held with TKMS."" Asked whether a sale to a foreign party was possible, he said: ""Let me put it this way: nothing is inconceivable."" ThyssenKrupp said it was examining all options on whether to buy out its partner's stake. A spokesman for Thales declined comment on Atlas Elektronik as well as on separate reports it could bid for a railway business being sold by Italian aerospace firm Finmeccanica, as the rest of Europe's aerospace industry sheds non-core assets.

1339,"Sep 11, 2014 01:56PM ET",Airbus CEO criticizes German arms export rules,nan,"By Sabine Siebold BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief executive of aerospace and defense group Airbus (PA:AIR) criticized the German government on Thursday for its restrictive arms export policy, saying it could deter international cooperation on future defense projects. ""When it comes to defense and security policy, what the German government says and what it does are two very different things,"" Tom Enders said in a statement provided to Reuters. German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, who plans to tighten the rules on arms exports to security-sensitive areas, last month told the country's arms industry that its future lay in consolidation with European peers. However, he is reportedly skeptical about a planned tie-up of German tank and armored vehicles maker Krauss-Maffei Wegmann with French rival Nexter, instead preferring an all-German partnership between KMW and Rheinmetall (DE:RHMG). In addition, Berlin is blocking a contract for European multinational missile maker MBDA to supply Qatar with the Milan ER anti-tank missile by not giving approval for parts to be transferred from Germany to France, defense sources told Reuters. The contract hold-up was earlier reported by French daily Les Echoes. Airbus owns 37.5 percent of MBDA, and other shareholders are Finmeccanica (MI:SIFI) and BAE Systems (L:BAES). ""While there are lofty speeches being made that talk about more cooperation and consolidation in European defense, the axe is being swung at decades of Franco-German cooperation,"" Enders said. Enders, a former German defense ministry planner and paratroop reservist who has overhauled Airbus to reduce French and German state influence, has previously said tighter export rules could cost jobs in Germany. On Thursday he said that Berlin's actions could hamper progress at a European level. ""Which European government will want to work on important defense projects with Germany in the future? How can such a one-sided and populistic view help to drive forward a common European defense and security policy?"" Enders said. The German economy ministry said in response that it would continue to follow a restrictive arms export policy. ""Respecting human rights is of high importance when it comes to export decisions, irrespective of which country is the receiver. This also holds true for the export of German parts,"" it said in a statement. Germany's arms industry directly employs some 80,000 people and exports rose 24 percent to 5.85 billion euros in 2013 from 2012. The surge in exports triggered the moves by Gabriel to curb sales to states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, whose purchases had previously helped make Germany the world's third largest arms exporter. German firms have complained that Gabriel's more restrictive arms policy has already held up thousands of export permit applications and Rheinmetall has warned on profits after Germany blocked an agreed deal to sell combat simulation equipment to Russia, going beyond EU sanctions which blocked future defense contracts.

He said Ryanair intends to exercise all the options because the 200 new planes are key to achieving its target growth.Ryanair already is the largest airline in Europe, and O'Leary said the new Boeing planes will further cut Ryanair's operating costs, allowing it to take market share from legacy carriers such as Lufthansa, SAS, British Airways and Alitalia.""It means that we're going to expand and grow very strongly in Europe, both in new markets and in going in and taking traffic away from incumbent carriers,"" he said at a press conference in New York where he and Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner signed the deal.""I hope it will hasten in an era of a new price war in Europe over the next 10 years, which like all the old price wars, Ryanair will win.""O'Leary said the new planes, which will have two additional doors, will seat eight more passengers than the 737-800 models currently in Ryanair's fleet. The planes reduce fuel consumption by about 18 percent compared with current models, and with the additional seats the cost would be about 20 percent lower, O'Leary said.O'Leary said the extra seats would generate about 1 million euros of additional revenue per plane per year, most of which will go to the bottom line.Last year Ryanair placed a $15.6 billion order for 175 Boeing 737-800 jets, but O'Leary said in July he would keep that order, even as he studied the higher-density MAX version.Reuters reported on Friday that Ryanair was in advanced talks to order at least 100 MAX jetliners.Boeing shares rose 2.6 percent to $127.94. Ryanair's stock closed down 0.1 percent to 7.483 pounds.Boeing's Conner said low-cost carriers could eventually make up 35 percent of the market for single-aisle airplanes. Boeing's chief 737 competitor, Airbus Group's (PA:AIR) A320, also is getting refreshed with new engines.O'Leary said the new MAX jets would not allow Ryanair to offer transatlantic service, because the range is not sufficient to reach enough U.S. cities.Ryanair has a plan to operate a long-haul service as a subsidiary, but needs 30 to 50 long-haul aircraft to make it work.""The availability (of those jets) just isn't there for another four or five years,"" O'Leary said.(Corrects Conner's title to chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in fifth paragraph)(Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York; Additional reporting by Connor Humphries in Dublin, Ireland,; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)"

Ryanair declined to comment.On Friday, Reuters reported that Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, was in advanced talks to order at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliners, modified to include 11 extra seats, bringing total seating in the new plane up to 200.One source told Reuters the order could be for as many as 150 of the jets.A deal for 100 jets would be worth about $10.4 billion, at the 737 MAX 8's list price of $104 million, but airlines usually negotiate steep discounts, particularly on large orders.Ryanair's order, if confirmed, would mark another major win for Boeing's 737 MAX program, which has garnered 2,219 orders since its launch in 2011.A deal also would be the first MAX order by Ryanair, continuing Ryanair's reliance on an all-Boeing, single-aircraft fleet. The airline only flies the 737-800.Boeing also would further widen its lead over Airbus Group (PA:AIR) in the order tally so far this year if the deal is confirmed. At the end of August, Boeing had 1,004 total orders, and Airbus had 1,001.Boeing also leads Airbus in orders this year after adjusting for cancellations, with 941 net orders from Jan. 1 to Sept. 2, compared with 722 net orders between January and August for Airbus.Boeing's 737 MAX competes with Airbus' A320neo. Both jets are based on the companies' top selling single-aisle planes, fitted with next-generation engines that reduce fuel consumption significantly.Boeing says the MAX family will burn 16 percent less fuel than current competitors. Airbus has said its A320neo will provide similar savings.The promise of such fuel savings has spurred strong demand from airlines eager to cushion rising oil prices. The MAX family is powered with engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co (N:GE) and Safran SA (PA:SAF).The A320neo offers a choice of engines, made either by CFM or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).Ryanair's O'Leary has said he would put slightly less than 200 seats on board the modified 737 MAX jetliner that Ryanair is expected to purchase, known as the 737 MAX 8, to avoid staffing the plane with an extra flight attendant, since one is required for every 50 passengers.Last year Ryanair placed a $15.6 billion order for 175 Boeing 737-800 jets, and O'Leary said in July he would maintain that order, even as he studied a higher-density MAX version.(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Paul Simao)"

Airlines must provide one flight attendant for every 50 passengers.He offered at one point to buy planes from Chinese manufacturer Comac if they filled this requirement.Ryanair last year signed a $15.6 billion contract to buy 175 Boeing 737-800 jets, the largest single order ever placed by a European airline with Boeing, with the first of the aircraft due for delivery later this month. It later upped the order to 180.In July, O'Leary welcomed the decision to study a higher-density version of the 737 MAX and said he would maintain the order for current-generation 737.""We will take those aircraft as is, but for the next round of aircraft, (for the period) 2019 to 2025, we are looking at the 189-seat Airbus or what I hope will be a 197- to 198-seat 737,"" he was quoted as saying by Flightglobal.Ryanair has had somewhat bumpy relations with Airbus, but discussed the possibility of breaking away from Boeing as an exclusive supplier as it continues to expand, according to industry sources.

That compares with 941 net orders for Boeing from Jan. 1 to Sept. 2, after accounting for 63 cancellations.Airbus says the total of 279 cancellations it has announced this year are boosted by conversions from one product to another, as airlines hop out of the current-generation A320 single-aisle family into the newer and more efficient A320neo.It has argued Boeing will face similar pressure to convert orders when its own revamped 737 MAX approaches delivery, but some analysts have expressed concerns about the underlying level of cancellations as investors remain sensitive to any signs of weakness in recently strong demand for passenger jets.The A320neo is being readied for its first test flight with engines from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), expected in the second half of the month.August's order figures included four more upgrades from the existing A320 to the A320neo from major single-aisle customer AirAsia (KL:AIRA), bringing the total number of A320 order conversions this year to 73.Cancellations also reflect the loss of an order for 70 A350 wide-body aircraft from Emirates airline in June, though Airbus is ahead of its net order guidance for the year.International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) (L:ICAG) meanwhile ordered eight A350-900 aircraft, exercising an option for its Spanish subsidiary Iberia in August.Airbus has now reached 750 orders for its next generation of long-distance aircraft, designed to compete with Boeing's lightweight, carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner.Separately, the head of the European Aviation Safety Agency told Reuters the A350 was on schedule to receive its safety certification by the end of September. It is due to enter service with Qatar Airways by the end of the year.In its latest update, Airbus also said it had delivered 389 aircraft between January and August. Boeing delivered 461 between January and Sept. 2, including 13 787 Dreamliners, well above its target of 10 deliveries a month of the high-tech jet.For the full year, Airbus is targeting around the same number of deliveries as last year, when it delivered 626 passenger jets.

Now the Asian giant is on its way to overtaking the U.S. as the largest consumer of commercial aircraft too, led by a surge in demand for single-aisle regional jets. In its annual report on the Chinese market, Chicago-based Boeing Co. NYSE:BA projects that China will buy just over 6,000 aircraft worth $870 billion by 2033. This would represent 45 percent of the Asia-Pacific market.The report released Thursday affirms Airbus Group NV EPA:AIR’s prediction from February that Asia’s growing number of consumers with disposable incomes would boost demand for air travel and make China the world’s top consumer of commercial jets by 2030.“I don’t think we anticipated the demand in emerging economies and from low-cost carriers,” Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president, told the Financial Times. China’s air-travel market is about half that of the U.S. and Canada, but the country is seeing rising demand for regional travel and regional jets with between 90 and 230 seats.Boeing stands to benefit the most from this growth. It’s currently China’s main provider, well ahead of European archrival Airbus. Boeing says its Next Generation 737-800 and 737 MAX 8 could meet the strong demand for regional routes.China’s own aircraft manufacturing sector is struggling. State-owned Comac, the largest commercial aircraft maker, has repeatedly delayed product launches. A second assembly line for Comac’s ARJ21 regional jet won’t be operational until 2016 due to lack of tooling and parts. Avic Aircraft, a Comac subsidiary, reported last month a net loss of $22.3 billion in the first half of the year. Avic builds the C919, which competes with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320."

Industry publication Flightglobal estimates the top 50 lessors have a total fleet valued at nearly $200 billion.The global airline industry is forecast to make a profit of $18 billion in 2014, with North America alone making up half of the profit, data from the International Air Transport Association shows. The top four U.S. carriers, all the products of mergers and acquisitions, have put the sector on a sound financial footing.BOC Aviation, formed after Bank of China acquired the Singapore Airlines-backed company in 2006, had an estimated fleet value of $8.9 billion in 2013, according to Flightglobal.Japanese-owned SMBC Aviation Capital is Asia's biggest lessor, with a fleet valued at $9.4 billion.

The lessor has tapped into different types of financing, including the first offshore renminbi-denominated bonds by an aircraft lessor.This has helped it take on competition from the biggest lessors, GECAS, a unit of General Electric, and International Lease Finance Corp, now part of AerCap (N:AER).Ilya Ivashkov, a New York-based senior director at Fitch Ratings, said being part of Bank of China had helped BOC Aviation tap into various funding sources, giving the lessor an edge over some other players.Chinese banks such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398) and China Development Bank have also emerged as significant global players with their fast-growing leasing subsidiaries.Dinesh Keskar, Boeing's vice president for sales at Asia Pacific and India said airlines in India, Indonesia and China are increasingly tapping lessors to operate modern fleets, instead of making capex-heavy plane purchases.The introduction of more economic reforms in some of Asia's biggest economies will ultimately boost travel growth in the region, Martin said.""Now particularly with three reform-minded leaders in place in the three biggest countries in the region - in Indonesia, China and India, we are going to see further stimulation to traffic growth,"" he said, adding that growth in intra-Asia trade will drive demand for business travel and also boost tourism.""(Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)"

1355,"Aug 08, 2014 04:10PM ET",Exclusive: Boeing 787 output hiccups reemerge at assembly sites,nan,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing has pushed some factory work on the 787 Dreamliner to the uncovered tarmac outside its assembly plant in Washington state in an effort to keep churning out the popular plane at a rate of one every three days, according to people with knowledge of the situation.At the same time, the sources said, at least 16 Italian-made fuselage sections for the 787 have stacked up in a Boeing hangar in Wichita, Kansas, rather than being shipped directly to the factory, a sign of changes in the production process.The unusual shifts, details of which have not been previously reported, are partly a response to unfinished jobs building up as 787s move along the assembly line and partly an effort by Boeing to speed up the factories.Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said outside work is not unusual when unfinished jobs build up along the assembly line, and is not unique to the 787 line. He said the company has reduced the backlog of jobs since January, though the sources said the situation has gotten worse.The company is trying to streamline 787 production and cut costs while hitting its target of delivering a record 110 Dreamliners this year, up from 65 in 2013.Investors are counting on smooth Dreamliner production to lift Boeing's stock, which has fallen 12 percent this year on fears that production could falter as Boeing speeds up the factories and introduces new models, and that global demand for new airplanes will taper off after years of heady growth.Boeing stock was up 0.13 percent, to $119.99, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.In some sense, the production problems reflect the aerospace sector's record-setting strength. Order books at Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) are bulging, with about 10,000 planes valued at more than $700 billion combined. Both companies are speeding up output of their best-selling models.The 787, an innovative, fuel-saving long-range jet, the most popular version of which carries a list price of $257 million, has garnered 1,057 orders since it hit the market in 2004. Most are made at Boeing's factory in Everett, Washington, with a smaller line in North Charleston, South Carolina.But North Charleston also puts together midbody fuselage sections from pieces shipped by Alenia, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica (MI:SIFI). North Charleston workers install wiring and other components and ship the finished pieces to Everett or their local assembly line for final assembly.The production process did not previously involve storage of midbody section pieces in Wichita, according to the sources. Boeing sold its operations there in 2005, and has put the last of its facilities there up for sale.Boeing said the rerouted fuselages are stored for a couple of weeks in Wichita to ensure they are available when needed in North Charleston. No assembly work is being performed in Wichita, and the rerouting is due to be phased out soon, the company said.Meanwhile, the 787 assembly line still has a large volume of unfinished jobs, according to people familiar with the production.The jobs, known as ""traveled work"" because they are moved to the next part of the assembly line, surged early this year when Boeing increased 787 production to 10 a month from seven. Boeing stock dropped when the problems surfaced, and the company hired back hundreds of contract workers it had laid off to attack the problem.In May, Boeing said it had largely eliminated traveled work and gave South Carolina workers a bonus for cutting the backlog.But since then, Boeing has dispatched teams to complete installation of galleys, lavatories, seats, stowage bins and carpet while the planes are parked on the flight line, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The work is normally performed in the factory.Employees at the plant in Everett are working mandatory 10-hour days and weekends to keep up, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the company.One source said several hundred workers are assigned to the teams doing final assembly after planes have left the factory.""We've had hundreds of those guys coming to the flight line almost on a round-the-clock basis to perform all the traveled work,"" said one of the sources.Despite the problems, Boeing has met its production targets, delivering 30 787s in the latest quarter and 56 so far this year through July, including a new stretched version of the plane.""While it's not optimal, it happens on every airplane program and is certainly not unique to the 787,"" said Birtel, the Boeing spokesman.

Airbus has said its haul of orders at Farnborough marked its best ever performance at the UK's biennial aerospace event. Boeing, whose officials argue net orders are the most sensible benchmark for the fiercely contested order race between the world's largest planemakers, reported 837 gross orders and 783 net sales after cancellations between January 1 and July 29. On July 31, Boeing added an order for 40 wide-body jets from Japan's All Nippon Airways (T:9202). Airbus has added 8 wide-body orders to Iberia parent IAG (L:ICAG) since its latest monthly order sheet was compiled. In an effort to reassure investors following a rise in the number of cancellations and amid growing industry concerns over a cyclical downturn, Airbus said last week that these included conversions between models and showed no underlying weakness. It told analysts that some cancelled current-generation A320s would be replaced by orders for a revamped version of the same model, due to make its maiden flight in September. In its latest monthly order table, Airbus set out in more detail the way its order book has been evolving. It reported 44 new cancellations of its A320 model in July. Of these, 39 represented conversions between the two different models of A320, including 23 for AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and 16 for Latam Airlines Group (SN:LAN), it said in a table. However, a comparison of monthly data suggested that Latam had converted 12 aircraft and cancelled another 4. Airbus declined further comment, saying it did not discuss decisions by its customers. Airbus confirmed the cancellation of six A380 superjumbo aircraft for Japanese airline Skymark Airlines <9204.T>. The latest totals exclude 127 provisional orders for the newest version of its wide-body A330 jet, the A330neo, which was launched in Farnborough. Firm contracts are expected to be negotiated in the coming weeks and months. The latest tally included 40 out of 43 aircraft announced as additional plane orders for BOC Aviation at the air show. Of these, three had already been placed in the order book in May. On top of orders announced at the air show, Airbus reported a sale of 45 A320-family aircraft to at least one undisclosed customer. The data also showed that Australia's Qantas (AX:QAN) had cancelled five A320 aircraft. Industry sources have said that approximately that number of aircraft, assigned to Qantas unit Jetstar, have been sitting in Toulouse for some time awaiting delivery as the airline struggles to get regulatory approval for a Hong Kong venture. Airbus declined comment. Qantas was not immediately available for comment. Airbus switched to a net order target for the year with its first-half results published last week, saying net orders should exceed deliveries and that these should be around the same as the 626 deliveries seen in 2013. Airbus said it had delivered 352 planes between January and July, including 16 A380 superjumbo aircraft. In the latest period for which Boeing delivery figures are available, the U.S. planemaker handed over 342 aircraft between January and June. Boeing targets 715-725 deliveries in 2014.

But negotiators were unable to overcome differences on major sticking points and the deal was extended for four months last week.Reuters reported in February that U.S. aerospace companies were seeking permission to sell airliner parts to Iran for the first time in three decades.In April, Boeing and engine maker General Electric (N:GE) said they had received licenses from the U.S. Treasury Department to export spare partsEuropean planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) reiterated on Thursday that it had applied for a U.S. export license but said it had not yet reached an agreement with Iran on how to implement it.U.S. industry analysts say the sale of spare aircraft parts is seen as a diplomatic carrot for Iran, which for decades has relied on parts obtained on the black market or copied locally.Middle East and aviation sources said the first deal between Boeing and Iran could benefit the U.S. company if a broader softening of sanctions is agreed.Iran Air will initially need at least 100 jets if economic relations return to normal and will find it easier to do business with companies that co-operated during the current window for sanctions relief, the head of the airline told Reuters in an interview in June.Iran estimates its eventual future need for aircraft at around 400 aircraft.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Jason Neely)"

The list-price value of the six planes and the purchase rights add up to about $2.9 billion.The order for the A330neo, which will have new, more fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines, replaces an existing order for six A350XWB-800 planes, Hawaiian said.Hawaiian's A350-800 order was seen as one of the main remaining obstacles to halting the slow-selling A350-800, which Airbus wants to stop developing in favor of the revamped A330neo and the larger A350-900.Hawaiian, which also has Boeing planes in its fleet, had said earlier this month it was prepared to look at the A330neo.The airline also reported on Tuesday that strong demand and cost controls helped net income for the second quarter more than double to $27.3 million, or 43 cents a share, from $11.3 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.Adjusted for items, profit was 35 cents a share, compared with 33 cents expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly operating revenue rose about 8 percent to $575.7 million.(Reporting by Karen Jacobs in Atlanta; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)"

1366,"Jul 17, 2014 03:10AM ET",Wizz Air to keep growing as east Europeans fly more,nan,"By Marton Dunai BUDAPEST (Reuters) - When a group of Hungarian businessmen told the manager of a shabby air strip in southern Poland that they wanted it as a base for a new airline, none of them had any idea that it would quickly become the biggest low-cost carrier in eastern Europe.Wizz Air's maiden flight to London took off from Katowice in May 2004. It now has over 300 routes, annual revenues of 1 billion euros, counts Ryanair, another no-frills airline as its main competitor, and dominates air travel in a region with faster economic growth than the rest of Europe.Organic expansion in the region and as far afield as Moscow, Tel-Aviv or Dubai is set to continue while a new phase of growth is likely to come from Wizz Air exploiting the difficulties of state-backed regional airlines that are struggling to survive.""These airlines either disappear, or merge, or shrink a lot from their current size,"" said Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air chief executive and a former Procter & Gamble executive.""Either way that means opportunity for Wizz Air.""Varadi set up the airline after trying, without success, to reform Hungary's Malev. When Malev eventually collapsed in 2012 Wizz Air stepped in to pick up many of its routes and passengers.It plans a listing on the London Stock Exchange to raise money for expansion, though an offering scheduled for June this year was pulled, with the company citing unfavorable market conditions. It has said it would try again, but it is unlikely to do that this year.Wizz Air is nevertheless, well placed to pounce on other regional airlines - Poland's LOT [LT.UL], Czech Airlines, Latvia's Air Baltic, and Slovenia's Adria Airways are all propped up by state aid.LOT is especially vulnerable, with local press reports saying it is in financial difficulties and Wizz Air has many Polish-speaking flight crew and five operating bases in Poland.INDIGO INVESTMENTVaradi was in Poland with other founders of the airline looking for a base. They decided on Katowice for the first flight, which took off two weeks after seven ex-Communist states joined the European Union, giving their combined 70 million people opportunities to travel that they had never known before.At the time, less than 5 percent of people in the region flew, aviation professionals estimate, compared to nearly half of Americans.""We were near Katowice, on a cold winter morning in late 2003...We could not find the airport to save our lives. There were no signs,"" Varadi said.""The airport served 200,000 people in a year. Today it serves 2.5 million, more than half of which is us. We put that airport on the map.""The executives knew the low-cost model they had chosen could only work if they achieved an economy of scale. That meant lots of passengers, many flights and large planes to keep the costs down. They quickly started to run out of money.Then Indigo Investments, a Phoenix, Arizona-based investment group specializing in aviation, gave Wizz Air a small capital injection in the early autumn of 2004, followed by a bigger investment in February the next year.The group is headed by Bill Franke who was at one time chairman of America West Airlines and has invested in airlines including Mexico's Volaris, Florida-based Spirit, and Singapore's Tiger Air.Along with his cash, Franke shared with Wizz Air his industry expertise, procurement connections and staffing, said people familiar with the companies' cooperation.Franke declined to be interviewed for this article, and Indigo declined to comment. Niether Indigo or Wizz will say how much of the company Indigo now owns.COMPETITIONThe Eastern European low-cost market offers huge opportunities. It is expected to grow to $4.12 bln by 2018 from around $3 billion this year, according to Euromonitor International, or a growth rate of 40 percent compared to 20 percent expected in Western Europe during the same period.Wizz Air stole a march on its low-cost rivals by entering the untapped eastern European market first, but Ryanair has since caught up.When Hungary's Malev folded, Wizz Air and other airlines also increased capacity or opened new routes. Ryanair within days had opened new routes from Budapest airport, although it downscaled later over a row about airport fees.There has been speculation that mainstream European airlines would like to takeover Wizz Air, giving them access to the low-cost market in the region. Air France KLM and Lufthansa denied having any interest in Wizz, which also said it was not in takeover talks.Ryanair remains Wizz Air's fiercest competitor, with the two companies expected to entrench for an intensifying competition for share of a quickly expanding market.""Demand for aviation in Wizz Air's core region of Central/Eastern Europe is projected to grow faster than the rest of Europe, due to higher GDP growth and lower current levels of penetration of air travel,"" industry analyst CAPA said in a report in May.""Nevertheless, Wizz Air's planned increase in traffic is much faster than market growth and will require further market share gains.""Wizz Air is now in a straight fight with Ryanair to keep costs down and squeeze revenue from passengers.Their average ticket prices are nearly identical. The two airlines are fairly close to one another on the main benchmark, cost per available seat kilometer, which for each carrier is around 0.35 euro cents.Ryanair, Europe's leanest airline, does better on fuel, airport services, and the cost of the aircraft it operates, according to the Centre for Aviation, an Australian-based aviation industry consultancy.Yet Wizz Air is leaner than Ryanair in others ways, in part because its workforce is based in lower-cost eastern Europe.Varadi is confident Wizz Air's growth rates will continue.""We have produced an annual growth rate of about 15 percent in recent years and our portfolio is so diverse, we are present in so many markets, that I think we can keep that up regardless of any turbulence,"" said Varadi.($1 = 3.0386 Polish Zlotys)(Additional reporting by Gergely Szakacs in Budapest, Christian Lowe in Warsaw and Victoria Bryan in Frankfurt; editing by Anna Willard)"

The airline declined further comment.An Airbus spokesman said it expected a fix for the doors would be approved in the autumn by European safety authorities and it would then be fitted to planes rolling off the production line from 2015, with successive upgrades for planes already in service.The current plan is to do this during regular maintenance, thus meaning the planes would not be on the ground any longer than usual, he said.The planemaker has booked orders for 324 of the planes, which each have 16 doors, from 20 customers. So far, 135 have been delivered to 11 customers.Airbus said fatigue had been found on fewer than 10 percent of the more than 400 doors inspected on the A380.A380 customer Lufthansa said it was aware of the issues but hadn't experienced any problems. A spokesman said if necessary Lufthansa could keep using some old 747s to maintain service but it was not yet clear what the impact would be.(Reporting by Victoria Bryan and Tim Hepher; Additional reporting by Maria Sheahan in Frankfurt; Editing by Mark Potter and James Dalgleish)"

Many suppliers to the world's biggest plane maker also beat the market.But as indexes pushed higher this year, investors sent Boeing down 5.7 percent amid concern that the aviation business cycle may have peaked and that Boeing's ability to produce positive surprises is limited. Suppliers also suffered.For the stock to rise, Boeing needs to notch up profit margins on jetliners, run its factories smoothly, and win price cuts from suppliers. It also must keep booking orders.Last month, Dubai-based airline Emirates canceled a $16 billion deal for Airbus Group NV's (PA:AIR) new A350. More cancellations could spook investors and ripple down to suppliers such as Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), Precision Castparts Corp (N:PCP) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON).Boeing is considered on track to deliver a record 715 to 725 jetliners this year, having delivered 342 in the first half. But hiccups in 787 Dreamliner production this year suggest Boeing may struggle to keep its promise to make jets even faster.""They need to continue to crank 787s out and get cash flow on them,"" said Jim Reed, co-manager of the Global Equity Fund at Scout Investments, in Kansas City, Missouri, which holds about $185,000 worth of Boeing stock.""And they need to move from producing 10 787s a month to 12 a month, like they say they're going to do"" by mid-2016.GREEDY FOR ORDERSAt the Farnborough International Airshow, Boeing had booked 70 orders as of Tuesday, adding $11 billion to its record backlog. That is down from 260 deals worth $34 billion at the Paris Airshow last year. Boeing's orders are 12 percent lower this year through May than a year ago.""Orders are one of those things you want to be greedy on,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, a money management firm in Suffern, New York, with about $1 million invested in Boeing.As well, many Farnborough orders came from lessors, not airlines, underscoring concerns about a possible bubble in plane production and a recent spate of airline profit warnings.Still, profits at plane makers and suppliers have soared 65 percent since 2007, said Eric Kronenberg, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.He expects profits to keep climbing. Boeing is squeezing suppliers to cut costs and widen its margins. But suppliers will streamline their factories to avoid cutting their own profits, Kronenberg said.Boeing's jetliner operating profit margin hit 11.8 percent in the first quarter, its highest level in a year. Investors want it to beat that number when it reports next Wednesday.But even a good performance may not galvanize investors.""A lot of the good news for Boeing is already out there,"" said Catherine Avery, chief executive officer of CAIM LLC, a money manager in New Canaan, Connecticut.She sold Boeing in late 2013, capturing the 80 percent rise.To buy again, she wants ""some sort of indication that there's going to be a much stronger trend for order growth,"" she said. ""And I'd like to see how things go with their production.""(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"
1370,"Jul 16, 2014 07:30AM ET","Airbus, Boeing climb close to $100 billion in air show deals",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Victoria Bryan FARNBOROUGH England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) climbed close to the $100 billion mark for plane deals at the Farnborough Airshow on Wednesday, demonstrating demand for new passenger jets despite concerns raised by their already record full order books. Recent profits warnings from airlines such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) have stoked fears of a sharp slowdown in demand for new aircraft or even cancellations. However, shares in Airbus closed down 2.5 percent after the company told analysts it may have to cut output of its best-selling twin-aisle A330 passenger jet to get through a three-year transition toward an upgraded model launched at the show. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier acknowledged on Monday that his company's demand forecast implied that average production over the expected lifespan of the revamped jet project would be lower than the current 10 a month. Airbus gave further indications to analysts at a meeting on Wednesday that production would slip, participants said. Reflecting the flurry of activity in the first three days of the show, the biennial event has already outsold the 2012 show, which saw $72 billion of orders and commitments. The tally hit $135 billion at last year's Paris Airshow. Such deals range for provisional letters of intent to firm orders, and can include the announcement of transactions that may have been listed in order books to unidentified buyers. Europe's Airbus has racked up over $60 billion in orders and commitments, boosted by demand for its re-engined and more fuel-efficient A330. However, its U.S. rival fought back on Wednesday. BIG DEALS Gulf carrier Qatar Airways finalised a $19 billion order for 50 Boeing 777-9 X planes and added options to buy a further 50, potentially doubling the size of the deal. China's Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) also announced plans to order 50 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes worth $5.1 billion at list prices. Prior to the air show, Boeing had a comfortable lead in orders over Airbus this year, with 649 net orders as of July 8 versus 290 for Airbus. Late in the day, Airbus sought to reassure participants after a German broadcaster reported the planemaker's plans to upgrade the doors on its A380 superjumbo could mean the program breaking even later than expected. A spokesman said Airbus was testing improvements to the doors after incidents mainly involving noise during flights and that it expected the upgrade to be approved in the autumn, and fitted to all planes rolling off the production line from 2015. He said it was unclear how much the upgrade would cost but that Airbus was ""well on track"" to reach breakeven on the A380 in 2015, as planned. Also on Wednesday, Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) reached the 500 mark for deals for its Q400 turboprop model and for its CSeries airliner, as it announced three contracts involving 20 aircraft.

Airbus (PA:AIR) and AirAsia declined comment.Airline deals have been few and far between at the world's largest showcase event, which coincides with growing concern about overcapacity and a string of airline profit warnings.But leasing companies are putting their faith in steadily growing aviation traffic especially in Asia.""We do see this as growing our business over the next 10 years,"" SMBC Chief Executive Peter Barrett told journalists.MARKET SHAREThe air show has, however, brought renewed evidence of a battle for market share between Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) over sales of narrowbody jets, the backbone of most medium-haul networks.It comes hard on the heels of two closely watched domestic contests in the UK where Monarch Airlines handed Boeing a critical win by dropping current supplier Airbus, while British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) stuck with Airbus after another duel.But the star of the civil side of the show remained an aircraft that Airbus had not expected to make until recently - a revamped version of its A330 long-haul jet that Airbus says will be able to compete with the much newer Boeing 787 Dreamliner.Airbus extended the provisional order book to 55 of the new aircraft on Tuesday and was expected to bring the total for the air show above 100 with the imminent announcement from AirAsia.Boeing has criticized Airbus's latest model as a rehash of tired metallic technology compared with its carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner, which also gathered new orders on Tuesday.But Airbus and a trio of leasing company buyers said the A330 still made sense for airlines that do not need the full range capability of the 787 or its own A350, even though the smallest member of the A350 family is now sure to be axed.The defense side of the show remained locked in suspense over the arrival of America's newest combat jet, the Lockheed Martin (N:LMT) F-35.The radar-evading jet missed its Farnborough debut on Monday after being grounded due to an engine fire, but U.S. military officials have approved a limited flight clearance along with engine inspections, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said Washington still hoped the F-35 could fly at the show.(Editing by Mark Potter)"

Its American rival, Boeing, announced a deal with Air Lease Corporation, or ALC, for 26 aircraft worth $3.9 billion. On the first day of the industry event, Airbus signed deals reportedly worth nearly $21 billion, while Boeing bagged orders worth $7.7 billion.With Tuesday’s deal, SMBC’s total orders for Airbus aircraft now stands at 206 planes while BOC has so far ordered a total of 255 Airbus aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing’s deal with ALC of Los Angeles consists of six orders for the extended range version of the 777-300 and a confirmation of its order for 20 737s. Both companies reportedly signed several deals with airline companies and lessors at the air show.The deal with SMBC is a sign of the company's growing supplier base in Japan, John Leahy, chief operating officer of Airbus' customer division, said, in a statement Tuesday.Airbus, which has led Boeing in terms of order size at the air show, has faced 225 order cancellations so far this year while Boeing has seen only 54 orders being cancelled. Airbus also came in for criticism Monday from Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, who said he was disappointed with the delays caused by Airbus in delivering new planes to buyers.“I’m very angry because this is making an impact on our expansion plans,” Baker said, according to Bloomberg, referring to the airline's plans of deploying its first A380 in June, adding: “It is their problem because they are not keeping their costs under control.”ALC, which put in an order for 60 A321neo aircraft, also signed a deal Monday with Airbus for a newer, upgraded version of the 20-year-old A330 aircraft.

""I feel comfortable that we have the right machine in every single market segment.""Airbus kicked off the Farnborough Airshow with confirmation it would sell revamped versions of its A330 wide-body jet powered by Rolls-Royce (L:RR) Trent 7000 engines and offering 14 percent fuel savings.The revamp looks set to intensify the contest between the two planemakers for up to $250 billion of orders at the core of the long-haul jet market.The upgraded A330, called an A330neo, is Airbus's attempt to prolong the life of its profitable twin-aisle jet, as the European company tries to preserve market share against Boeing's much newer 787 Dreamliner.Analysts said Airbus's revamp plan followed poor sales of its A350-800 - the minnow of the next-generation A350 family - whose development looks set to be halted or suspended as a result.""I congratulate them on making that decision, on moving away from the A350-800 which is, what, they essentially, I guess are doing, and going back to the kind of re-engine scenario that they had in 2004, but there's no way their plane is much better than ours,"" Conner said.Both Boeing and Airbus have clashed over the weight and efficiency of their jets in the 250- to 300-seat segment of the jetliner market.Conner championed the efficiency of Boeing's 787 family of aircraft, saying that higher performance meant the contest was not just about purchase price, as he defended Boeing's offering against the cheaper A330neo.""I don't really care what is said, this is really the most efficient airplane family around,"" he said of the 787 group of aircraft.Air Lease Corp, which on Monday became the launch customer for the A330neo, said the only way Boeing could respond was by making 787-9 production costs more efficient, and delivering more flexibility to the operators that do not require all of the payload range capability of the 787-9.""I don't believe they can close the pricing gap because the A330 is a mature program, most of the development costs have already been absorbed and it's a relatively minor step up compared to building a new airplane,"" Air Lease Chairman and Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy said at the show.Boeing's Conner also said that the company expected demand for cargo aircraft to pick up as he gave an upbeat assessment of future demand for planes.Boeing, Conner added, is in talks with Dubai's Emirates carrier regarding its 747-8 aircraft.""We're still in discussions with Emirates today. That's going to go on for a while I'm sure so I can't say that we're close, I can't say that we're far away.

The jet, dubbed the A330neo, would be a revamped version of Airbus' twin-aisle A330 jetliner with new efficient engines made by Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC.  SMALL WONDERS   Boeing's annual forecast, released in conjunction with the airshow, said single-aisle airplanes such as the 737 and A320 will garner the most orders, reflecting booming demand for air travel in Asia and the growth of low-cost carriers there.  Last year Boeing predicted a 20-year need for 35,280 planes valued at $4.8 trillion.   About 40 percent of single-aisle planes built in the next two decades will go to low-cost carriers, and a large share of will be in China, Tinseth said. He predicted China would overtake the United States as the world's largest domestic air travel market in the next 20 years.  Twin-aisle planes also will attract strong demand. But Boeing notched back its forecast for jumbo jets such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. It expects airlines to need about 620 of those over the next 20 years, down from the 760 it forecast last year.   ""That's the market that has really struggled to take hold,"" Tinseth said.   Boeing expects airlines to buy 25,680 new single-aisle planes over 20 years, and that the global fleet will double to 42,180. About 58 percent of those planes will represent growth at airlines. The rest will replace retired aircraft.   Boeing cut its forecast for air-cargo growth this year to 4.7 percent from 5 percent in 2013, but said the trend is stable and will continue to support production of the 747-8 freighter and freight versions of its popular 777 jet.   (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in London; Editing by Richard Chang)"

Still, the company seems to be securing at least two buyers, the sources.The Airbus Group board hasn't given the official green light to begin marketing the airliner, but it's prepared to.This week, the Franco-German company downplayed the possibility of a quick launch -- considered somewhat of an effort to protect itself if an announcement didn't end up materializing, Reuters noted.The wire service said that the Airbus board could discuss the matter on the night of its July 30 half-yearly results.""I think the A330neo will be launched at Farnborough, and if not, it won't be long in coming,"" said a senior industry source.Future clients could include Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which is shopping for as many as 50 jets, and Airasia (KL:AIRA), which is seeking an A330 upgrade, as well as lessors that have expressed support including Air Lease Corp (NYSE:AL) and CIT, Reuters added.Delta is widely considered most likely to weigh bids from Airbus and rival Boeing later this year.In June, Reuters reported that Airbus was poised to launch the new version of  the A330 with Rolls-Royce as sole engine supplier, but subject to approval from the company's board.The aircraft will be offered in two versions similar to the two current 253-seat and 295-seat models and offer some 14-15 percent increased efficiency than the existing model.Airbus traditionally makes air show headlines but is aware of the pitfalls of launching without an order, having launched a regional version of the same airplane in China last year."

In a trio of European newspaper interviews published on Tuesday, Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the flagship division of Airbus Group (PA:AIR), said there were predictions of strong demand for an enhanced version of the A330. The possibility is ""growing every day"" that Airbus will go ahead with the so-called ""A330neo"", though not necessarily at next week's Farnborough Airshow, he told the Financial Times. The newspaper quoted him as saying it might be possible to sell more than 1,000 of the revamped aircraft. Airbus has drawn up plans to revamp its biggest-selling wide-body passenger jet to preserve a second front in its competition with the delayed Boeing 787 Dreamliner (N:BA) while it prepares to introduce the A350. It said over the weekend it had not decided whether it would launch the A330neo at the July 14-20 air show. Interviewed by France's Les Echos, Bregier said the industry's largest showcase event fell ""a bit early"" to finalize the project and that launching it there is ""not an objective"". Industry sources have said the definition of the 250-300 seat jet is broadly complete, notably the selection of Rolls-Royce (L:RR) as sole engine supplier for the aircraft, which would offer new wingtips and fuel savings of 14-15 percent. Bregier has been seen as cautious about the roughly $2 billion project as Airbus faces challenging increases in production elsewhere, but has been progressively more enthusiastic in public since the Berlin Airshow in May. In a separate interview with German daily Handelsblatt, Bregier repeated that Airbus would make an announcement by the end of the year should it decide not to launch the A330neo. Bregier also called on the European Central Bank to take steps to devalue the common European currency to help exporters who are being hit by a strong euro. ""It should do what the Japanese did last year and what the Americans have been doing the whole time... It is not fate that the euro shoots through the roof while the American and Japanese use their currencies to support industry,"" he told Handelsblatt. ""I am not talking about a huge devaluation, I am talking about 10 percent,"" Bregier said, adding that all European exporters would be fine at an exchange rate of $1.20 to $1.25 while currently the rate is about $1.36.

In Europe there are 10,0000 and in the U.S. there are 12,000. Therefore the market potential for helicopters in China is huge,"" he said in a telephone interview.China currently buys about 50 helicopters a year out of an annual global market for 800 civilian helicopters, according to estimates by Airbus Helicopters, formerly known as Eurocopter.By 2020, its purchases are expected to quadruple to 200 a year and by then, instead of 6-7 percent of the global market, it is expected to make up 20 percent of demand, Faury said.""This means a significant shift in the market and we will of course be open to opportunities to keep investing in China and to continue to be present, not only commercially but industrially, as the market continues to flourish,"" Faury said.Airbus Helicopters, part of the Franco-German Airbus Group (PA:AIR), co-operates with China's industry on two programs, the EC120 light helicopter and EC175 medium helicopter.The world's largest civil helicopter maker has a market share of 40 percent in China but expects this to rise as the country's buyers prioritize light single-engined and light twin-engined rotorcraft - two segments in which it has most sales.Airbus Helicopters is initially targeting a Chinese market share of 50 percent, Faury said. But it is seen as facing stiff competition from Anglo-Italian rival AgustaWestland (MI:SIFI) and U.S. Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies (N:UTX).China could also be ready to build its own civil helicopter from scratch by the end of the decade, Western experts say, as it seeks to strengthen its bid to become a new aviation power.In other aviation business during Merkel's visit, Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) and China's flag carrier, Air China Ltd (SS:601111), signed a provisional deal to expand their partnership ahead of a possible commercial joint venture.The two Star Alliance members also said they were working to offer better flight connections, particularly on China-Europe routes, and expand collaboration in maintenance and services.But planemaker Airbus did not announce jet orders, as some in the industry had predicted, and the expected purchase of dozens of A320-family jets could now be postponed until further contacts between German and Chinese officials in October.(Reporting by Andreas Rinke and Fang Yan in BEIJING; Editing by Paul Tait, Matt Driskill and David Evans)"
1384,"Jul 07, 2014 10:38AM ET",Merkel says U.S spying allegations are serious,nan,"By Andreas Rinke BEIJING (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday allegations that a German man had worked as a double agent for U.S. intelligence were serious and, if true, were a clear contradiction of what cooperation between partners is supposed to be about. The case risks further straining ties with Washington, which have been sorely tested by revelations last year of large-scale snooping on Germany by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). ""If the reports are correct it would be a serious case,""Merkel told a news conference in Beijing, standing next to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. ""If the allegations are true, it would be for me a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners."" The White House and State Department have so far declined to comment on the arrest of a 31-year-old employee of Germany's BND foreign intelligence agency. According to intelligence and political sources, the man admits passing documents to a U.S. contact. Those include information about a parliamentary committee looking into allegations by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden that Washington carried out major surveillance in Germany, including monitoring Merkel's phone.  SUSPICIONS German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was on a trip to Mongolia while Merkel was in China, said the spying case would have consequences if the circumstances are confirmed. ""We haven't finished clearing this up yet. But if suspicions are confirmed that American secret services were involved, it will become a political issue and we can't just get back to business as usual,"" he told reporters in Ulan Bator. Surveillance is a sensitive issue in a country where memories of the Nazi's Gestapo secret police and communist East Germany's Stasi ensure the right to privacy is treasured. Speaking in Berlin, Snowden's lawyer in Germany, Wolfgang Kaleck, said he hoped the latest allegations might eventually help change Germany's stance towards his client, noting that European states had profited from his information but were not prepared to protect him.  As Merkel visited China, where she oversaw the signing of agreements involving Airbus Group NV's helicopter division selling 100 aircraft to Chinese companies, a German intelligence chief warned that some firms in China faced a growing threat from industrial espionage by Chinese government agencies with huge resources. ""Germany is against that - regardless of where it comes from,"" Merkel said, in reference to industrial espionage.  ""We have a duty as the state to protect our economy ... We are for the protection of intellectual property."" China's premier repeated his government's denial that it was involved in such activities. ""China and Germany, it can be said, are both victims of hacking attacks. The Chinese government resolutely opposes hacking attacks as well as the use of the internet to steal commercial secrets or intellectual property,"" Li said. ""China will engage in dialogue and consultation to protect the security of the Internet.""

1386,"Jul 05, 2014 04:00AM ET",Airbus says 'jury still out' on A330neo airshow launch,nan,"By Ingrid Melander and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier AIX-EN-PROVENCE France (Reuters) - Airbus Group has not decided whether it will launch its proposed A330neo jet at this month's Farnborough Airshow but is confident about the outlook for plane orders at the gala event, its strategy chief Marwan Lahoud said on Saturday. Airbus has drawn up plans to revamp its biggest-selling wide-body passenger jet to preserve a second front in its competition with the delayed Boeing 787 Dreamliner in addition to the new A350. Lahoud said ""the jury is still out"" on whether the A330neo, a more efficient version of the 20-year-old A330 jet, would be launched at the July 14-20 airshow.  ""The subject is still being discussed,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of an economic conference in southern France. People familiar with the matter say technical work on the project, based on a Rolls-Royce engine and new wingtips, is complete and that barring surprises, the $2 billion revamp will go ahead soon, subject to board approval. There will be two versions - upgrades of both types of A330, the 253-seat A330-200 and the 295-seat A330-300.  The board could discuss the issue before the airshow or at its next regular meeting tied to July 30 half-year results. The project has already led to a war of words between Airbus and Boeing that is expected to spill over to the world's largest aviation event, held each summer in the English town of Farnborough or in Paris - in alternate years. The two companies are involved in a strategic chess game at the lower end of the market for long-haul jets, with tens of billions of dollars' worth of business at stake. However there are concerns that the arrival of the A330neo could spark aggressive price competition for new orders. Airbus has said the A330neo would have the same ""cash operating costs"" and cost much less to buy than the Boeing 787-9, Boeing's latest model due to make its debut at Farnborough. Boeing disputes these assertions as well as Airbus's forecasts of more than 1,000 potential sales for the A330neo.  Lahoud said he was optimistic about the overall outlook for aircraft deals at the Farnborough Airshow.  Asked how many orders he expected, he said: ""We believe we'll have a good business dynamic ... we are pretty confident."" Airbus ended the first half of the year behind its U.S. rival in orders and deliveries, but is widely expected to unveil hundreds of new orders in Farnborough. Boeing, however, looks set to strike a blow against Airbus in its European home territory by convincing UK-based Monarch Airlines to switch suppliers as the two planemakers wage a global battle for market share for single-aisle jets like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Lahoud said Airbus Group would continue boosting the amount of raw materials and components it buys in dollars to offset the currency's weakness. It has offered some customers the chance to pay for aircraft in euros. ""It is their decision,"" he added. Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm meanwhile told German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung most currency risks were hedged for the next 2-3 years. The company's guidance, based on a euro worth $1.35, ""is not at risk"" from currency swings, he said. He reaffirmed plans for the A380 to break even next year.

The service, called Mint, includes some private suites with doors that close, tapas-style food and amenity kits. The seats are located at the front of the plane.""We think it's going to ramp up pretty quickly to profitability,"" JetBlue President Robin Hayes said in an interview on Tuesday. ""We're booking weeks out and almost every flight is going out full and we continue to see that trend into the July timeframe.""The Airbus A321 planes with the service have 16 fully lie-flat seats. JetBlue plans the service on flights between New York's John F. Kennedy airport and San Francisco starting Oct. 26.Hayes said JetBlue could expand Mint to other routes over time.JetBlue launched Mint in response to customers who said they were skipping the carrier on cross-country flights because it did not offer premium seating. The seats, which recline to convert into flat beds, are initially priced from $599 to $999 one way. Hayes said the average fare was likely to rise but declined to give a timeframe.The new seats debut as New York-based JetBlue faces pressure to improve revenue and hold down costs. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group have also upgraded seating on coast-to-coast routes.Shares of JetBlue closed up 1.2 percent on Tuesday at $10.98, just below a year high of $11.12 reached on Monday. JetBlue's stock has risen about 28 percent this year, while Delta and low-cost provider Spirit Airlines have seen their shares rise about 46 percent and 39 percent, respectively, year to date.JetBlue ""has a good product, it's just that in a very price sensitive industry they need to figure out how to monetize it better,"" said Savanthi Syth, an airline analyst with Raymond James. Syth said she expects Mint to add six or seven cents in earnings per share to JetBlue.""It's not big enough to make a big difference to earnings but we think it will be a positive product,"" she added.Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a May 16 note that Mint could be ""earnings negative,"" since one Mint seat takes up space of three coach seats.Hayes, who was named JetBlue president late last year, said the carrier was working with Datalex PLC on a new Web-based merchandising platform to be rolled out in the second half that will enable it to offer in-plane products.""We've been making a lot of the investments in the last two to three years that allow us to monetize and develop new products and services for customers which will absolutely grow our ancillary revenue stream,"" Hayes said.(Reporting by Karen Jacobs in Atlanta; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

The A320neo is due to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2015 and flight testing of the plane is due to start in September 2014, Airbus said.The American order is significant in part because the carrier has options for additional A320neos. The orders are part of American's landmark firm order for 460 Airbus and Boeing planes, placed in July 2011.The 2011 American deal forced Boeing to follow Airbus' strategy of putting new engines on the stalwart A320.

1390,"Jun 30, 2014 06:38PM ET",Boeing delivers first 787-9 to Air New Zealand,nan,"By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N:BA) contractually delivered its first 787-9 to Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) on Monday, allowing Boeing to book the delivery of the new, stretched Dreamliner in its second-quarter results. Delivery of the 787-9, the latest of Boeing's carbon-composite aircraft, marks a major milestone for Boeing, showing the company's ability to move rapidly and on schedule through design, fabrication and testing. Boeing has said for months that it would deliver the first 787-9 around mid-year, and it hit that date precisely on Monday. ""Boeing is proud to have contractually delivered the first 787-9 Dreamliner to Air New Zealand,"" spokesman Doug Alder said. The Dreamliner uses lightweight plastic construction and a newly developed electrical system to replace heavier metal systems on older planes. Coupled with new engines produced by General Electric (N:GE) and Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) it offers 20 percent fuel reduction over existing, similar-sized aircraft. Boeing struggled with early production of the smaller 787-8, and a number of those jets required extensive reworking and modification. The Dreamliner also has had problems with lithium-ion batteries that grounded the fleet for more than three months last year and required extensive modification of the battery system. The 787-9 incorporates all of those changes along with a fuselage that is about 20 feet longer than the 787-8. The ""dash nine"" carries 38 more passengers than its predecessor, up to 280, in a typical three-class configuration, with a range of about 8,300 nautical miles, about 450 miles more than the 787-8. The plane got Federal Aviation Administration approval in June, including the ability to operate extended operations (ETOPS) flights up to 5-1/2 hours away from a diversion airport, enabling it to fly certain long-range routes. Boeing has said the 787-9 includes numerous refinements over the earlier model, including a laminar flow control system on the tail that helps reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. A longer Dreamliner, the 787-10, that seats up to 323 passengers, was launched last year and is due for first delivery in 2018. Air New Zealand said it plans to take physical delivery of its new 787-9, painted with a striking black livery, on July 9 and fly it away from Seattle on July 10. The plane is due to enter service with the airline on Oct. 15, likely after All Nippon Airways (T:9202) begins service with 787-9s that are due for delivery in July. ANA already operates the smaller 787-8, and so requires less flight training to fly the bigger version. Boeing has sold the 787-9 to 25 customers, including American Airlines (O:AAL), British Airways (L:ICAG), Japan Airlines <9201.T> Air France (PA:AIRF) and Air Canada (TO:ACb).

Air Astana, which is 49 percent owned by British defense firm BAE Systems (LONDON:BAES), could consider buying a revived version of the 757 from Boeing later once that lease expires around 2024, about the time Boeing could have a successor to the 757. Boeing has been studying the viability of bringing back a single-aisle twin-engine 200-passenger jet that can fill a niche between its smaller 737 and its twin-aisle planes like the 767. The mid-sized narrow-body 757 first entered production in 1981 to serve short and mid-range routes. British Airways bought the first batch and began using them in 1983. The aircraft did well through the '90s, but by the end of the century carriers facing intense competition for regional service had shifted toward the smaller Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to save fuel costs and reduce the number of empty seats that dig into profitability.The eight-month economic recession in 2001 put more pressure on carriers to cut costs, and Boeing built its last 757 in Wichita, Kansas, in 2004. At the time, the 757 was only one of five Boeing airplane models to top 1,000 deliveries. Boeing made 1,050 of them."

The first A350 is due to be delivered to Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of this year.""We are confident that we will sell the (production) slots in the coming months,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""There's no impact on the programme as deliveries were scheduled to start at the end of the decade.""Airbus (XETRA:AIRG) shares were down 3.3 pct in early trading in Frankfurt, with the news expected to cast a shadow over two days of briefings for the media at Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse on Wednesday and Thursday.Emirates has been pushing for Airbus to upgrade the A380 superjumbo with a more efficient engine, after increasing its total orders for the world's biggest passenger jet by 50 in November to 140 planes.The carrier's chief executive, Tim Clark, said earlier this month that a revamped A380 could have a 10-12 percent performance improvement and that ""we are hoping to move on that pretty soon"".Emirates is also in the process of firming up an order for 150 of Boeing's latest jetliner, the 777X mini-jumbo, of which Emirates has ordered 150 worth $76 billion at list prices.Asked about the A350 order cancellation on Wednesday, an Emirates spokesman said: ""The contract which we signed in 2007 for 70 A350 aircraft has lapsed. We are reviewing our fleet requirements.""Airbus said in a statement that it remained ""very confident"" in the A350 program and that it expected the A350 order book to grow in 2014.Britain's Rolls-Royce, which is the sole engine maker for the A350, said the Emirates decision would result in a 2.6 billion pound ($4.4 billion) hit to its order book.""While disappointed with this decision, we are confident that the delivery slots which start towards the end of this decade vacated by Emirates will be taken up by other airlines,"" Rolls-Royce said in a statement."

Monday following a dismal week, as the European Central Bank's
move to buy Spanish and Italian bonds to halt contagion from the
euro zone debt crisis offset the U.S. credit downgrade by S&P.	 The Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Banks index
 , which plummeted 14 percent last week, surged
5.2 percent in early trade, with Banco Popolare up 8.7
percent and UniCredit up 6.6 percent.	 The European Central Bank said on Sunday it would ""actively
implement"" its bond-buying programme, signalling it would buy
Spanish and Italian government bonds to stem contagion from the
euro zone debt crisis. 	 ""There's a bit of relief from the ECB using heavy artillery.
It might save the day, but problems aren't solved in the long
term,"" a Paris-based trader said.	 At 0837 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was down 0.4 percent at 971.47 points, while the
euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index gained 0.7
percent at 2,391.69 points.	 Spanish and Italian government bond yields retreated, with
traders saying the central bank had stepped up its programme of
bond purchases to include debt issued by Italy and Spain,
boosting the euro currency .	 But cyclical stocks such as miners and industrials lost
ground as investors fretted about the impact of the U.S. credit
downgrade on global growth.	 Rio Tinto fell 2.1 percent, Siemens 
dropped 1.1 percent and Airbus parent EADS sank 2.9
percent, also hit by the stronger euro.	 Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.2
percent, Germany's DAX index down 0.8 percent, and
France's CAC 40 down 0.2 percent.	 ""European indexes have broken below key support levels on
Friday, and all eyes are now on the S&P 500. It hasn't yet hit
the target of 1,150 points stemming from its recent triple top,
so I would sell into today's rebound,"" said Valerie Gastaldy,
head of Paris-based technical analysis firm Day By Day.	 ""It may take a few days before the S&P 500 hits the target,
but it should come.""	 The slide in European banking shares since February has
dragged bank valuation ratios to levels not seen since the heat
of the financial crisis in early 2009.	 The beaten-down STOXX bank index trades at 7.7 times
12-month forward earnings, below a 10-year average of 10.9,
while the average price-to-book ratio has fallen to 0.76, versus
a 10-year average of 1.38.

Thursday, with a key index of blue chip companies from the euro
zone dropping to a two-year low, as investors dumped equities
across the board in response to sluggish global growth and
Italy's debt troubles.	 Banking stocks were hammered, with Barclays losing
7.8 percent, UBS down 6.4 percent and UniCredit
 down 9.33 percent.	 Mining and industrials stocks, which had shown resilience
over the past few months while the broad market drifted lower,
took a serious beating, with global miner Xstrata 
dropping 8.5 percent and Airbus maker EADS sinking 6.1
percent. Carmaker Fiat ended down 10 percent.     	  The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index
fell 3.3 percent to 2,414.97 points, its lowest since mid-2009.	  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
closed 3.3 percent lower at 993.35 points, plunging below the
1,000 mark for the first time in 12 months.	 ""The fact is: we don't see big volumes in the options market
with people buying protection. Investors are massively getting
out of stocks, period. And it might take a while before they
come back,"" said Jean-Yves Dumont, head of asset allocation
strategy and funds, Dexia Asset Management.	 ""People are realising that the peripheral euro zone crisis
hasn't been properly addressed yet, and today's European Central
Bank press conference has done nothing to reassure the market.
We're facing the risk of another confidence crisis like the one
we got when Lehman collapsed."" 	 The buying of Portuguese and Irish bonds by the European
Central Bank on Thursday did little to ease the fears about the
health of the euro zone, with the Italian 10-year government
bond yield premium over German benchmarks rising to a euro
lifetime high. 	  MASSIVE WIPEOUT	 The sell-off in European equities this week has wiped more
than 400 billion euros ($566 billion) off the market
capitalisation of German, British, French, Italian, Spanish and
Dutch blue-chips indexes.	 This is bigger than Switzerland's GDP last year and almost
the size of the 440 billion euro capacity of the rescue fund set
up by the European Union.	 The euro zone's main benchmark indexes, including the
industrials-heavy DAX have fallen between 8 and 11
percent so far this week, on track to post their worst weekly
losses since May 2010.	 On Thursday, Italy's blue chip FTSE MIB ended down
5.16 percent, according to Reuters data, its lowest close since
April 2009.	 The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index , Europe's main
barometer of anxiety known as the VSTOXX index, surged 17
percent to a near-five month high at 34.6, but remained well
bellow a peak of 54.6 hit in May 2010 during the first wave of
the Greek crisis.	 The VSTOXX could continue to surge, said Valerie Gastaldy,
head of Paris-based technical analysis firm Day By Day.	 ""Implied volatilities have been very quiet in recent months,
despite the intense agitation of equity markets. Inter-market
arbitrages are clearly under way: between the CDS, bonds and
equities, and especially on the Euro STOXX 50,"" she said.	 ""Some argue that the relative calm (of the VSTOXX) is due to
arbitrage. But people forget that in arbitrage, nothing is
stable when the markets shift, especially in volatility
arbitrage. The Euro STOXX 50 breaking below the major support of
2495 points would unbalance the books.""

weighed down by hawkish comments from European Central Bank
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet on the peripheral euro zone
sovereign debt crisis, plus a rise in U.S. inflation to a 2-1/2
year high in April. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
shares closed down 0.4 percent at 1,140.53 points, giving back
earlier gains after strong German and French GDP numbers had
more than offset weaker numbers in parts of the periphery.
[ID:nLDE74C1FL] Volume was 98.3 percent of its 90-day average. Trichet's comments, however, ""urged Greece"" to stick to its
reform plan and reiterated the view that the country should not
restructure its debt. [ID:nMDT009923] Most traders, though, believe Greece will have to
restructure its debt, particularly as Trichet's comments on
inflation pointed to the potential for further interest rate
rises, which could worsen Greece's debt problems and hit
markets. ""Trichet speeches over the past couple months have indicated
a more hawkish stance,"" Veronika Pechlaner, a manager on the 100
million euro ($144 million) Ashburton European equity fund said.
She added: ""The majority of the market is expecting some sort of
Greek debt restructuring."" Banks featured among the worst performers, with the STOXX
Europe 600 Banks index  down 1 percent. Commerzbank
 and Dexia  which both have exposure to Greek
bonds were down 3.3 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. The broader markets slipped on the euro zone peripheral
concerns, with the FTSE 100  index down 0.3 percent,
Germany's DAX  0.6 percent lower and France's CAC 40
 down 0.1 percent. The Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone index 
extended earlier losses, down 1.8 percent. Traders were also concerned that the differing GDP numbers
between the euro zone peripheries and core Europe could make it
more difficult for these debt-laden countries to deal with their
problems if interest rates were increased. ""Today's data is more evidence that shows big trouble in the
European Union, and the European Central Bank will have a
difficult task in choosing a policy that fits all,"" said Daniel
Pingarron, market analyst at IG Markets. Also impacting the markets, was a fall on Wall Street after
U.S. April CPI data came in line with expectations, but was
still at a 2-1/2 year high, prompting traders to remain cautious
about the inflation outlook.
 STRONG EARNINGS For much of the day the market had also been supported by
strong corporate earnings. ThyssenKrupp , Germany's
biggest steelmaker, gained 2.3 percent after forecast beating
results. [ID:nLDE74C02W] Elsewhere, French steel tubes maker Vallourec  rose
6.1 percent following an improved outlook for second-quarter
earnings. It said production was being driven up by positive
market trends. [ID:nLDE74B28L] Meanwhile, Airbus parent EADS  was up 5.8 percent
after forecast beating first-quarter earnings. [ID:nLDE74C047] Ex-dividend stocks dominated the FTSEurofirst 300 fallers
list, with Germany's Deutsche Telekom , Deutsche
Boerse, Adidas  and BMW  slipping
on ex-dividend trading.

Friday as miners rallied along with recovering metals prices,
but traders remained wary of the strength of the bounce with
commodities having endured their worst rout in three years. Silver , which has fallen more than 25 percent over
the last two weeks shaken by global growth concerns, climbed as
much as 3 percent on Friday as investors bought back in on the
dips. The uptick helped precious metal miners such as Fresnillo
, which rose 2.2 percent having slid more than 7.5
percent on Thursday. Shares in Anglo American  added 1.8 percent, and BHP
Billiton  and Xstrata  both rose 1.5 percent. ""Considering the volatility seen in the prices of
commodities of late, most of the trades we have seen have been
undertaken on short term contracts, and this raises the
potential for quick bouts of profit taking with traders
unwilling to take many risks,"" Joshua Raymond, market strategist
at City Index, said. The FTSE 100 , which is heavily weighted towards the
mining sector, bounced 46.72 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,991.68
by 1057 GMT, echoing a late rally on Wall Street overnight and
having shed 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions. Sentiment was helped as Germany reported soaring
first-quarter GDP figures. [ID:nLDE74C0CY] Oil services firm Petrofac  rose 5.4 percent,
pleasing punters by saying it was confident of hitting its
target for profit growth in 2011. [ID:nLDE74B1S8] Whitbread  infiltrated a commodity dominated gainers
list on the FTSE 100, rising 2.6 percent. Britain's biggest hotel operator's shares were boosted by
director share buying, and talk of the potential for the company
to spin-off of its Costa Coffee chain.  BAE GLEE BAE Systems  rose 1.9 percent. Europe's biggest
defence contractor was seen benefiting from the U.S. House of
Representatives' committee approving $690 billion for the U.S.
military complex in fiscal 2012. [ID:nN12139581] BAE was also
getting a lift from EADS results in Paris. [ID:nLDE74C047] Risk-sensitive banks  found favour. Barclays  added 0.8 percent as Citigroup upgraded
the company to ""buy"", although worries over debt contagion in
Europe lingered in the background. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that
despite bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Europe's debt
crisis may yet spread to core euro zone countries and emerging
Eastern Europe. On the second tier, London Stock Exchange  rose 3.5
percent after beating full-year results forecasts.
[ID:nLDE74B2AX] On the downside, retailers Next  and Marks and
Spencer  fell 1.8 and 0.9 percent, respectively, as
investors banked profits following their recent strong showing. Elsewhere, Scottish & Southern Energy  fell 0.6
percent as both Citigroup and Matrix downgraded their rating for
the utility firm on valuation grounds, after recent strong
gains, helped by commodity stock weakness. ""The stock market is clearly not a zero-sum game and one
stock's loss is not necessarily another stock's gain but it is
hard to escape the impression that the flight from the mining
sector is benefitting the utilities as investors seek out
defensive situations with a decent yield (6 percent in this
case),"" said Bill McNamara, technical analyst at Charles
Stanley. Wall Street futures ahead of U.S. inflation numbers, due at
1230 GMT, pointed to a firmer open on Friday. April U.S. CPI is seen up 0.4 percent on the month, after a

watchdog on Friday criticised delays and cost inflation in the
production of the new Typhoon fighter jet, prompting the defence
ministry to defend the project. The Eurofighter Typhoon is built by Britain's BAE Systems,
Italy's Finmeccanica and European aerospace group EADS, and this
week conducted its first combat operation, enforcing a United
Nations resolution in Libya. In a scathing report, the parliament's Committee of Public
Accounts, which scrutinises the way government departments spend
money but has no regulatory powers, said the Typhoon project was
mismanaged, pushing up costs. ""The history of the Typhoon fighter aircraft represents yet
another example of over-optimism, bad planning and an
unacceptably high bill for the taxpayer,"" said committee chair
Margaret Hodge in a statement. ""The (defence ministry) is now buying 30 percent fewer
Typhoon fighter aircraft than originally planned, the cost of
the project is now expected to be 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7
billion) more than was originally approved ... the cost of each
aircraft has increased by 75 per cent,"" she added. The watchdog said the overall project cost had risen to 20.2
billion pounds and that the cost of each plane had risen to 126
million pounds each. The body also said it had taken too long to
bring the jet -- conceived in the 1980s -- into service. Britain is buying 160 of the aircraft, and the accounts
committee suggested that support costs for the plane could be
higher than originally budgeted. Global demand for a new generation of fighter jets has
surged, and the arms market is likely to be watching the
Typhoon's performance in Libya closely, weighing up its
advantages against its purchase and running costs. The defence ministry defended the Typhoon project, and said
problems in its production were being resolved. ""The Typhoon is a world beating air-to-air fighter and is
fast developing a ground attack capability as is being
demonstrated in Libya,"" Defence Secretary Liam Fox said in a
statement. ""I am determined that in the future such projects are
properly run from the outset, and I have announced reforms to
reduce equipment delays and cost overruns,"" he added. British government departments have been under pressure in
recent months to slash spending to reduce a national budget
deficit, and the defence ministry in particular has been
strongly criticised for over-spending in previous years.

1440,"Mar 31, 2011 10:40AM ET",UPDATE 4-WTO raps U.S. subsidies to Boeing,nan,"   * Aid included unfair research payments from NASA * Verdict follows WTO ruling against Airbus last year * Both sides claim the edge in world's largest trade row 
 (Adds EU to appeal) By Tim Hepher and Andrew Callus GENEVA, March 31 (Reuters) - Planemaker Boeing received at
least $5.3 billion of illegal U.S. subsidies, the World Trade
Organization said on Thursday in a dispute that shows no signs
of an end to years of inconclusive wrangling. The banned aid included $2.6 billion of research funding
from space agency NASA. But a WTO verdict sparked an immediate
row over whether trade judges were right to include more than $2
billion of further support on the charge sheet against Boeing. The ruling is the latest chapter in a six-year battle
between the industry's two giants. The spat has already entered
the record books as the world's largest and costliest trade
dispute. The WTO verdict backs some, but not all, of a tit-for-tat
legal case over Boeing aid brought by the European Union. A separate WTO trade panel condemned European support for
Boeing rival Airbus in a parallel case last year. As so often in a row which now extends to 2,000 pages of
complex trade court rulings, both sides claimed victory. ""This WTO panel report clearly shows that Boeing has
received huge subsidies in the past and continues to receive
significant subsidies today,"" European Union trade chief Karel
De Gucht said. Airbus, part of European aerospace group EADS, said it had
lost $45 billion in plane sales because of the subsidies. Boeing
has made similar claims about the impact of Airbus subsidies. In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said the
ruling vindicated a longtime U.S. position that ""the subsidies
the Europeans give to Airbus dwarf anything that the U.S.
government does for Boeing"". According to the United States, the European subsidies for
Airbus faulted by the WTO last year exceeded $20 billion. As the latest telephone book-sized report was wheeled out of
WTO offices in Geneva, the companies at the heart of the dispute
opened fire with another salvo of claims through the media. ""It's time for Boeing to stop denying or minimizing the
massive illegal subsidies it gets,"" said Rainer Ohler, head of
public affairs and communications at Toulouse-based Airbus. Boeing acknowledged receiving $2.7 billion of aid on top of
a dispute that has already been aired, but accused its rival of
diverting attention from more pernicious types of European aid. ""This WTO ruling shatters the convenient myth that European
governments must illegally subsidize Airbus to counter U.S.
government assistance to Boeing,"" said Michael Luttig, executive
vice-president and general counsel at Boeing. Speaking in private, however, sources involved in the case
clashed over whether the $5.3 billion figure cited by the WTO
against Boeing was a fair account of where it went wrong. The figure includes $2.2 billion of export assistance under
a previous assistance programme known as Foreign Sales
Corporations, which the U.S. says is defunct. ""It is interesting but irrelevant,"" a U.S. source said. A European source said Boeing was still living off the
benefits of the scheme even though it had been scrapped. The WTO judges appeared to shy away from going over ground
well covered in earlier rulings, saying they had nothing to add. Both sides can appeal the ruling, as they did when the WTO
focused on Airbus. That appeal verdict is expected next month. Sources familiar with the case said the EU could appeal as
early as Friday in a tactical move aimed at reducing the time
gap between the two cases.  LENGTHY PROCESS The dispute over the $2 trillion plane market is a running
sore in relations between the world's trading superpowers. Most recently, it spilled over into a politically charged
battle for a contract to supply air tankers to the Pentagon,
which was first awarded to Airbus but eventually went to Boeing. The WTO decisions could help determine how not only Airbus
and Boeing, but future competitors in China, Russia, Brazil,
Japan and Canada, run their fast-growing aircraft sectors. Boeing Chairman Jim McNerney hailed what he called a
""dramatic victory"" in clarifying rules and suggested this would
prove helpful as China challenges the Airbus and Boeing duopoly. However, analysts say it could be years before appeals are
exhausted and the case can lead to any trade sanctions. ""Boeing began its complaint with a strong argument, but
Europe's counter-complaint has muddied the waters,"" said
aircraft analyst Richard Aboulafia of Virgina-based Teal Group. ""At the end of the day it won't matter much. Both sides will
continue to see exactly what they want to see, and will do
exactly what they want to do."" Even if the WTO verdicts against both sides are upheld, both
sides disagree over what that would mean for the future. The WTO has criticised public loans to Airbus, especially
for the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo. The United States has warned Airbus not to go back to its
host governments -- Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- for
similarly structured loans for its next plane, the A350.  But an EU official insisted the ability of governments to
use the loans system in the future had not been altered.

1441,"Mar 30, 2011 10:04AM ET",WTO to rule on claims Boeing received subsidies,nan," By Tim Hepher and Andrew Callus PARIS/GENEVA, March 30 (Reuters) - A long-running
transatlantic trade dispute over illegal state handouts for
Airbus and Boeing comes to a head on Thursday with the latest
ruling from the World Trade Organisation. The United States and European Union, both trading
superpowers, have been fighting cases against each other in the
WTO for more than six years over each other's subsidies for
manufacturers of large passenger aircraft. Thursday's document will contain the WTO's 1,000-page
findings on European Union claims that U.S. planemaker Boeing
won billions of dollars in unfair U.S. support. The trade bloc brought the case after the United States
protested against subsidies benefitingEuropean planemaker
Airbus. The WTO found parts of the financing for Airbus planes
was illegal in its report on that case last year. The two cases represent the world's largest trade dispute
and could help determine how not only Airbus and Boeing, but
potential future competitors in China, Russia, Brazil, Japan and
Canada, run their growing aircraft sectors for years to come. However, analysts say it could be months or even years
before appeals and possible compliance procedures are exhausted.  DISAGREE STRONGLY EADS subsidiary Airbus said the final report on the case
against the United States over Boeing subsidies would damage its
rival's past claims that it was market-funded. The EU says NASA,
states and the Pentagon all pumped in funds unfairly. ""Boeing can no longer hide they received massive illegal
subsidies that have severely harmed Airbus. Despite years of
denial and attempts to minimize the research grants and state
subsidies it receives, the public report will show the
contrary,"" spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma said. Boeing has acknowledged that the WTO backed some of the EU
claims. However, the two sides disagree strongly over the amount
of condemned Boeing subsidies and how they compared in size and
effect with those given to Airbus.  ""We are fully confident that the WTO will reveal tomorrow
the massive market advantage Airbus has enjoyed from illegal
government subsidies for more than 40 years,"" Boeing spokesman
Charlie Miller said.  ""From media reports quoting people who have seen the ruling,
it is clear that the WTO has rejected the vast majority of the
EU's claims in sharp contrast to last year's ruling that Airbus
had received illegal subsidies totalling more than $20 billion."" After an interim confidential report was delivered to the
parties in January, Airbus said it showed Boeing had received at
least $5 billion in illegal subsidies and was only able to
launch its 787 Dreamliner with such support.  Boeing denied the assertions and said Airbus had in any case
received a much larger boost from taxpayers. The two sides also disagree over whether the WTO's findings
in the earlier case will automatically disqualify possible
future government loans for the Airbus A350, an aircraft which
is being developed to compete with the Dreamliner. Both sides appealed aspects of the WTO's verdict on the
original U.S. case and U.S. sources say the WTO's appeals body
is expected to insist next month that Airbus remedy about $5
billion worth of illegal aid given in preferential public loans. European sources say both cases should be considered
together and say the best outcome would be political compromise.

one or two of the 13 superjumbo A380s scheduled for this year
until January 2010, the European planemaker told Reuters on
Friday. The Toulouse-based aircraft manufacturer, a unit of European
defence and aerospace group EADS, also said client financing
remained difficult and it would take time for the business
environment to return to normal. ""We are still aiming for 13 (A380) deliveries but one or two
could come in January,"" Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier
told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony for the delivery of
Air France-KLM's first A380. ""Everything will depend on airlines' capacity to take these
planes at the end of the year,"" he said. Air France-KLM has ordered 12 A380s. The first one will be
put into service in November on the Paris-New York route. Airbus's chief executive, Thomas Enders, also said on Friday
it was ""too early to relax"" over customer financing and to
believe it was guaranteed. Customer financing helps airlines raise funds to order and
take delivery of aircraft, but the past year's financial crisis
has put pressure on traditional sources of credit. Enders added the overall A380 delivery rhythm in the first
half of 2010 should be ""similar"" to the current rate. Last month Airbus cut its A380 delivery target to 13 from 14
for 2009. As of today, it has delivered seven. Airbus, just like Boeing, gets the bulk of payments for its
aircraft on delivery. On the basis of catalogue prices, which
can differ significantly from prices paid, an A380 can fetch
$330 million. However, faced with lower traffic, many airlines have been
cutting capacity. Industry body IATA expects international
airlines to suffer combined losses of $11 billion in 2009.(Writing by Astrid Wendlandt and Lionel Laurent; Editing by

 (Adds more background, shares) By Rhys Jones BROUGHTON, Wales, Oct 28 (Reuters) - European planemaker
Airbus, a unit of EADS, expects to match the number of planes it
delivered last year in 2009 but said the A380 superjumbo
programme was still challenging. ""We're on track to repeat the 2008 delivery record of 483
planes in 2009,"" said Tom Williams, Airbus's vice president of
programmes at a briefing at its Broughton, north Wales plant on
Wednesday. A drop in global passenger demand has Airbus and U.S. rival
Boeing (BA.N) headed for their worst annual order tally in at
least 15 years as airlines cancel and defer orders, weighing on
the whole aerospace supplier sector. Airbus has booked 149 gross orders -- before cancellations
-- this year. Its target is 300 orders for 2009, meaning it has
a lot to make up in the fourth quarter. Williams added that the A380 programme was ""still
challenging"" and ""not running as smoothly as we would like"". Airbus has repeatedly cut 2009 production targets for the
mammoth passenger jet and now plans to deliver only 13 this
year. Industry body IATA said last month that the sector is still
far away from returning to profit, though air traffic demand has
started recovering from the steep slump. It has said it sees the
world's airlines losing $11 billion this year. The euro is also causing a headache for European
manufacturers. The currency has been lingering around $1.50
after hitting 14-month highs, hurting European manufacturers as
production costs in their home currency rise compared to
dollar-denominated sales abroad. Airbus's owner EADS has stepped up calls for action to help
European exporters cope with the weak dollar. Airbus also said the new A400M military transporter aircraft
would fly before the end of the year. On the new A350 passenger jet Williams said the company
would start producing 10 aircraft per month and that its first
flight would be in late 2012. Shares in EADS were down 0.49 cents at 12.84 euros by 1440
GMT.

 (Recasts after CEO interview) By Tim Hepher and Matthias Blamont PARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The world's biggest civil
helicopter maker, Eurocopter, said on Thursday a slump in
corporate and VIP spending would force it to cut costs and
voiced fears about the cost to European firms of a weak dollar. In the first indication of the global downturn's impact on
production plans for next year, Chief Executive Lutz Bertling

is not recovering up to now,"" Bertling said in an interview,
adding Eurocopter had received 75 cancellations this year. Spending by corporations and VIPs has fallen due to the
financial crisis and pressure on boardrooms to cut perks,
mirroring a slump in business jet orders. But operators of oil
and gas fields are still buying as energy prices rebound. ""Next year we will decrease production rates for small
helicopters while we will increase production rates for the
heavy ones,"" Bertling said.  ""The number of helicopters we deliver next year will be

be somewhere around 2008 (levels),"" he added. Eurocopter
delivered 588 helicopters last year. Bertling also toned down forecasts given at the start of the
year for 450 sales of new helicopters in 2009 compared with 715
in 2008. Eurocopter now targets something closer to half the
record 802 orders seen at the peak of the market in 2007. ""It is very difficult to say in these times, but we should
at least be above 400,"" he told Reuters. Eurocopter said earlier on Thursday it planned 200 million
euros ($299.4 million) of recurring annual cost cuts from the
end of 2011 in an efficiency project to be known as SHAPE. The company, a sister division to planemaker Airbus, said it
would free up cash by cutting inventories and retrain or
redeploy employees to make its factories more efficient. But its
16,000 staff would be spared compulsory redundancies. ""2010 and 2011 will be the most diffficult years for us and
we want to stabilise margins and continue to invest,"" Bertling
said. EADS shares ended flat against a weaker European market.  DOLLAR IMPACT Eurocopter competes with Italy's AgustaWestland, owned by
Finmeccanica, Bell Helicopters, a unit of U.S.-based Textron,
and United Technologies Corp's Sikorsky in a global market
estimated to be worth over $6 billion a year. It also builds military helicopters such as the Tiger and
the delayed NH90. But analysts say the shrinking portion of
high-margin civil sales has put pressure on operating profits,
which fell 5 percent in the first half. Speaking as the euro touched the $1.50 level for a second
day after hitting 14-month highs, Bertling said the weak dollar
was hurting European efforts to compete with U.S. companies. Unlike Airbus, which sells jetliners exclusively in dollars,
Eurocopter is cushioned by having some contracts in euros. ""The direct impact on EBIT (operating income) is not so
serious, because we have increased our natural hedging and we
are doing a lot of sales in euros,"" Bertling said. ""But of course it is affecting our competitiveness. Compared
to the American suppliers, the European ones have a disadvantage
in competitiviness due to the U.S. dollar rate"".
 Formed from a Franco-German merger in 1992 and folded into
EADS at the turn of the decade, Eurocopter made up 10.3 percent
of both revenues and operating income at Europe's largest
aerospace company in 2008. It is EADS's third largest business behind Airbus and
Defence and Security, and roughly the same size as its Astrium
space business. EADS and Airbus have recently stepped up calls
for action to help European exporters cope with the weak dollar.

 (Adds detail, share price) PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French aerospace and defence group
Safranforecast a challenging 2010 as it posted flat
third-quarter revenue on Friday, pressured by underused business
jets and lower-than-expected sales of spare parts. The company, which partners General Electric in the world's
largest engine maker for civil jetliners, CFM International,
reiterated forecasts for 2009 revenue ""on the same scale"" as
2008 and an operating margin of about 6 percent. But it did not give a specific outlook for next year. ""It is too early to make detailed predictions, but 2010 will
be a challenging year and we intend to face the challenges,""
Chief Executive Jean-Paul Herteman told reporters. Safran shares were down 5.2 percent to 12.07 euros at 1016
GMT. GE is due to publish third-quarter results later on Friday,
with Wall Street expecting profit to fall over half to 20 cents
per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, with revenue
forecast to drop about 15 percent to $40 billion. Safran third-quarter sales fell 0.2 percent to 2.38 billion
euros ($3.55 billion), with core aerospace propulsion falling
1.5 percent. Analysts had predicted revenue closer to 2.5 billion euros. Natixis Securities analyst Olivier Brochet said sales of
spare parts of CFM56 engines, the workhorse of most airline
short-haul fleets, which fell 2.6 percent in dollar terms over
nine months, had fared worse than an expected decline of 2
percent. The CFM56 is the engine built and sold in a joint venture
with GE, the world's largest jet engine manufacturer. Shares in Rolls-Royce, which some analysts say is better
shielded from market variations through flexible ""TotalCare""
engine support contracts, rose around 0.4 percent on Friday. Safran said it had also been hurt by a slump in business jet
travel, hit by recent publicity over unpopular executive perks. ""Revenue was affected by the depressed market conditions in
the business aircraft segment, which account for 10 percent of
aircraft equipment business,"" the company said. Falls in the aero-engine sector were dampened by higher
defence and security spending. Engine makers clinched a wave of new orders over the summer
tied to aircraft deals negotiated before the financial crisis
exacerbated a cyclical downturn last year. But fresh demand is
waning, putting more focus on servicing older engines. Safran was created from a merger of French state engine
maker Snecma and telecoms equipment group Sagem in 2004, and has
a market value around 5 billion euros. The company is also part of a consortium building the West's
largest turbo-prop engine for the Airbus A400M military
transport plane, Europe's largest defence project, which has
been hit by both engine and software delays. Herteman said recent trials had gone smoothly and that the
engine was not standing in the way of a first flight for the
aircraft by the end of the year, as Airbus plans. Delays of up to two years in the maiden flight have caused
friction between EADS unit Airbus and its engine suppliers,
which also include Rolls-Royce and Germany's MTU. Herteman declined to comment on whether Safran would take
financial provisions for either the A400M or delays to the
Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is also two years late.

 (Adds Gut comment, further quotes, background) By Tim Hepher PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The sales chief at Europe's Airbus
denied a report on Thursday he was involved in a bid to buy
plane leasing giant ILFC, squashing the prospect of a dramatic
switch from being the industry's top salesman to being its most
powerful buyer. Airbus commercial director John Leahy also told Reuters
airlines were heading for a ""tight winter"" despite improved
traffic showing the economic slump may be easing, and reaffirmed
the European planemaker's key sales and production targets. Leahy moved to head off any uncertainty over his role after
French newspaper La Tribune reported he had teamed up with
Jean-Paul Gut, a former senior official at Airbus parent EADS,
to study buying ILFC with Qatari financial backing. ""There is absolutely no truth in this whatsoever,"" Leahy
told Reuters in an interview. Gut, who ran international
strategy at EADS until 2007, also denied eyeing up ILFC. ""I have never studied this dossier, whether it be alone or
with any other partner,"" he told Reuters via a spokeswoman. The report appeared to touch a sensitive nerve, since such a
deal would accelerate a shift of industry power towards the
Gulf, already among the sole sources of aircraft demand during
the recession and now getting into parts production. Prising its American sales champion away from Airbus would
also likely unsettle the planemaker after a period of relative
management stability. Airbus and parent EADS went through months
of turmoil after its A380 superjumbo was delayed in 2006. Leahy, 59, insisted he was staying in Toulouse. ""I am not considering leaving Airbus at the present time. I
am quite happy here. After being at Airbus for 25 years, I feel
I have an obligation to stay to get us through the downturn and
back up out of the cycle,"" he said. With a fleet of 1,000 jets, ILFC is seen as one of the most
powerful players in aviation, even though its logo is never seen
by travellers. Its future has been left uncertain since the
financial crisis ripped through insurance parent AIG. Sources told Reuters on Monday that AIG was in talks to sell
a small part of ILFC back its its founder and Chief Executive
Steven Udvar-Hazy, who sold it to AIG in 1990.  ""That is my understanding too,"" Leahy said, adding the whole
firm would have been ""too big to chew off"" right now. ILFC is among several aircraft lessors up for sale or thrown
off course by the credit crunch and a slump in aviation. Royal Bank of Scotland may sell leasing unit RBS Aviation
Capital and AerCap last month agreed to buy Genesis Lease. ""We are watching the lessor situation with great interest,
but ILFC is part of AIG which belongs 80 percent to the U.S.
government and RBS is owned by the UK government, which gives
more stability than at the start of the crisis,"" Leahy said.  KEEPING SALES, PRODUCTION TARGETS Leahy said airline traffic was recovering but yields, or
average revenues per seat sold, were lagging. He did not however
expect a significant new wave of aircraft cancellations. ""This will be a tight winter because a lot of airlines
filled planes in the summer at heavily discounted fares and
didn't build up a cash war chest to get through winter. So there
could be some cancellations but I don't think there is that much
risk of a big wave of cancellations,"" he said. Leahy said he was sticking to Airbus's target of reaching up
to 300 plane orders before cancellations in 2009, leaving more
than 150 orders still to fill in the fourth quarter. He also fended off calls by some analysts and industry
figures, including ILFC's Udvar-Hazy, for both Airbus and rival
Boeing to slash plane production by as much as 30 percent to
protect aircraft values and cushion against cancellations. He said Airbus had told suppliers on Wednesday it could keep
production level after trimming narrow-body output to 34 planes
a month from October, but any adjustment to this would be slim. ""There are currently no plans (to cut production). If there
is a risk it could be minus 5 percent, but then by Spring it
could be plus 5 percent,"" Leahy told Reuters. Some suppliers are reluctant to keep production running at
current rates for fear of a sudden slowdown at Airbus as
airlines fail to raise funding to take aircraft deliveries.

 (Adds economist quote, currency, trade background) By Tim Hepher PARIS, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Europe should beef up support for
industry and put exporters first after the financial crisis
exposed the ""mirages of speculation"", the head of Airbus parent
EADS said in remarks published on Wednesday. ""I am convinced that Europe must play its industrial card
with greater determination. The financial and economic crisis
demonstrates that solid and lasting growth cannot be built upon
the mirages of speculation,"" Chief Executive Louis Gallois wrote
in an op-ed column for French newspaper Les Echos. Gallois, who has repeatedly criticised the strength of the
euro against the dollar, stepped up calls for governments and
monetary policymakers to pay more attention to exporters but
analysts said this was unlikely to force a change of thinking. ""Industry and related services are the cornerstone of stable
and balanced development. In the face of emerging economies, we
have reached a turning point where Europe must decide if it
wants to stay in the industrial and technological race or not. ""This suggests first that policies -- taxes, currency,
competition and research -- should take account of the need to
support European industry, especially companies which export."" Gallois last year described the weakness of the dollar as a
""Sword of Damocles"" hanging over Europe's largest aerospace
group, particularly its civil airliner subsidiary Airbus. Airbus competes with Boeing for sales of aircraft built in
euros but sold in dollars. Its deputy head last week urged
central banks to boost currency stability. Economists say Airbus is a bellwether for growing currency
concerns in the euro zone. But tackling imbalances may be beyond
Europe's grasp even if it manages to reach consensus internally. ""This is part of wider concern now in the euro area that the
strength of the euro is really starting to bite,"" said Gilles
Moec, senior European economist at Deutsche Bank. ""Intervention only works if it is coordinated across major
world currencies. Even if Euroland gets really vocal and calls
for dollar appreciation against the euro, it would take
coordinated action with the (U.S.) Fed, Japan, Britain and
probably China. For the time being I don't see any consensus.""  RINGSIDE VIEW Gallois' remarks were timed to coincide with the tenth
anniversary of a Franco-German deal in 1999 that paved the way
for the creation of EADS, with Spain also on board, in 2000. Europe's grandest financial and industrial ventures grew in
tandem over the next decade as the euro asserted itself and
airliner sales soared. But the gap between dollar revenues and
euro costs squeezed EADS profits. And industrial delays kept a
lid on shares which are 22 percent below their flotation price. The euro stood at $1.08 on the day of the 1999 deal but has
since risen 37 percent. At $1.48, it is up 18 percent since
early February but well off last year's record of $1.60. France has been among leading voices expressing concern over
trade and foreign exchange imbalances.  But currency strategists say these protests are unlikely to
prompt any concerted move even within Europe to restrain the
euro's rise in the absence of public pressure from Germany,
which traditionally backs a firm currency to curb inflation. With its ringside view of strategic industries, EADS equally
emerged over the years as a barometer of fluctuating industrial
ties between the euro zone's two leading economic powers. Internal power struggles, both between French and German
executives and within the French camp, were blamed for
exacerbating a crisis over delays to the Airbus A380 superjumbo
which led to a plunge in the value of EADS shares in mid-2006. Gallois told Le Figaro relations between France and Germany
had been strengthened by joint efforts to tackle the recent
financial crisis and this meant a ""positive climate"" for EADS. Franco-German-controlled EADS combines Airbus, the Ariane
space rocket, as well as interests in helicopters, missiles,
Eurofighter combat planes and France's nuclear deterrent. Gallois said the time had come to launch bold new industrial
projects in Europe and suggested some of the funding could come
from a national loan being drawn up by France. French President Nicolas Sarkozy unveiled plans in June to
take out a loan from the public or financial markets to fund
priority investments for the country's future. EADS is locked in a long-running dispute with Boeing over
the role of government investment in aerospace, with each
accusing the other of receiving unfair subsidies. The World Trade Organisation last month ruled against
European government loans for Airbus, according to sources
familiar with a confidential draft ruling. The European Union is counter-suing the United States over
research payments which it says unfairly benefit Boeing.

 (Adds quote, details, background) By Tim Hepher PARIS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus
reaffirmed plans to get the delayed A400M military transport
plane flying by the end of the year as it announced a raft of
management changes at its military division on Tuesday.The changes include the appointment of a new engineering
chief -- described as ""Mr Tanker"" by one industry source --
after a storm over A400M costs and delays, which contrasts with 
relatively smoother developments of Airbus refuelling tankers. It is the widest shake-up of the team running efforts by
Airbus to diversify away from civil plane production since
parent EADS brought in Airbus's restructuring chief Domingo
Urena to run the troubled military division in February. Miguel Angel Morell, Urena's new head of engineering and
technology, previously led efforts by Airbus to develop
in-flight refuelling planes converted from A330 passenger jets. The move comes as EADS, in partnership with Northrop Grumman
, faces a new competition against rival Boeing to sell tankers
to the U.S. Air Force. EADS and Northrop last year won an order for tankers worth
$35 billion from the United States but Boeing successfully
appealed the decision and the contest is set to be run again. ""Morell is a very capable guy. He is 'Mr Tanker' and helped
to ensure they performed well in the United States so he is a
key player,"" an industry source said, asking not to be named. Airbus declined a request to interview Morell. Australia was the first customer for the Multi-Role Tanker
Transport plane, or MRTT, which will carry troops and perform
mid-air refuelling. The A330s are converted at Getafe in Spain. Deliveries to Australia, originally tabled for 2007, have
been delayed but the project has been broadly spared the turmoil
that threatened the A400M, Europe's largest defence project.  MAIDEN FLIGHT ""Airbus Military is getting ready for some important
milestones such as the A400M first flight to take place by the
end of the year, the first A330 MRTT deliveries to operators in
Australia and the UK and the U.S. tanker competition,"" the
company said in a statement. The maiden flight of the A400M has been delayed by almost
two years due to engine and software development problems,
forcing EADS to renegotiate the 20 billion euro contract with
the seven European NATO countries that first ordered the plane. Ministers are expected to meet in coming days to discuss
whether to reschedule deliveries and waive penalties for delays. In other changes, Airbus Military's previous engineering
chief, Rafael Acedo, has been appointed head of strategy and
Jaime Perez-Guerra, a former spokesman for Spanish airline
Iberia, has been appointed head of communications. Spain clashed earlier this year with EADS over previous
management changes and a reorganisation that saw the Spanish-led
military transport business folded into Airbus instead of
remaining as a standalone EADS unit, industry sources say. Sources familiar with the matter blamed that rift for
Spain's decision to boycott a meeting of ministers from Airbus
producing countries at the Paris Air Show in June. Often seen as a junior partner to France and Germany in
EADS, Spain has pushed for some time for a greater profile in
Europe's largest aerospace group, which was created in 2000. Spain has doubled its share of Airbus's next civil project,
the A350, following investments in new materials.

report it planned to transfer 20 percent of its engineering work
to India and elsewhere by 2012 was wrong, but reaffirmed
longer-term plans to shift work abroad. Indian newspaper The Mint reported on Monday Airbus would
move a fifth of its engineering and design activities to
low-cost countries, the majority of it to India, by 2012. ""This report is incorrect. The EADS 2020 Vision envisages up
to 20 percent of Airbus work could be subcontracted globally by
2020 but this is not new,"" Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon said. Airbus carries out most of its work in the four countries
that founded it as a consortium 40 years ago -- Britain, France,
Germany and Spain. It is part of listed group EADS. Announced in January 2008, Vision 2020 is a 12-year plan to
""rebalance"" the parent group as a global company with less
reliance on airliner sales for its revenues and on high-cost
European factories for its engineering and production work. The overhaul would curb the exposure of Europe's largest
aerospace group to both a weak dollar and civil aviation
business cycles, and result in about a fifth of its workforce
being located outside Europe compared with a fraction of that
now. In India, Airbus employs 130 people at an engineering centre
and nearby training facility in Bangalore and plans to increase
this to 400 people by 2012, Dubon said. The facility helps to speed up design work in Europe by

 (Recasts, combines previous items) By Tim Hepher and Matthias Blamont PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus
looked set to cut its forecast for A380 superjumbo deliveries
in 2009 to 13 aircraft, from its most recent target of 14
planes, after a deal with one of its buyers. The head of Airbus parent EADS  told Reuters on
Monday that the move followed talks with Singapore Airlines
, one of three carriers operating the world's largest
airliner. Deliveries to airlines have already been delayed half
a dozen times. The reason for the latest delay was not immediately clear. After failing to deliver A380s on time due to wiring
difficulties, Airbus has most recently been urged to reschedule
deliveries by airlines worried about a sharp drop in traffic. ""We are discussing with Singapore Airlines the possibility
of delivering the last aircraft (from the 2009 delivery
schedule) in January next year,"" EADS Chief Executive Louis
Gallois told Reuters on the sidelines of a company event. ""If they take it in January instead of December then we
will deliver 13 in 2009,"" he added. Sources familiar with the matter said earlier that Airbus
was expected to deliver 13 A380s in 2009, one fewer than its
most recent delivery target. French newspaper Les Echos
reported a similar cut in its early Tuesday edition. Airbus declined to comment. The expected new A380 schedule was a further reminder of
the swaying fortunes of Airbus and rival Boeing  as the
industry rides out the worst recession in decades. Airlines are
predicted by their lobby group to lose $11 billion this year. EURO STRENGTH 'CLOSE TO LIMIT' EADS is additionally concerned about the strength of the
euro as it competes with Boeing for sales in dollars. ""At the current level we are close to the limit. Beyond
that it will become difficult,""  Gallois said. The euro  fetched $1.4616 late on Monday. Airbus, which makes up the bulk of EADS revenues and
profits, is recovering from an industrial and financial crisis
in 2006 and 2007, triggered by problems in wiring the giant
A380 airliners on a scale needed to ensure smooth deliveries. Now it is Boeing's turn to face disgruntled customers as
production of its mid-sized 787 Dreamliner also slips two years
behind schedule. The head of Vietnam Airlines -- a customer of both
planemakers -- became the latest buyer to put pressure on
Boeing, saying he had not decided whether to cancel any 787s. Vietnam Airlines has eight of the next-generation jets on
order and its leasing affiliate, Vietnam Aircraft Leasing
Company, has ordered a further eight. ""We are not happy about the constant delays. It affects our
business plan,"" Vietnam Airlines President and CEO Pham Ngoc
Minh told Reuters at the EADS event, where he was a guest. ""We expected to get our planes in 2009, then 2010, and now
nobody can confirm to us which is the exact delivery date. I
can be patient but it gives us a lot of headaches."" The head of Oman Air last week hinted at possible 787
cancellations and said a decision would be made after its
maiden flight, due this year. [ID:nLO146307] The airline has ordered 787s through a deal with Kuwaiti
lessor Alafco . While dealing with their respective airliner production
hiccups, Airbus and Boeing are preparing to compete again in a
contest to build refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Gallois told reporters he remained confident of Airbus's
ability to compete after winning an earlier tender that was
successfully challenged by Boeing last year. Boeing said last
week said it may offer a choice of aircraft. EADS is bidding in a team led by its U.S. partner Northrop
Grumman  for the tanker contract that one U.S. official
now predicts could be worth up to $50 billion.

 (Adds analyst quote, background) By Tim Hepher PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Defence deals with Brazil,
Morocco and Saudi Arabia pushed French arms sales up 13 percent
last year to their highest level since 2000, the government said
on Monday, highlighting efforts by Paris to capture new markets. President Nicolas Sarkozy has launched a drive to secure new
business for 50,000 high-tech workers directly or indirectly
employed in France's arms industry and to try to arrest a dearth
of export orders for France's multi-role Rafale combat jet. French companies took 6.6 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in
new orders last year, strengthening France's grip on fourth
place in the league table of global arms exporters behind the
United States, Britain and Russia, the defence ministry said. Contract wins included France's share of aerospace deals
with Brazil and Saudi Arabia secured by Franco-German-Spanish
group EADS and a frigate contract with Morocco that will boost
privatised French electronics group Thales. France has about 7 percent of the global arms market, which
is shifting away from a heavy reliance on the Middle East. Earlier this month, Sarkozy led an arms export delegation to
Brazil, which has a deal in the pipeline to buy four French
submarines on top of 50 EC725 Super Cougar helicopters it
ordered from EADS subsidiary Eurocopter last year. ""We are getting away from the classic idea that France only
exports to the Middle East, and we are doing what is necessary
to respond to the needs of Europe, Asia and Latin America,""
defence ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire told a news
briefing. Brazil is also weighing up whether to buy French Rafale
warplanes, built by Dassault Aviation. Latin America's largest country has signed a strategic
defence alliance with France, and the government has expressed
preference for Dassault's Rafale plane over competing models
from Boeing and Sweden's Saab. But Brazil's air force last week extended until Oct. 2 a
deadline for companies to present improved bids. Brazil is seeking a generous technology transfer offer and
local assembly as part of a contract to buy 36 jet fighters. The
deal could eventually rise to more than 100 aircraft.   BARGAINING CHIP The contest illustrates how buyers are increasingly driving
hard bargains in exchange for lucrative contracts as Western
companies face mostly stagnant defence spending at home. ""The global financial crisis is held up as a useful
bargaining chip,"" said Paul Holtom, a senior official at the 
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a thinktank on
the global arms business. ""In Brazil, France has shown that it is willing to transfer
a lot of technology; it is a case where buyers do not just want
off-the-shelf equipment but to a great extent the blueprints."" The U.S. and Sweden have both said they would also be able
to meet Brazil's technology transfer requirements. Last year's jump in export orders came after Paris saw arms
sales come under pressure for much of the decade as French arms
salesmen struggled to repeat the success of Dassault's previous
generation of Mirage warplanes. France suffered an embarrassing setback at the end of the
previous year when Morocco snubbed a French offer of Rafales in
favour of Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters, prompting Sarkozy to
order a shake-up of France's arms export system. France sold weapons systems worth 8.2 billion euros in 2000. France's third-biggest market last year was Saudi Arabia,
thanks in part to a deal to buy mid-air tankers converted from
passenger planes built by EADS subsidiary Airbus. Last year's data was presented to France's parliament just
as EADS and U.S. partner Northrop Grumman embarked on a fierce
battle with U.S. contractor Boeing to secure a far bigger order
of mid-air tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Washington published draft bidding rules on Friday for a
contest now said by a senior U.S. military official to be
potentially worth as much as $50 billion.

government, directly or indirectly provide 50,000 jobs in
France. French companies took new orders worth 6.6 billion euros
($9.7 billion), strengthening France's grip on fourth place in
the league table of global arms exporters behind the United
States, Britain and Russia, the defence ministry said. France has about 7 percent of the global arms market, which
is shifting away from a heavy reliance on the Middle East. Sarkozy this month led an arms export delegation to Brazil,
which finalised a deal to buy four conventional submarines and
is pondering whether to buy French Rafale warplanes, built by
Dassault Aviation. ""We are getting away from the classic idea that France only
exports to the Middle East and we are doing what is necessary to
respond to the needs of Europe, Asia and Latin America,"" defence
ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire told a news briefing. Brazil and France signed a defence accord in December last
year worth up to 8.6 billion euros, including the supply of 50
EC725 Super Cougar helicopters built by EADS subsidiary
Eurocopter. France had seen its defence exports come under pressure for
most of the decade as it struggled to repeat the success of
Dassault's previous generation of Mirage warplanes with the
multi-role Rafale, which has not yet found a buyer. France sold weapon systems worth 8.2 billion euros in 2000. Morocco was France's second-largest client in 2008 with a
contract to buy FREMM frigates built by a state-controlled
company 25-percent owned by electronics firm Thales. France suffered an embarrassing setback at the end of the
previous year when Morocco snubbed a French offer of Rafales in
favour of Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters, prompting Sarkozy to
order a shake-up of France's arms export system. In third place last year was Saudi Arabia, thanks in part to
a deal to buy air refuelling tankers converted from passenger
planes built by EADS subsidiary Airbus. Details were presented to the French parliament as EADS and
U.S. partner Northrop Grumman embarked on a fierce battle with
U.S. contractor Boeing to secure a far bigger order of mid-air
tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Washington published draft bidding rules on Friday for a
contest now said by a senior U.S. military official to be
potentially worth as much as $50 billion.  Shipments of arms sold in previous years fell in 2008 to
3.17 billion euros from 4.6 billion in 2007, but the figures are
not final because of bureaucratic delays in compiling data. ""The orders we are seeing now will lead to an increase in
deliveries in future years,"" Teisseire said.

 (Recasts with Pentagon briefing documents) By Jim Wolf and Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The Pentagon unveiled on
Thursday what it called ""crystal clear"" rules in a $35-billion
contest to build new refueling aircraft after two botched
attempts, although some lawmakers said a trans-Atlantic trade
dispute should have been accounted for. Boeing Co , the second largest U.S. defense
contractor, is vying for the contract against a team made up of
Northrop Grumman  and Europe's EADS , parent of
Airbus. The contract would be for an initial 179 tanker aircraft,
the first of three acquisition stages valued at $100 billion. The Pentagon said it would release the new rules to
companies on Friday and give them 60 days to comment. It hopes
to award a contract for the new planes in the middle of next
year, with the first planes to be delivered in 2015. This is the Pentagon's third attempt in eight years to
start replacing its aging fleet of KC-135 tankers, which are
more than 50 years old on average now. A year ago, it canceled an earlier deal awarded to Northrop
and EADS after government auditors upheld a protest by Boeing,
saying the Air Force mishandled the bids. Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn told lawmakers the
Pentagon had learned important lessons after government
auditors concluded the last process was ""too subjective."" ""This time we will be crystal clear about what we want and
what the bidders need to do to win,"" Lynn said, according to a
briefing document obtained by Reuters. ""We have crafted this approach to favor no one except the
warfighter and taxpayer,"" he said, saying the competition would
focus on price, long-term ownership costs and aircraft
performance. ""We've steered 'straight down the middle.'"" The new requirements drew praise from some key lawmakers,
although others said it was too soon for a detailed
assessment. Senator John McCain said the rules appeared viable but
added, ""the devil is in the details."" McCain led the opposition
to an earlier $23.5 billion sole-source tanker deal with Boeing
that collapsed amid an ethics scandal in 2004. WTO DISPUTE Boeing supporters generally welcomed the Pentagon's new
approach, but several criticized the Pentagon's decision to
exempt a Boeing-Airbus fight at the World Trade Organization
over alleged illegal aircraft subsidies. Lynn told Reuters the dispute should not factor into the
bidding because appeals in the case might not be settled for
years. He said the draft rules included a provision that would
ban either company from passing on the cost of any WTO fines. Lynn, Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter and Air
Force Secretary Michael Donley told lawmakers on Thursday that
they were determined to ensure the competition was fair. The fight pits Boeing's political backers from Washington
state and Kansas, where the company would do much of its tanker
work, against lawmakers and others from Alabama, where the
Northrop-EADS team would do final assembly of its planes. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton
welcomed the new rules, as did Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington
state. But Dicks and other Boeing backers criticized the
decision to exempt the trade issue from the bidding criteria. Rep. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas said this week that he could
pursue legislation to add the trade issue. PENTAGON URGED TO SPEED PURCHASES John Murtha, powerful chairman of the defense subcommittee
of the House Appropriations Committee, called for the Pentagon
to buy 36 airplanes per year, instead of the 15 planned under
the new rules, saying it would save billions in maintenance and
repair costs and get new tankers into the fleet sooner. He still believed that it would be easier to build tankers
with two suppliers, but was no longer insisting that the
Pentagon buy planes from both bidders, said his spokesman. The new rules call for fixed-price bids from the companies
and require them to meet just 373 mandatory requirements,
instead of the more than 800 requirements included last time. Companies could enhance their proposals by meeting 93
additional non-mandatory requirements, and their score in that
category could decide the competition, if the evaluated bids
were within one percent of each on price. The rules also include a complex model for judging the
performance of the aircraft under various wartime scenarios,
and give greater weight to fuel burn and military construction
costs in evaluating the longer-term cost of ownership. The first U.S. attempt to award a tanker contract collapsed
in 2004 amid a conflict-of-interest scandal that sent a former
top Air Force weapons buyer and Boeing's former chief financial
officer to prison. Boeing shares were down 1.2 percent in afternoon trading to
$51.77, while Northrop shares were off 0.9 percent to $51.11.

1458,"Sep 24, 2009 05:09AM ET",Pentagon launches 3rd try to buy refueling planes,nan," By Jim Wolf WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department
said Thursday it was relaunching a competition for a
multibillion-dollar fleet of mid-air refueling planes after two
botched tries to award the deal. Boeing Co  is vying for the contract against a
trans-Atlantic team made up of Northrop Grumman  and Airbus
parent EADS . The contract is projected to be worth $35
billion for an initial 179 tanker aircraft, the first of three
planned acquisition stages that could cost $100 billion over
time. A notice on the Pentagon's website said Deputy Defense
Secretary William Lynn would brief reporters on a draft
solicitation at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Thursday along with Ashton
Carter, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, and Air Force Secretary
Michael Donley. U.S. lawmakers also were expected to be briefed on the draft
""request for proposal,"" which will be made public on Friday on
FedBizOpps.gov, a clearinghouse for federal contracting
opportunities greater than $25,000, a Pentagon official said. The proposed terms of the competition are being closely
watched by U.S. lawmakers to see how they may change from the
last round. The deal has pitted Boeing's political backers, chiefly
from Washington state and Kansas where the company would do
much of its tanker work, against lawmakers and others from
Alabama, where the Northrop-EADS team would do final assembly
of its planes. Politicians have been sparring over the impact of a
confidential, interim World Trade Organization ruling earlier this
month in a long-running dispute between plane-building archrivals
Boeing and Airbus. ""This is a battle to the death,"" said Scott Hamilton, a
defense industry analyst with Leeham Securities. ""For Boeing,
the strategic implications also involve (the threat of)
allowing Airbus to get a production foothold on U.S.
territory."" The first U.S. attempt to award a tanker contract collapsed
in 2004 amid a conflict-of-interest scandal that sent a former
top Air Force weapons buyer and Boeing's former chief financial
officer to prison. That involved a $20 billion-plus plan to lease
and buy modified Boeing 767 aircraft as flying gas stations. Northrop Grumman and EADS then teamed to win in February
2008 with a plane based on an Airbus A330. The Pentagon canceled
that deal in September after government auditors found the Air
Force had failed to follow its own rules in evaluating the rival
bids. The Air Force then was sidelined while the Pentagon took
over planning for the third effort to acquire the planes, which
are to start replacing the military's aging KC-135 tankers. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced last week that he was
putting the Air Force back in charge of the competition, although
his office would keep a ""robust oversight role."" In giving the Air Force control again, he said the United
States ""cannot afford the kind of letdowns and parochial squabbles
and corporate food fights that have bedeviled this effort over the
last number of years."" (Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa)

 (Adds lawmaker on trade spat in final paragraphs
) By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Lawmakers who back Boeing
Co  said they were considering legislative action to
ensure the Pentagon did not exempt Airbus parent EADS 
from U.S. export restrictions and other laws in a $35-billion
refueling aircraft competition that resumes this week. Todd Tiahrt, a Republican lawmaker from Kansas, home to a
big Boeing plant, said on Tuesday he expected to see a draft
request for proposals for the new competition on Thursday. The Air Force's third attempt to begin replacing its aging
KC-135 tankers is being closely watched by lawmakers supporting
Boeing, and those backing a rival bid by Northrop Grumman Corp
 and Europe's EADS. Northrop won a contract for 179 tankers in February 2008,
but the Pentagon canceled the deal in September 2008 after
government auditors found the Air Force had not followed its
own rules in evaluating the bids. Tiahrt said the Air Force needed to take into account a
preliminary World Trade Organization ruling, that concluded
Airbus' A330 and A340 planes benefited from about $5 billion in
illegal subsidies, when deciding which tankers to buy. He said the subsidies had already given Airbus an ""unfair
advantage"" in the commercial marketplace, costing Boeing jobs
in the United States. Now it was crucial to ensure that Boeing
was not disadvantaged in the tanker competition as well. ""That's why I think it's important that they include
recognition ... and financial acknowledgment of these illegal
subsidies,"" Tiahrt told reporters after touring a demonstrator
of the cockpit for Boeing's 767 tanker outside the Capitol. IRANIAN HELICOPTER SALES? Tiahrt said the Pentagon exempted the last Northrop bid
from export restrictions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
cost accounting standards, and rules on the foreign content of
specialty metals, and should not be allowed to do that again. He said EADS had pitched a small military helicopter at a
recent air show in Iran, raising concerns that it was
leveraging work done on the U.S. Army's UH-72 Light Utility
Helicopter into helicopter sales to a U.S. enemy. EADS spokesman Guy Hicks said his company scrupulously
adhered to every U.S. law that governs foreign sales and the
protection of national security and military technologies,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He said EADS was not marketing a version of the U.S. Army
helicopter to Iran, and any foreign sales of that helicopter
would be led by the U.S. government. Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said he was puzzled that
lawmakers were raising these issues again since they had been
addressed and debated during the last competition. ""Boeing's supporters must believe that disqualifying
Northrop Grumman's tanker offer is the only way to guarantee a
Boeing win, which implies that that they feel Boeing won't have
the best tanker for the warfighter,"" Belote said. LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS Depending on how the Air Force tanker request looks, Tiahrt
and other lawmakers could act to ensure the trade issue and
waivers are addressed in the new competition. ""We will look at legislative solutions,"" said
Representative Rick Larsen, a Democrat from Washington, where
Boeing has its largest manufacturing facilities. The Air Force exempted the trade issue from the last
competition and officials say the recent WTO ruling does not
require changes to the draft request for proposals. Boeing supporters say the preliminary WTO report upheld the
U.S. view that Airbus received illegal subsidies to the
detriment of Boeing, while Northrop backers say it concluded a
European loan mechanism was in fact legal. European Union Ambassador John Bruton said on Monday the
WTO ruling concluded launch aid was not automatically illegal,
but depended on the conditions under which it was given. Scott Hamilton, defense analyst with Leeham Co, said Boeing
supporters should be cautious about playing up the WTO issue,
since a separate European case against alleged illegal U.S.
subsidies to Boeing was also nearing an end. ""Be careful what you ask for,"" Hamilton said. ""I know
Northrop will bring the WTO up in the event Boeing is called
offside. Then what? Buy Russian?"" Larsen told Reuters that U.S. trade policy and defense
procurement were on a collision course, and it was up to the
White House to solve the problem. If the WTO concluded Boeing
had also benefited from illegal subsidies, then that should
also be reflected in the competition, he said. ""If, in fact, it's had an impact on the 767 then what's
good for the goose is good for the gander,"" Larsen said,
although he added it would be harder for the European Union to
prove its case since the 767 aircraft had been around for much
longer.

1462,"Sep 18, 2009 01:24PM ET",UPDATE 2-Airbus moves towards fresh European loans,nan," * Says loan talks with four governments going well * Confirms Spain to get 10 percent of work on next A350 jet * CEO says 2 more hard years; production to be cut if needed 
 (Adds quotes, details, Boeing comment) By Tim Hepher and Matthias Blamont PARIS, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Airbus said on Friday it was
making progress on securing European loans for its next
generation of passenger jet as its top executive warned of two
more tough years for the world's largest civil planemaker. The loans are likely to include more money from Spain, the
smallest of four national production partners in Airbus, whose
government said it was examining what funds to give. ""Spain is committed to the future of Airbus and if that
means contributing aid, it is being studied,"" an industry
ministry spokesman said in Madrid. ""But we haven't closed any
figures or taken any definitive decision."" French newspaper La Tribune reported that Spain was ready to
lend 300 million euros to the EADS subsidiary as its share of
loan funding. Airbus was provisionally offered 340 million pounds in loans
by Britain last month and is also negotiating with France and
Germany for advances on part of the 11 billion euro estimated
cost of building its next passenger jet, the mid-size A350. ""The talks with the (four) governments are proceeding well,""
Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said. Sources familiar with the matter said Airbus had also
finalised a shake-up of its European industrial network, which 
will see thousands of extra jobs created in Spain by doubling
that country's share of aircraft production to 10 percent with
work on the A350. Airbus confirmed the figure but denied any link between
workshare allocations and the availability of government loans. The system of government loans has been attacked by the
United States and it filed a complaint at the World Trade
Organization. Previous loans drew criticism in a confidential
draft verdict from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), according
to sources close to the case. The United States says the European loan system penalises
its workers and is no longer necessary to prop up Airbus, which
has overtaken Boeing as the world's largest jetmaker. ""Today Airbus and parent EADS have a bank balance of more
than 8 billion euros,"" Boeing spokesman Charlie Miller said. ""They have no need for financial support from the taxpayer
and should finance aircraft development with their own cash and
commercial loans."" Airbus has denied the loans are given on preferential terms. The European Union has said the WTO case on past loans does
not apply to the A350 but the United States says reverting to
the same pattern of funding could aggravate the WTO's largest
ever trade dispute. The EU has countered with a complaint at the WTO over Boeing
research deals.  TRADE-OFF Airbus has said that roughly half of its 55,000 workforce
would have a role of some kind in the A350 project. It employs
some 3,000 civil aircraft workers in Spain where tail sections
are made. Germany will lose 3 to 4 percent from previous production
levels to 34 percent on the A350, said the sources familiar with
the changes to Airbus's European industrial network. France will
slightly boost its share to 38 percent and assemble the A350. This is part of a previously agreed trade-off that will
ultimately result in a larger German role in the next generation
of Airbus's top-selling model, the single-aisle A320. The assembly line for the next single-aisle model, codenamed
A3OX and likely to be developed starting late in the next
decade, will be in Hamburg rather than split between Hamburg and
Toulouse. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in remarks published
in the Wall Street Journal on Friday that the EADS subsidiary
faced two further ""difficult"" years and did not rule out making
further production cuts if necessary to adjust to demand. Airbus last year suspended plans to increase production of
its top-selling single-aisle, A320-family jets to 40 planes a
month and in February this year it decided to cut back
production to 34 a month from 36 a month from October 2009. It also froze A330/A340 production at 8.5 aircraft a month. Airbus delivered an average of 32.75 A320-family jets a
month between January and August. Some airlines have cancelled orders and Airbus sales chief
John Leahy warned on Thursday of further cancellations over the
winter. However, Airbus said it was still on track to reach its
goal of matching last year's record deliveries of 483 planes.

1463,"Sep 18, 2009 08:15AM ET",ANALYSIS-European techs firms first to take dollar hit,nan," * U.S. dollar down 15 percent in 5 mths, 4 percent in 2 wks * European technology sector most exposed * Hedging to tame immediate impact  By Tarmo Virki and Ben Hirschler HELSINKI/LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A sharp fall in the
dollar threatens to hurt an incipient recovery in several
European industry sectors, with technology firms and some
drugmakers among the first to feel the pinch. The U.S. dollar has dropped almost 4 percent against the
euro in the last two weeks alone to around 1.47, as investor
risk appetite has increased, and the greenback is down 15
percent in the last five months. After sharp swings on the currency markets last year,
companies have learned to better hedge against potential losses,
analysts said, but the latest fall in the dollar is still
expected to impact many firms in the coming months. ""It's not all going to hit today but it's going to, stage by
stage,"" said Edmund Shing, equity derivatives strategist at BNP
Paribas in Paris. Within Europe the technology sector is the most exposed to
other currencies, with 64 percent of sales taking place outside
Europe. For the healthcare sector, 49 percent of sales were
outside Europe in their last fiscal year. (For graphics on sectors non-European sales exposure: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/099/EZ_SLSE0909.gif)  TECHS For the European technology sector, a weaker dollar means
lower sales and profits, but margins are hurt less as most of
the electronics components are priced in dollars. ""For the technology sector a weaker dollar causes quite a
lot of problems on the revenue line,"" said Richard Windsor,
technology specialist at Nomura. Jari Honko, analyst at eQ Bank in Helsinki, said the weaker
dollar is cutting sales at Europe's top technology firm Nokia
and hurting reported profits. Nokia is a small player in the U.S. phone market, with
smaller than 10 percent market share, but around 50 percent of
its annual sales of 50.7 billion are tied to dollar or
dollar-linked currencies. Even small changes in the currency market can have a
devastating effect on the consumer electronics industry because
profit margins are a narrow 5-6 percent at the best of times,
and often well below that. Technology makers across the board are impacted. ""The classic sectors that get hurt are areas based in
aerospace and defence,"" said BNP's Shing. ""EADS is a prime example because they export in dollars, and
their biggest competitor is the (U.S.-based) Boeing -- so
obviously that's a big help for Boeing and a big negative for
EADS in competitive terms,"" he said.  DRUGS Currency fluctuations are also a big swing factor for
European-based drugmakers, reflecting their global presence and
heavy exposure to the U.S. market. The strengthening of European currencies will remove a
favourable tailwind enjoyed by some firms in previous quarters. GlaxoSmithKline, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical company,
sells more than 40 percent of its products in the U.S. market
and has gained markedly from the weakness of sterling against
the dollar this year. However, many investors have learnt to look through such
currency effects to the underlying picture, helped by the
decision of many companies to give numbers that strip out
currency effects alongside reported results. Two of Europe's biggest pharmaceutical groups -- Novartis
and AstraZeneca -- have got around the problem by reporting in
dollars. Among drug companies reporting in euros, as opposed to
pounds or Swiss francs, exposure to the United States is less.
Sanofi-Aventis generates less than a third of its revenue in the
United States and Bayer under a quarter. Not all sectors are suffering, though, with some retailers
winning as they import from the Far East where their cost base
is in U.S. dollars and they sell in stronger euros or sterling
-- boosting their margins. UniCredit said provided the dollar's fall was gradual, it
did not expect a weakening to even 1.60 to change the positive
trend in the equities markets. ""An ""abrupt"" massive depreciation would, however, be
problematic, since it would signal a simultaneous loss of
confidence in the USD on the part of many investors and would
therefore point to a material change in the macro environment in
general,"" UniCredit said in a research note on Friday.

 By John Irish DUBAI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates low-cost
carrier Air Arabia is launching a new budget airline with an
Egyptian partner, enabling it to open its third hub and
diversify away from increased pressure in its home market. The Arab world's largest listed airline by market value said
on Wednesday it had set up the joint venture firm with Egypt's
Travco Group, driving shares almost 4 percent higher on the
news. ""The new carrier will serve Europe, Middle East and African
markets and will represent Air Arabia's third hub after UAE and
Morocco,"" Air Arabia said in a statement. The airline is facing growing competition from local rivals
including Kuwait's Jazeera Airways and Dubai-owned flydubai, as
well as from fully-fledged carriers such as Emirates, struggling
to cope with a sharp drop in international passenger travel. Air Arabia already operates in Morocco, flying from its
Casablanca hub earlier this year, and said in August it planned
to set up a new hub between its base at Sharjah, United Arab
Emirates and North Africa to diversify its revenues and boost
its catchment area.  Formed in 2003, it has a fleet of 20 Airbus A320 aircraft
and has placed an order for 44 more A320s, a unit of EADS. ""The pressure is in the market because there is a lot of
supply at the same time so the way they execute their business
is very important ... it's perfect in execution as we had
Morocco, now Egypt so it shows they are on the right path,""
Dheeraj Lakhwani, analyst at Dubai-based Prime Emirates said. Group Chief Executive Adel Ali told Reuters in an interview
in August that the next three to six months would remain
difficult for the industry, but said he was confident Air Arabia
would be in ""good shape"" in 2009 and beyond. The airline posted a 10 percent rise in second-quarter net
profit to 90 million dirhams ($24.50 million) last month. Prime Emirates' Lakhwani said he expected Egyptian
operations to begin within six months. The aviation sector received a strong blow in 2008 first
from rising fuel costs, then from the global financial crisis,
although low-cost carriers typically perform better in an
economic downturn than national carriers, by competing on price. Shares reversed some gains, but were up 2.86 percent to 1.08
dirhams at 0834 GMT in Dubai, outperforming the market, which
was up 0.5 percent.

 (Adds details, quotes) By Sui-Lee Wee HONG KONG, Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace giant Boeing
Co expects global air cargo traffic to return to growth next
year amid a broad economic recovery, with the United States and
China leading the way, a senior executive said on Wednesday. Air cargo growth typically leads economic and passenger
traffic growth by 3-6 months, Jim Edgar, Boeing's regional
director, cargo marketing, said at the Asian Aerospace Expo in
Hong Kong. ""This year, we're anticipating a deeper decline and it'll
be the first time in history that we'll have two years of
decline back to back,"" Edgar said, referring to worldwide cargo
traffic. ""The decline is slowing ... things are improving and we're
hopeful, but there's a way to go yet,"" he said, adding that
near-term certainties include the global economy, oil prices
and the stability of financial institutions. Generous stimulus packages from governments will prop up
the global economy, Edgar said. ""We expect the U.S. and China to lead the worldwide
recovery, followed by the EU, UK and Japan,"" he said. Air freight, a leading indicator of the health of world
trade, is picking up slowly, but is still down on last year and
the upturn remains fragile, the International Air Transport
Association (IATA) said last week. Airlines carried 11.3 percent less cargo in July than a
year earlier, according to IATA data. Boeing, like its European rival, EADS' Airbus unit, has had
a difficult year as carriers and air cargo operators have seen
less business during the global recession. The road to recovery for the airline industry still looks
bumpy for the current second half, said Randy Tinseth,
vice-president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""We're going into the worst part of the year -- it'll be a
pretty tough next 4-6 months,"" Tinseth said. ""But in 2010,
there'll be a bounce back in traffic."" On Tuesday, Airbus said it was seeing signs of recovery in
freight demand and expects a recovery in total passenger
traffic volume by 2010. Airbus and Boeing are headed for their worst annual order
tally in at least 15 years as struggling airlines cancel or
defer almost as many planes as they are buying. The world's airlines are expected to post 2009 losses of $9
billion, with first-half net losses hitting at least $6
billion, IATA has said.

1468,"Sep 08, 2009 10:12AM ET","WRAPUP 1-Airbus, Boeing trade blows after WTO edict",nan," * Airbus sticks by government loans after WTO aid ruling * Boeing executive says future Airbus A350 is subsidised * Airbus dismisses risk of fallout in U.S. defence contract  By Sui-Lee Wee and Alison Leung HONG KONG, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Airbus on Tuesday rejected
U.S. calls to renounce government loans for its next airliner
after the WTO gave a preliminary ruling against earlier loans,
while a Boeing executive hit out at unfair ""subsidies"". In an unpublished draft ruling on Friday, the World Trade
Organisation said government loans used to develop planes such
as the A380 superjumbo were ""actionable"" subsidies harming rival
Boeing, according to sources familiar with the case. It also ruled that some of the loans, including part of the
funds lent by governments to help build the A380, violated an
even tougher ban on export aid, the sources said. The findings, which came in a confidential 1,000-plus page
ruling, are the latest chapter in a decades-old battle between
Boeing and Airbus for dominance of the global aircraft market, a
major source of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The outcome of the case and a European Union counter-claim
against alleged U.S. support for Boeing could determine the
options for funding Airbus's next airliner model, the A350. Washington reacted angrily when Britain, which builds wings
for Airbus aircraft, said last month it would provide $565
million in further loans to help develop the mid-sized jet.
France, Germany and Spain are expected to follow suit. Airbus has ""absolutely no plans to change the funding for
the A350 at the moment,"" Christopher Buckley, executive
vice-president for Europe and Asia Pacific, said on Tuesday. ""From the Airbus point of view, we strongly believe, as
we've always done, that reimbursable launch aid is a very good
way of launching aircraft programmes,"" Buckley told Reuters in
an interview at the Asian Aerospace exhibition in Hong Kong.  COMPLEX DISPUTE Sources familiar with the WTO case said Washington failed in
a bid to ensure its complaint applied to future models such as
the A350 by describing the loans as one single pot of subsidies. But a Boeing executive renewed pressure on Airbus to give up
loans for the A350, which competes with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. ""I think the result of the trade case would determine
whether or not that direct subsidies are allowed,"" said Rob
Laird, vice president of China, East and Southeast Asia sales. ""I assume it will have implications on any new programme
that is not yet funded,"" he told Reuters in an interview. The 787 and A350 compete in the jet market's most promising
segment, covering long-range aircraft with 210-350 seats. Analysts say that could generate thousands of orders worth
hundreds of billions of dollars as prosperity returns in coming
decades. Airlines have so far ordered 850 787s and 493 A350s . ""We started selling it (787) in 2003,"" Laird said. ""We had a
few years head start, so is it appropriate then for a subsidised
product to come in afterwards and start selling and start taking
market share? That is an issue that has been debated."" Backed by their respective governments, the spat between
Airbus and Boeing, the biggest single U.S. exporter, has become
the WTO's most complex and commercially significant dispute. Washington says Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS, received a
boost equivalent to $205 billion in today's money from
advantageous loans and other perks from France, Germany, Spain
and Britain over two decades, giving it an unfair edge. Brussels argues the loans came on commercial terms and says
Boeing in turn got illegal subsidies from U.S. agencies
including NASA plus state tax breaks worth some $24 billion. Buckley said Airbus was not worried about the impact of the
WTO case on a potential $35 billion, 179-plane U.S. order for
air force refuelling tankers that Airbus, together with partner
Northrop Grumman, hopes to clinch against Boeing. Some Boeing backers in Congress want Airbus excluded from
the race if it is found to have benefited from subsidies. Brazil also has a stake in the outcome of the case since it
is locked in a long-running aviation subsidy row with Canada. Brazilian planemaker Embraer may sue in the European Court
of Justice over alleged UK subsidies to a Northern Irish
subsidiary of Canada's Bombardier, sources told newspaper Valor
Economico.

"
1470,"Sep 03, 2009 09:51AM ET",FACTBOX-The WTO legal process in the Airbus dispute,nan," Sept 3 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation is due to
issue a confidential ruling on Friday to the United States and
European Union in the case brought by Washington over subsidies
for EADS subsidiary Airbus. But the ruling does not mark the end of the case, launched
by the United States in October 2004. The prospect of trade
sanctions -- if ever approved -- is still far off and there are
many opportunities for appeals and other legal manoeuvres before
the dispute is finally settled. The next major deadline will come in about 6 months, when
the WTO issues a similar interim ruling in the counter-suit
brought by the EU against the United States over subsidies for
Boeing. At that point, when the legal outcome in both cases is
emerging, the two sides may decide to end the litigation and
negotiate a settlement. Otherwise, this is how the WTO legal system works:  CONSULTATIONS A country launches a trade dispute by seeking formal
consultations with another country over the issue. These last 60 days -- longer if the two parties wish --
after which the plaintiff can request the creation of a panel of
judges -- legal and trade experts -- to rule on the dispute. In this case the consultations lasted 8 months.  PANEL The panel is requested at a meeting of the WTO's dispute
settlement body (DSB), held once a month. The respondent can reject the first request, but it goes
through automatically on the second request unless all WTO
members including the plaintiff agree to block it. In this case the United States requested a panel in May
2005, the EU rejected it at a DSB meeting in June, and it was
finally set up in July 2005. The panel should be formed within 20 days, with both parties
agreeing on all 3 judges sitting on it. If they cannot agree
they can ask the WTO director-general to compose the panel,
within another 10 days. The United States asked the director-general to do that in
October 2005, and the panel was formed later that month.  THE RULING WTO panels usually aim to issue a ruling, or report, to the
parties within 6 months of being formed. But they can take
longer in a complex case. This report is confidential and is not officially published.
However the final report, usually circulated to all WTO members
and published on the WTO website 2-3 months later, rarely
differs from the confidential interim ruling. In this case the panel advised the WTO in April 2006 that it
could not complete its work within 6 months. The ruling has been
delayed repeatedly since then. It is this confidential, interim
ruling that was issued to the parties on Friday.  THE APPEAL Once the final ruling has been published, it will be adopted
by the WTO within 60 days, at the next meeting of the DSB. If
necessary, the plaintiff will call a special meeting of the DSB
to adopt the report. However, within that 60 days, either party can appeal. The appeal -- looking at whether the original panel observed
trade law in coming to its decision, rather than re-examining
the facts of the case -- is heard by three members drawn from
the WTO's seven-member Appellate Body of trade law experts. They must deliver their ruling -- upholding or overturning
all or part of the original panel's findings -- within 90 days. WTO members must accept or reject the appeal ruling within
30 days, at a meeting of the DSB. It can only be rejected by
consensus -- that is with no member objecting to the rejection.  COMPLIANCE If the panel or appellate body have found against the
respondent, they generally recommend that it should bring its
trade practice in line with WTO rules. Once the WTO has adopted the original panel or appeal ruling
at the DSB, the respondent has a ""reasonable period of time"" to
make these changes and conform with the rules. Both parties may agree the reasonable period of time within
45 days of adoption, or put it to arbitration, which takes up to
90 days. The period is usually 15 months from adoption.  COMPLIANCE DISPUTES If the respondent believes the plaintiff has failed to
comply with the ruling in the reasonable period of time, it can
launch another dispute to determine compliance. This involves the same process of consultations, panel and
appeal. But it works to a tighter time-frame, with the panel
usually delivering a ruling within 90 days.  SANCTIONS An appeal to a compliance dispute is the end of the line.
Now the plaintiff can seek retaliation to compensate it for the
losses it has suffered by the respondent's illegal behaviour,
until the respondent implements the ruling. This could involve a retaliatory increase in tariffs in the
product concerned or similar goods, or ""cross-retaliation"" in
another area, for instance lifting copyright or protection of
intellectual property rights for goods like software of music. The two sides may agree on compensation, or they may go to
arbitration over the size and scope of retaliation. The
arbitrator should deliver a decision within 60 days.

 (Updates with ANA, JAL comments) By Karen Jacobs and Deepa Seetharaman ATLANTA/NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on
Thursday its 787 Dreamliner would finally make its first flight
by the end of this year, with initial delivery expected in the
fourth quarter of 2010, and its shares shot up 8 percent. Shares of the Chicago-based company rose to a five-month high
as the statement helped answer questions that have surrounded the
lighter, more fuel-efficient 787 aircraft, said Alex Hamilton, an
analyst with Jesup & Lamont Securities. ""There was a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of the chatter on
the street was 'Would this aircraft ever fly?'"" he said. ""It sort
of ends the uncertainty."" Standard & Poor's Equity Research upgraded Boeing shares to
""buy"" from ""hold"". Boeing, the No.2 plane maker behind EADS unit Airbus, said it
expects its 787 programme to be profitable eventually, but also
plans to take a third-quarter charge to write off the cost of the
first three test-flight planes, which it says have no commercial
value because of extensive modifications. The date of the first test flight has been put off repeatedly
because of production problems and a two-month labour strike,
hurting Boeing's credibility as it grapples with the commercial
aerospace slump. The latest delay was in June, when Boeing said the plane
would not fly as scheduled during the second quarter so it could
reinforce a side-of-body section. The June delay was the 787 project's fifth, with the first
coming in 2007. ""Risk remains the new schedule could slip given the current
challenge of re-fitting the wing-body join, the possibility of
changes to the electrical and environmental control systems and
simply the poor 787 track record,"" Credit Suisse analyst Robert
Spingarn said in a note to clients. Boeing told analysts on a conference call that it had ""a high
degree of confidence"" in the fix for the structural problem that
caused the latest 787 delay, and had done a thorough analysis. BIG PRETAX CHARGE The third-quarter charge will be a result of reclassifying
costs from the first three test planes as
research-and-development expenses versus programme inventory. The
change will create an estimated non-cash pretax charge of $2.5
billion, or $2.21 a share, against third-quarter results.Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.21 a share for the
third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. ""This is money that was already spent and this is money that
they're reclassifying as an R&D expense ... The message should be
clear -- it's still an economically viable aircraft,"" Hamilton
said. Fitch Ratings said the 787 programme has potential long-term
credit benefits if Boeing successfully executes the updated plan. ""But Fitch is still concerned about the program given that
(Boeing) still needs to achieve first flight, certification, and
a successful production ramp-up,"" the agency wrote. The revolutionary carbon-composite 787 has been lauded for
its fuel-efficiency. About 850 of the planes have been ordered. The Dreamliner's delivery delays are making some customers
dissatisfied, however, with Japanese airlines including launch
customer All Nippon Airways mulling a possible compensation
claim. ""We understand the need to make the best and safest aircraft
possible and appreciate that delays due to engineering issues of
the current nature must be solved in order to move forward,"" All
Nippon, which has 55 of the planes on order, said in a statement. ""However, as a launch customer and future operator of the
787, the length of this further delay is a source of great
dismay, not to say frustration,"" All Nippon said. An ANA spokesman said the company will look into the
possibility of compensation once it knows the actual delivery
schedule and can assess the effect of the delays on its business. Japan Airlines (JAL), Asia's biggest carrier by revenues, has
ordered 35 of the planes. It said it will look into every option
including a compensation claim against Boeing once the delivery
schedule and the effect on its business plans is clear. Boeing said it projects achieving a production rate of 10
Dreamliners per month by late 2013, and was evaluating where to
locate a second production line. While it is not selling the first three test flight 787
planes, Boeing said it still expected to market three other
test-flight 787s. Boeing shares rose 8.4 percent or $4.00 to $51.82 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen about 18 percent since
June 23, when the latest 787 delay was announced.

 (Adds details and background) Aug 25 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation is expected
to deliver a mixed ruling next week in the U.S. case against EU
launch aid for Airbus allowing both sides to claim victory,
sources with knowledge of the case said on Tuesday. The preliminary ruling is expected to be followed in the
next six months by a WTO decision in a countersuit brought by
the European Union over U.S. support for Boeing airliners. Brussels and Washington have been embroiled in a bitter
multi-billion-dollar transatlantic dispute over subsidies given
to the world's top two plane makers hit by the worst economic
crisis in nearly 80 years. ""The WTO report will be handed over to EU and U.S. diplomats
in Geneva on Friday, Sept. 4,"" a source told Reuters on
condition on anonymity. ""The ruling will be handed over to officials from Brussels

received 22 cancellations.  But that still leaves the European manufacturer far ahead of
U.S. rival Boeing, whose 85 new orders in the first half stand
against 84 cancellations caused by a slump in demand from
airline companies rocked by a huge fall in demand for flights. MIXED RULING Sources said it was still unclear how the panel of WTO
judges would rule next week and said they expect both sides to
be successful on a number of the points being argued in the case
which began in 2005. ""One thing is certain. It will be complicated and most
likely mixed,"" a second source said. ""The devil will be in the detail. The U.S. can expect to win
on a number of points, but lose on some other areas.""  If the U.S. administration and Boeing are successful, the
decision could prevent EU governments from sinking further
launch aid into Airbus -- a subsidiary of EADS -- for its new 11
billion euro ($15.72 billion) A350 airliner. French and German ministers discussed possible government
loans for the A350 at the Paris air show in June, and Britain
has also made an offer of financing.    New U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk has made it clear that Washington would
challenge such aid at the WTO. Both sides argue that the industry, in which governments
play a big role, needs clarification over what counts as illegal
subsidies, especially as new entrants such as Canada's
Bombardier and Chinese manufacturers are planning to compete in
the long-haul aircraft market.

 (Adds further business minister, Airbus quotes, background) By John Bowker and Matt Scuffham LONDON/BRISTOL, England, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Britain pledged
340 million pounds ($565 million) in loans to European
planemaker Airbus to win work, in a move set to aggravate a
transatlantic dispute over aerospace industry aid. Britain agreed to the loan on Friday to make sure parts for
Airbus's planned A350 widebody passenger jet are built in
Britain, but it is likely to face fierce opposition from the
United States and Airbus's arch rival Boeing. Business minister Peter Mandelson, at Airbus's Filton plant,
near Bristol, western England, said the support package would
create and sustain more than 1,200 jobs there and at Broughton,
north Wales, as well as more than 5,000 jobs in the supply chain
across Britain. Airbus, owned by European aerospace company EADS, has been
looking for loans from European governments to help get the 11
billion euro ($15.7 billion) project off the ground, in exchange
for work to be shared out around the continent. Germany would provide 1.1 billion euros and France 1.4
billion, German and French officials have said. However, the loans have been disputed and the World Trade
Organisation is expected to deliver a preliminary ruling in the
first week of September in a case brought by the United States
against European Union launch aid for Airbus. A report into a
counter suit by the EU over Boeing subsidies will follow. ""It's senseless tit for tat ... There are two legal cases,
one launched by the U.S., one by me (when Trade Commissioner at
the EC). I did not welcome it, or seek it, but it was inevitable
once the Americans started down this course,"" said Mandelson. Mandelson said the cash was not a handout, saying it would
generate a return for the taxpayer. ""It's not a subsidy. It's an
investment, and from an investment you get a return. It will
bring a commercial return in royalties paid as production and
sales get under way."" Airbus, which has nearly 500 firm orders for the A350 from
30 customers, has estimated the market at 2,500.
 The A350 will launch next decade and is intended to compete
with Boeing's much-delayed 787 Dreamliner. Britain's investment will ensure 18 percent of the work will
take place in Britain. The Airbus plant in Filton has 4,000
employees and designs and builds wings. It is also earmarked to
build wings for the heavily delayed A400M military transport. A spokeswoman for Airbus said terms and conditions of each
loan -- including one to help build the giant A380 -- were
confidential, although she claimed the company had repaid double
an investment in the A320 due to royalties from sales.

after hitting their highest close for 8-1/2 months in the
previous session, as Deutsche Bank led banks lower and BP's
results put pressure on energy stocks. Weak U.S. consumer confidence also weighed on the market and
overshadowed news that U.S. single-family home prices rose in
May from April, the first monthly rise in nearly three years. U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in July,
the Conference Board said, recording its second consecutive
decline as sentiment remained hampered by a difficult job
market. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed
down 1 percent at 902.85 points. Volumes on the index were about
87 percent of the 90-day daily average. Banks were among the worst hit. Deutsche Bank sank over 11
percent after it raised its loan loss provisions in the second
quarter, overshadowing a nearly 70 percent rise in net profit
driven by its investment banks. BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Deutsche Postbank lost between 2.8 and 5.5 percent. However, BBVA advanced 4.5 percent after reporting its core
capital rose to 7.1 percent in the first half, supporting the
bank's recent declarations that it had no need for a capital
hike. ""The earnings season seems to be better than analysts'
expectations on an aggregate level. So far it seems to be
because cost cutting has been very effective ... improving
profitability despite declines in sales on top line,"" said Mark
Bon, a fund manager at Canada Life. ""There is some expectation that once you have this phase of
cost cutting there is a return of some top line growth from
refilling the inventory pipeline, an increase in sales,"" he
said, adding that it would be an importance phase for the market
to return to healthy earnings growth though it could be a long
process. The FTSEurofirst 300 has gained 40 percent since reaching a
lifetime low in early March, and is up 8.5 percent for the year. Oil producers were other standout losers after BP said it
had increased its cost reduction targets for 2009 by 50 percent
to $3 billion but reported a halving in second-quarter profits
due to lower oil prices and weaker refining margins. BP was 3.1 percent lower, while BG Group, Total and
StatoilHydro lost 2.1-2.8 percent. Miners were also weaker, with Xstrata down 6.5 percent
despite posting solid first-half production numbers. Anglo
American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Eurasian Natural Resources
 fell 3.1-6.9 percent. ""There is a little bit of rotation into stocks which lagged
behind and a little bit of profit taking on things that have run
very well recently,"" Bon said. ""It's a good development, as even
stocks that have lagged behind have the chance to be bought as
well."" Across Europe Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.3 percent -- ending
a record-equalling 11th-day winning run, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 lost 1.5 and 1.2 percent, respectively. LAGARDERE, DRUGMAKERS SUPPORT Lagardere soared more than 5 percent amid news that the
media group had been provisionally cleared by France's stock
market regulator in a long-running probe into suspected insider
trading at Airbus parent EADS. EADS, which Lagardere owns 7.5 percent, gained 2.3 percent,
benefiting from solid second-quarter results. Defensive drugmakers offered some support, with Novo Nordisk
, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA and Sanofi-Aventis up
0.7-3.1 percent. ""There is this sentiment in the market about the glass being
half full -- but there is a big gap between the euphoria and

forecast * New provision on A400M, more seen in H2 * Key shareholders cleared in insider trading probe 
 (Adds lawyer comment, EADS comment, combines items) By Tim Hepher and Matthias Blamont PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS rallied
investors by hiking cash forecasts and maintaining other goals
on Tuesday, despite only temporarily putting off a major defence
writedown and expressing concerns over A380 superjumbo costs. The reassurances, given as the aviation industry endures a
punishing financial crisis, diverted attention from a 23 percent
drop in operating profit in the first half and pushed shares in
Europe's largest aerospace group up by as much as 7 percent. In a separate boost, the company's two most important
industrial shareholders -- French media group Lagardere and
German car firm Daimler -- announced they had been provisionally
cleared of insider trading. Lagardere owns 7.5 percent and Daimler owns 22.5 percent of
EADS, which suffered a dramatic fall in share prices in June
2006 when it announced worsening delays in A380 deliveries. The 2006 share price fall triggered a probe into what
executives and core shareholders knew before selling stock. A lawyer with access to the judicial file said French
regulator AMF had provisionally concluded seven people,
including former co-CEO Noel Forgeard, had dealt shares while in
possession of confidential information.  He is among five people targeted in a separate criminal
probe, all of whom deny wrongdoing. The lawyer said serving Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders,
who last year dubbed the probe a ""show trial"", had been cleared. EADS said it reaffirmed confidence in managers involved in
the affair. The AMF will give a definitive report at end-year. The lengthy probe has had little visible day-to-day impact
on EADS, but the lack of resolution had kept the embers warm on
Franco-German tensions that once threatened to break apart the
company, only a few years after its creation in 2000. Tensions between French and German factories were at the
heart of the A380 production crisis that wiped a quarter off
EADS's value and led to a series of management shake-ups. Chief Executive Louis Gallois said on Tuesday EADS was still
delivering A380s at too high a cost and ordered a review. But EADS reaffirmed its goal of delivering 14 A380s in 2009
and at least matching a record total of 483 Airbus deliveries it
made last year, leading to ""roughly stable"" group revenues. It said it would consume 1 billion euros ($1.43 billion) of
free cashflow in 2009 instead of 1.5 billion earlier forecast.  At 1345 GMT its shares were up 3.5 percent at 13.17 euros.  A400M PROVISIONS Three years after the A380 crisis, it is a military plane,
the delayed A400M troop and heavy equipment lifter, which poses
the greatest financial risk to EADS, Gallois told analysts. EADS has booked 2.4 billion euros of charges on Europe's
costliest defence project, running four years late, including 71
million in the second quarter. It faces major new provisions
once negotiations with buyers are concluded around end-2009. Seven European NATO nations that ordered the heavy airlifter
agreed on Friday to renegotiate the contract. Cancelling it
would have forced EADS to pay back 6 billion euros of advances. ""The A400M has been a big concern. It is now more obvious
that the contract will not be cancelled as some had speculated,""
said Markus Turnwald, analyst at DZ Bank in Frankfurt. First-half group operating profit fell 23 percent to 888
million euros with revenues rising 2 percent to 20.195 billion
euros. Cost cuts failed to offset recent dollar weakness and
lower plane prices. Net profits fell 6 percent to 378 million. Airbus remains the world's biggest manufacturer of large
passenger jets ahead of Boeing as it heads for another year of
record deliveries which dominate EADS revenues. But these are
from a previous order boom and current markets look bleak. ""Even if traffic recovers, we know some airlines are weak
and we will appreciate the length and the depth of the crisis
next year. We can't have a full evaluation today,"" Gallois said. Low-cost Ryanair reminded investors of that with a profit
warning on Monday, hitting the sector. EADS said it was sticking to a target of up to 300 new jet
orders in 2009, though some analysts say the figure is symbolic
since the busier first half only yielded 90 orders and it will
not affect revenues for some years due to production lag times. Boeing last week beat expectations with a 17 percent rise in
second-quarter profit but to the disappointment of some analysts
did not say when its delayed 787 would fly.

1477,"Jul 21, 2009 02:32PM ET",CORRECTED - Boeing sees late August WTO ruling in Airbus case,nan," (Corrects description of Robert Novick in para 5 to legal
adviser to Boeing, not adviser to U.S. government) * Boeing expects WTO Airbus ruling late Aug/early Sept * Repeats warning against Airbus aid for A350  By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, July 21 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation is
likely to deliver a preliminary ruling in the U.S. case against
EU launch aid for Airbus [ARBU.UL] around the end of August,
officials from rival Boeing  said on Tuesday. The ruling, to be followed about six months later by a
decision in a countersuit brought by the European Union over
U.S. support for Boeing airliners, would be a first attempt at
resolving the multi-billion-dollar Transatlantic dispute. ""We trust both governments will take the WTO decision on
board, and we will see the end of aircraft subsidies,"" Boeing
Vice-President for Government Operations Ted Austell said. The WTO panel of judges formed to examine the dispute in
2005 said last October that the case was so complex that it
could not rule on it until some time this year. Robert Novick, an attorney with law firm Wilmer Hale, who is
an outside legal adviser to Boeing on the case, said the panel
had advised the U.S. and EU authorities that it hoped to give
them an interim, confidential, ruling in the week of Aug. 31.  LAUNCH AID Both Austell and Novick said Boeing hoped that with a ruling
imminent, EU governments would not provide further launch aid to
Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS , for its new 11 billion
euro ($15.63 billion) A350 airliner. French and German ministers discussed possible government
loans for the A350 at the Paris air show in June, and Britain
has also made an offer of financing. [ID:nLF457914]
[ID:nL768958] New U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk has made it clear
that Washington would challenge such aid at the WTO. ""We're hoping the governments won't do something precipitous
before the WTO decision,"" Novick told Reuters. Boeing argues that the industry, in which governments play a
big role, needs clarification over what counts as illegal
subsidies, especially as new entrants such as Canada's
Bombardier  and Chinese manufacturers are planning to
compete in the long-haul aircraft market. ""Boeing and Airbus, the United States and the EU, have a
shared interest. They want to make sure that as the industry
expands there is sufficient clarity quickly as to what the rules
of competition are going to be,"" Austell told Reuters. Many rulings in WTO disputes are mixed, and Novick conceded
that decisions on some aspects of the case could go against the
U.S. government. But it is confident it will win on the main
issue. ""No one is going to come away from the report unsure that
launch aid is a subsidy,"" he said. With a first ruling approaching, there is little chance that
the case will be resolved by negotiation. Kirk and EU trade chief Catherine Ashton have met several
times and agreed to try and settle some disputes bilaterally
rather than through litigation. A long-running row over an EU
ban on imports of U.S. beef treated with hormones was settled in
this way. ""They've had the opportunity to get together a couple of
times... Our understanding is this matter was not part of the
discussions,"" Austell said.   In the first half of this year Airbus sold 90 planes, and
received 22 cancellations. But that leaves it far ahead of
Boeing, whose 85 new orders in the first half stand against 84
cancellations. [ID:nL8720597]

Timothy Geithner will seek to reassure Gulf Arab states this
week that U.S. dollar assets they hold in large quantities
remain a strong investment. A recent decline in Saudi foreign assets shows the purchase
of U.S. treasuries by Washington's Gulf allies, five having
currencies pegged to the dollar, at levels seen in the past
decades should no longer be taken for granted. Geithner, offering assurances on the United States' ability
to pull out of recession, is combining a visit to Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, the Arab world's largest and
second-largest economies, with a trip to Europe. He is unlikely to encounter any challenge to the dollar's
global dominance on his visit to the world's biggest oil
exporting region, analysts and diplomats said. China and Russia have expressed concerns about the weakened
U.S. currency staying as the only dominant reserve currency. But
Beijing, which itself holds large quantities of U.S. assets,
suggests any change would be a long-term affair. ""The U.S. is looking to reassure Saudi Arabia and the GCC
(Gulf Cooperation Council) countries on the outlook of the
dollar and U.S. investments given the challenges for the U.S.
economy and fiscal position,"" said Monica Malik, a regional
economist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. Riyadh-based analyst John Sfakianakis added the trip was ""an
important customer visit to one of the biggest holders of U.S.
government paper and a seminal dollar supporter"". U.S. officials played down expectations that Geithner would
pursue any major initiatives, but indicated that one of the aims
was to ensure foreign investors would not lose faith in the
United States as a primary target for their investments. ""We will want to reiterate that we're open to foreign
investment from the region,"" a U.S. official said.Malik said realignments in world trade had already made their
mark on GCC reserves. ""There is already likely to have been a diversification of
GCC reserves in terms of currencies over the last few years
given the dollar weakness and the expanding trade with Asia and
Europe,"" said Malik. Saudi net foreign assets have fallen by around 183 billion
riyals ($48.80 billion) since November, according to central
bank data, as the world's biggest oil exporter dips into
reserves built up over decades thanks to high crude prices. Central Bank Governor Mohammad al-Jasser said in May the
kingdom was not selling any foreign assets but was drawing on 
reserves to continue spending to keep the economy going.
 Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf told Reuters in May the
G20 member kept diverse foreign exchange reserves, broadly
reflecting trends in the kingdom's trade and needs.
  TRADE COMPETITION Geithner will address Saudi business leaders on Tuesday in
Jeddah before holding talks in the UAE on Wednesday. The United States is still the main trading partner for
Saudi Arabia but Asian or European countries are making inroads. A consortium including China Railway Construction Corp
<0390.HK> <601390.SS> won a Saudi infrastructure deal worth $1.8
billion, while European aerospace group (EADS)  just won
its second defence contract in the kingdom, beating U.S. firms. Another purpose of Geithner's visit was to to make sure
regional investors were not still put off by the political
controversy that followed Dubai's DP World's 
acquisition in 2006 of a British firm that would have given it
control over some U.S. ports. Some U.S. lawmakers objected on national security grounds
and state-owned DP World eventually transferred the operation of
the terminals to an American entity. ""We have a new process post-DPW and we want to make sure the
process is fair and transparent and predictable, that it focuses
appropriately on real national security concerns,"" the U.S.
official said.

1479,"Jul 02, 2009 06:50AM ET",France confident UK won't quit A400M - source,nan," PARIS, July 2 (Reuters) - France is confident Britain will
commit to the Airbus  A400M military transport plane but
disagreements remain over how to share out the costs of delays
to the programme, a French presidency source said on Thursday. The A400M, which would be built by European planemaker
Airbus , has faced repeated production delays and cost
overruns. European nations involved in the project on June 22
postponed a decision on whether to commit to it for good. ""The question is to know ... what balance we are going to
find between the states and (Airbus parent) EADS to overcome
both scheduling and financing difficulties,"" said the senior
official at President Nicolas Sarkozy's office. The source was speaking to reporters ahead of a summit in
France on Monday between Sarkozy and British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown, during which the A400M will be discussed. British defence procurement minister Quentin Davies
signalled during a meeting on the A400M last month in Spain that
much progress needed to be made to rescue the 20 billion euro
($28 billion) troop and equipment transporter. Davies declined to say whether Britain would remain part of
the programme, which also involves France, Germany, Spain,
Belgium, Luxembourg and Turkey. Asked whether the British were preparing to drop out, the
French presidency source said: ""The answer is no."" The official said Britain, like other countries involved in
the A400M including France and Germany, faced tough budget
constraints due to the recession. ""At the same time, the fact is that Britain and France need
transport planes and will have to buy some one way or the other. ""The cost of abandoning the project would be much higher
than the cost of continuing with it because we would have to add
up the cost to EADS, and thus to the states which are
shareholders in the company, and the cost of buying the planes
we need from someone else."" ""Thus we have all reached the same wise conclusion, which is
to continue this great enterprise,"" the source said. Brown and Sarkozy would certainly discuss how long to allow
for negotiations on sharing the costs of the delays, the source
said, mentioning one month, three months or six months as
possible timeframes. ""It's a very difficult discussion given the general context,
but the will to succeed is there,"" the source said. The seven nations involved in the A400M met last month to
decide whether to agree to a renegotiation of the contract
requested by Airbus Military. Airbus says the original contract signed in 2003 is too
restrictive for a complex defence project and blames part of the
delay on political interference in the choice of suppliers. The countries agreed to extend a moratorium allowing time
for discussions to the end of July. The French presidency source said what was important at this
stage was ""to allow ourselves all the time we need"" and Sarkozy
would make that point to Brown on Monday.

1480,"Jun 25, 2009 11:17AM ET",WRAPUP 2-Trade ministers seek Doha progress for Pittsburgh G20,nan," * Trade ministers say Doha talks in end-game * Aim for progress by G20 Pittsburgh summit in September * Boosting trade an economic stimulus * Protectionism a threat as trade volumes contract  By Jonathan Lynn PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - Trade ministers want to point to
concrete progress in the long-running Doha round to free up
world trade in time for September's G20 summit in Pittsburgh,
Australia said on Thursday. Trade Minister Simon Crean, speaking after a meeting of his
foriegn counterparts in Paris hosted by Australia, said
completing Doha would help pull the world out of the economic
crisis because trade itself was an economic stimulus. ""The result of today's meeting was a restatement by
ministers that we now are in the end-game of negotiations,""
Crean told a news conference. The Doha round was launched in late 2001 to help poor
countries prosper through trade, but in the nearly eight years
since then the talks have stumbled repeatedly as trading powers
clashed over proposals to cut tariffs and subsidies on goods
from food to chemicals. Crean said there was a new willingness to work together on a
deal, spurred by the recession that was hitting developing
countries hardest. ""I think the big dynamic that's changed is that leaders have
said we want Doha concluded and we stand ready to assist in
bringing it to that conclusion,"" Crean said. World Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General Pascal Lamy
said the challenge now was to convert the improved atmospherics
into a concrete deal. ""The mood music is now more congenial and it's playing at a
faster pace. We now must shift from mood music to dance music,""
he told the news conference.  TALKING TO EACH OTHER Earlier U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk called for a new
approach to the Doha talks, involving direct negotiations with
key trading partners as the traditional multilateral format was
not working. From the current incomplete package of deals it was clear
what the United States would give up but hard to see exactly
what it would gain, he said, given the many exceptions to an
overall agreement for various countries, making the deal opaque. ""We think getting more clarity around that may be the key to
helping us find a solution to a way forward,"" Kirk said after a
meeting of ministers at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). Developing countries had expressed fears they could be
strong-armed into an unbalanced deal through a one-on-one
approach. But participants in the meeting at the Australian embassy
said there was acceptance the WTO's traditional multilateral
negotiations could be complemented by one-on-one talks to
provide clarity about a likely deal, indicating a looming
obstacle to the talks had been removed. ""Until they believe they're in the end-game nobody's going
to do the kind of bilateral deal-making that's required,"" said
one official. ""People will talk when they need to talk,"" added the WTO
ambassador of one big emerging country. Kirk has also called on big emerging countries to open their
markets further to foreign goods to help secure a Doha deal. But the trade ministers from India, Brazil and South Africa,
meeting on the sidelines of the OECD, rejected that call. ""At this final stage of negotiations, in the midst of the
worst economic environment since the Great Depression of the
1930s, it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to assume that
further unilateral concessions from developing countries will be
forthcoming, especially in the context of the current economic
crisis,"" the three ministers said in a statement. The Doha talks have been effectively on ice since a meeting
of ministers last July failed to clinch an outline agreement,
although Lamy said it had completed 80 percent of a deal. A number of positive comments in recent weeks, not least
from Kirk and his new Indian counterpart Anand Sharma, have
kindled hopes the talks could resume shortly. WTO chief Lamy told the OECD meeting that completing Doha
was all the more important because trade was expected to
contract by 10 percent this year -- 14 percent in developed
countries and 7 percent in developing countries. Figures from the International Air Transport Association
IATA suggested global trade was still far from recovery. Demand for cross-border air freight dropped 17.4 percent
year-on-year in May, IATA reported. Lamy said the economic crisis underlying the trade
contraction was giving rise to protectionist pressures, as a
group of 11 small and medium-sized export-led economies called
at the OECD meeting for an early conclusion of the Doha round to
help fight protectionism. Both Kirk and China's WTO ambassador Sun Zhenyu said a
series of recent trade disputes launched by the United States
and China against each other at the WTO showed a willingness to
resolve differences by the rules and were a sign of mature
trading relationships rather than growing trade tensions. But Kirk said the United States would not hesitate to make a
legal challenge to launch aid for the new Airbus A350 passenger
jet and A400M military plane. He said the United States expected a result by the end of

 (Adds quotes, details, combines stories, adds byline) By Jonathan Lynn PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - The United States wants to
negotiate directly with individual major trading partners to
push forward the World Trade Organisation's Doha round, U.S.
Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Thursday. Kirk told a news conference that pursuing the negotiations
in the traditional multilateral way would no longer work. ""We believe we have to start with an honest assessment that
continuing on the same path that we have engaged in for the last
three rounds will most likely yield the same result and that
would be a failure to come to a successful conclusion,"" he said. Kirk has also called on big emerging countries such as
Brazil, China and India to open up their markets more to foreign
goods to help secure a deal. The big developing countries are resisting that call as well
as the push for bilateral talks, which they fear could be used
by the United States to reopen the incomplete package agreed by
trade ministers last July as a basis for a Doha deal. Most of the WTO's 153 members see that package as the
starting point for finalising an deal on talks launched in late
2001 to free up world trade and help poor countries export more. But Kirk said the United States still did not have a clear
idea of what benefits it would receive from a deal, because the
many exceptions to an overall agreement made the deal opaque. ""We think getting more clarity around that may be the key to
helping us find a solution to a way forward,"" Kirk said.  HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP Kirk said he did not believe that recent disputes launched
by the United States and China against each other at the WTO
were a sign of increasing trade tensions. ""Dispute resolution is a healthy sign of a mature trading
relationship,"" Kirk said. The United States and European Union launched a case against
China on Tuesday for restricting exports of industrial raw
materials. [ID:nN231104] China has also asked for a WTO panel to resolve a dispute
with the United States over imports of Chinese poultry after
consultations failed to settle the row. ""We are very hopeful with the EU also filing that we may be
able to engage China in a more robust discussion that will allow
us to resolve this,"" Kirk said. But he warned European countries the United States would not
hesitate to make a legal challenge to launch aid for the new
Airbus [ARBU.UL] A350 passenger jet and A400M military plane. ""If they do move forward with that, we will respond quickly
and swiftly and file another action within the WTO,"" he said. Kirk said the United States expected a result by the end of
August in an existing case brought against the EU over earlier
launch aid for Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS . The EU has
filed a counter-case against U.S. state support for Boeing

1482,"Jun 19, 2009 09:16AM ET",UPDATE 1-Europe races to avoid split over A400M plane,nan," * European nations split on conditions for A400M talks * UK financing proposal unlikely to be accepted -sources * Defence ministers to hold crucial meeting on Monday  (Adds quotes, background) By Tim Hepher PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - European nations are divided over
conditions for a new round of talks on the delayed A400M troop
plane and are racing to ease the deadlock ahead of a ministerial
meeting on Monday, sources following the matter said on Friday.
  After threatening to pull out of the 20 billion euros 
($27.84 billion) Airbus project, Britain has signalled
commitment in principle to the European transporter but has put
forward financial conditions that other partners are unlikely to
accept, the sources said. ""Britain has made a two-fold financing proposal which is
highly unlikely to be acceptable,"" a source familiar with the
project said. Details of the proposals were under wraps, but a UK military
source defended them as a ""sign of commitment and pragmatism"". Manufacturer Airbus and its parent EADS declined comment. Britain has ordered 25 planes worth about 100 million euros
each. It has said it needs the troop and equipment transport
planes in Afghanistan but the UK's Treasury is carefully vetting
defence spending amid heightened pressure on public finances. The A400M dispute comes weeks after tough negotiations over
the next phase of production of the Eurofighter Typhoon, which
went down to the wire before the UK agreed to stay on board. ""Britain has problems with its budget and others have their
own problems too. There is a detailed negotiation going on,"" a
senior industry source said on Friday. Another described the talks as ""touch and go"".  HIGH-TECH JOBS  Defence companies have warned Britain could lose thousands
of high-tech jobs if its pulls out of the A400M and questions
have been raised over how long Airbus, the world's largest civil
planemaker, would keep aircraft wings production in the UK. The A400M transport plane is designed to carry troops and
equipment to combat zones like Afghanistan but has been delayed
about four years. Facing losses on the plane, Airbus parent EADS
, has asked for a renegotiation of the contract. Buyers agreed a three-month moratorium preventing either
side from taking drastic action over the project but this
expires at the end of June with no sign of a common approach. Defence ministers from the seven European NATO nations that
ordered the plane -- Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium,
Luxembourg and Turkey -- meet in Seville, Spain, on Monday to
decide whether to extend the moratorium. France and Germany last week backed the A400M and called for
a further freeze of six months to allow more negotiations. Often described as a laggard in European negotiations,
Britain is anxious to avoid being boxed in and has surprised
some partners by being particularly active on the A400M talks. But others accuse it of trying to impose pre-conditions on
future talks that other nations will find difficult to accept.
 ""They want to be able to get in front and preset conditions
on which they will enter the next six months of talks. Others
are saying no, we'll have the six months first,"" a source said. If the project collapses, EADS would be forced to repay 5.7
billion euros in advance government payments. It has said it has
spent the money on development and is now burning some 100
million euros a month of cash to keep the project in readiness. Some 4,000 engineers are involved in keeping the project
afloat pending a decision on its future, an industry source
familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

* Mubadala not interested in buying stakes in partners * Signs maintenance partnership deal with GE Aviation  By Helen Massy-Beresford and John Bowker PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi state investment agency
Mubadala Development said on Wednesday it was interested in
partnerships with leading aerospace groups but denied a report
it planned to take stakes in major European aerospace companies. ""Partnering with the world's leading aerospace organisations
forms an integral part of the long-term strategy we are taking,""
Aerospace Associate Director Homaid Al Shemmari said at the
Paris Air Show on Wednesday. ""Building a global aerospace industry for Abu Dhabi is a key
part of the emirate's diversification,"" he added. But he denied a news wire report quoting him as saying that
Mubadala may consider buying stakes in partners such as EADS,
Finmeccanica and Rolls-Royce. ""We are not interested in taking equity stakes in any of our
current partners. Our current model is for partnerships and
joint ventures with a focus on Abu Dhabi,"" Al Shemmari told
Reuters. He was speaking after signing a maintenance partnership deal
with General Electric unit GE Aviation, the world's largest
maker of jet engines, that will see GE supply support and
services while Mubadala builds a maintenance network for GEnx
engines. This is the latest in a series of aerospace deals by the Abu
Dhabi investment fund as the emirate seeks to boost its economy.
Abu Dhabi is part of the United Arab Emirates, the world's third
largest oil exporter. GE and Mubadala did not give any financial details of the
deal, which forms part of a broader partnership the two groups
agreed last year. GE Vice Chairman John Rice said the group would not limit
the areas where the company would consider future collaboration
with Mubadala. The groups are analysing the market and looking at how
revenue will be split between them in the next few months,
Mubadala's Al Shemmari said. Last July, Mubadala forged a deal with Airbus parent EADS to
provide parts for wide-body aircraft from a composites plant
that Mubadala plans to open from next year. Ultimately, large aircraft structures will be designed,
developed and manufactured in Abu Dhabi. Mubadala said on Sunday it would start the first phase of
the plant later this month and that it would be operational in
2010. Partnerships had been formed with EADS, Airbus, FACC and
Alenia Aeronautica, part of Finmeccanica. At the Farnborough Air Show a year ago, Abu Dhabi national
airline Etihad place a $10 billion order for Airbus planes. Although the industrial deals are not officially linked, the
plane purchase was finalised in December in what experts
described as a landmark agreement that could see EADS producing
part of its next generation of jets in Abu Dhabi.

1484,"Jun 12, 2009 09:48AM ET",ARMS TRADE-Red tape and red faces in A400M bungle,nan," (Reuters correspondents worldwide are looking this week at
how recession and changing threats are affecting the global arms
trade. For highlights, please double-click on [ID:nARMS])  * Missing software logs threatened top European arms project * A400M problem went wider than just engine software * Threat to poach UK jobs if Britain abandons plane  By Tim Hepher PARIS, June 12 (Reuters) - The jinx surrounding Europe's
unfinished and costly A400M military transport plane all started
at the Paris Airshow eight years ago, when red-faced aides mixed
up the papers for European defence ministers to sign.  Instead of appointing Airbus as preferred bidder to build a
new-generation transporter for their own armies, the politicians
were asked to pull out their pens to sign the wrong contracts --
until scurrying hands intervened to correct the gaffe. It was a bad omen for a project now gone horribly wrong.
 Nearly a decade later, another apparently simple mishap over
documentation has brought the 20 billion euro project led by
Airbus to its knees, and divided European leaders on the eve of
the latest biennial air jamboree at Le Bourget, outside Paris. It has contributed to a four-year delay and potentially huge
penalties for Airbus parent EADS , even as Britain and
France say the aircraft is desperately needed in Afghanistan. As European buyers extend a moratorium on cancelling the
plane to allow another six months of talks [ID:nLB787214], the
aircraft risks entering the history books as the 'A400-When?' That is not how it seemed a year ago in Seville when the
first plane was rolled out in triumph before the King of Spain. Just 12 weeks later the company and its engine makers were
in turmoil after inspectors from a new European safety agency
turned up to do an audit on the documentation of key software. According to one source familiar with the matter, it was a
moment of blinding recognition that something was wrong. ""They just looked at it and said, 'It is impossible, you
can't do this'. And the whole thing had to start again."" The blow came on top of engine problems but was potentially
more severe. The aircraft was put into hibernation and forensic
teams of software certification experts were drafted in to help. Experts in secret military design, developers had failed to
log their every move according to formats set by the European
Aviation Safety Agency, according to sources in the post-mortem. The civil agency is involved because it was the only outfit
available to rule on airworthiness for all buyers, saving cost. Most attention has focused on the way the plane talks to the
turbo-prop engines through a software system called the FADEC,
supplied by German engine maker MTU . MTU has said all
four engine makers on the project are working on a solution. But developers have told Reuters that drastic action also
had to be taken to repair software logging problems throughout
the plane's sub-systems, feeding into main aircaft computers. ""The plane is an over-complex beast. It was realised too
late,"" said a person familiar with the aircraft. EADS has recognised its own organisation was also to blame.  UK AEROSPACE ""FINISHED"" IF DEAL COLLAPSES Britain has threatened to pull out over delays but European
diplomats say the other six buyers -- France, Germany, Belgium,
Spain, Luxembourg and Turkey -- seem resolved to go ahead. The 
seven European NATO countries ordered a total of 180 aircraft. How all that is solved could have far-reaching consequences
for Europe's fragile attempts at defence coordination and affect
future placement of thousands of jobs in aerospace, not only for
war but also in the big Airbus civil jetliner plants. Europe's needs are set out in a six-year-old security paper
that ticks off most imaginable threats, from insurgents to
unfriendly states. Transforming the vision into kit capable of
backing every competing national mission was never an easy task. The A400M aircraft is designed for strategic airlift, steep
descents into the battlefield or serving the fleet as a tanker. EADS wants purchasing countries to prioritise their needs.
Ground-hugging capability has already been put on hold. Industry experts say another root cause of problem was
protectionism over jobs that led to clumsy decisions over what
should be developed where, regardless of where expertise lay.  Yet now, recession and job fears ahead of German and British
elections in the coming year could come to the project's rescue. Britain has been left in no doubt that aerospace means jobs. ""If Britain cancels the A400M, its whole aerospace industry
is finished,"" said an official with another country directly
involved in the talks, asking not to be named. Britain is home to wings manufacture for all Airbus jets,
one of its key high-tech industries employing 11,000 people. Workshare -- a code word for national haggling over who
builds what -- is not yet set for the A350, a 10 billion euro
jetliner project now starting up, industry sources point out. But a more likely battleground may be a plane not yet even
on the drawing board -- a future replacement of the single-aisle
A320, which could take start to shape late next decade. Although there is no acknowledged link between the A400M and
civil investment, the A320 is being floated as the one to watch
since it would need carbon wings similar to those on the A400M. Airbus does not need to spell out to UK mandarins what that
means. The A320 is a spigot for investment and jobs. At least
one rolls off the company's European production lines every day.
Nearly 4,000 of the planes are in operation worldwide. Britain may yet decide this is a bluff. Moving production is
costly and restructuring has reinforced factory specialisation. So-called ""soft capability"" such as decades of expertise in
the wind tunnels that designed Concorde would be hard to shift. ""It would be extremely costly because of the way programmes
are structured. Tooling is specific to facilities,"" said a top
executive with a rival aerospace firm. ""Anything can be done. But is it worthwhile? Probably not."" (Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)

1485,"Jun 11, 2009 09:59AM ET",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-EADS defence chief upbeat on growth,nan," * Upbeat on profitability but short-cycle margins may slip * Scope for organic growth on three fronts, defence CEO says * Final deal on Eurofighter in days  By Tim Hepher MUNICH, June 11 (Reuters) - European aerospace group EADS is
confident it can prise internal growth out of its defence
business and live for now without acquisitions as it saves cash,
the head of its defence and security business said. The group's second largest unit by revenue after Airbus can
again improve its performance in 2009 but sees some pressure on
margins further down the line on security products with short
production cycles and possible deferrals of security equipment
orders, he said. ""Defence and Security always delivered and outperformed our
planning in recent years, and we have definitely done well, but
we still can do better and we intend to do that,"" Stefan Zoller,
the unit's chief executive, told Reuters. He was responding in an interview late on Wednesday to a
question on whether he stood by a recent prediction that the
unit's profit margins would again improve in 2009. They rose to
7.2 percent in 2008 from 6.4 percent the year before. EADS shares were up 1.1 percent at 11.29 euros at 1312 GMT,
erasing part of their earlier gains. Zoller declined to give a detailed forecast for 2010 but
said the economic crisis would not have a significant impact on
long-running defence programmes with long development cycles. ""It might be different in some areas where we have very
short procurement cycles like rather product-oriented businesses
in security, where we may see shortfalls."" Some customers may defer orders for professional mobile
communications devices for security and military use.
 ACQUISITION-FREE DIET EADS has placed itself on a broadly acquisition-free diet
amid the financial crisis, declaring that ""cash is king"" as it
faces looming threats to its cash pile from penalties for
aircraft delays and airline customer demands for financing. Zoller's unit drew up plans for an unspecified acquisition
said to be worth $1 billion or more in the United States last
year but major shareholders on the board vetoed the plan. ""When you are not focusing on one approach, you shift your
capacity in other directions,"" Zoller said. He identified room for internal growth in three main areas: -- New product and system offerings ""including security as
well as defence"" -- Development of businesses that tap into relatively robust
operating budgets rather than capital spending budgets, which
are being eroded by arms cutbacks or shifts in defence spending -- Expanding the European company's global reach, something
that did ""not necessarily"" need big acquisitions as a recent
joint venture with India's Larsen & Toubro had shown.  U.S. HOPES EADS still wants to expand its defence or security
activities in the United States, but any significant leap
forward there would still depend on acquisitions, Zoller said. ""We want to grow in the US. Today we grow based on the
facilities and capacity that we have, ... coming up with new
product-specific offerings,"" he said. ""A very bold improvement or business development in the
country will need acquisitions, that is for sure."" In April last year EADS bought Californian security systems
company PlantCML for $350 million. Zoller said partners in the Eurofighter combat jet project
-- Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain -- expected to sign a final
deal for the next tranche of production ""in the next few days"". The deal, provisionally agreed after Britain lifted cost
objections a month ago, involves ""significant"" cuts in long-term
life-cycle costs to be delivered by industry, he said. Regarding Airbus's A400M military plane, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday that countries involved in the
much-delayed project needed a further six months to discuss how
to proceed. Asked whether French planemaker Dassault's arrival as a key
shareholder had changed EADS attitudes towards French
electronics maker Thales, Zoller said that as far his division
was concerned, ""Thales used to be and will be always a
straightforward competitor"". He declined to comment on whether EADS could sell a 46
percent stake in warplane maker Dassault inherited from the
French state company that helped to found EADS in 2000. An
approach by EADS to try to make an offer for Thales was rebuffed
by the French government last year and EADS CEO Louis Gallois
has resigned from the Dassault board.(editing by John Stonestreet)

project to build the A400M military transport aircraft need a

Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday. Seven NATO allies involved in the much-delayed project had
previously given themselves a three-month moratorium, due to
expire at the end of June, to discuss the A400M's future. Following talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
Sarkozy told reporters more time was needed. ""We said we'd give ourselves a little delay of six months to

Turkey ordered the A400M in 2003 in a deal worth 20 billion
euros ($28 billion) -- the region's biggest single cross-border
procurement contract. But the programme has run into engine development delays,
prompting Airbus parent EADS to halt production and call for
talks with buyers on revisions to the contract. The delays could cost EADS billions of euros in charges. Germany's defence ministry has threatened to withdraw from
the project, but Der Spiegel has reported that Merkel has
distanced herself from this position. The German chancellor said on Thursday: ""In any case, we

1488,"Jun 09, 2009 08:33AM ET",ARMS TRADE-U.S. siren call irresistible for Europe arms makers,nan," (Reuters correspondents worldwide are looking this week at how recession and
changing threats are affecting the global arms trade. For highlights, please
double-click on)  * Recession adds to challenge of cracking U.S. defence deals * Acquisitions seen key for access to U.S. market * U.S. defence spending also under pressure with cuts expected * Europeans led 73 percent of U.S. defence acquisitions by value last year  By Deepa Babington ROME, June 9 (Reuters) - European defence companies will step up their
frantic search for a slice of the U.S. defence market -- even if a new U.S.
administration, spending cuts and a recession make an already difficult mission
harder still. The United States accounts for about half the world's defence spending and
has long attracted -- and frustrated -- European firms like Franco-German EADS
and Italy's Finmeccanica which are eager for a foothold to spur their global
ambitions. But the dominance of U.S. rivals has hampered them, a problem which analysts
say will be made worse by a more dove-ish new U.S. administration, planned cuts
to big-ticket programmes and a rise in protectionist tendancies amid a global
recession. ""It has never been easy for European companies to break in to the U.S.
market and it just got a whole lot harder,"" said Doug McVitie of Arran Aerospace
consultancy. ""The defence budget is not expanding like the (former U.S.
President Ronald) Reagan Star Wars years and they won't allow foreigners
waltzing in."" Analysts say that Europeans facing flat or lower defence spending at home
are unlikely to be deterred, making more joint ventures or acquisitions like
Finmeccanica's $4 billion purchase of U.S. firm DRS Technologies last year
inevitable. European-led acquisitions accounted for 37 percent of U.S. defence sector
deals and more than 73 percent by value in 2008, as a weak dollar provided a
powerful incentive, according to a study by Jane's Industry Quarterly. ""If your domestic market is shrinking but your shareholders still expect
growth, that means looking at the United States -- which is like a siren call
for the defence industry,"" said Guy Anderson, lead analyst at Jane's Information
Group. ""And to do business in America, you've got to be in America. You've got to
have a footprint. Acquisitions are going from nice to have to a necessity."" The U.S. defence budget for fiscal 2009 is set at $515 billion, excluding
further outlays for war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even if spending stays flat, the intelligence, surveillance and
reconaissance segment promises exponential growth, and overlaps with the
homeland security budget, said Anderson.  DIPPING ITS TOES Britain's BAE Systems -- Europe's largest defence contractor that generates
over half its sales from the U.S. -- could continue scouting for more deals as
could Finmeccanica, on a much smaller scale than the DRS buy, said Anderson. Finmeccanica has stuck to its U.S. growth ambitions despite being penalised
by investors for paying a 27 percent share premium to buy DRS and then facing
cuts to the U.S. presidential helicopter and C-27J cargo plane programs it is
involved in. Smaller British peer VT Group has already said it is planning an acquisition
spree in the fall and will bid for $3 billion worth of U.S. contracts. But analysts say the European company most likely to strike the next big
U.S. deal is France's Thales SA, which was eyeing DRS before Finmeccanica
snapped it up.  It says it remains on the lookout for U.S. acquisitions. It remains to be seen whether a change of industrial leadership makes it
harder to prise open U.S. defence contracts. Privatised radar builder Alcatel Lucent has always been on a tight rein, but
the Franco-U.S. firm recently sold its 21 percent stake to Dassault Aviation,
which is seen as a company more closely associated with French sovereign
interests. Airbus parent EADS may struggle to pull off a big U.S. deal despite
repeatedly stating its interest in the United States amid growing concerns of
being sidelined, said Anderson and McVitie. ""In the U.S., EADS has repeatedly rushed to the water, dipped its toes and
run away,"" said McVitie. ""On the industrial level, they don't have the competence to get into the
U.S. market but the bigger concern is that their shareholders don't want cash
reserves used on U.S. acquisitions."" An acquisition thought to be worth $1 billion was vetoed by the board last
year and the company has vowed to conserve cash. EADS is still hoping to wrest back a $35 billion refueling tanker contract
it won jointly with Northrop Grumman before the deal was cancelled after a
Boeing challenge.  GETTING IN THE DOOR Not everyone is convinced European companies will succeed in their U.S. bid
despite intense lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill. Though the Pentagon has yet to show a nationalistic streak in its buying
practices, Europeans face a much tougher sell at a time of contracting budgets
unless they offer a critical mission product, said Loren Thompson of U.S.-based
Lexington Institute. ""What tends to happen in the highly cyclical U.S. defence market is that it
opens up when there's rapid expansion and holds back during a contraction, so
foreigners have a much greater difficulty getting in the door,"" said Thompson. But while trying to export to the United States may be virtually impossible,
buying a U.S. company like DRS and maintaining U.S. jobs there could overcome
protectionist concerns, said Anderson. More long-term joint ventures could also be the order of the day to avoid
overpaying or getting into a price war with European peers, since linking with a
U.S company can help override security or technology transfer worries, said
McVitie. ""There is no trend, what you'll get is probably a lot of one-offs,"" he said.
""But what is clear is that if (a European company) wants to step up to be a
global player, they have to have access to the biggest market in the world.""

 (Adds detail, quotes, background) By Tim Hepher  PARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - Weeks before the first China-built
Airbus rolls off the assembly line near Beijing, the European
planemaker's top official has pulled out the map and targeted
future jetliner production in the United States and India. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, writing 40 years after
the birth of the first plane project by a four-nation European
consortium, said Airbus must become global to stay competitive. ""We have to leave national sentiment behind us,"" Enders
wrote in a column in Friday's edition of the Financial Times. ""Airbus will only remain competitive in the long term if it
develops resources and markets globally and becomes a genuinely
international company, with development and production also in
the U.S., China, India and elsewhere."" Airbus agreed in 2006 to set up an assembly line for the
A320 family of jets, its most popular model, at Tianjin in China
to reduce costs and gain an edge over rival Boeing in one of the
world's largest aviation markets. The first plane will be delivered by end-June, the first
time an Airbus has been assembled outside its two main host
countries, France and Germany, supported by Britain and Spain. India has pressed Airbus to consider opening a production
line there also, but so far the European company has been tied
up in domestic restructuring and a series of aircraft production
delays, as well as fierce union opposition to offshoring jobs. When India's civil aviation minister floated the idea of an
Indian assembly line at an Airbus ceremony at the Paris air show
two years ago, Airbus officials cautiously welcomed the concept
but said the costs might outweigh the benefits. The economic crisis has since threatened planemakers'
orders.  TRADE WARNING In the United States, Airbus considered assembling
freighters in Alabama as part of a deal to sell mid-air
refuelling tankers built from the same fuselages to the
Pentagon. But the plans were suspended when Boeing appealed
against the contract. U.S. production is attractive to firms whose costs are in
euros but whose products, like aircraft, are priced in dollars. Unions and politicians in Europe, however, are concerned
about job losses. Writing days before European parliamentary elections, Enders
said shutting trade borders was no fix to the economic crisis. ""Next month in Tianjin we shall deliver the first Airbus
made in China ... No one will benefit more from this than
Europeans."" He also blamed European governments for hobbling Airbus's
first major military project, the A400M airlifter, with a wish
list for customisation that only added to production delays. The
four-year setback has usually been blamed on engine problems. ""Too often there has been a reversion to defending diverse
national requirements that offer little in terms of performance
but impact significantly on cost and deliverability,"" he said. ""That certainly has been the case with the A400M, and we
have asked the European partners in the programme for a greater
degree of realism in order to enable delivery of the aircraft we
all want at a sensible price."" Parent EADS is trying to negotiate contract changes to
rescue the 20 billion euro project by an end-June deadline.

1490,"May 14, 2009 06:48AM ET","UPDATE 2-After delay, Britain recommits to Eurofighter deal",nan," * Britain to sign contract by year-end * Germany plans to place order before summer break 
 (Adds Eurofighter statement, quotes, details throughout) By Luke Baker LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Britain surrendered to German
pressure and recommitted itself to the Eurofighter defence
contract on Thursday, even though it has enduring concerns about
the cost of the multi-billion dollar programme. After more than a month of delay, and following phone calls
from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Prime Minister Gordon
Brown said Britain remained committed to Eurofighter, a contract
conceived 25 years ago that involves Germany, Spain, Italy and
Britain building more than 600 high-peformance combat jets. ""We are moving forward with this important programme with
our partner nations,"" Brown said in a statement that followed
weeks of talks between the defence ministry and the Treasury
about the feasibility of pursuing the deal. Despite the words of commitment, Brown said details relating
to the third tranche of Eurofighter -- which will see up to 112
aircraft built -- still needed to be negotiated. Britain is supposed to take 40 of the aircraft in the first
instalment of the third tranche, but still appears to want to
reduce that number. Britain's defence minister said the number
had still not be finalised. Britain's cautious recommitment was welcomed by German
officials and the Eurofighter consortium -- which comprises
Britain's BAE Systems, Italy's Finmeccanica and EADS for Germany
and Spain. ""The agreement that the UK have confirmed today sends a
clear signal of customer commitment,"" Enzo Casolini, chief
executive of Eurofighter GmbH, said in a statement. BAE shares rose 1.44 percent on the day, EADS edged up 0.45
percent and Finmeccanica gained 3.25 percent. Germany said shortly after Britain's announcement that it
would go ahead with its share of the Eurofighter order, though
there had been little doubt about that. The German parliament's
budget committee still has to agree the purchase. But others were more sceptical about Britain's announcement
and wanted to see final contract details before declaring that
Eurofighter is now fully financed to completion. ""It is a fudge,"" said a person involved in the talks, adding
the UK Treasury appeared to be dragging its heels over a final
deal. With Britain in recession and public finances severely
stretched, the government is taking a hard look at all major
ticket defence items, including the much-delayed Airbus A400M
military airlifter. Britain said on Wednesday it was committed to the A400M, but
""not at any cost"", and also revealed that the aircraft would not
enter service before 2014, five years late. One of seven countries to have ordered a total of 180 of the
planes, Britain also disclosed the next target deadline for a
maiden flight, February 2010, something Airbus had kept secret. French Defence Minister said on Thursday he was doing all he
could to save the A400M but ""it's far from being a done deal"". Officials say there is no overt link between the two sets of
negotiations, the more so as they do not share all the same
partners. Italy is not involved in the European quest to build a
heavy airlifter and France has its own rival to the Eurofighter. (Additional reporting by Laure Bretton and Tim Hepher in

1491,"May 14, 2009 05:40AM ET",UK says will go ahead with buying more Eurofighters,nan," * To sign contract by year end * PM says deal will create jobs in UK manufacturing  (Adds quotes, background) LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it will
buy a third batch of Eurofighter aircraft and hopes to sign a
contract by the end of the year, dispelling fears it would pull
out of the project. Britain and its partner nations, Germany, Italy and Spain,
will continue negotiations with the aerospace industry to secure
a deal to build the next tranche of advanced warplanes. ""This will strengthen Britain's defence capability and will
create new jobs in advanced manufacturing that Britain needs to
emerge stronger and fitter from this global downturn,"" Prime
Minister Gordon Brown said in a statement. With Britain in recession and public finances severely
stretched, the future of the contract had been in doubt. Defence and finance ministry officials held talks this week
on the financial implications of Britain cancelling part of its
Eurofighter contract, defence sources said. The U.S. Pentagon last week sent Congress a fiscal 2010
budget plan that included proposed sweeping cuts to defence
programmes including an end to funding for the F-22 fighter jet.
 Under a long-standing agreement with its partners, Britain
was obliged to buy 88 of the aircraft as part of a third
production tranche. That number has already been reduced to an initial 40 after
a compromise negotiated by Germany, with the remainder offset
for a later production run, dubbed tranche 3b. Yet even the cost of the 40 jets -- of which 24 have already
been set aside for Saudi Arabia -- was proving a tough
commitment for Britain. The 16 it would actually take delivery
of will cost around $1.6 billion, defence industry sources say. Britain was under particular pressure from Germany to show
its commitment to Eurofighter, which is being built by BAE
Systems, Italy's Finmeccanica and European aerospace giant EADS
. Shares in the plane's manufacturers rose on the statement
which lifted months of uncertainty over the fate of the combat
jet. At 0918 GMT shares in BAE Systems were up 0.1 percent,
Finmeccanica rose 2 percent while EADs gained 2.1 percent.

"
1492,"May 13, 2009 09:16AM ET",UK set to reaffirm Eurofighter commitment-sources,nan," By Luke Baker LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Britain is expected to decide on
Thursday that it remains committed to the Eurofighter defence
contract, though it wants to trim some costs related to the
multi-billion dollar programme, government sources say. Talks involving Business Secretary Peter Mandelson and
officials from the Ministry of Defence, the Treasury and the
prime minister's office have concluded that cancelling the
contract would have too much of an impact on jobs and Britain's
reputation, as well as incurring fines of up to $1.5 billion. While the decision is expected to be finalised on Thursday,
it may not be announced immediately, the sources said. Germany, one of the four nations involved in building the
advanced jets along with Spain, Italy and Britain, wants to hear
by the end of May whether Britain remains committed. ""Everything points to a decision being made by the end of
the week, and most likely by Thursday,"" one government source
close to the discussions told Reuters. Two others said that the cost of getting out, not just
financially but in terms of reputation and the economy -- up to
40,000 Britons are directly or indirectly employed by
Eurofighter and related aerospace contracts -- made it very
likely that the government would reiterate its commitment. However, they said that the final decision would be made by
Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a former finance minister who is
not regarded as supportive of massive defence spending. ""This is a major strategic decision, so the prime minister
has to be involved and is involved,"" one of the sources said. One source said Britain's Attorney General, the chief
government law officer, had advised the UK could be sued for
damages if it pulled out. A spokeswoman declined to comment. Britain has delayed for months over what to do with
Eurofighter, concerned that the high cost of the programme,
conceived nearly 25 years ago, was becoming unaffordable at a
time of economic crisis and budget constraint. Brown and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have held
telephone talks on the issue in recent weeks as Germany has
pressed Britain to make pending payments on the contract. Under the original deal for the aircraft -- being built by
Britain's BAE Systems, Italy's Finmeccanica and EADS for Germany
and Spain -- Britain was obliged to buy 232 planes. The majority are already in service, but the third tranche,
which involves a further 88 aircraft for Britain and others for
Spain, Germany and Italy, has yet to go into production. That tranche has already been split into two parts, so that
Britain is now obliged to pay for and take delivery of 40
aircraft, with the remainder set aside for future production. Britain has weighed various methods of reducing its costs,
including selling some of its allotment on to other countries or
altering the finance schedules. Tinkering with the numbers may
reduce the total cost by a small degree, but ultimately defence
experts expect Britain to go ahead with the contract. ""We have a commitment to our partners, cancellation is
costly, and tranche three is the one that the airforce really
wants,"" said Keith Hartley, a defence economist. ""Eurofighter is central to Britain's aerospace industry. The
costs may be high, but it's something Britain has a strength in
and needs to stay committed to."" Defence sources last month that Britain had won agreement to
take just 16 new aircraft out of its allotment, by allocating
the other 24 to a recent export deal with Saudi Arabia. But it
came under pressure from European partners after refusing to
sign up to the agreement until it had reviewed the costs.

1493,"May 11, 2009 06:32AM ET",UK assessing cost of cancelling Eurofighter deal,nan," * Treasury, MoD officials meet over Eurofighter contract * Britain seen stalling in latest contract payment  By Luke Baker LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - British defence and finance
ministry officials held talks on Monday to assess the financial
implications if Britain cancelled part of its Eurofighter
defence contract, defence sources said. With the national budget under severe strain due to the
economic crisis, the Treasury is reviewing spending on major
contracts and has to give the go-ahead on all deals costing more
than 400 million pounds ($586 million). Under a long-standing agreement with Spain, Italy and
Germany -- its partners in Eurofighter -- Britain is obliged to
buy 88 of the aircraft as part of a third production tranche. That number has already been reduced to an initial 40 after
a compromise negotiated by Germany, with the remainder offset
for a later production run, dubbed tranche 3b. Yet even the cost of the 40 jets -- of which 24 have already
been set aside for Saudia Arabia -- is proving a tough
commitment for Britain. The 16 it would actually take delivery
of will cost around $1.6 billion, defence industry sources say. The Treasury is stalling on that sum, the sources say, but
any cancellation of the contract would not necessarily mean a
saving -- since getting out would carry its own penalties and
legal fees that could more than offset the $1.6 billion. Discussions over the contract are complicated by the fact
that senior Ministry of Defence officials are divided over the
necessity of Eurofighter, with some seeing it as essential to
Britain's future defence role and others as surplus to need. ""The Treasury and MoD are going to have to hammer out the
details,"" a defence ministry source said of the talks, which he
said began on Monday and may continue through the week.  WHAT DEFENCE ROLE? Britain is under particular pressure from Germany to show
its commitment to Eurofighter, which is being built by Britain's
BAE Systems, Italy's Finmeccanica and EADS of Germany and Spain.  Not only is Eurofighter an important symbol of pan-European
cooperation, but it involves the employment of up to 100,000
people worldwide, according to its supporters. BAE has said the
contract is worth two billion pounds ($3 bln) to it alone. With Germany holding elections in September, Berlin wants
Britain to show its commitment to the third tranche -- and pay
up. Britain needs Germany to be committed to NATO operations in
Afghanistan, where more troops are required. The negotiations over Eurofighter cut to the quick of what
combat role Britain sees itself playing as a global power -- and
whether it can really afford to play that role. Britain has a range of defence contract obligations over the
next six years: the A400M transport aircraft, the building of
Type-45 destroyers, tactical submarines, two aircraft carriers
and the joint-strike fighter as well as Eurofighter. While major cuts to some contracts are possible, any cuts
could carry financial penalties, political costs in terms of
votes, and security costs if defence were compromised. Rather than a headline-grabbing cancellation of a major
contract, Keith Hartley, the director of the centre for defence
economics at the University of York, expects ""trimming"". ""There might be the possibility of a small reduction in
numbers (of Eurofighters) without too much of a penalty,"" he
said. ""But I think we'll fiddle around with the margins, make
small reductions if we can, rather than cancelling.""

1494,"Mar 24, 2009 07:00AM ET",INTERVIEW-Dubai finance chief pinpoints $10 bln aid funds,nan," By Jack Reerink and John Irish DUBAI, March 24 (Reuters) - Funds from an emergency $10
billion rescue plan will target Dubai World, Dubai Holding and
domestic firms in the emirate's sovereign wealth fund's
portfolio, Dubai's finance department head said on Tuesday. A five-man fiscal committee, headed by Emirates airline
chairman and local power broker Sheikh Ahmed bin Saaed
al-Maktoum, was re-established a month ago to assess the
companies' requirements and decide how the funds would be used,
Nasser al-Shaikh told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. ""We will not wait to support the companies, there are urgent
requirements that need to be dealt with quickly,"" he said.
""There is no free lunch; we will be helping companies on
commercial terms."" Shaikh said the funds would begin flowing in the next few
weeks and said non-bank financial advisors would help allocate
the financing to avoid ""conflict of interests."" Dubai launched the $10 billion bailout plan in February,
paid for by bond purchases from the United Arab Emirates central
bank in a move lauded by investors for restoring confidence in
the former boom town, hit hard by the financial crisis. Dubai World includes real estate unit Nakheel, developer of
palm-shaped manmade islands, and port operator DP World, while
Dubai Holding, an investor in Sony and EADS, is owned by the
ruler of the emirate.  Dubai property prices have been under pressure since late
last year, when the global financial crisis and a slump in oil
prices ended an economic boom in the Gulf region. Hundreds of billions of dollars of expansion projects have
since been cancelled in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai
companies have laid off thousands of employees and UAE banks
have been loath to extend new mortgage loans. Local banks, including Islamic institutions, have also
submitted proposals to the government to provide assistance to
small and medium enterprises, Shaikh said.  ""For us it's like driving a car with poor visibility: We can
only see 10 to 15 meters ahead,"" he said. ""We will have to
revisit our plans and stay focused on the short-term
challenges."" Emaar Properties, the largest listed UAE property developer,
has not held discussions with the government as it ""believes it
can handle it (the situation)."" The government is also set to appoint an international PR
firm as part of its crisis management efforts and plans to
collate all Dubai's economic data on the web.  ""We are working on improving the economic data,"" Shaikh
said. ""There are different reasons for rumours in Dubai but once
the information is out there it will kill them."" (Editing by David Cowell)

1495,"Jan 27, 2009 04:32AM ET",FEATURE-Seychelles takes painful path to recovery,nan," By Richard Lough VICTORIA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Foreign accents fill the
lunchtime air at a beachfront restaurant while diners clad in
Ralph Lauren and Prada sunglasses knock back succulent tiger
prawns and chilled white wine. It is the scene the Seychelles archipelago has built its
image on. But for locals, who had been enjoying one of Africa's
highest standards of living, the good life is on ice. The Indian Ocean islands are in the midst of a severe
economic crisis, prompted by the global financial downturn on
top of years of unsustainable borrowing. A raft of painful economic reforms demanded by the
International Monetary Fund in return for emergency funding have
seen the local rupee lose half its value against the dollar
since floating in November. That has pushed inflation beyond 60
percent -- the highest rate in Africa after Zimbabwe. ""It was like a fever, everything just shot up at once,""
lamented a local taxi driver, David, who didn't give his
surname, saying he feared authorities would revoke his licence. ""Fuel, food and cooking gas, they've all at least doubled in
the last three months. The shock has been too big,"" he said. The timing hurts too. This year, the Seychelles economy is predicted to shrink by
at least 0.5 percent according to the country's central bank,
compared to 3.1 percent growth in 2008. Tourism revenues are expected to fall by 10 percent --
roughly $32 million -- over the next year. A deepening sense of
uncertainty prevails across the visitor-dependent archipelago. ""I just have no confidence,"" said an anxious Captain Philip
Hoareau, as his catamaran shuttle service made a steady 26 knots
en route to Praslin island's turquoise bays. ""If tourism slumps, then the economy will collapse. We do
not earn much from anything else.""  EXCESSIVE SPENDING HABIT For more than 20 years, the Seychelles has consistently
over-run its budgets, borrowing heavily from foreign governments
and commercial creditors to invest in health, education and
housing, as well as tourism and fisheries. After defaulting on a payment towards a $230 million
sovereign bond last October, the country accepts it had been
borrowing beyond its means. President James Michel, who intends
to stand for re-election in 2011, told Reuters there was now a
need to ""tailor our clothes in accordance to the cloth we have"". The government has already moved to cut spending, downsizing
the public sector, scrapping subsidies and freezing pending
investment projects while increasing its tax revenues. With external debt topping $800 million, Michel is calling
for half of it to be cancelled. ""The global credit crunch may not have been the direct cause
of the Seychelles' crisis, but it has certainly been a
catalyst,"" wrote Christopher Eads, of the Economist Intelligence
Unit (EIU), in a December 2008 country report.  PAINFUL PATH The question now is: how quickly will the economy recover? The Seychelles is not the first small, fragile economy
exposed to external shocks to extend itself too far.  In recent years, Belize, Jamaica and Cape Verde have all
implemented austerity reforms to rein in public debt. But with the current world economic climate shattering
consumer confidence, observers say much will depend on how the
recession in Europe impacts tourism. ""The financial crisis means the Seychelles is unlikely to
recover as quickly as hoped,"" said Richard Segal of the
Africa-focused investment bank, UBA Capital. The devaluation of the currency would soften the blow as the
price of travel to the Seychelles decreases. ""The early signs are good, but the reforms have to be
carried through for a year at least,"" said Segal. ""We've seen it
before where reforms are encouraging, but after six months
sentiment is high and they relax."" If the absence of a lunchtime queue at the once popular
Andrew's Hotdog and Burger van is an indicator of consumer
sentiment, then the Seychellois are bracing for a bumpy road. ""These reforms are necessary but should have been done in
small doses over time,"" said office-worker Noella Frederick,
standing alone at the counter. ""Let us get on with these reforms
and be done with them."" (Additional reporting by George Thande; editing by Matthew

1496,"Jan 26, 2009 01:08PM ET",UPDATE 1-French aerospace aid plan cheers Airbus,nan," * France says 5 bln euros aid will not distort competition * Airbus welcomes support to secure deliveries  * EADS shares rise 4.2 percent  (Adds French trade minister, Airbus comment, closing shares) By Matthias Blamont and Anna Willard PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus said a
French plan to provide up to 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to
support plane purchases would help secure aircraft deliveries as
government aid for the ailing economy spreads beyond banks and
cars. France's trade minister defended the move, saying it would
not distort competition and that the state was not giving money
directly to Airbus, owned by Franco-German aerospace group EADS
. The German government said it was unaware of the plan. The French state plans to inject the money into banks with
the aim of financing aircraft purchases to help Airbus, a French
government source said on Sunday, confirming an earlier report
in business newspaper Les Echos. EADS shares rose more than 4 percent on Monday. Although not presented as a direct bailout, the plan
appeared to be the first significant government package targeted
at aerospace as countries pour funds into propping up industries
weakened by the credit crisis.  ""The French state is not giving money to Airbus,"" French
trade minister Anne-Marie Idrac told Reuters on Monday. ""It's not a subsidy, which would distort competition, it's a
question of fluidity in the financing of Airbus clients where it
is needed, and this in coordination with other countries who are
stakeholders of Airbus."" EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois said earlier this month
that banks were failing to provide airlines with loans needed to
finance aircraft deliveries even when backed by state export
credit agencies. ""We welcome the strong initiative of the French government
to try to secure our deliveries, which are at risk due to the
credit crunch,"" an Airbus spokesman said on Monday. Customers
pay for new aircraft on delivery.  PROTECTING AIRBUS DEALS? Airbus is the world's largest producer of civil jetliners,
ahead of rival Boeing They are locked in a transatlantic trade
row over subsidies at the World Trade Organisation, with both
accusing the other of taking illegal government handouts. It was not immediately clear whether the French plan was
designed specifically to funnel money into protecting deals with
Airbus, something that may open it to scrutiny from Boeing and
other planemakers, or ease credit across the aerospace sector. Boeing declined to make any comment. There are concerns that the aviation industry, one of
France's biggest export earners and home to thousands of
high-tech jobs, could be hit indirectly by the automobile crisis
since the two industries share many of the same suppliers. Analysts said similar financial support schemes could be
drawn up in other Airbus host countries such as Germany. ""The German government is not familiar with details of the
French plan. It therefore refrains from comment,"" a government
spokesman said on Monday. Shares in EADS rose 4.2 to 13.13 euros. But some analysts
said it remained unclear how effective state-backed loan
guarantees to boost aviation would be. Les Echos said the state would inject the money into banks
with a record of lending to the aeronautical industry. It named
Calyon, Societe Generale and BNP Paribas. ""We've been expecting some increased support from the
government but it sounds a slightly contrived way to do it,""
said Sandy Morris, an analyst at ABN Amro, adding that air
traffic growth stalling may be the main issue, not financing. The French government has already pledged help on a smaller
scale to aid aeronautical suppliers and bolster research.

purchase of airplanes. ""There is indeed a plan to lend 5 billion euros to the banks
to finance Airbus contracts,"" a government source said on

comment on Monday. Shares in the European aerospace group rose as much as 1.6

package),"" said Sandy Morris, analyst at ABN AMRO. ""We've been

recession, airlines simply won't need more aircraft,"" he said. Les Echos said the state would inject the money into banks
with a record of lending to the aerospace industry.  It named Calyon, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Natixis. ""The aim is to prevent airlines from cancelling orders
citing difficulties in raising money,"" said the newspaper, which
did not give its sources.  EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois earlier this month
accused banks of failing to provide adequate lending to Airbus
customers even when the loans were backed by state export credit

industry damaged by recent fuel price spikes as the economic
downturn hits air travel. They also face a battle to prevent
airlines cancelling or deferring orders. Aircraft are usually ordered years before they are built and
the financing often is not finalised until a few months before
delivery, according to aviation executives.

1498,"Nov 24, 2008 12:46PM ET",RPT-FACTBOX-The men behind Dubai's crisis committee,nan," (Repeats story from late Monday) Nov 25 (Reuters) - Dubai has set up a nine-man committee to
tackle the global financial crisis. The advisory council reports
directly to the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum,
also the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates. Its mandate is to assess and review Dubai government
finances, the real estate and banking sectors and equity
markets. It will also look to encourage further central bank
action to ensure banks and companies have access to sufficient
liquidity.  The committee is made up of key business and political
figures including the heads of the top three property firms and
the sovereign wealth fund, the chief of both of Dubai's bourses,
and federal government representation through the UAE Cabinet
Affairs Minister and the vice-chairman of the central bank.  THE ADVISORY COUNCIL  MOHAMED ALI ALABBAR - Chairman, Emaar Properties Once the face and voice of Dubai in the early days of the
boom, Mohammed Ali Alabbar has spent much of the last three
years quietly building up a regional property empire, overseeing
the construction of the world's tallest tower and biggest malls
and battling shareholder discontent. The finance and business
graduate has been brought in to chair the new advisory council
and will be its spokesman. Alabbar is also the director-general
of the Dubai Department of Economic Development.  NASSER BIN HASSAN AL-SHAIKH, Director-General of the Dubai
Department of Finance, Chairman of Amlak Finance and Deyaar Like Alabbar Shaikh has been pushed into the limelight over
the last few weeks after returning to a position similar to one
he held previously as head of Dubai's Department of Finance. In
charge of Dubai's sovereign debt, the calm and measured Shaikh
has also been leading the merger between Amlak and fellow
mortgage lender Tamweel.  MOHAMMED AL-GERGAWI, UAE Minister of Cabinet Affairs,
Chairman of Dubai Holding One of Sheikh Mohammed's closest aides, Gergawi's role will
also be to link any Dubai action with federal action in his
capacity as minister of state for cabinet affairs. He is
chairman of the Executive Office, a top government body led by
the ruler, and is chief executive of the ruler's private company
Dubai Holding, which is an investor in Sony and EADS. Its real
estate arm Dubai Properties is one of the emirate's leading
three developers.   ESSA KAZIM - Chairman of Borse Dubai and the Dubai
Financial Market Kazim was director-general of the Dubai Financial Market
(DFM) from 1999 to 2006 before assuming the role of chairman and
taking a more hands-on approach to the development of the Dubai
International Financial Exchange (DIFX). His membership gains
further importance given the DFM falling almost 70 percent this
year. Kazim has also overseen the sale of a 33 percent stake in
DIFX to NASDAQ OMX and last week its rebranding into the NASDAQ
Dubai.  MOHAMMED AL-SHAIBANI, Director-General of Dubai Ruler's

assessing the emirate's key entities. He heads up the ruler's
court and is chief executive of its sovereign wealth fund. He
also sits on the board of Emaar.  OMAR BIN SULAIMAN, Governor of the Dubai International
Financial Centre and Vice-Chairman of the UAE Central Bank As governor of the Dubai International Financial Centre, bin
Sulaiman's mandate is to convince the world the Middle East's
Canary Wharf can compete on a global stage and become the bridge
between east and west. Among his many roles, he is also chairman
of DIFC Investments, which holds a 2.2 percent stake in Deutsche
Bank. He was recently appointed to the board of the UAE central
bank as vice-chairman.  SULTAN BIN SULAYEM - Chairman of Dubai World Since the onset of Dubai's construction boom in 2002 bin
Sulayem has filled the pages of the international media with
some of Dubai's most glamorous and ambitious projects. From
three man-made palm-shaped islands to a map of the world
reclaimed from sea and now plans for a kilometre-high tower, bin
Sulayem has made his name in property through Nakheel. His
mandate as chairman of Dubai World also covers the world's
fourth-largest port operator DP World.   ABDUL AZIZ AL-MUHAIRI - Managing Director of the Investment
Corporation of Dubai Muhairi joined Dubai's sovereign wealth fund after stepping
down from his position as chief executive of Dubai Bank in May.
With a bachelor of science degree, Muhairi was one of the
architects in converting Dubai Bank into an Islamic bank and
paving the way for it to become one of the world's largest
Islamic financial institutions within five years.  MARWAN BIN GHALITA - Chief Executive of the Real Estate
Regulatory Authority (RERA) An engineering graduate from California State University,
Ghalita has spent the bulk of his career at the Dubai Land
Department. Ghalita holds the keys to Dubai's real estate sector
after being handed the top job of regulating the industry and
clamping down on malpractice in 2007. Since RERA's creation,

1499,"Nov 03, 2008 05:24PM ET",ANALYSIS-US defense market seen facing rising protectionism,nan," By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Expected Democratic gains in
Congress, a tighter defense budget and growing concern about
barriers to U.S. weapons sales in some European countries point
to a surge in American protectionist sentiment after the
Tuesday election. That is seen resulting in tighter scrutiny of European
companies bidding for a stake in billion-dollar U.S. defense
contracts. At the same time, a rising dollar and tighter credit
markets worldwide may dampen foreign interest in buying smaller
American defense companies. ""For a variety of reasons, it's going to be harder to enter
this market or sell into it,"" said defense analyst Loren
Thompson of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute. Defense officials, industry executives and analysts agree
that U.S. defense spending is likely to grow much more slowly
over the next four years than it did over the past eight,
regardless of whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John
McCain wins the presidential election. One reason: Congress
must find a way to pay for the unprecedented $700 billion
bailout package for the U.S. financial services industry. U.S. defense spending has climbed over 60 percent during
the Bush administration, and will total at least $612.5 billion
in fiscal 2009, including $542.5 billion for the basic defense
budget and $70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Steve Kosiak, analyst with the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, said weapons programs could be hit
relatively hard as defense spending leveled out. That would
create more pressure to protect U.S. manufacturers, especially
if the U.S. economy remains weak. ""The next administration may also take a more active role
in shaping and protecting the defense industrial base. That,
too, could result in some additional protectionism,"" he said. Analysts say protectionist rhetoric is already on the rise.
They cite campaign statements by both presidential candidates,
and anti-foreign comments by Boeing Co  supporters during
the company's protest against a $35 billion refueling aircraft
contract awarded to Northrop Grumman Corp  and its
European subcontractor, Airbus parent EADS . ""It's probably going to get worse before it gets better,""
said one defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Richard Aboulafia, analyst with the private Teal Group,
agreed. ""The sad truth is that both sides of the political
aisle have been back-pedaling on globalization."" EXPORTS MAY TEMPER MOOD Some U.S. industry executives and analysts argue that the
prospect of strong overseas sales -- which help maintain
production lines and high-paying jobs at home -- should prevent
any moves to reverse globalization in the aerospace sector. Clay Jones, chief executive of Rockwell Collins Inc
, a subcontractor to big defense companies, said it was
clear that a Democratic-controlled Congress and White House
would be more protectionist. But at the same time, efforts to
rein in defense spending might actually force the Pentagon to
pursue more global development programs like the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF), he told Reuters in an interview. Lockheed Martin Corp  is developing three variants
of the F-35 with eight international partners, including
Britain, at a cost of $299 billion. ""If you're trying to control the rate of defense spending,
the JSF arrangement makes a lot of sense,"" Jones said. Globalization also keeps the aerospace sector competitive
and generates good jobs at home, he said. Some U.S. weapon production lines, including Lockheed's
F-16 fighter jet and Boeing's F-18 warplane, were now surviving
solely due to foreign sales, said Remy Nathan, an assistant
vice president at the Aerospace Industries Association. ""I genuinely don't see some kind of a massive course
correction,"" Nathan said, referring to protectionist worries. EUROPEAN INROADS European companies made major inroads to the lucrative U.S.
defense market in recent years. EADS won a contract to build light utility helicopters for
the U.S. Army while AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's
Finmeccanica , is designing the next U.S. presidential
helicopter. Alenia, another Finmeccanica company, has a big
role in an Army contract for cargo planes. The Northrop-EADS refueling tanker project was the biggest
deal by far involving a European supplier. Pentagon chief arms buyer John Young has denied there was
any protectionist sentiment involved in the decision to
postpone the tanker competition, and said he remained convinced
that open competitions yielded the best results for U.S.
troops. But he said U.S. officials and lawmakers remained concerned
about the lack of access that U.S. companies had to some
European markets. ""I can't explain that to Congress,"" he said. Acquisitions have also let several European defense
companies increase their footprint in the U.S. market. Finmeccanica last month won permission to buy military
engineering and electronics company DRS Technologies Corp after
agreeing to put DRS' sensitive operations into a proxy company
that remains out of the control of Finmeccanica's Italian
bosses. Even with the condition, some U.S. government officials
remained concerned about the deal and nearly blocked its
approval, according to two sources. The Finmeccanica deal may be the last large foreign
acquisition of a U.S. weapons company for some time, given
tight global credit, the rising dollar, and concerns about
maintaining the U.S. industrial base. ""Finmeccanica may prove to be unique. These deals are going
to become harder to sell with the U.S. economy in such a
perilous condition,"" said Thompson.

1500,"Oct 29, 2008 06:40AM ET",ANALYSIS-Industry bailouts risk unfair trade challenge,nan," By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Will global cooperation over the
financial crisis give way to national fights over state
subsidies to industries hit by the economic fall-out? Maybe, say lawyers, since there are strict rules at the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) limiting the use of subsidies. But if all major countries are doing it, governments may not
want to point fingers for fear of drawing attention to their own
practices. ""To the extent that governments provide massive funds for
bailouts, they do raise subsidies issues, there's no doubt about
that,"" said Brendan McGivern, a partner at law firm White and
Case, and former head of disputes at Canada's WTO mission. However, he said countries often turn a blind eye to other
nations' subsidies, especially if they are doing the same thing. ""Governments are always concerned that if they challenge
other people's subsidies there's a risk of tit-for-tat
retaliation,"" he said. Differences over subsidies underlie some of the most bitter
trade disputes, such as the challenges by the United States and
European Union to each other's support for civil aircraft built
by Boeing Co and EADS NV unit Airbus. Governments around the world have pumped hundreds of
billions of dollars into their banking systems, taking over
toxic loans or injecting capital. Now there are calls for similar help for industrial
companies, hit by the economic repercussions of the crisis. Trade disputes could emerge if aid to industrial companies 
gives them an edge over foreign competitors.  CAUSING HARM Most of the calls for help have focused on the auto sector,
which manufactures big-ticket items particularly susceptible to
any retrenchment in consumer spending. Moreover, the troubled U.S. sector is directly exposed to
the credit crunch because of its reliance on consumer finance. Subsidies can be more than the provision of cash. A
government loan at below-commercial rates would also count. For EU member states an added complication is that any state
aid must not breach EU competition rules. The WTO declined to comment on the admissibility of any of
the proposals, which if challenged would have to be examined in
a legally binding process under WTO dispute rules. But the foundations of the WTO are that members must not
discriminate among their trading partners, and that they must
treat foreigners and locals equally. The WTO's agreement on subsidies clearly bans aid that
requires recipients to meet export targets or use a certain
amount of local content instead of imported goods. But other types of subsidy are allowed in some cases. A key
test is whether the subsidy causes harm elsewhere. ""The grant of the subsidy is not enough -- you've got to
show that the grant would injure an industry (in another
country),"" said John Donohue, an international trade lawyer in
the Philadelphia office of law firm Thorp Reed and Armstrong. Aid that allows a company to undercut a foreign competitor
in each other's home territory or third markets is more likely
to be challenged than one that just keeps a firm alive. But when times are tough, one of the first things companies
do is try and knock out their foreign competitors, Donohue said. ""If we hit a severe and prolonged recession, are we going to
see an increase in unfair trade cases by U.S. companies versus
foreign companies?"" he asked. Competitors can hit back at subsidies in various ways. Their
government may slap countervailing duties on the products to
compensate for the benefit of the subsidy, as well as mounting a
legal challenge to the aid itself.
