3,"Jun 03, 2019 02:10PM ET","In Chrysler, France May Be Served a Slice of Corporate Americana",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Chrysler has bounced around between different owners for the better part of two decades. Next up: the French government.If a board meeting slated for Tuesday goes according to plan and seals the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), the French government will end up owning a 7.5% sliver of the combined group. And while there are plenty of French companies owning U.S. household names -- think luxury house LVMH or advertising giant  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) -- the involvement of the state in a storied U.S. consumer brand is still an unusual corporate development.That the French government would ascend to a stakeholder in Chrysler is testament to the twists and turns that have characterized the U.S. carmaker’s winding corporate road, as well as France’s long history as a Renault shareholder. Founded in 1925, Chrysler ascended to the Big Three that dominated American roads for decades, though it’s long been the scrappy player trailing behind General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).Germany’s  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) bought the company in 1998, only to unceremoniously divest less than a decade later amid mounting losses. Following the global recession, Chrysler combined with Fiat SpA, which has managed to turn the business around.Among the company’s stable of products is the Jeep, which has a cult following among U.S. consumers and dates back to World War II, when the U.S. government solicited bids for a four-wheel drive vehicle to ferry soldiers over rugged European terrain. Chrysler’s lineup also includes Ram pickup trucks and Dodge Charger and Challenger muscle cars that have graces American garages for decades.In the past, Chrysler churned out oversize, gas-guzzling LeBaron sedans and Plymouth station wagons. In many ways, that history runs counter to France’s auto industry, which built a reputation for zippy and quirky cars like the Citroen DS, Renault R4 and Espace or the Peugeot 504, a rugged and boxy station wagon popular in far-flung places like Africa.Under the 34 billion-euro planned Franco-Italian deal, the French state’s 15% stake in Renault will be cut in half. While that might sound like a diminished role, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is still pushing for guarantees on French jobs and factories, as well as future influence. Paris is also pressing for boardroom representation along with operational headquarters for the combined company in France and the nomination of Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as chief executive officer for four years, Bloomberg News has reported.U.S. President Donald Trump has been mum about the potential deal. The “America first” leader has been a cheerleader for Detroit’s carmakers, with the exception of when they’ve closed plants or plotted investments in Mexico. He cheered Fiat Chrysler earlier this year for adding jobs in Michigan, but the company continues to operate several factories south of the border and recently cut a shift of workers at a plant in Illinois.If the Renault board gives the green light to the deal, Jeep and Ram would become part of a broad mix of brands and nameplates, ranging from Italian marques Maserati and Alfa Romeo to the diminutive Fiat 500 and compact Renault Clio. Fiat’s founding shareholder, the Agnelli family’s holding company Exor NV, would be the single largest investor."

10,"Apr 15, 2019 04:11AM ET","StockBeat: Publicis, IWG Sparkle on Deal News ",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Earnings season may be ramping up but it’s M&A activity that's grabbing most attention in Europe’s stock markets this morning.The biggest eye-catcher is French advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP), which rose over 4% at the opening after announcing it had agreed to buy the marketing data unit of  Alliance Data Systems  (NYSE:ADS) for some $4.4 billion. It’s given up some of those gains since, but the move — Publicis’ biggest ever acquisition — is exactly the type of investment it needs to get ahead in digital marketing and reduce its dependence on an old-media ad business that is being squeezed hard by the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Publicis was leading the CAC 40, which was broadly flat. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was also essentially unchanged at 387.40, despite more hints over the weekend that China and the U.S. are approaching agreement on their various trade disputes. The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% and Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, not helped by a drop in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares after a report alleging further emissions-related misdeeds on Sunday.Meanwhile in London, IWG (LON:IWG), the office space company formerly known as Regus, rose as much as 20% in early trading after agreeing to sell its Japanese business to Tokyo-based TKP for 320 million pounds ($420 milion), a sum that’s around 3.4 times the business’s annual revenue.Under a franchise agreement due to start next month, IWG will also continue to get an unspecified fee from TKP, which will act as operator for all of IWG’s flexible workspaces in Japan.Finally, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was up 0.5% after reporting further progress in preparing the sale of a stake in Universal Media Group.

23,"Feb 01, 2019 01:46PM ET",NewsGuard's 'real news' seal of approval helps spark change in fake news era,nan,"By Kenneth LiNEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 500 news websites have made changes to their standards or disclosures after getting feedback from NewsGuard, a startup that created a credibility ratings system for news on the internet, the company told Reuters this week. The latest major news organization to work with the company is Britain's Daily Mail, according to NewsGuard, which upgraded what it calls its ""nutrition label"" rating on the paper's site to ""green"" on Thursday, indicating it ""generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability.""A representative of the Daily Mail did not respond to several requests for comment. NewsGuard markets itself as an independent arbiter of credible news. It was launched last year by co-chief executives Steven Brill, a veteran U.S. journalist who founded Brill's Content and the American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of News Corp's Wall Street Journal.NewsGuard joins a handful of other groups such as the Trust Project and the Journalism Trust Initiative which aim to help readers discern which sites are credible when many readers have trouble distinguishing fact from fiction. After facing anger over the rapid spread of false news in the past year or so,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other tech companies also say they have recruited more human fact checkers to identify and sift out some types of inaccurate articles.These efforts were prompted at least in part by the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Facebook and other social media sites were used to disseminate many false news stories.The company has been criticized by Breitbart News, a politically conservative site, which described NewsGuard as ""the establishment media’s latest effort to blacklist alternative media sites."" The way NewsGuard works is this: red or green shield-shaped labels are visible in a web browser window when looking at a news website if a user downloads NewsGuard's software from the web. The software is free and works with the four leading browsers: Google's Chrome, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's Safari. 'CALL EVERYONE FOR COMMENT' NewsGuard's investors include the French advertising company  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) and the non-profit Knight Foundation. Thomas Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, owns a smaller stake, according to NewsGuard's website. News sites do not pay the company for its service.The startup said it employs 35 journalists who have reviewed and published labels on about 2,200 sites based on nine journalistic criteria such as whether the site presents information responsibly, has a habit of correcting errors, or discloses its ownership and who is in charge of the content. News sites field questions if they choose to from NewsGuard journalists about its performance on the nine criteria.""We call everyone for comment which algorithms don't do,"" Brill said in an interview, highlighting the difference between NewsGuard's verification process with the computer code used by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook in bringing new stories to the attention of users. Some news organizations have clarified their ownership, financial backers and identity of their editorial staff after interacting with the company, NewsGuard said.GateHouse Media, which publishes more than 140 local newspapers such as the Austin American-Statesman and Akron Beacon Journal, made changes to how it identifies sponsored content that may appear to be objective reporting but is actually advertising, after being contacted by NewsGuard.  ""We made our standards and practices more prominent and consistent across our digital 460 news brands across the country,"" said Jeff Moriarty, GateHouse's senior vice president of digital.Reuters News, which earned a green rating on all nine of NewsGuard's criteria, added the names and titles of its editorial leaders to the Reuters.com website after being contacted by NewsGuard, a Reuters spokesperson said.NewsGuard upgraded the Daily Mail's website rating on Thursday to green after giving it a red label in August, when it stated that the site ""repeatedly publishes false information and has been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases."" The Daily Mail objected to that description, and started discussions with NewsGuard in January after the red label became visible for mobile users of Microsoft's Edge browser, NewsGuard said. NewsGuard has made public many details of its exchange with the Daily Mail on its website. ""We're not in the business of trying to give people red marks,"" Brill said. ""The most common side effect of what we do is for news organizations to improve their journalistic practices.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

34,"Oct 25, 2018 06:10AM ET",WPP shares plunge as ad group falls behind in post-Sorrell era,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) lost a fifth of its market value after downturns at its New York and London creative agencies forced it to cut sales and profit forecasts, showing the scale of the task facing its new boss after founder Martin Sorrell's acrimonious exit.Mark Read, a softly-spoken veteran of the world's biggest advertising group, said WPP needed to sell assets, hold off acquisitions and bring in new talent at its storied agencies such as JWT, Ogilvy and Y&R, in order to recover. WPP's third-quarter downturn, which wiped 2.8 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) off its market value, was all the more startling as it came after decent updates from peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP). The results indicated that the high-margin and previously strong media units that buy ad space and plan campaigns were also struggling. ""We need to have stronger creative agencies,"" Read told Reuters. ""We do have good people, we need more of them. This isn't going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about the speed at which the business is going to turn around."" Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising boss, built WPP from a two-man office in central London into the world's most powerful advertising company offering creative work, media buying, pr, consultancy and data analytics. The group outperformed for years, helped by Sorrell's ability to buy companies and win pitches, but growth disappeared at the start of 2017 due to competition from consultancies and tech groups Facebook (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL) which enable clients to cut out the middle men and place ads directly.Sorrell left in April after a complaint about personal misconduct which he denied. He remains a top 10 shareholder and has since set up a new challenger group, S4C. ""The challenges we've seen in the third quarter reinforce our determination to take more radical action and to move more decisively,"" Read said. RADICAL ACTION The British group will start by selling a stake in its underperforming data analytics group Kantar, which has been valued at around 3.5 billion pounds by analysts.That will help to lift overall growth and add to the 16 non-core assets it has already sold, raising 704 million pounds. The efforts will help lower debt from almost 5 billion pounds. Sales were particularly weak in North America and the UK for WPP, which lowered its net sales full-year guidance, saying it could fall as much as 1 percent compared with a target of 0.3 percent growth just three months ago. The operating margin is likely to be down between 1 and 1.5 margin points, compared with a previous prediction of down 0.4. The shares were down 16 percent at 0925, taking them down 34 percent in the year to date and giving WPP a market value of 11.1 billion pounds. ""WPP has delivered a proper profit warning,"" analysts at Citi said. ""Third quarter organic growth is materially below expectations and having raised guidance at the beginning of September the group has cut it hard today.""Major WPP clients such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) are facing their own pressures, forcing them to question everything they spend and taking some marketing work in house. In recent months WPP has also lost some major pitches, most notably the creative account for Ford to Omnicom's BBDO, which it had previously held for 75 years. WPP also said that Finance Director Paul Richardson would step down after 22 years in the role. ($1 = 0.7748 pounds)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

41,"Aug 30, 2018 03:31PM ET",WPP set to name internal favorite Mark Read as new CEO: source,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) will name its unassuming former digital boss Mark Read as its new chief executive, tasked with turning around the world's largest advertising group in the wake of Martin Sorrell's departure, a city source told Reuters. Read was seen as the leading internal candidate to become CEO after he spent almost nine years on the board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job in 1989. The city source, who declined to be named because the decision is not yet public, said Read would be given the job as long as the two sides have agreed terms. Due to publish results next Tuesday, WPP declined to comment. Read stepped up to become WPP joint chief operating officer in April after Sorrell, its founder and the world's most famous advertising man, quit after 33 years in charge following a complaint of personal misconduct which he denied. He takes over the 16 billion pound company at a difficult time, as the industry goes through a period of unprecedented change as clients seek to save costs by doing some digital marketing themselves and others turn to consultants for advice. Others are placing ads directly on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), cutting out the middlemen advertising groups.The group had outperformed its peers - Omnicom (N:OMC) and IPG (L:IPG) in the United States, France's Publicis (PA:PUBP) and Havas and Japan's Dentsu (T:4324) - for years but lost its way in 2017 with organic growth disappearing. Clients have told Reuters they hugely value WPP's work but they want the group to be streamlined. Operating in 112 countries, WPP has 400 separate agencies that provide everything from pure advertising to media planning strategies, data research and PR. Those 400 agencies have traditionally competed with each other, meaning clients can deal with multiple different agencies. They now want those agencies to work together to provide a more simplified service. Read told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry.Some moves are already evident - the group is moving its headquarters, has revamped its website to provide a more sleek message and clients and WPP executives have told Reuters they've seen a more collaborative approach from the top.Married with two young children, Read had been the popular option among senior and junior members of WPP staff spoken to by Reuters. News of his pending appointment was first reported by the Financial Times.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

42,"Aug 23, 2018 02:11AM ET",Europe's new data law upends global online advertising,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - Europe's new data privacy law has put a small army of tech firms that track people online in jeopardy and is strengthening the hand of giants such as Google and Facebook in the $200 billion global digital advertising industry.The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) brought in by the European Union in May is designed to protect personal information in the age of the internet and requires websites to seek consent to use personal data, among other measures.The ability to track internet users has attracted hundreds of companies that harvest and crunch user data from websites - with or without the consent of the site owner – to form very specific individual consumer profiles.GDPR poses a challenge to those groups because they all need consent to use the data. While sites often request consent on behalf of the ad tech firms they use directly, uncertainty over whether every link in the supply chain is GDPR-compliant is pushing some to leave Europe altogether.Concerns about GDPR should, however, benefit Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google and Facebook (O:FB) as their loyal customers are more likely to give consent to carry on using sites, allowing the U.S. giants to keep amassing and analyzing vast amounts of GDPR-compliant data that advertisers will pay to use.Big publishers such as national newspapers are also likely to keep their readers and believe they can benefit by eventually charging advertisers more for online slots in the knowledge they are compliant with the new EU rules.""It's challenging for the digital ecosystem,"" said Mark Read, joint boss at the world's biggest ad agency, WPP (L:WPP). ""But if consumers feel confident that their data is being protected and they understand how it is being used and it's done with permission, ultimately that should be a good thing for clients and for us,"" he told Reuters. TANGLED WEBFrom a standing start nearly 30 years ago, the internet has become the largest advertising medium in the world because it allows firms to target consumers with ads based on anything from their browsing history, comments, spending power to location.Within the tangled ecosystem are multiple firms that help brands and ad agencies connect to sites that fund content with targeted ads. For every dollar spent by an advertiser, about half may go to ad tech groups, according to industry estimates.When an internet user pulls up a page multiple bid requests are sent into the advertising ecosystem touting facts about the person such as demographics and interests, as well as the nature of the site they are viewing. That personal data can then pass through a dozen or more ad tech firms before a company or ad agency bids at an auction for space on the website and an advert is loaded. It is that spread of personal data that risks breaking the new EU privacy law. For example, a firm that provides ads for a website viewed on a mobile phone may use other partners not included in the compliance chain to provide information about a user's location.That doubt about compliance is threatening the myriad ad tech middlemen and is also prompting advertisers and publishers to rethink how they share their user data.""In a world where we are putting the consumer first, there are only going to be so many opportunities for the very colorful ecosystem of companies to obtain consent,"" said Andrew Casale, head of ad group Index Exchange http://www.indexexchange.com.UNCERTAIN TIMESIn the midst of the disruption, some ad tech groups are pulling out of Europe. Harry Kargman, founder of mobile ad firm Kargo https://www.kargo.com, told Reuters the company had withdrawn for now because it did not know how GDPR would be applied. ""There is too much uncertainty,"" he said. ""And I don't think (that will change) until they apply it in specific cases.""Verve https://www.verve.com, a company that helps advertisers target consumers on mobiles based on location, and Drawbridge https://www.drawbridge.com, a cross-device user data firm, have both stopped operating ad businesses in Europe.Factual https://www.factual.com, another company that provides consumer data based on their location, also temporarily scaled back its operations in Europe after realizing the mobile apps it relies on ""could not safely claim they were compliant"".Others groups higher up the food chain have also been hit. France's Publicis (PA:PUBP), one of the world's top five advertising companies, said it had felt the effect.""Advertisers were cautious about spending money in supply chains that they weren't absolutely sure they could target safely or legally,"" said Steve King, CEO of Publicis Media. Kargo's Kargman expects Facebook and Google to benefit from the uncertainty. The two companies are likely to receive a high ratio of user consent given their loyal customer base while both own high-quality data because users post likes, dislikes and location, or search for areas of interest on Google or YouTube. The companies also have deep pockets so can ensure they are compliant, throwing engineers and lawyers at the problem and reassuring brands at a time of uncertainty.But they too have had to make changes. Facebook lost about 1 million European monthly active users after GDPR and it said a desire by some users to avoid targeted ads is likely to lead to a modest revenue hit.In response to GDPR, it has asked advertisers to certify they have the proper consent to use any data from third-party brokers, potentially shedding itself of some liability.Google is also requiring publishers to secure consent when using its ad products on their properties. Marketers and partners also need to now use more of Google's own services. It has stopped providing easy access to lists that helped companies evaluate the success of their ads by showing which users clicked on them. Advertisers must now use Google's Ads Data Hub application to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.Google declined to comment for this article. It has previously said GDPR is a big change and is working with partners on compliance.GOOD NEWS FOR PUBLISHERS?Of the more than 20 executives spoken to by Reuters, from ad bosses to publishers, tech groups, brands, lawyers and consultants, all expect the supply chain to thin out - leaving publishers to potentially receive a greater slice of ad revenue.""Given the number of actors it could take some time though,"" said Phil Smith, head of UK advertiser trade body ISBA https://www.isba.org.uk. Leading British sports website GiveMeSport https://www.givemesport.com is one publisher hoping the biggest overhaul of data privacy laws in more than 20 years will challenge the system. ""There are too many middlemen and they've been eating the cake,"" General Manager Ryan Skeggs said. ""We're hoping GDPR will help weed them out. The sites that do well, theoretically speaking, should then make more money."" Three of the leading UK newspaper groups - Rupert Murdoch's News UK https://www.news.co.uk, The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com and The Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk - have joined forces in the Ozone Project to sell their online inventory, or ad space, together, offering advertisers access to 39 million users. Project leader Damon Reeve said publishers had lost control of their data to tech vendors. By compiling only quality inventory, he hopes marketers and publishers will start sharing user data directly - making them less reliant on third parties.That should provide a boost to the newspaper industry which is still grappling with the shift online, where ad rates are far lower than those charged for a space in a physical edition.""By 2020, Ozone could add circa 30 million pounds ($38 million) per annum – not a trivial contribution to a national newspaper newsroom,"" said analysts at consultancy Enders Analysis https://www.endersanalysis.com.Adam Smith, a director at WPP's media buying arm GroupM https://www.groupm.com, agreed the focus on user compliance was likely to cut the amount of available inventory. ""That feeds into price inflation for the sought after inventory,"" he said.How long the initial impact of GDPR will last, though, is not yet clear as many consumers - tired of the constant permission pop ups - are just giving consent to access sites. Prosecutors are also yet to bring any cases for data breaches.But GDPR has ramped up the speed of change in what has been such a fragmented industry. ""This kind of consolidation is natural in most maturing industries,"" Enders analyst Matti Littunen said. ""GDPR has just accelerated it.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

54,"Jul 03, 2018 12:07PM ET","Firing fake pineapples, Pernod uses 'influencers' to drive sales",nan,"By Martinne Geller and Kate HoltonLONDON/CANNES, France (Reuters) - This spring, Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Malibu Rum paid American singer Nick Jonas to host a competition in Vietnam that began with 33 Instagram stars battling to catch fake pineapples while flying off a giant waterslide into the sea. In one month alone, videos and pictures from the ""Malibu Games"" were viewed 2.4 billion times online, showing the potential for so-called ""influencer marketing"" to reach social media-mad consumers that may overlook older, traditional brands.This kind of advertising, where celebrities and popular bloggers earn money by posting about products, has developed over the past five years on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter (N:TWTR), Facebook (O:FB) and YouTube.Influencer marketing found early popularity with beauty, fast fashion and fitness brands but has now spread across the spectrum, even though some analysts question whether it actually works. It accounted for about $1 billion a year of advertising spend on Instagram alone last year, according to influencer marketing agency Mediakix, which predicts the entire market could reach $10 billion by 2020; still tiny in the near $600 billion ad realm, but growing fast. Thibaut Portal, leader of Pernod's global media hub, said influencer marketing was playing a ""growing and key role"" in the French spirit maker's campaigns and was in use on all its major brands.Influencers give Pernod more options for spending marketing dollars online, an important destination for liquor companies which have restrictions on television advertising in some places, such as France.Sometimes brands use social media stars with millions of followers to drive awareness of a brand, but other times pick ""micro-influencers"" with thousands of followers who, as experts in their industry, can impact choices. ""We are not interested in working with big, massive influencers with four or five million followers (when) the week after, the same influencer is going to post a picture of a washing machine,"" Portal said.The rapid growth of influencer marketing shows how the broader ad industry is changing, as brands struggle to reach consumers in a world of fragmented content on the internet, now the biggest platform ahead of TV. Brands will pay anywhere from $10,000 to more than $100,000 for a single social media post, experts say, depending on the size, engagement and loyalty of the person's followers. This can buy online content more cheaply than traditional advertising. Pernod is far from alone in using the technique, with fellow consumer giants like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mars all testing the waters. Pernod declined to say how much of its 1.7 billion euro marketing budget it spent on influencers, but Unilever said it accounted for ""tens of millions"" of its 7.7 billion euro marketing last year. However some analysts question whether a viral video clip seen millions of times actually lifts sales. Influencers can also artificially enhance their audience numbers - which often dictate their fees - by purchasing fake followers, machine-generated profiles fueled by ""bots"". This was highlighted last month when Unilever said it would cut ties with influencers that buy followers.""If it was a child before, it's a teenager now, and it's got to grow up quickly,"" Neil Waller, co-founder of influencer marketing platform Whalar, said about the fledgling advertising area. CUT OUT MIDDLEMANPernod credits Malibu's social media presence for helping to invigorate the brand, whose sales volume grew in each of the past three years, according to researchers IWSR, after falling the previous two.The Malibu Games mostly featured people whose notoriety centers on social media. Besides singer Jonas (15.4 million followers on Instagram), participants included Sierra Dallas (1.2 million), Alba Paul Ferrer (878,000) and Rory Kramer (483,000). The influencers posted about their experiences of the three-day event, including enough short video clips to make up over four hours of footage. A teaser video was watched 10 million times, the company said.Getting creative content directly from influencers also allows brands to skirt the middleman, traditional ad agencies owned by the likes of WPP (L:WPP), Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG). Nonetheless, agencies are using the tactic too. ""We're deeply involved in it, when creative agencies launch campaigns there will be an influencer element in it,"" Jonathan Nelson, digital boss of the world's second largest ad company Omnicom said. ""These are tailored experiences for you.""Research by Accenture found that 53 percent of consumers aged 18 to 34 were loyal to brands that partnered with social influencers, compared with just 8 percent for those over 55. According to e-commerce analytics firm L2, 72 percent of Instagram users report making purchase decisions based on something that they saw on the site.   Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed said he expected influencers to take a growing part of his budget. ""We see it as a very powerful vehicle ... creating very authentic real-time content at a much lower price,"" Weed told Reuters. ""The way it penetrates the culture, I really do think it's going to be a big and vibrant market."" Mars, another major advertiser, is also a fan. It divides its ad budget, with 80 percent going on proven campaigns and media, 15 percent in areas that are unproven but where there is a method of measurement, and 5 percent on total experimentation. Influencer marketing falls into both the biggest and the second-biggest categories depending on the type of campaign. Goat, a nearly three-year old agency that works with around 40,000 influencers, helped recruit members for the Malibu Games, opting for stars with a broad, young appeal. ""The key is can they influence their audience,"" co-founder Arron Shepherd said. ""With Malibu we're looking to make it the number one drink that people think of in the summer.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

As the biggest holding company in the sector, WPP has been particularly hard hit, losing major contracts, almost 30 percent of its market value and in April, its founder and chief executive Martin Sorrell over a personal misconduct allegation.Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing and the company has not divulged the nature of the complaint against him. The softly-spoken Mark Read, WPP's former digital boss, has been appointed to run the company of 200,000 employees as a joint chief operating officer in the short term, charged with reviewing its structure while keeping staff and clients onside.""In five years time the business should look radically different but we can evolve ourselves there,"" he told Reuters at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival where ad and tech companies go to meet the world's biggest marketing spenders.The exit of the 73-year-old Sorrell came at a momentous time for the industry, as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) threaten to cut out middlemen ad agencies and as new challengers like consultants battle to win high-margin strategic and advisory work. Read says the world's biggest companies are not questioning the value of spending on their brand or message, rather they are changing how they target consumers in a world of mass, but fragmented, content.""Just like us, clients realized that they needed to more radically examine their costs,"" he said. ""They're not demonstrating a lack of commitment in marketing or marketing spend, they're shifting it from what they used to do to what they want to do in the future. ""In the same way, we need to position WPP to capture the spend of the future."" CHANGE IN THE AIRMajor clients have made clear they no longer want to work with multiple people across multiple agencies to secure market research, data analytics and public relations services, plus ads on multiple platforms. WPP's rivals Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP), IPG (N:IPG) and Dentsu have been less affected so far than the British-based company which owns more than 400 agencies, traditionally set up to compete with each other. Read, long seen as a successor to Sorrell after he wrote to him asking for a job in 1989, said he had spent recent weeks talking to colleagues and clients and said WPP would do better at incentivising one-time competitors to work together.The scale of the challenge is huge, however. After ploughing billions of dollars into online advertising, major brands are now demanding more transparency on how their money is spent, and evidence on how it leads to a transaction. Clients, under pressure from the digital forces weighing on their own operations, are demanding greater efficiency, particularly consumer goods groups like  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G that are served by WPP. ""If you look at the production of content, clients don't want a 5 percent reduction in the cost, they want an 80 percent reduction,"" he said. ""So it's about redirecting resources and sometimes that requires a more radical examination of your cost to take the legacy cost out and redirect it to the future.""Read admits the company, present in 112 countries, is in a transition phase. He is working with fellow COO Andrew Scott to review the structure, but WPP is unlikely to embark on a major new strategy until the next CEO is in place.Much of the talk at the annual industry event has been dominated by the travails at WPP and who should take over, with P&G's marketing boss Marc Pritchard and Verizon's Tim Armstrong also seen as candidates. The unexpected departure of Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising man who was rarely out of the headlines, has catapulted the 51-year-old father of two, Read, into the spotlight. He describes the last 10 weeks as ""eventful"" and says WPP now needs leadership.Less showy than his former boss, Read thought for some seconds before saying he was enjoying the job, and that he didn't accept the view that traditional advertising was doomed. ""It's a challenge,"" he said, on the terrace of one of the major hotels that look over the seafront, wearing shorts and a t-shirt. ""Running a company like WPP, to some extent you need to lead from the front, and I'm happy to lead.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

58,"May 30, 2018 10:25AM ET",Sorrell plots comeback with new listed company after WPP exit,nan,"By Kate Holton(Reuters) - Martin Sorrell is staging a comeback just six weeks after he was ousted from WPP (L:WPP), using the same formula as in the 1980s when he transformed a little-known shell company into the world's biggest advertising group. One of Britain's best known businessmen, Sorrell said he would invest 40 million pounds ($53 million) of his own money into Derriston Capital (L:DERR) while institutional investors have pledged 150 million pounds to buy marketing companies.The London-listed group will be renamed S4 Capital, in reference to four generations of Sorrell's family, while he will become executive chairman. Its next moves are likely to be closely watched in an industry facing questions over whether the ad guru's model is still the best way to deliver adverts, marketing, research data and media buying in a digital world. WPP and its peers have struggled in recent years as major consumer goods groups such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) trimmed spending on marketing and took some services in house, while consultancies such as Accenture have stepped up competition and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominate the online ad market. ""S4 Capital is a company that aims to build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth,"" the 73-year-old said. ""There are significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content."" The new company, which has raised 51 million pounds through Sorrell and institutional investors including Lombard Odier, Miton, a Rothschild investment unit,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and Toscafund, is in early talks over a number of potential acquisitions. The group is looking to buy assets in the faster growing part of the industry such as technology and data which can be used to maximize the effectiveness of advertising, while markets such as India could also be of interest. TRIED AND TESTEDTaking charge of a listed shell company repeats the tactic Sorrell used in the 1980s when he took a stake in Wire and Plastics Products, a maker of shopping baskets, and used it as a vehicle to buy some of the most famous advertising agencies such as JWT and Ogilvy & Mather.Derriston Capital is a little-known two-year-old listed shell company set up to invest in medical technology. Over 30 years Sorrell built WPP into a company with 200,000 staff in 112 countries by adding market research groups, media buyers, and public relations firms such as Finsbury. Worth 16 billion pounds, WPP returned millions to shareholders, including its CEO, and dominated the industry for decades. According to Thomson Reuters data, Sorrell is still the eighth biggest investor in WPP, with a 1.4 percent stake. Sorrell had vowed to break down the barriers at WPP to make it easier for clients to get all the services they needed from a small team, rather than from a range of people among the more than 400 agencies it owned.Starting again should make it easier to mould a business more aligned to the needs of today.WPP competes with U.S. groups Omnicom (N:OMC) and IPG (N:IPG), France's Publicis (PA:PUBP) and Japan's Dentsu, while thousands of small independent companies provide everything from ads for mobile phones to creative work and data analytics.Sorrell quit WPP after the board opened an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct.The company has not given any details and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. He told staff he had stepped down because the disruption was putting too much pressure on the business.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Apr 30, 2018 05:25AM ET",WPP's Read reviewing structure as results boost shares,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - Mark Read, tasked with running WPP (L:WPP) after the sudden exit of founder Martin Sorrell, said he would look at restructuring the world's biggest advertising group but ruled out a break up.Digital boss Read, appointed joint chief operating officer alongside acquisitions specialist Andrew Scott, said on Monday the company had the tools to respond in an industry facing lower customer spending and technological upheaval.Quarterly sales were not as bad as feared, boosting WPP shares as much as 9 percent and easing some of the investor pressure on the owner of ad agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather.Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its underperforming market research arm Kantar as an initial step to start to unwind the empire built up by Sorrell over more than three decades.Scott said the group would definitely look at disposing some minority assets it holds. Read, who was previously on the board for nine years, was speaking as the group reported first-quarter trading figures. Organic net sales slipped only 0.1 percent -- compared with a 1 percent drop that analysts had forecast.The share jump meant the WPP stock was on course for its best single gain ever and has now regained the losses it incurred when it announced Sorrell's departure on April 14. ""We are not complacent about what we need to do and we recognize that we need to get the top-line growing more quickly,"" Read told Reuters in an interview. ""There are structural shifts in the industry and we need to have more of a structural response, (but) we are an industry in structural change, not structural decline.""WPP, which provides advertising, data and market research to the likes of Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) through its 200,000 staff in 112 countries, has been rocked this month by the departure of its founder who launched the company 33 years ago.HARD ACT TO FOLLOWSorrell, who built the company from a two-man outfit in 1985 to dominate the industry, will be a hard act to follow after he never missed a quarterly results session and used them as a platform to discuss everything from advertising trends to geopolitical events. Sorrell, 73, quit after an allegation of personal misconduct. WPP did not give any details of the allegation and Sorrell denied the charges.Investors, and the board, are likely to assess how Read and Scott deal with the presentation to financial analysts on Monday, compared with the smooth Sorrell.WPP has trailed its peers Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) in terms of growth rates in the last year as it was particularly hit by the lower spending from consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G.It has said it does not expect to grow in 2018, a position it reiterated on Monday. The weak performance, combined with the upheaval sparked by the growth of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has prompted some analysts to question whether WPP should be broken up or at least sell some underperforming divisions such as its market research arm Kantar.Read declined to comment on a report in the Financial Times that said private equity group CVC had approached WPP about a potential sale of Kantar Media but he said that division needed to do better. He added however: ""Even within Kantar it's mainly the custom parts of the business (that is struggling), other parts of the business are doing well."" The custom parts refer to projects carried out for individual clients. His comments could point towards a more nuanced approach to the restructuring, selling off bits of assets but not dumping whole divisions within the group.NO TIMETABLE Read, who is seen as a front runner for the CEO job, said it did not make sense to break up WPP but that he and Scott were reviewing all options and will present them to Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta. He said there was no timetable for the process. ""Roberto has asked Andrew and I to look at the strategy and come back as quickly as we can to the board with recommendations,"" he said. The trading update is likely to ease some of the pressure on the group. The results were boosted by an improved performance in Britain and Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe. ""Mark Read and Andrew Scott are providing the stability and leadership WPP requires, but there is no standing still,"" Quarta said. ""They have my and the board's full backing to review the strategy, to come back to us with recommendations, and to move forward decisively to implement our vision for the group.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

63,"Apr 27, 2018 12:40PM ET",WPP digital boss Read prepares to step into Sorrell's shoes for first quarter results,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - WPP's digital boss Mark Read will get the chance to stake his claim to the top job at the world's biggest advertising company when he helps to present its first set of results without founder Martin Sorrell on Monday.Sorrell, who built a two-man business into one of Britain's biggest companies with operations in 112 countries, never missed a quarterly results presentation and routinely appeared on TV and radio shows to discuss everything from advertising trends to global economic events and politics.He stood down two weeks ago after the board opened an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct, sparking a hunt for a replacement after 33 years and at a time when the company is facing challenges on every front. Sorrell denied the allegations and the company has said they will not be made public. Read is seen as the leading internal candidate to become chief executive after he spent almost nine years on the WPP (LON:WPP) board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell and secured a job in 1989. On Monday, he will join his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott, Finance Director Paul Richardson and Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta in presenting the first-quarter results, while Read will also speak to the media. ""I've spent as much time as possible speaking to our people and clients,"" Read wrote in a memo to staff last week. ""There's universal admiration for Martin's achievements, and sadness about his departure. ""At the same time, there's a huge amount of support and goodwill for the company, and no shortage of confidence about the future.""The company will consider internal and external candidates.Whoever takes over the top job will face a difficult task, however, after the group published in March its weakest results since the financial crash due to lower spending from consumer goods groups like  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G and competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It forecast no growth in net sales in 2018 and analysts are expecting a first-quarter figure of down 1 percent or worse.""Despite the change of CEO, other things are unlikely to change at WPP near term,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. ""We expect WPP to stay with its guidance which is for organic flat net sales growth in 2018 and a flat underlying margin in constant currency.""The sudden departure of Sorrell has also sparked speculation as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies now that clients want a more joined-up offering. Read told colleagues he did not believe breaking the business up made sense. ""In a world where clients need faster, more agile, integrated solutions, we need to get closer together, not further apart,"" he said.WPP is the last of the big four advertising agencies to update the market after Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) all reported strong first-quarter results.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Apr 21, 2018 08:30AM ET",Ford tells WPP it will take bids from other ad agencies,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Company (N:F) said on Saturday it will take bids on some of its advertising managed by WPP (L:WPP), adding to uncertainty around the British ad giant after last week's exit of founder Martin Sorrell.While Ford's decision does not affect all of its accounts with WPP - and the agency will be able to bid for the rest of the business along with everyone else - it comes at a difficult juncture for the world's biggest advertising firm.Sorrell, who over 33 years built the firm into one of Britain's biggest companies, quit last week as chief executive officer after an allegation of personal misconduct that he denies.Saturday's announcement is part of a review of Ford's strategy that has lasted since November, when it told long-time partner WPP that it was considering its future ad model.""We are going to place some portions of our advertising business up for bid with other agencies, including WPP, beginning in the coming weeks. No decisions have been made,"" Ford Britain said in a statement.It added that WPP is a trusted partner of Ford and that it had offered the agency more detail about its marketing aspirations.WPP, which counts Ford as a major client, declined to comment.WPP staff were sent a memo on Friday outlining Ford's decision.""WPP will have an opportunity to compete with other firms to retain these portions of the business, and will remain Ford's agency of record in some other key areas,"" a copy of the memo seen by Reuters said.Ford's review of its ad operations does not include accounts with WPP in China, public affairs, U.S. dealerships or WPP's Hudson Rouge agency that handles Ford's luxury Lincoln brand, the memo said.WPP and its major rivals Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) face challenges on every front, from the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - whom Sorrell famously dubbed ""frenemies"" - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte.With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups are grappling to become more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

68,"Apr 19, 2018 05:23AM ET",Publicis and industrials lead the pack as earnings dominate European stocks trading,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Advertising group Publicis and industrial stocks made gains on Thursday as strong results spurred them higher, while the main European indices stalled, showing signs of fatigue after a two-day rally took them to six-week highs. Earnings dominated trading, with Swiss industrial equipment maker ABB (S:ABBN) and French electric components firm Schneider (PA:SCHN) the biggest boosts to the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. ABB rose 3.9 percent after reporting its best start to the year since 2015, while Schneider's profit beat sent its shares up 2 percent. Shares in ABB rival  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also rose 1.5 percent.Advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) shone at the top of the STOXX after delivering a first-quarter sales beat helped by a rebound in North American activities.Its shares jumped 6.1 percent, boosting the media sector (SXMP) up 0.8 percent. ""The fact we have now had a second agency group [after U.S. firm Omnicom on Tuesday] report top-line positive organic revenue growth should reassure on the secular concerns,"" said Liberum analysts.Publicis' British rival WPP (L:WPP) also gained 3.4 percent as the results helped improve sentiment on agencies, which has been very negative.A surge in metals prices, after Russian sanctions sparked concerns over global supply, lifted the basic resources index (SXPP) up 0.4 percent, having soared 4.3 percent on Wednesday.Finnish steel firm Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) gained 2.8 percent, reflecting a rise in Japanese steelmakers overnight after a summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump produced no bad news on tariffs.Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) also rose 2.3 percent.Overall the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) hovered near six-week highs as a weaker healthcare sector outweighed gains in resources stocks. Novartis  (S:NOVN) shares fell 1.8 percent despite the Swiss drugmaker confirming 2018 targets. Baader Helvea analysts pointed to weaker first-quarter performance for its Sandoz drug in the U.S., and lower than expected profitability in the Innovative Medicine segment.Results from Nestle and  Unilever  reignited concerns about large consumer goods firms' pricing power. Unilever (L:ULVR) declined 2 percent after investors focused on weaker pricing which the Chief Financial Officer said was expected, due to difficulties in Brazil, North America and the UK.""We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.Nestle (S:NESN) shares barely budged despite the maker of Kit Kat chocolate confirming its outlook and saying volumes had picked up.Tech stocks also held the STOXX back with chipmakers arms (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), STMicro (MI:STM), and ASML (AS:ASML) all falling after Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) reported weaker than expected results.Merger and acquisition news also drove some big share price moves.  Weir Group  (L:WEIR) shares jumped 5.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm agreed to acquire U.S. mining tools maker ESCO for $1.05 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"Apr 16, 2018 12:24PM ET","Britain's WPP, investors adjust to life without Sorrell",nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) entered uncharted territory on Monday after the exit of founder Martin Sorrell left the world's biggest advertising company rudderless at a time of intense industry change.Shares in WPP fell 6 percent after Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion, stepped down on Saturday after the board investigated an allegation of misconduct.David Herro of Harris Associates, WPP's biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data, said Sorrell would be missed.""Sir Martin is a visionary, a legend in advertising and a skilful businessman,"" he said. ""The circumstances surrounding this are regrettable as is a leadership transition without Sir Martin's involvement. The sudden departure of Sorrell, the face of the company which he founded in 1985, has sparked questions as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies across 112 countries.It has also prompted fears that without Sorrell's contacts it could lose clients and talent while it seeks a new CEO. ""We think the lack of operational direction for the group and potential for client losses are clear downside risks over the short to medium term,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said. ""The potential for asset sales or even a break-up may provide some support, but these are highly uncertain and unlikely to take place in the near-term."" WPP said that chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman while its digital boss Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the chief operating officer of WPP Europe who oversaw acquisitions, become joint chief operating officers.They inherit a difficult task, with WPP in March publishing its weakest results since the financial crisis as consumer goods groups such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G cut spending and other customers jumped ship.The industry is also battling the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which dominate the online advertising market, and watching nervously as consultants such as Accenture move more aggressively into the sector.The changing dynamics have meant the previous idea of building marketing groups up to offer advertising, branding, planning and research on a global scale - championed by Sorrell and followed by others - is now under threat as clients want more nimble relationships in a digital age.Many are starting to ask if they can do things differently - creating their own content to place directly on online platforms or working with smaller ad groups.Analysts are already saying that WPP's market research arm Kantar could be sold off for around 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion), compared with the group's overall market value of 14.5 billion pounds, and question whether there are synergies from holding PR assets like Finsbury. Sorrell had argued that the insight provided from market research had set WPP apart from peers such as Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG), enabling it to improve its decision making when planning and buying media space for ads. The group also owns stakes in groups such as Chime Communications, Vice, AppNexus and Chime Communications which could be reviewed. ALL CHANGEWith so much change in the industry, some analysts have questioned whether the group should seek a new CEO from outside who could look at it dispassionately.Names already in the frame include Jerry Buhlmann, who runs the Dentsu Aegis network, and Adam Crozier who previously ran broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV) and  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG). Jeremy Darroch, the well regarded CEO of bid target Sky, and Andrew Robertson, boss of rival ad agency BBDO, have also been linked with the job. From inside WPP Read, 51, is seen as the lead candidate. While a common refrain heard about WPP is that no one knows the company like Sorrell, Read is the one man who comes close after he wrote to the WPP boss asking for a job in 1989. From the company's office in Farm Street, Mayfair, he watched as Sorrell pulled off a string of takeovers before building his own profile by growing its digital operations. He spent nearly 10 years on the WPP board, introducing him to investors, and is regarded by peers as a strategic thinker who can win corporate pitches to bring in work. Scott, 49, is better known in the corporate world than the advertising community, having worked on the company's acquisition strategy. ""Mark will be responsible for clients, operating companies and people,"" a spokesman said. ""Andrew will focus on financial and operational performance and implementing on-going reorganization of the group's portfolio.""They will ""report to and be supported"" by Quarta. Read has already contacted senior executives within WPP to offer to speak to clients and reassure them that work will continue as normal. Whoever replaces Sorrell however will face longer-term questions as to whether a group that was built in his mould should remain intact after his departure. Already executives are predicting that bits will be sold off in a move that could once again become a model for the wider industry. David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas and the founder of tech marketing group You and Mr Jones, predicted WPP would eventually end up missing Sorrell more than he would WPP.""No one else can keep that company together the way he has been able to because he built it,"" he told Reuters. ""It's the fall of an emperor and one that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.""Sorrell, 73, did not have a non-compete clause and could set up a new advertising business. He owns 1.4 percent of WPP, according to Thomson Reuters data.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

72,"Apr 09, 2018 11:21AM ET",WPP CEO Sorrell could learn his fate next week,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - WPP founder Martin Sorrell could find out as early as next week whether he can remain at the helm of the world's biggest advertising company but is likely to struggle to work with its board even if he is cleared of wrongdoing, sources said.WPP (L:WPP) sent shockwaves through the industry last week when it said it was investigating alleged misconduct by Sorrell, raising the prospect that the 73-year-old could step down after more than 30 years in charge. Sorrell denies the allegations.A source close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity said the result of the investigation by independent counsel was likely to come next week.However a second source who is familiar with Sorrell's thinking questioned whether it would be business as usual if the CEO was exonerated because he is unhappy about how the situation has been handled.""When there is a family bust up life is never the same again,"" the second source said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. ""Kissing and making up would seem to be a very challenging concept after this."" WPP declined to comment. The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into the world's biggest advertising group by three decades of relentless dealmaking and is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in Britain.In his time the group has expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers and market-research and public relations groups such as Finsbury.Present in 112 countries and employing more than 200,000 people, WPP provides services to clients including Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), P&G and a string of major corporations. BREAKING UP THE BUSINESS?It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) in the years that followed the financial crisis but it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in consumer spending from some of its biggest clients.Its shares are down around 30 percent this year, with the growing migration of advertising online also adding to the challenges facing the industry. ""It won't be this week, it could be as soon as next,"" the first person said on the timing of the investigation. The uncertainty about Sorrell's future has renewed speculation as to who would take over the top job if he left and whether the group would remain in its current form.Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its data management arm which provides market research to clients. Analysts at Liberum have valued the asset at around 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion), compared with WPP's current market valuation of 14.6 billion pounds. In the past the WPP management has said that although the data management arm has recorded lower growth rates, it is attractive to clients who want to see the impact of their media spending, making it aligned with the rest of the group.

73,"Apr 04, 2018 07:29AM ET","WPP investigates CEO Sorrell for alleged misconduct, which he denies",nan,"By Paul SandleLONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) is investigating an allegation of misconduct against Martin Sorrell, who has built the world's biggest advertising empire over more than three decades of relentless expansion.Sorrell, who denies any wrongdoing, transformed WPP from a wire shopping basket maker through acquisitions of top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers and market-research and public-relations groups.He said on Wednesday the allegation concerned financial impropriety, specifically the use of company funds. ""I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognize that the company has to investigate it,"" the 73-year-old, one of Britain's best-known and highest-paid chief executives, said.Shares in WPP, which said the allegation did not involve sums which were material to the company, fell to more than four-year lows and were down 2.1 percent at 1,094 pence at 1058 GMT.The investigation will raise fresh questions about leadership succession at WPP, given Sorrell's dominance.Chairman Roberto Quarta has previously said the board routinely discusses potential candidates should Sorrell leave, but no possible timeline has been publicly discussed.Sorrell said his commitment to the group, in which he holds a 1.39 percent stake according to Reuters data, remained ""absolute"".""As a significant share owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over thirty years ago, remains absolute - to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,"" he said. INDUSTRY SHIFTWPP shares have fallen by 36 percent in the last year after consumer goods clients such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) cut ad spending, while digital companies Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) have encroached on its turf by forming direct relationships with brands.The world's four top advertising groups are rethinking their models after growing through serial acquisitions of agencies which are often run as separate entities and designed to compete with each other to provide the best service.But with technology changing advertising and consumer goods groups demanding cost savings, clients are increasingly wanting to work with one team who can provide a common proposal for media planning, creative ideas, data and analysis.Meanwhile consultants like Accenture (N:ACN) are offering more marketing services, raising questions about the future role of the major ad groups.Sorrell said a law firm was conducting the investigation, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, and he understood the process would be completed shortly.""I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way,"" he added.Sorrell has been richly rewarded, receiving payouts of 70 million pounds ($98 million) in 2015 - then the highest ever for a British executive - and 48 million pounds in 2016.Some investors baulked at his rewards, with a third voting against the 2015 payout, but Sorrell's record was at the time enough to keep shareholders on side.Sorrell said last month 2017 was ""not a pretty year"" for WPP, adding that he would accelerate a plan to simplify the group, which employs more than 200,000 people in 112 countries.WPP's forecast for this year was more pessimistic than peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Political turmoil and conflict have worsened, further shaking advertisers' confidence in the region, Zenith said.The forecaster estimates a 6.2 percent fall in ad spend this year in the region.Zenith forecast 8.8 percent annual growth to 2020 in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which were hurt by the Ukraine conflict in 2014, foreign sanctions on Russia and the drop in oil prices.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The world's third largest advertising group said it was redoubling efforts to become a consulting partner for global advertisers online to help boost sluggish growth.The plan envisages a 4 percent underlying sales growth target in 2020 by tapping its digital arm Publicis.Sapient and fostering greater collaboration between its myriad of agencies. Liberum analyst Ian Whittake affirmed his ""Hold"" rating on the stock, calling the plan ambitious.""On a general level, Publicis has taken probably the most 'bearish' view on the future of agencies, which probably reflects its acquisition of IT consultancy firm Sapient, and the wording of the statement reflects that,"" he said.By 0932 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.1 percent, while the UK's FTSE (FTSE) was up 0.1 percent after hitting a 15-month low in the previous session.Advertisers and media stocks are among the worst performers in Europe over the last 12 months, as they struggle to compete against big U.S. internet players like Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), which now face growing regulatory scrutiny.

84,"Mar 01, 2018 08:21AM ET",WPP punished for slow response to advertising upheaval,nan,"By Kate HoltonLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's WPP (L:WPP) struggled to keep pace with changes in advertising in 2017, with its worst annual sales performance since the financial crisis and a gloomy outlook putting its shares on track for their worst day in 20 years. The world's biggest advertising group has been hit by consumer goods clients such as  Unilever  cutting spending and by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and consultants Accenture encroaching on its turf, forcing it to cut its outlook three times in 2017.""2017 for us was not a pretty year,"" WPP's founder Martin Sorrell said, adding it would accelerate a plan to simplify the group which employs more than 200,000 people in 112 countries through agencies including JWT, Ogilvy & Mather and Finsbury.Shares in WPP dropped by 14 percent, putting it on track for its worst day since 1998 and wiping 2.3 billion pounds off its market value. Investors had expected it to echo peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP) in sounding more upbeat about 2018. The world's leading advertising giants are rethinking their models after growing through repeated acquisitions of agencies which are often run as separate entities and designed to compete with each other to provide the best service. But with technology changing advertising and consumer goods groups demanding cost savings, clients are increasingly wanting to work with one team who can provide a common proposal for media planning, creative ideas, data and analysis. ""Clients want things to be much more agile, simplified, better and cheaper and that is what we have to respond to,"" Sorrell told Reuters. ""We have been going in that direction but we have to go faster."" A strategy it currently uses for its biggest clients such as Ford and Colgate-Palmolive, where it creates a single team to provide all the services required by that company rather than through multiple agencies, could be rolled out more widely.Publicis has set up ""Chief client officers"" but all the holding companies struggle with the fact their staff are traditionally loyal to the agencies such as Ogilvy & Mather, seen as the inspiration for the Man Men TV series. ""We start this new phase of our journey from a position of market leadership, and with total confidence in the enduring value of what we offer our clients,"" Sorrell said. CHANGING TIMES?WPP reported a 0.9 percent drop in 2017 underlying net sales, after predicting a broadly flat outcome in October, with demand particularly weak in North America where net sales fell 3.2 percent. Britain was one of the strongest performers. For 2018 it said the group's budgets were being set on the basis it would see flat growth for revenue and net sales, with the headline operating margin also flat in constant currency.That looks particularly cautious when 2018 offers the soccer World Cup, the Winter Olympics, mid-term U.S. elections and a generally more buoyant global economy, factors that would normally boost its sales. However net sales were down 1.2 percent in January, showing little sign of improvement.Looking ahead to its longer-term target, WPP also cut a forecast for annual diluted earnings per share growth to 5 to 10 percent, from a previous forecast of 10 to 15 percent. WPP, which Sorrell built from a two-man operation in a London office in 1985 to one with annual billings of 56 billion pounds ($77 billion), has been particularly hurt by the pressures in the packaged goods sector. Clients such as Unilever (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter and Gamble (N:PG) are cutting spending as consumers turn to more niche brands, hitting sales. Unilever is also bringing certain capabilities in-house, such as creating its own content through a new unit. Other clients have also started to make their own content and place it directly on Facebook and Google.Richard Hunter, head of Markets at Interactive Investor, said cost conscious companies were taking a shorter-term view while there were red flags around the North American region. ""The jury is still out as to whether WPP has suffered due to a cyclical change, or whether the landscape is actually structurally different,"" he said. ""The general view of the shares as a buy has been in place for some time, although this will come under increasing pressure in the absence of some rather more positive prospects.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

94,"Jan 26, 2018 07:10AM ET",BAML expects muted growth at ad agencies,nan,"(Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) has struck a bearish tone on global ad agencies, seeing three years of muted growth at companies such as WPP (L:WPP), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and Omnicom (N:OMC). Ad agencies have resorted to M&A and partnerships to try to fend off a growing threat from business consultancies and tech companies. In 2015, Publicis acquired U.S. digital ad firm Sapient to accelerate growth in Internet advertising. Its division Publicis.Sapient recently won a deal with  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) to assist the retailer on e-commerce challenges. Competition among the big four of WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic (N:IPG) has become fierce as clients review the effectiveness of their marketing budgets.""Marketing spending are secularly shifting from storytelling and creativity towards technology, customer experience, data-driven and business transformation,"" BAML analysts wrote in a note to clients. They reinstated coverage of the world's top ad companies with an ""underperform"" rating after what they said was an ""extensive discussion"" with experts across the advertising value chain. Shares in ad companies have taken a hit in the last year and have underperformed the overall market, which has been setting fresh records. WPP has lost about one-third of its value since the start of 2017.WPP, the industry leader, has taken the biggest hit, with leading clients such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG) cutting spending as consumers turn to more niche brands.In its most recent earnings conference call, P&G said it aimed to save another $400 million in agency and production costs, on top of the $750 million it had already saved. P&G did not give any time frame for the cost savings goal.""We view this as a trend, not a one-off,"" BAML added, saying it expected the agencies' organic growth to flatten out by 2020.The analysts believe consulting companies, such as Accenture (N:ACN), Deloitte or  IBM  (N:IBM) will start to have a ""bigger impact from 2018 onwards, leading ad agencies to lose market share to the consultancies."" ""The lucrative media planning/buying space will start being disrupted by consultancies, helped by the rise of AI and their edge in data analytics.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) accelerated losses to 0.6 percent after Catalonia failed to meet a deadline set by Madrid to renounce its independence bid, setting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on course to impose direct rule on the region.Madrid's IBEX (IBEX) was down 1 percent, lagging other markets.London's FTSE (FTSE), Paris's CAC 40 (FCHI), Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) and Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) were down 0.6 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.Bank stocks (SX7P) fell back 0.7 percent as Spanish lenders came under pressure, while Spanish government bond yields rose. ""The market is going in risk-off mode"", said Pierre Martin, a senior sales trader at Saxo Bank a few minutes after the latest developments in the Spanish crisis hit the headlines. Earlier, markets had retreated only slightly, after underwhelming third quarter trading updates. Shares in advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) fell more than 6 percent after third-quarter sales were below market forecasts, while German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion (DE:KGX) was down 9.2 percent after it cut its 2017 guidance.  Unilever  (L:ULVR) fell 4.5 percent as its underlying sales growth missed analysts' consensus.Martin argued that while the initial reaction from investors seemed to be negative, it was still too early to get a clear picture of Europe's third quarter earnings season. French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) were up 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent respectively after their results.But Martin said the situation in Catalonia was likely to set the tone for the day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In June, it forecast growth of 4.2 percent in 2017.Zenith said a slowdown in Britain, usually an outperformer in advertising spending in Western and Central Europe, would weigh. Regional spending growth would be 2 percent in 2017 and average 2.6 percent a year to 2019. It was 3.9 percent in 2016.In June, Zenith forecast a 0.9 percent growth in British advertising spending in 2017, down from 9.6 percent in 2016.Results from some advertisers have shown an upbeat picture in North America. Publicis reported a second quarter rise in underlying sales helped by North American revenues. Omnicom (N:OMC), the No. 1 U.S. advertising firm, reported better-than-expected quarterly results in July.However, WPP (L:WPP), the world's largest advertising group, and Interpublic (N:IPG) both reported weaker figures."

WPP (L:WPP) shares lost as much as 10 percent value after the world's largest advertising group cut its full-year sales outlook after a drop in demand caused it to miss first-half targets.The agency has been among the worst-performing stocks in the media sector, which has declined 4.8 percent overall this year against a buoyant broader European market. ""Deteriorating trading conditions are a concern and ...we are minded to trim our full year profit before tax forecasts by 4 to 5 percent,"" said Roddy Davidson, media analyst at Shore Capital.The sector index (SXMP) fell 2 percent, with WPP's French peer Publicis (PA:PUBP) down 3 percent.

136,"Mar 20, 2017 11:54AM ET",Google apologizes to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco,nan,"By Esha Vaish and Kate Holton(Reuters) - Google apologized on Monday for allowing ads to appear alongside offensive videos on YouTube as more high-profile firms such as Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) and HSBC (L:HSBA) pulled advertising for British markets from Google sites.The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit.Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue.""I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content,"" Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London.Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google.The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant.For big advertising groups such as WPP (L:WPP), internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars.HOSTILE INDUSTRY""Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings,"" said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group.""Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,"" he said.WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished.""We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,"" said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis (PA:PUBP), the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google.Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right.Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster.A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising.On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue.Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS (L:RBS), McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group  Havas  (PA:HAVA) and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads.A source at Lloyds Banking (L:LLOY) said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as  Vodafone  (L:VOD),  Barclays  (L:BARC) and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) were reviewing policies, their representatives said.(This version of the story has been refiled to remove extraneous apostrophe in first paragraph)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Run by the high-profile British businessman Martin Sorrell, WPP said that both the group and its subsidiaries were fully cooperating with the enquiries. The DoJ's antitrust division has been investigating whether advertising agencies rigged bids to favor their in-house production units in competition with independent companies. Rival groups Interpublic Group of Cos (N:IPG), Omnicom Group (N:OMC) and Publicis Group SA (PA:PUBP) had already announced that they had been subpoenaed as part of the investigation.Shares in WPP were down 0.4 percent at 1,774 pence by 1608 GMT, when the Stoxx 600 Europe Media sector index <0#.SXMP> was up 0.16 percent. Large advertising companies have expanded their own production operations in recent years as a way to grow new revenue streams and keep up with advertisers’ increasing demand for video content.WPP declined to comment further.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

153,"Oct 28, 2016 01:30PM ET",Seventy-five percent of internet use in 2017 will be mobile: report,nan,"By Malathi NayakNEW YORK (Reuters) - Seventy-five percent of internet use will be mobile in 2017, up slightly from this year, as a growing number of consumers around the world access the web on smartphones and tablets, media buying agency Zenith forecast this week.Zenith previously estimated that 71 percent of internet consumption would be mobile in 2016. Sixty percent of global internet advertising dollars will come from mobile advertising in 2018, Zenith said, following the release of its ""Mobile Advertising Forecasts"" report on Thursday.Mobile advertising expenditure in 2018 will total $134 billion, which ""is more than will be spent on newspaper, magazine, cinema and outdoor advertising put together,"" it said. Zenith, a unit of French ad agency  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP), had estimated global mobile advertising expenditure in 2016 to be $71 billion.As more ad dollars shift to the digital realm from television, brands are rushing to  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Snapchat and Google (O:GOOGL) where they can market to viewers.""In four years, you've gone from 40 percent to 70 percent (of total internet use) in mobile,"" said Scott Singer, a digital media executive and managing director of innovation consultancy firm DDG Inc. This trend is driving a shift in ad dollars to mobile and stoking deals in the media, entertainment and communications businesses, he added. The rise of mobile data consumption, including video, is pushing telecommunications companies to marry content and digital distribution. They are betting that they can lure viewers to online video and other content that are relayed over their internet and wireless networks, while also attracting advertisers to grow ad revenue.AT&T Inc (N:T) on Saturday said it plans to buy media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) for $85.4 billion to diversify into content distribution.  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) has proposed to buy internet company  Yahoo Inc  (O:YHOO).Both want to leverage user data to help marketers deliver targeted ads.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

187,"Jun 26, 2015 02:54PM ET","Ad executives cautious about growth, gear up for contract battle",nan,"By Leila AbboudCANNES (Reuters) - (This version of the story corrects figures on Publicis contract wins, paragraph 13)The reluctance of big companies to spend at a time of lacklustre global growth and fewer major sporting events this year are dampening demand for advertising, said the chief executives of two leading ad agencies. In separate interviews on Friday, Martin Sorrell of WPP (L:WPP) and Maurice Levy of Publicis (PA:PUBP) sounded cautious about the prospects for the advertising market, citing a lack of vibrancy in the U.S economy, weakness in Brazil, Russia and China, and Europe's continued fragility.""There is a lot of uncertainty,"" Levy told Reuters. ""Companies have cash to spend but are not in the mood to do so, and consumers are not feeling confident either.""Research firm Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, recently cut its growth forecast for the global advertising market to 4.2 percent down from 4.9 percent earlier this year. For his part, Sorrell said that the major companies served by WPP agencies such as Ogilvy and Mather and Group M were very focused on cost controls, sometimes to the detriment of long-term investment in their brands and products. ""Business is tough. Clients are very demanding in an environment where top-line growth is lower than it was before the financial crisis began,"" he said.UP FOR GRABSAgainst that backdrop, the world's top six ad agencies face upheaval because an unprecedented $27 billion in media buying and planning contracts are up for review in the coming months at companies including Coca-Cola (N:KO), Procter and Gamble (N:PG) and L'Oreal (PA:OREP).That is requiring them to defend some major contracts, while trying to steal others from rivals. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated that Publicis was the most exposed, with 1.7 percent of sales at risk and 2.5 percent of earnings per share. It is defending seven contracts including P&G,  General Mills  (N:GIS), Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and Coca-Cola.For WPP, about 1.1 percent of revenue and 1.6 percent of earnings per share are risk as it seeks to keep nine contracts including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR).Both Sorrell and Levy claimed the reviews were an opportunity to win business, while acknowledging that the fees would be lower on the new deals than the old ones.""The reviews are worrying for the agencies but their effects will also be felt on media owners because the price of ads will fall further,"" Levy predicted, referring to TV broadcasters, print outlets, and radio.Levy said Publicis had already won one contract with beauty products maker Coty (L:ULVR) with billings of $100 million and another with coffee specialist Keurig worth $150 million.""If we lose all our current contracts and win none of the new ones we're going for then our sales could drop 2 percent,"" said Levy. ""But if we defend everything and win all the new ones, then they could go up as much as 3 percent.""Sorrell said that WPP's plan was to stress its technology and data expertise in pitches to clients. WPP has made a big bet on data with its Kantar unit, which Sorrell argues offers a competitive advantage although a lower margin business. ""We are differentiated from our competitors and that will help in the reviews,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

195,"Mar 23, 2015 07:21AM ET",Online ad revenue at risk in war on 'click fraud' ,nan,"By Jennifer Saba and Jim FinkleNEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - A growing number of U.S. companies, including MillerCoors and AIG, are stepping up the battle against online ad fraud by demanding proof that their ads have been seen by real people instead of computers hijacked by cybercriminals.Spurred by a warning in December by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) that businesses are losing $6.3 billion a year to so-called ""click fraud,"" these companies now stipulate in advertising contracts that they will only pay for online ads when given proof that humans clicked on them. ""We don't want to be paying for non-human traffic,"" said Mark Clowes, global head of advertising at American International Group Inc (N:AIG), the largest commercial insurer in the country. In a typical click fraud scheme, a crook infects many computers with malicious software, and directs the machines - called bots - to visit a webpage, click on an ad or watch a video. The fake traffic fools a marketer into thinking the site is popular, so it pays to place ads and links on the site.A study conducted by cybersecurity firm White Ops for the ANA found that bots viewed almost one-fourth of online video ads and 11 percent of display ads. The study, published in December, involved 36 participants including AIG and MillerCoors (L:SAB) (N:TAP).    While click fraud has been going on for years, the ANA report has galvanized advertisers to fight back, ad executives said. What had been a trickle of references in contracts is becoming a flood. ""We've written into all of our contracts that our clients insist on at least 95 percent human traffic and anything less requires a make good or credit,"" said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, an ad buying agency whose clients include Victoria's Secret Pink.""By the end of 2015 we expect that every major agency and every major advertiser will include these kinds of clauses in their terms and conditions.""WEB PUBLISHERS AT RISKU.S. digital advertising revenue is expected to reach $59 billion this year, according to eMarketer.Online ads are sold through a complex, opaque system that can involve many parties including advertising agencies, website publishers and automated ad exchanges - the middlemen who aggregate and resell ad space across many websites.Website publishers often pay third parties to direct visitors to their sites, a practice known as ""source traffic."" According to the 57-page ANA study, about half of all click fraud came from publishers paying for third-party traffic providers. (http://bit.ly/1Gj8wfI)As advertisers crack down on click fraud, website publishers could suffer in the short term, said ANA Executive Vice President Bill Duggan. Smaller publishers, in particular, would likely find it difficult to quickly respond to pressure from advertisers to eliminate bots. On average it costs up to 3 percent of a digital campaign to sweep the traffic.An industry attorney said some publishers are not happy with the new contracts, which shift fraud costs to them from advertisers.""You cannot inject a new risk module without having somebody squirm,"" said Joseph Rosenbaum, a partner at Reed Smith LLP. ""Nobody likes to have additional liability."" Scott Cunningham, senior vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which represents some 600 website publishers, disagreed. He said the responsibility falls ""squarely"" on publishers.""Your inventory is competing with criminal inventory. You absolutely have every obligation,"" Cunningham said. Representatives for major website publishers  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Yahoo Inc  (O:YHOO) and  AOL Inc  (N:AOL) said they have been aggressively working to combat click fraud for several years. AOL and Facebook said the new advertising contracts had not hurt revenue. Microsoft, Yahoo and Google declined to comment.FIGHTING FRAUDFirms that audit traffic include White Ops, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat Inc. OpenX, an advertising exchange that uses algorithms to buy and sell ads, said it took a 15 percent hit to revenue growth in 2013 after investing heavily to clean up its traffic. Growth was back on track by 2014 and OpenX spends more than $1 million each year to ensure traffic quality, it said. Concerns about click fraud have prompted some advertisers and website publishers to form an alliance in December. ""This is the No. 1 industry priority right now,"" said Mike Zaneis, interim head of the alliance, known as the Trustworthy Accountability Group. Board members include executives from Facebook, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG),  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) and WPP Plc (L:WPP).""It's gaining momentum,"" Zaneis said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chairman and chief executive Levy on Thursday faces investors worried that clients are deserting the French group and disappointed by a performance that lags the sector. (http://bit.ly/1yeEhpJ) The $35 billion Omnicom-Publicis pairing would have overtaken WPP (L:WPP) as the world's biggest advertising company. It fell apart over leadership conflicts and delays to tax and antitrust approvals. Investors want to see the rebound Levy has promised. ""The only credible response will be a return to organic growth in 2015. That will need to be visible in the figures. The most important thing is to stem client losses, at Razorfish in particular,"" said Conor O'Shea of analyst Kepler Cheuvreux. Razorfish is Publicis' digital advertising arm making ads targeted at the Internet, which is the industry's growth area. But online giants like Google are moving to cut agencies out and capture ad spending directly, hitting players like Razorfish, which has lost business from clients including Motorola and Blackberry. Levy has blamed his company's problems in part on an over-enthusiastic focus on the merger, but Publicis' organic growth was just 1 percent in the third quarter of 2014, while ex-merger partner Omnicom managed 6.5 percent. At the investor day on Thursday, investors expect an update on profitability targets set out in September and also on the company's performance in emerging markets. They also want clarity on a cash handout they have been hoping for now that funds have been spent on U.S. digital specialist Sapient (O:SAPE), which Levy bought last month for $3.7 billion in a bid to kickstart a recovery. The deal has received a mixed response. ""We would have preferred Publicis resolve its operational difficulties first,"" said Exane BNP Paribas in a research note. For 72 year-old Levy, who has been at the helm for 30 years, the thorny subject of his succession was something the Omnicom deal was supposed to solve. Arthur Sadoun, head of one of its main divisions Publicis Worldwide, is seen as the current favorite, but Levy - who is due to go in 2017 - has a reputation for outmanoeuvring rivals.

Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged.Also on Friday, industry data showed that the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose to a three-and-a-half year high of 66.2 in October from 60.5 in September, confounding expectations for a reading of 60.0.Still, lower oil prices pressured down energy and energy-related stocks.Despite the otherwise bullish effects upbeat U.S. data would have on oil due to prospects for rising demand for fuel and energy, a stronger dollar continues to punish the commodity as the economy improves.A stronger greenback makes oil a less attractive commodity on dollar-denominated exchanges, especially in the eyes of investors holding other currencies.OPEC countries are due to meet later this month, though expectations remain firm the cartel won't trim output to boost prices, with the logic being that allowing oil to fall further will prompt U.S. hydraulic fracking operations to hold off on production and stem the flow of oil into the global market.In corporate news, French advertising company, Publicis Groupe SA (PARIS:PUBP) said it would pay $3.7 billion to buy Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ:SAPE), while medical testing giant Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH) announced plans to buy medical research supplier Covance Inc (NYSE:CVD) for $6.1 billion.Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), up 1.68%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.03%, and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), up 0.99%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst performers included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), down 2.68%, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), down 1.54%, and Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), down 1.48%.European indices, meanwhile, ended the day lower.After the close of European trade, the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.99%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.92%, while Germany's DAX fell 0.81%.

200,"Nov 03, 2014 01:07PM ET",Publicis to buy U.S. digital ad firm Sapient for $3.7 billion,nan,"By Leila Abboud PARIS (Reuters) - Publicis (PA:PUBP), the world's third-largest advertising agency, is to buy U.S.-based digital ad specialist Sapient (O:SAPE) for $3.7 billion in cash as it seeks to accelerate growth after a botched merger earlier this year.The French group is hoping rapid growth in both North American and Internet advertising, which are far outpacing European and traditional ad formats, will help it catch up with sales gains at rivals such as WPP (L:WPP) and Interpublic (N:IPG).Chief Executive Maurice Levy has blamed Publicis' recent poor performance on a failed merger with world No.2 ad agency Omnicom (N:OMC), announced in August 2013 and abandoned in May over control and cultural clashes.But some analysts said Publicis' offer of $25 per share, a 44 percent premium to Sapient's closing price on Friday, was a hefty price for a company whose growth may have peaked.The transaction, which followed an unusual rally in Sapient shares and options last week, could also dash hopes among the French company's shareholders that cash might be distributed to them, analysts said.Publicis shares fell 2.3 percent, while Sapient was up 42 percent at $24.59 in early afternoon trading.""A good asset at a steep price,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Charles Bedouelle of the deal, adding it would ""likely push back (Publicis') cash return story by two years.""UBS analyst Tamsin Garrity said Publicis had been under pressure from investors to return cash, and was expected to announced share buybacks at a strategy day on Friday.""The acquisition of Sapient makes such returns unlikely,"" she added. Garrity has a neutral rating on Publicis shares.Levy defended the decision, saying the company would generate more value in the long term by buying Sapient rather than buying back its own shares. He pledged to update investors on his approach to dividends and buybacks sometime in November.""This operation is extremely important for securing the future of Publicis,"" Levy said. ""It is far better to invest and deliver a higher growth and higher profits ... which will lead to a re-rating, rather than simply buy back our own shares.""""The deal will create a foundation for accelerated growth"" by giving Publicis access to new markets and revenues, he added.Publicis said the deal would be financed through existing cash and new debt, and would not affect Publicis' credit rating. It did not say when it would add to group profits but forecast 50 million euros ($63 million) in annual cost savings.""A JILTED LOVER""?Sapient's sales grew 14.1 percent to 1.1 billion euros last year, far outstripping Publicis' sales growth of 1.2 percent, though the French company had a higher operating profit margin. The U.S-based group earned 63 percent of its 2013 sales in North America and has 13,000 employees, 8,500 of which are in India.""The risk that growth slows at Sapient is one of the transaction's more important considerations,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.He noted the deal gave Sapient an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of around 12 times its forecast earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2015, far above Publicis' current multiple of about 8 times.Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of Publicis' rival WPP, was even harsher, telling financial blog Business Insider that Publicis had rushed into the Sapient deal to compensate for its botched marriage with Omnicom.""It looks like the behavior of a jilted lover,"" said Sorrell, who often trades barbs with his cross-channel rival.Levy responded on a later conference call that he did not think Sorrell ""knew anything about love.""""When it comes to love he should give that to the French,"" he said.Buying Sapient will speed Publicis' roughly seven year-old effort to earn more revenue from digital advertising, which includes everything from online marketing to brand building on social networks and automatic ad buying for major customers.Last year, 38.4 percent of Publicis' sales came from digital, and it had been aiming to reach 50 percent by 2018, something that the Sapient deal will make happen immediately.According to Zenith Optimedia, the digital ad market is expected to grow 17.1 percent this year, driving total ad market growth of 5.3 percent.Sapient's main SapientNitro unit is a digital agency on a par with Publicis' Razorfish and WPP's AKQA with customers including carmaker Fiat, retailer Marks & Spencer and consumer goods group Unilever.'SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY'?Sapient shares rose 20 percent last week ahead of the deal announcement, compared to a 3.3 percent rise in the Nasdaq, prompting some market observers to question whether information had leaked. Trading in options in Sapient was also especially heavy.""It looks like that there was some suspicious activity in Sapient,"" said optionMonster.com lead analyst David Russell. ""Someone is definitely making a lot of money on this and they were buying the calls right before the merger was announced.""Sapient boss Alan Herrick will continue to run the company and join Publicis' management team, while Jerry Greenberg, the co-chairman of Sapient's board, will join Publicis' board.The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Citigroup (N:C) has committed to financing the bid.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Rothschild advised Publicis, while Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Sapient.(1 US dollar = 0.8000 euro)(Additional reporting by Saqib Ahmed and Jennifer Saba; Editing by David Clarke, Mark Potter and Cynthia Osterman)"

The three sources, one of whom said that ""big egos"" were involved, requested anonymity because they're not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, the news agency added.According to the Journal, the deal, which was described as a ""merger of equals,"" had been challenged by battles over position and power, including difficulties in getting tax and other regulatory approvals, people familiar with the matter said.The merger, announced with plenty of fanfare, was made to bring each firm extra strength in competing with the likes of juggernauts such as Google Inc. and Facebook, which dominate digital advertising, and that accounts for almost a quarter of global marketing spending, Reuters said.The deal would have led to the world's biggest ad holding company by revenue as it combined ad agencies such as BBDO, DDB, Saatchi & Saatchi, TBWA and Leo Burnett, public-relations firms like FleishmanHillard and Ketchum and digital ad agencies including DigitasLBi and Razorfish, the Journal said.The merger called for a 50-50 ownership split of the equity in the new company, Publicis Omnicom Group, with Wren and Levy operating as co-CEOs for 30 months from the closing, according to Reuters.The crucial choice of chief financial officer had been a particular sticking point, Reuters noted. According to a person familiar with the situation, differences over the position were so stark that last November, Omnicom executives told an analyst in the U.S. that its CFO, Randy Weisenburger, would get the job, but Publicis executives told another analyst that its CFO, Jean-Michel Etienne, would get it the position, the Journal reported.""We both have strong personalities and we both have strong corporate cultures but there was no one factor,"" Wren said.    "
