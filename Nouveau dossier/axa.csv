3,"Apr 17, 2019 03:32AM ET",StockBeat - Why Axa Isn't on the Hook (Too Much) for Notre Dame,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Nothing makes a financial journalist feel worse about his or her career choices than a disaster.The shock of the event is routinely followed by the grim realization that our place in the scheme of things is to talk about the impact on insurance stocks.The catastrophic fire that ravaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is a case in point. The staggering scale of loss is immediately evident, so it would be natural to suspect that AXA (PA:AXAF), France's biggest insurer, may be seriously on the hook for the reconstruction.So you'd be surprised to hear that its stock hit a 13-month high on Tuesday, especially after it confirmed that it was the insurer to two contractors on restoration works whose activity may have been linked to the fire. It's up another 0.4% at the time of writing on Wednesday.That isn't just down to the fact that France's business elite has already promised 700 million euros to cover reconstruction costs, a figure that will probably be augmented by public donations.This key part of a statement released by  Axa  late on Tuesday explains why it's shielded from the worst:“The Notre Dame cathedral is classified as a historical monument since 1862, and like all properties belonging to the state, it is self-insured by the state (therefore AXA is not the insurer for the monument itself).""But the insurance giant isn't out of the woods yet, as the rest of the statement shows:""Among the many companies working on the on-going construction projects of the cathedral, AXA France provides civil-liability coverage to two companies: Europe Echafaudage and Le Bras Frères.""Additionally, AXA Art is involved in the insurance of certain artefacts and ceremonial objects in the Notre-Dame.The cause of the fire is still unknown and being investigated. AXA said all its teams are ""fully cooperating"" with the authorities.AXA's shares are still over 10% below where they started 2018, having spent most of last year trying to convince investors of the merits of its $15.3 billion acquisition of XL, a deal that made it the world's biggest property and casualty insurer.However, they have risen 26% since the start of the year, according to data compiled by Investing.com, and still offer what by local standards is an attractive yield of 5.69%.Elsewhere, it's another strong morning for Europe's bourses, with major indexes rising between 0.1% and 0.4% in response to stronger-than-expected Chinese growth data for the first quarter. The U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.2%, however, as is the Euro STOXX 600."
4,"Jan 16, 2019 05:05AM ET","Brexit deal defeat boosts European banks, hurts FTSE 100 as endgame still unclear",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - British shares lagged Europe on Wednesday after Prime Minister Theresa May's resounding defeat in a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, but in the face of unrelenting political uncertainty investors shifted their focus to results and M&A news.A defeat had largely been priced in already, though the magnitude of the loss - a margin of 230 - came as a surprise.Analysts and investors interpreted the outcome as a positive for the market, making a ""softer, later"" Brexit more likely, but uncertainty ahead of a no confidence vote in May's government on Wednesday evening kept trading muted.""There's still quite a lot of uncertainty...a hard exit is a lower probability risk than it was but I don't think we can completely discount it,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office for UBS Global Wealth Management.The FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.6 percent by 0930 GMT while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) held flat and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.2 percent.The top British index was dragged down by multinational exporter stocks like  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and  Diageo  (L:DGE), which make the lion's share of their earnings in foreign currencies and are bruised by sterling rising.Bank shares (SX7P) were the biggest boost to European indexes, up 0.9 percent as investors bet that a disruptive no-deal Brexit was less likely after the parliamentary vote. BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), AXA (PA:AXAF) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) were the top three boosts to Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX), but the gains remained unconvincing with the endgame to Brexit still clear as mud.""Unfortunately, everything remains possible: new elections, an extension of the deadline for Article 50, or even a second referendum,"" said Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at DWS.Italian banks rallied, led by Unicredit (MI:CRDI), having slumped in the previous session on fears the European Central Bank may require full coverage of non-performing loans by 2026.They helped Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) rise 0.5 percent, outperforming peers, after Unicredit said it considers its non-performing exposure (NPE) coverage ""fully adequate"".The Brexit vote defeat drove UK domestic stocks up as investors grew more optimistic about the prospects for sectors seen as highly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit.UK housebuilders  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW),  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV), and Berkeley Group (L:BKGH) were among the top European gainers, up 2.1 to 3 percent.""If you look at domestic UK stocks, some of their valuations have been pushed back to blood-on-the-street type valuations,"" said Dominic Wallington, head of European equity at RBC Global Asset Management.""There's real insurance in some of these valuations, that I think is remarkable.""Overall Britain's FTSE 100 is trading at a much lower valuation than peers.Elsewhere in Europe results and dealmaking news drove moves with stocks shrugging off the night's political developments.Danish freight company DSV (CO:DSV) climbed 4 percent after it made a bid for Swiss logistics company Panalpina (S:PWTN) valuing the company at $4.1 billion.Panalpina shares soared 27.7 percent after the bid which, at 170 Swiss francs per share, represents a 24 percent premium to the stock's closing price on Tuesday.""We can see the strategic logic for DSV, as the deal would give them a large opportunity to scale their process and IT capabilities. But a deal of this magnitude will not be without risk,"" wrote Bernstein transport analyst Daniel Roeska. Pearson  (L:PSON) shares tumbled 5.3 percent, the biggest European fallers, after the British education publisher said it expects one-off restructuring costs to rise to around 330 million pounds, ahead of its original 300 million pound plan.Norwegian aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) rose 4.9 percent after it said Brazil's northern state of Para lifted a production embargo on its Alunorte alumina refinery.(For a graphic on valuations, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2AQVGMG)"

Employees can either return the money or take it as an advance on their January paychecks.AXA did not immediately say how much money was incorrectly paid out, but based on the average Swiss salary of around 85,000 Swiss francs per year, the error could have amounted to more than 30 million Swiss francs ($30 million) in overpayments.""There are worse things,"" an AXA spokesman told Tages-Anzeiger.

10,"Nov 28, 2018 05:20AM ET",Insurer AXA raises profit targets in wake of $15 billion XL deal,nan,"By Inti Landauro and Matthieu ProtardPARIS (Reuters) - AXA (PA:AXAF), Europe's second-biggest insurer, expects its profitability to improve in the next two years thanks to U.S. business brought in by its new XL arm, and said it would now focus on expanding in Asia. The French insurer said profits should be boosted by its $15 billion acquisition of Bermuda-based XL earlier this year, which helped to broaden AXA's range of business. AXA also lifted its expected synergies from the XL acquisition to 500 million euros ($564 million) from 400 million, and raised its dividend payout range to between 50-60 percent from 45-55 percent.Following the XL deal and the stock market listing of its U.S. operations, AXA is now looking to develop more in Asia in areas such as China, health insurance and its branch network.The company has already hired a series of leading managers in the region, such as Gordon Watson, chief executive officer for Asia.""In just nine months, Gordon has attracted some of the best leaders in Asia with significant local expertise to propel AXA to become the next insurer of choice in the region,"" AXA CEO Thomas Buberl said.Buberl said last year that he wanted the company, the number two insurer in Europe after Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), to focus on six emerging countries, with four of them in Asia.Even though Asia represents about half of the world insurance market's growth, ""AXA in Asia has underperformed over the past few years,"" Buberl said during a presentation to investors.Earlier this month, the company said it had agreed to buy the 50 percent stake it didn't own in its Chinese unit AXA Tianping for 584 million euros.AXA also raised on Wednesday its expected adjusted return on equity (ROE) to between 14-16 percent in 2019 and 2020, up from a previous target of 12-14 percent.It confirmed its target for underlying earnings per share to rise by 3-7 percent a year over the same period and expressed flexibility over possible future share buybacks.AXA shares were up 1.3 percent in early trading, as analysts welcomed AXA's latest financial targets.""In our view, AXA are reassuring the market by raising adjusted ROE target of 14-16 percent and rewarding investors with a step-change in the payout ratio from the current 45-55 percent to 50-60 percent (we had forecasted 51 percent in 2020), more than exceeding our base case for the investor day,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies, which kept a ""buy"" rating on AXA.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

12,"Nov 14, 2018 12:38PM ET",Global regulators hold off designating 'too big to fail' insurers,nan,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Global insurance regulators will put off singling out insurers deemed so important to the financial system that they are required to hold extra capital, in a victory for companies such as American International Group (N:AIG) and  Prudential  (L:PRU).The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) said it wants to replace the list of ""too big to fail"" insurers, last published in 2016, with a broader framework from 2020.In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, regulators identified nine systemically important insurers which then face onerous bank-like capital rules to cover potential losses, increasing costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.The industry has long argued it played no major role in the financial crisis and should not be treated in the same way as global banks, which must also hold extra capital.Nine insurers featured on the list published in 2016:  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), Allianz (DE:ALVG), American International Group,  Aviva  (L:AV),  Axa  (PA:AXAF), MetLife (N:MET), Ping An Insurance Group Co of China (HK:2318) (SS:601318), Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU), and Prudential in Britain.The IAIS said it was moving away from a ""binary"" approach of imposing extra measures on a small group of insurers to a ""proportionate"" application of measures targeted at the activities of insurers that lead to systemic risk.It has proposed a new framework to come into effect in 2020, after which a decision would be made in 2022 on whether to scrap the list altogether.Insurers on the list had initially been expected to meet mandatory capital requirements known as ""higher loss absorbency"" or HLA from January next year.But the IAIS said on Wednesday that HLA would not be implemented before the start of 2022, and within the new framework it would only be applied on case-by-case ""intervention"" by supervisors, meaning no automatic application.The industry has lobbied for regulators to focus on activities rather than issuing extra capital requirements simply because of a company's size.AIG had to be bailed out by taxpayers in the United States during the financial crisis, but the insurance industry has argued that AIG's problems stemmed from its involvement in complex products linked to home loans rather than mainstream insurance.Wednesday's announcement follows a decision by regulators in the United States to remove Prudential Financial from their own list of systemically important financial institutions. Met Life won a court battle to remove itself from the U.S. list.The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation in the Group of 20 economies (G20), said the new framework would provide an enhanced basis for mitigating systemic risk, if implemented properly.The FSB said it would review in November 2022 whether the list of insurers should be scrapped or, in light of initial implementation of the new framework, be re-established.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

13,"Nov 05, 2018 12:09PM ET","European banks' beauty only skin-deep, investors say",nan,"By Sinead CruiseLONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top banks may have survived a milestone test of their resilience but strengthened balance sheets count for little when they generate such meager returns compared with U.S. rivals, investors say.The European Banking Authority stress test results on Friday showed the sector in reasonable financial health, with a clean sweep of 48 lenders judged capable of withstanding economic shocks like a crash in real estate or bond prices.For the first time since 2009, the EU health check of the sector showed all top banks passed a key capital threshold under the most adverse economic scenario.However European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos on Monday said a dozen banks that came below the 9 percent threshold in the adverse scenario should strengthen their capital positions.Those banks include  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). (For interactive graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2D4c7an)Fears of fresh cash calls partly explain why investors are still running shy of the sector. The STOXX European banks index (SX7P), which has tumbled 20 percent so far this year, held flat on Monday following the results. This rejection looks set to continue as Europe's economic prospects darken, according to some fund managers and analysts. A decade on from the financial crisis and despite years of central bank stimulus, Europe's growth is slowing, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting full-year GDP growth in the euro zone of 2.1 percent this year and 1.8 percent next.That reflects an outlook depressed in part by Italy's political crisis, the slowdown in Turkey and the likely fallout from Britain's divorce from the European Union, which were all factored into the stress test scenarios.On the surface, European bank stocks look like bargains. The sector's valuation via the STOXX bank index (SX7P) is hovering just above all-time lows, long after lenders shed the toxic assets that destroyed faith in the financial system in 2007.But the fact that bank capital levels are now roughly three times higher than pre-crisis levels has failed to offset worries about where bank revenue growth is going to come from.""Profitability remains quite a problem for many banks in Europe,"" Mario Quagliariello, director of economic analysis at the EBA, told Reuters.ROUGH YEARLow base rates - 0.75 percent in Britain and negative 0.4 percent in the euro zone - are forcing lenders to cut margins and take greater risks as demand for loans slows amid stagnant growth, resulting in paltry returns for investors.""European bank stocks have had a rough year thus far - and until there is economic data that suggests robust economic growth in the eurozone, bank stocks seem unlikely to recover,"" said Mike Olivia, an advisor at WestPac Wealth Partners, which holds bank stocks.Bank bosses also have fewer freedoms to make money in investment banking post-financial crisis, investors say. This is compounded by an equally striking incapacity to curb costs. And tighter regulation has made the sector safer but less lucrative, fund managers say, making it a tougher sell to their insurance and pension fund clients, who demand bigger rewards for what they perceive to be riskier investments.EU banks' average return on equity in 2017 stood at 5.6 percent, just over half the 2007 level of 10.6 percent, according to data from the European Banking Federation and below the 9 percent recorded by U.S. peers.U.S. lenders' investment banking businesses have increased their market share at the expense of their European rivals, thanks to weaker markets and tougher regulations in Europe, and laid bare in much more impressive operating margins - a key measure of profitability - for the U.S. banks.The top U.S. banks' equities and fixed income businesses ran at margins of 31 and 42 percent in the first half of this year, according to data from Coalition, compared with 14 and 27 percent for the same businesses in Europe's biggest investment banks. For an interactive graphic, click here. https://tmsnrt.rs/2PwqxXAPOWERLESSThe biggest two buying signals for investors in banks are an uptick in interest rates, followed by growth in demand for debt. But both of these factors are in the hands of policymakers, not bank CEOs, noted Vincent Vinatier, portfolio manager at AXA IM (PA:AXAF), which holds bank shares.""Most people doubt we will ever again see the kinds of profits we saw before the crisis ... ROE (return on equity) will be just a fraction of what it was,"" Vinatier told Reuters.Long-awaited rate rises will come, but those who jumped back into European bank shares in February, when hopes of a shift in monetary policy last peaked, have been punished with a 20 percent fall in prices.When rates do move upwards, this will likely happen in small increments after extensive sign-posting by EU policymakers. And the benefit on margins for banks will likely be largely offset by the need to repay ultra-cheap loans offered by the European Central Bank in recent years, and replace them with costlier funding, analysts at Berenberg said.Higher debt costs could also prove fatal to a glut of so-called 'zombie firms' - companies struggling to cover borrowing costs on current profit levels. Forbearance - the act of turning a blind eye to a faltering loan - and 'zombie companies' are most apparent on Italian and Spanish bank balance sheets.COSTSWith revenue growth so hard to capture, a tighter rein on costs is seen critical in the battle to win back investors.""There is still much more cost cutting to be done i.e. further branch closures and retrenchment of people,"" said Marc Halperin, manager of the Federated International Leaders Fund, which counts ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), AIB Group (I:AIBG),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), BNP Paribas,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit among its holdings.Expenses at Barclays' investment bank, for example, continue to spiral, leaving the bank short of its target to cut group cost to income to under 60 percent. Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Finance Director Andy Halford said his bank had made ""virtually no progress"" on reducing costs this year in a leaked staff email last month.And the benefits achieved by cutting jobs and branches have been eclipsed by fresh spending in technology and cyber defense.Banks have largely put massive penalties for past misconduct behind them but regulatory compliance is an unavoidable overhead set to rise as activities expand.And promises of 4, 5 and even 6 percent annual dividend payouts are not luring investors either, because European utilities, telecoms and insurers can offer the same dividends at reduced risk, fund managers said.Banks are the second cheapest sector on a price to earnings basis, trading at 9.1 times consensus estimates on 2019 earnings, a 30 percent discount to the market while offering a estimated 2019 yield of 5.7 percent, Berenberg data shows. Only the autos sector is cheaper.Although neutral to the sector, analysts at Bernstein said investors had rarely had a better opportunity to buy the ROE currently offered by the sector at such cheap prices.""If one did want to make a positive case for it, the European banks are somewhat cheaply valued against their level of ROE compared to what history would suggest.""The most bearish of investors say the lack of love for European banks reflects growing fears the European project is ultimately doomed, or another global financial crisis triggered by trade wars or sovereign insolvency is just around the corner. ""The next financial crisis will be triggered by sovereign debt, rather than the banks themselves. However the banks own a lot of the sovereign debt so there is contagion risk,"" said Matthew Gallagher, managing member at Odinic Advisors. ""Greece and Italy are starting to show cracks and won't be helped as interest rates rise in the US.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

18,"Sep 13, 2018 04:41AM ET",Holes in Swiss property market ring mortgage alarm bells,nan,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Rupert PretterklieberZURICH (Reuters) - Nearly four years after a 1930s telephone switchboard center was transformed into 18 industrial-style loft apartments in Zurich's Wiedikon neighborhood it is still not fully occupied.With rent plus utility bills of just over 5,400 Swiss francs per month for a three-bedroom apartment, the development by part of Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is indicative of a real estate rush which is raising regulatory red flags.A search for yield driven by Switzerland's negative interest rates has driven investors to build up their residential property portfolios and commission new luxury complexes.But although the country's vacancy rates have hit their highest levels in more than two decades, Swiss banks have upped mortgage lending as more investors seek to cash in.This is causing alarm among Swiss authorities who warn banks could be exposed when interest rates rise from the abnormally low levels used by the central bank to rein in the Swiss franc.""A real estate bubble is the biggest asset risk on the banking side,"" one regulatory official said. ""The investment property, buy-to-let segment is definitely overheated.""Vacancies on rental apartments more than doubled in nine years and the Swiss National Bank in June suggested implementing ""targeted measures"" for residential investment property lending.In an indication of the dependency on low interest rates to sustain demand, UBS (S:UBSG) says nearly one in five mortgage applicants in Switzerland is looking to rent the property out.With rates for ten-year mortgages at below 2 percent, compared to an average of around 5 percent from 1960 to the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago, creditors and investors are exposed to the risk of not being able to refinance their loans when interest rates do rise.But with insurers Zurich (S:ZURN),  Swiss Life  (S:SLHN) and  Axa  Winterthur, along with a number of pension funds, offering 10-year rates of 1.3 to 1.4 percent developers have pressed ahead with their building bonanza.TENANTS IN DEMANDThe stresses are most apparent in rural areas such as Remigen in the Aargau canton, where high-end projects have failed to find tenants, developers are offering discounts and bonuses, including rent-free introductory offers.""There are regions where I wouldn't build anymore,"" said Anton Affentranger, chief executive of Implenia (S:IMPN), Switzerland's largest construction firm, which converted the Swisscom building that Credit Suisse took on in Zurich.""I wouldn't build out in the sticks,"" he added.Credit Suisse's Real Estate Switzerland group, an investment vehicle for pension funds which focuses on residential properties, saw its portfolio grow by nearly 13 percent to 7 billion francs from June 2014 to June 2017.But while its vacancy rate nearly doubled to 8.2 percent, its generated returns -- although down 11 percent over a three-year period -- remain comparably attractive at 4.59 percent.What is worrying some property market analysts is that while rents have fallen, purchase prices have risen, posing a persistent affordability risk and bringing back memories of a late 1980s Swiss real estate bubble which triggered a damaging banking crisis in the 1990s when it burst.It now costs the equivalent of 30.7 annual rental payments to purchase a comparable home, according to UBS's second-quarter real estate bubble index, the highest purchase-price-to-rent ratio in a 36-year survey and above the previous peak of March 1989 at almost the height of the earlier real estate bubble.""There will have to be a price correction in the investment business. The appetite for real estate investment is so large that it's caused large distortions,"" Axa's (PA:AXAF) head of Swiss real estate, Ernst Schaufelberger, said. ""Many private (investors) are taking on a lot of debt.""SLEEP EASYThere are also concerns about affordability for commercial borrowers, with ratings agency Moody's saying more than half the loans granted failed banks' own self-regulation tests .These tests assess whether a mortgage would remain affordable -- calculated as no more than a third of a borrower's gross income or a third of net rent on investment properties -- should interest rates rise to 5 percent.""For residential investment property held by commercial borrowers, 51 percent of loans transgressed this guideline in 2017, up from 37 percent in 2016,"" Moody's said.""A sharp fall in house prices may result in collateral values no longer covering the value of the loans, which would imply outright losses for the bank in the event of default.""The Swiss National Bank has said new rules boosting capital requirements for domestic-focused banks of systemic importance should help cushion against any fallout, but there is growing concern that the government may also need to step in.""All major financial crises have been precipitated by a real estate crash,"" the regulatory official said, adding the big question was how sharp the correction would be.While many banks agree that prices have reached a high level and that certain lenders have been over-generous in granting loans, they see the worries as overblown.Switzerland's third-largest bank, cooperative lender Raiffeisen [RFSHW.UL], is the country's biggest mortgage lender and issues nearly one in four Swiss mortgages.""I'm of the opinion that one can more or less close one's eyes and sleep easily,"" Raiffeisen Chief Economist Martin Neff said. ""There are one or two cases that require targeted action, but I don't see a need for a broader market warning.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

21,"Aug 16, 2018 09:09AM ET",Exclusive: Amazon considering UK insurance comparison site - sources,nan,"By Carolyn Cohn and Simon JessopLONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is sounding out some of Europe's top insurance firms to see if they would contribute products to a UK price comparison website in what would be a major foray by the U.S. online retail giant into the region's financial services.Three industry executives told Reuters they had held talks with Amazon about the possible launch of a site. One said the talks were part of several discussions Amazon is having with insurers. A second said there were no imminent launch plans.While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites.""As Amazon becomes a larger part of the home, whether it's products delivered to the home, security monitoring, home services like Wi-Fi installation, you can make the case that insurance is the next logical step for this company,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy.The industry sources declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Amazon declined to comment.An Amazon price comparison website for insurance products would be a potential challenge to existing UK sites given the U.S. company's cutting-edge technology, reach and loyal customer base.Two of the most high profile are comparethemarket.com which shows products from insurers including AXA (PA:AXAF), Hastings (L:HSTG) and eSure (L:ESUR); and GoCompare (L:GOCO), which lists insurance from firms such as Santander (MC:SAN) and LV= [LV.UL].In response to the prospect of Amazon launching a rival service, shares in Moneysupermarket (L:MONY), GoCompare and Admiral (L:ADML), which runs the confused.com site, were down between 1.6 percent and 4.6 percent on Thursday.A UK insurance site would also build on Amazon's existing products in Europe offering extensions to manufacturers' warranties, a service known as Amazon Protect.While Amazon's loyal customer base and reach would probably prove attractive to some insurers happy to cede some of their premiums to Amazon to expand sales, the potential for premiums to be forced lower through competition could deter others.One of the industry sources said the comparison site model fitted Amazon's strategy of offering a range of products, as opposed to partnering with one firm. A price comparison website in particular could also be used to help drive traffic to its other marketplaces, Hottovy said.It was not immediately clear what financial arrangements Amazon would strike with insurers if it were to go ahead. Tech-rival Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched a financial services comparison site in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2016 but shut it down after only a year due to low traffic. REGULATORY BURDENIn the United States, Amazon has a joint venture with insurer Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and JP Morgan (N:JPM) aimed at slashing U.S. healthcare costs. It also offers a small business loan program.In Europe, Amazon has had a partnership with The Warranty Group since 2016 to offer the warranty extensions. It also offers co-branded credit cards in the United Kingdom and Germany although it does not lend money of its own.In a sign of potential expansion plans, Amazon began to place job ads last year for staff for a new insurance business in Europe, without giving details. While Chinese tech giants  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700) have large finance arms, leading Western tech firms have taken a more cautious approach to heavily regulated financial services, which often have hefty capital requirements.A comparison site, however, would let Amazon give its customers access to insurance from a variety of providers while avoiding that level of regulatory burden, industry sources said.The use of comparison websites to buy motor and home insurance is more prevalent in the United Kingdom than Europe or the United States.Some insurers rely heavily on comparison websites for sales. UK insurer Hastings (L:HSTG), for example, told Reuters it sells 90 percent of its motor policies through such sites.Rival car insurer Admiral (L:ADML) also relies on websites for sales and would be open to joining any Amazon site, its chief financial officer, Geraint Jones, said.""If it establishes a comparison site then I suspect Admiral will be interested in being a member, potentially. Price comparison is the main source of distribution of our products and we'll await with interest what they do,"" Jones told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

26,"Jun 26, 2018 03:30PM ET",Ex-State Street executive convicted in U.S. of hidden fee fraud,nan,"By Nate RaymondBOSTON (Reuters) - A former  State Street  Corp (N:STT) executive was convicted on Tuesday of participating in a scheme to defraud several of the bank's customers by charging them secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades. A federal jury in Boston found Ross McLellan, 46, guilty on five of six counts the one-time State Street executive vice president faced, including conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.The verdict came on the second day of jury deliberations and followed a trial of about three weeks. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin scheduled McLellan's sentencing for Oct. 10.""We're disappointed in the verdict and optimistic in an appeal that will include an enormous amount of significant issues, some of which are virtually unprecedented,"" said Martin Weinberg, McLellan's lawyer.McLellan is one four ex-employees of the Boston-based bank who since 2016 have faced U.S. charges that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. Two of those former executives - Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt - pleaded guilty in 2017. Both agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testified against McLellan in hopes of leniency when they are sentenced.The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six customers mark-ups on certain transactions. In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement.According to prosecutors, from 2010 to 2011 McLellan, Pennings, Boomgaardt and others conspired to add the secret commissions for trades made for the six customers, which had been utilizing the bank's ""transition management"" business.The service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments.The six customers included the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds.Prosecutors also claimed McLellan defrauded a New York-based unit of insurance company AXA SA (PA:AXAF) by applying hidden fees to trades conducted on its behalf. Jurors acquitted McLellan on the wire fraud charge related to that allegation.Charges remain pending against a former State Street employee, Kevin Walker, accused of participating in the AXA fraud scheme with McLellan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement. The six clients included the Kuwait Investment Authority and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds. All six utilized the bank's ""transition management” business, which helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios.

28,"Jun 18, 2018 04:20PM ET",Exclusive: KKR close to signing deal for Altice's telecom towers - sources,nan,"By Andrés González and Pamela BarbagliaMADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) is close to buying a stake in the telecom towers business of Altice (AS:ATCA), three sources told Reuters, a deal that will help the telecoms and cable group to pay down debt and reshape its European operations.Under the deal, which is being finalised, KKR will use its infrastructure fund to take a minority interest in Altice's towers subsidiary in France, the sources said.The U.S. buyout group has trumped rival bids from private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) and a consortium led by the infrastructure investment arms of insurers Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  Axa  (PA:AXAF) which also made it to the final stages of the auction, the sources said.KKR declined to comment while Altice and the other bidders were not immediately available for comment.Altice, whose debt equals more than twice its annual revenues, is rushing to finalize a series of non-core disposals involving telecoms towers in France and Portugal and its entire operations in the Dominican Republic.Its founder Patrick Drahi has pledged to shift the company's focus from large acquisitions to sales growth and debt management.The group's French masts could be valued at about 4 billion euros, according to estimates by RBC analysts, representing a multiple of 20 times its core earnings.Altice's SFR division has around 20,000 tower sites in France although some of these assets belong to a joint venture platform with French mobile firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY).The tower auction, which kicked off earlier this year, attracted interest from several heavyweight investors with Allianz and Axa joining a consortium with Digital Colony and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sources said.For KKR this is not the first minority deal in the telecom towers industry. Last year, it bought a 40 percent stake in Telefonica's telecom masts subsidiary Telxius for 1.3 billion euros.As part of the Telxius deal, KKR also gained significant exposure to an international network with approximately 65,000 kilometers of submarine fiber optic cables.Altice's reorganization, which involves the spin off of Altice's U.S. arm, is expected to complete toward the end of June and proceeds from the various auctions will be used to cut debt which rose to around $60 billion following a series of big ticket deals. In the United States, Drahi spent $28 billion in 2015 to buy cable companies Suddenlink and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), and even flirted with a $185 billion bid for cable giant Charter.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Yesterday the latest EU inflation numbers saw an unexpected decline in inflation on both the headline rate as well as on core prices,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, in a note.On Friday solid updates lifted shares in German specialty chemicals firm  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG), British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) and Swiss drug ingredients maker Lonza (S:LONN) to the top of the STOXX, while banking stocks were broadly lower.Sports car maker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) rose to a fresh record, up 5.6 percent, as brokers welcomed its better-than-expected quarterly update, providing more fuel to its stock price rally. HSBC declined 3.2 percent after it reported an unexpected 4 percent drop in first-quarter pre-tax profit due to a surge in investments, although its new CEO sought to cheer investors with a share buyback of up to $2 billion.BNP Paribas and Societe Generale fell sharply, down 2.4 and 5.9 percent respectively, as traders and analysts expressed disappointment with a weak-looking set of first-quarter results from the French banks.Their declines kept the French blue chip CAC (FCHI) down 0.2 percent. Still among financials, however, insurers  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) Generali (MI:GASI) were supported by better than expected quarterly updates, while AXA (PA:AXAF) fell 0.3 percent after first-quarter revenues fell 2.7 percent, pressured by a stronger euro which impacted the value of its sales.Forex headwinds were also blamed by BMW (DE:BMWG) for its 3 percent drop in quarterly operating profit. Shares in the German luxury carmaker were down 1.6 percent. Air France (PA:AIRF) was the biggest loser on the STOXX, down 7.9 percent. The airline said it expected profits to fall this year due to the effect of strikes at its main French unit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"Mar 06, 2018 12:13PM ET","BlackRock, Soros may invest in Deutsche's asset management IPO: source",nan,"By Tom Sims, Hans Seidenstuecker and Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - BlackRock (N:BLK), George Soros and big sovereign wealth funds are among investors expressing interest in buying stakes in the initial public offering of Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) asset management arm, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The sovereign funds include Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL) and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the person said. Deutsche Bank  is finalizing plans for the IPO of the asset management business, known as DWS, that have been a year in the making. Deutsche is expected to sell 25 percent of existing DWS shares for 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.5 billion), people close to the matter have said. DWS is seeking anchor investors, the person said, while it also wants to ensure the liquidity for the free floating shares.Deutsche Bank's largest investors, the Qatari royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], are not expected to invest in the IPO, said the person, who disclosed the potential investor base on condition of anonymity because the IPO process is ongoing. Spokesmen for Qatar and HNA declined to comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment, while the potential DWS investors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.The DWS listing will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan's struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.Deutsche said in March 2017 it would list a stake in DWS as part of a broader overhaul to help the bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals. Some investors have raised questions about the timing of the IPO as the economic growth cycle turns and financial markets become more volatile.""One of the key investor concerns regarding DWS is the question whether the asset management industry in general is at the top of the cycle,"" said a second person close to the IPO.The asset management industry is facing pressure on fees and rising regulatory costs, which show no signs of abating and which could limit profits for the sector. ""Asset management is under pressure from regulators, investors and the public to perform better and charge less,"" said Tom Brown, Global Head of Asset Management at consultants KPMG. ""Firms need scale or to specialize to stay in the game."" These potential constraints come on top of issues specific to Deutsche Bank.""Will DWS be able to cut costs as harshly as needed?"" the second person close to the IPO said. ""Will it be able to do an interesting large M&A deal given the fact that DB wants to retain control?""Another concern among investors is that Deutsche Bank could dilute the price of DWS shares by selling down its stake if the bank needs to raise capital. The IPO would help Deutsche to bolster its balance sheet and quell shareholder unrest over the pace of its turnaround after three consecutive years of losses. It could also possibly open the way to dividend payouts.A price range for the shares is expected to be announced as soon as Sunday, followed by the publication of an investor prospectus on Monday.The IPO would likely take place in the week of March 19, sources have said, adding it had been brought forward hoping to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any correction.DWS head Nicolas Moreau, formerly with the French insurer  Axa  (PA:AXAF), has been on the road for four weeks over the past few months drumming up investor interest and plans to meet with investors again next week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

After an initial fall at the open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) switched back into positive territory and gained further strength as Wall Street reversed earlier losses. The STOXX closed up 1 percent at 370.87 points. Italy's FTSE MIB blue-chip index (FTMIB) fell 0.4 percent to November lows, dragged down notably by weakness among its banks. Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament.""We expect lengthy negotiations after these elections, which may lead to increased volatility of Italian assets,"" said Matteo Ramenghi, CIO at UBS WM Italy.Italy's parliament will meet for the first time on March 23 and President Sergio Mattarella is not expected to open formal talks on forming a government until early April.Italian banks (FTIT8300), seen as a proxy for political risk given their large government bond holdings, were down 2.6 percent to a near two-month low Mid-sized Italian banks with domestically focused operations and high bad loan burdens were worst hit. BPER Banca (MI:EMII) lost 7.6 percent, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) 6.1 percent and UBI Banca UBI.MI 3.7 percent.European financials were also dragged down by France's AXA (PA:AXAF), which fell 9.7 percent. Europe's second-biggest insurer was the worst performer among blue chips, after it agreed to buy property and casualty insurance company XL Group for around $15 billion.  Mediaset  (MI:MS) fell 5.5 percent after the party of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose family controls the private broadcaster, did worse than expected. JCI Capital fund manager Alessandro Balsotti said even though the result of Italy's vote was not market-friendly, he did not expect systemic repercussions for European integration or the single currency, given that even the anti-establishment parties had toned down eurosceptic rhetoric during the campaign. The situation in Italy was in strong contrast to Germany where Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Merkel’s conservatives, signaling an end to political uncertainty in Europe's biggest economy. Germay's DAX (GDAXI) index added 1.5 percent, a rise seen as a sign of confidence in Europe's economic recovery which helped confine worries about the Italian political situation. ""The economic recovery in Europe and worldwide is much more resilient than in the past and the balance sheets of the companies are much stronger after many years of restructuring programmes,"" French asset manager Amundi said in a note. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened European automakers with a tax on imports if the European Union retaliated against his plan to slap tariffs on aluminum and steel. German automakers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) were down 0.6 and 0.1 percent respectively.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

41,"Mar 05, 2018 11:39AM ET",AXA buys Bermuda-based XL for $15 billion in latest insurance mega-deal,nan,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - France's AXA (PA:AXAF) moved to buy Bermuda-based XL Group (N:XL) for $15.3 billion on Monday to create what it said would be a world leader in property and casualty insurance.Europe's second-biggest insurer offered $57.60 for each XL share, a 33 percent premium to Friday's closing price, and said buying XL would result in property and casualty insurance rising to half of AXA's earnings, from 39 percent.XL has already agreed to AXA's offer, and AXA, which ranks as Europe's second-biggest insurer in terms of market capitalization behind Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), will look to de-list XL's shares. AXA said it would finance the deal with debt, cash and the proceeds of the IPO of its U.S. business.Insurers are turning to takeovers to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns from financial market investments. AXA's deal comes just over a month after American International Group (N:AIG) said it would buy reinsurer Validus (N:VR) for around $5.6 billion.P&C insurers' stocks fell during last year's natural disaster season and have attracted the attention of bidders as premiums are rising after several years of falling rates.Allianz had also been seen as a possible suitor for XL, but a source close to the German company said Allianz was not overly concerned by AXA scooping up XL. AXA's shares fell 6.9 percent to 23.33 euros by 0955 GMT, as some analysts said the deal looked pricey. Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said the deal will enable AXA to dominate the global property and casualty market, and reduce its exposure to the volatility of financial markets.""We will be number one in commercial insurance,"" Buberl told a news conference in Paris.Some analysts were skeptical about the price.""In our view, the acquisition of XL fits AXA's strategy of growing in commercial insurance. However, the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA's debt ratio is again rather stretched,"" said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe, who kept a ""hold"" rating on AXA shares.Analysts at UBS said XL did not necessarily fit AXA's plans to grow in Asia, given XL's predominantly U.S.-exposed business.""AXA targets growth in health, protection and commercial lines, P&C (property & casualty) markets preferably in Asia rather than U.S. reinsurance,"" UBS said.""However, acquiring XL does give global commercial P&C lines exposure and further accelerate AXA's exit from more volatile business lines in the U.S.,"" it added.COST SYNERGIESAXA has not been hit as hard as some by a series of costly natural catastrophes in 2017, thanks to reinsurance contracts and a diversified business model, and last month it reported higher-than-expected 2017 net profits of 6.2 billion euros.The company expects the XL takeover to be cash accretive, and result in cost synergies of around $400 million per year, based on pre-tax earnings.Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based Prime Partners which owns AXA shares, said it was a ""good deal"" given AXA's plans to cut its exposure to financial markets, and that it looked positive on a long-term view.The French company also reaffirmed its 2020 financial targets, under which AXA aims to increase earnings per share by 3 to 7 percent a year over the 2016-2020 period.Law firm Skadden said it was advising XL over the AXA takeover, while AXA added that JP Morgan was involved in part of the financing of the XL takeover.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

43,"Feb 22, 2018 12:18PM ET",European shares dip as earnings flurry fails to lift sentiment,nan,"By Julien PonthusLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell slightly on Thursday as a flurry of corporate results failed to lift sentiment after a new wave of speculation about faster hikes in U.S interest rates soured risk appetite globally. An hour after the open, the publication of the German business confidence index, which fell more than expected in February, and a downward revision in UK economic growth cemented the gloom, although a rebound on Wall Street from losses in the previous day helped shares come off lows.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index ended down 0.2 percent, having fallen as much as 1 percent earlier in the session. The index remains down 5.7 percent from the two-and-a-half year peak hit at the end of January.""Stock markets are weaker today after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of their latest meeting last night,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. Barclays  (L:BARC) was the best performing stock among blue-chips, rising 4.4 percent after it pledged to restore its full dividend with a payout of 6.5 pence per share in 2018.The earnings further buoyed optimism on British banks, a day after Lloyds (LON:LLOY) reported its highest pretax profit since 2006.Other financial companies had positive news, with French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) posting higher than expected 2017 net profit and Belgian financial services provider KBC (BR:KBC) boosted by solid performances in the Czech Republic and its international business. Their shares rose 0.6 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Denmark's  Genmab  (CO:GEN), Europe's biggest biotechnology company, posted the best performance within the STOXX 600, surging as much as 19 percent as it reassured investors on sales growth of blood cancer drug Darzalex this year.Denmark-based hearing aid manufacturer  William Demant  Holding (CO:WDH) was second with a 6.9 percent jump after results came in above forecast.In the currently unpopular utilities sectors, France's Veolia (PA:VIE) jumped 2.1 percent after reporting an acceleration of growth in early 2018. Double-digit international growth and a recovery in France boosted 2017 core earnings. UK energy supplier  Centrica  (L:CNA), which issued a profit warning in November, rose 7.5 percent after it raised its cost saving target by 500 million pounds and said it would cut about 4,000 jobs by 2020. In another unloved sector, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) lost 2.4 percent after its results, and  Telefonica  Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) fell 2.6 percent after RBC cut its target price by 13 percent. Telefonica (MC:TEF) rose 3.8 percent after a well-received earnings update.French payment technology company  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) suffered its worst trading day in 16 years, down as much as 20 percent in the early morning, after announcing 2018 guidance below analyst expectations.In contrast to the positive share price reaction to Glencore's (L:GLEN) upbeat results on Wednesday,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL)  fell 0.6 percent after presenting 2007 results that missed some forecasts.Moneysupermarket.com (L:MONY) fell 13.7 percent after the price comparison website said its earnings would not grow this year as it tries to reinvent itself to focus on more personalization, mobile and new products such as mortgages.(additional reporting by Danilo Masoni; editing by Tom Pfeiffer)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Feb 15, 2018 07:41AM ET",Virgin Money creates rare female top team with new hire,nan,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Esha Vaish(Reuters) - Virgin Money (L:VM) on Thursday appointed former HSBC (L:HSBA) executive Irene Dorner as chairwoman, creating a rare female duo at the top of one of Britain's FTSE 350 listed companies.Virgin Money had said in October it was in talks to hire Dorner, who will join Jayne-Anne Gadhia who is the first female CEO of a listed British bank.Dorner joins Virgin Money's board as chair elect and takes over from outgoing Chairman Glen Moreno on March 31.Dorner held many roles at HSBC, including chief executive of HSBC USA, and has also been a non-executive director at French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) and British engineering group Rolls Royce (L:RR).""Irene brings a wealth of experience and expertise in banking and financial services ... I am proud to be leaving a strong and diverse board,"" Moreno said. Gadhia has been an advocate for greater representation of women in senior roles in Britain's financial services sector, where the four big banks all have male chief executives and chairmen. Women directors are still relatively few in Britain despite government efforts to encourage companies to appoint more.Dorner's appointment would make Virgin Money the only FTSE 350 company to have an all female duo at the helm.Gadhia oversaw the creation of the government's Women in Finance Charter in 2016, which had 162 signatories as of November, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).  Theresa May, who became only the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher, has criticized the finance industry for failing to promote and retain women and the government has a voluntary target for FTSE 350 companies to have 33 percent women directors by 2020.There were only 38 women in executive directorship roles in 2017 across FTSE 250 boards, accounting for just 7.7 percent of the overall board representation, according to a report by Cranfield University and University of Exeter.Based on the information in that report, Dorner would be only the fifth female executive director of a FTSE 250 finance company.Other senior women in finance include Ana Botin, who is executive chairman of Santander (MC:SAN) and Inga Beale, who is CEO of Lloyd's of London . Last December,  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) appointed Val Rahmani as an independent non-executive director to its male-majority board.Britain's finance industry has also faced criticism for lack of transparency about ethnic diversity in management. Britain's two biggest banks, Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) having recently set diversity targets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

56,"Sep 18, 2017 12:19PM ET",From grudge to nudge: tech firms help insurers shift gear,nan,"By Carolyn Cohn and Jemima KellyLONDON (Reuters) - Insurers are counting on real-time technology to help them cut back payouts, from a system warning ships of nearby pirates to an app offering to buy sleepy drivers a coffee on the motorway.The lure of products promising to save on claims in a highly competitive market has led to a leap in investment in ""insurtech"" in Europe to more than $400 million (294 million pounds) in the first half of 2017, from just $50 million a year ago.The aim is to move insurance from a ""grudge"" purchase, when the only interaction with customers is after something has gone wrong, to a ""nudge"" product, encouraging safer behaviour.While the idea is not entirely new, the technology is making it more prevalent, prompting warnings from regulators about the risk of discrimination.Insurers say they can navigate those hazards as they explore blockchain - tamper-proof databases shared and updated across a network - ""big data"", analysing reams of information for trends, as well as the artificial intelligence technology behind driverless cars, drones and voice-recognition software.""The new technologies have the potential to change the game (from compensation to risk mitigation),” said Simon Tottman, head of insurance research, UK & Ireland, for consultants Accenture.The biggest surge of insurtech investment was in Britain, where, despite the vote to leave the European Union, it hit $279 million in the six months to end-June from $9 million a year earlier, analysis by Accenture of data from CB Insights showed.In the rest of Europe, investment jumped to $134 million from $37 million and some insurers are also forming partnerships with insurtech firms.RISKSA focus in Britain on analysis of social media to assess the probability of claims has fuelled concerns about data security. British motor insurer Admiral (L:ADML) had to abandon plans last year to take data from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to set insurance premiums following objections by the social media firm.The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV) sees risks from big data in personal insurance outweighing benefits, fearing it will shift insurance from spreading risk collectively to being an arbiter of social norms.New European Union data protection legislation coming into force in 2018 should strengthen consumer rights, according to a discussion paper published by European supervisory authorities in Dec 2016, which warned financial institutions to consider the legal dimensions of processing social media data.European regulators also worry about social exclusion, and are checking whether data is being used in a way that makes insurance too expensive for those regarded as a higher risk.Andrew Brem, chief digital officer at UK insurer  Aviva  (L:AV), which is aiming to invest 100 million pounds over the next few years in insurtech start-ups, says the aim is only to promote less risky behaviour.""In our sector, technology can be very powerful in helping people make smarter choices,” said Brem, whose company has an insurtech-focused office in a converted garage in London’s so-called Silicon Roundabout area in the east of the city.Health app Tictrac, due to start working with Aviva later this year, tracks exercise, sleep patterns and the weight of employees in corporate healthcare, offering tips and setting challenges to help prevent the onset of costly conditions.""Companies don't get any access to their employees' data,"" said Martin Blinder, Trictrac CEO. ""They're able to see aggregated, anonymised utilisation trends.""CLOUD, BLOCKCHAIN, APPSThe largest UK investment this year was in the domestically focused insurer Gryphon, which is awaiting regulatory approval to offer tailored life, critical illness and income protection insurance via financial advisers using cloud-based technology.Telematics - black boxes in cars which enable insurers to check customers' driving and reward safer habits - have been in use for a while.Anton Ossip, CEO of Discovery Insure, owned by Johannesburg-based financial services firm Discovery Ltd (J:DSYJ), said accident claims had dropped more than 11 percent since it began using customers' driving information in pricing in 2011.Kenny Leitch, global connected insurance director at UK insurer RSA (L:RSA) said it had paid nearly 2 million pounds in cash rewards to young drivers for safe driving using telematics.Insurtech firms are now looking at how to use telematics in real time to prevent accidents. For example, said Tottman, an app may suggest a coffee at a service station at the insurer's expense if it detects tiredness in a driver's voice.Consultancy EY, data security firm Guardtime, Microsoft (O:MSFT) and ship operator Maersk are building the first blockchain-based marine insurance platform.""The shared ledger can alert a ship in Somali waters that it’s approaching an area where pirates have just hijacked another ship,"" said Shaun Crawford, global insurance leader at EY.AXA (PA:AXAF) also has a strategic fund investing in insurtech startups and investments by Allianz (DE:ALVG)'s 430 million euro ($513 million) fund include U.S. firm Lemonade, a digital peer-to-peer insurer that uses artificial intelligence and behavioural economics.The U.S. pulled in $4.4 billion in insurtech investment between 2010 and 2016, compared with $1.3 billion in the Asia-Pacific region and $300 million in Europe, according to Accenture's analysis of CB Insights data.More than half the 100-plus insurers surveyed by consultants Capgemini said they wanted to partner with insurtech firms, according to its annual World Insurance Report published last week with trade body Efma.Murray Raisbeck, global co-head of fintech at consultants KPMG said some inroads by insurers into technology were still largely a public relations exercise, but insurtech was becoming a ""permanent feature"" of the market.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They complain it is able unfairly to undercut rival services because it uses independent workers who do not enjoy the same rights and benefits as permanent employees.The agreement announced in France on Tuesday comes on top of new benefit package schemes that have been announced in various countries in which it operates including the United States and Britain.""This partnership will provide a safety net for the independent workers who enjoy flexible work at the touch of a button and we'll carry on listening about further improvements we can make to create the best possible experience,"" said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber's head of operations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.No details of the French scheme were provided except to say that the insurance would be free for drivers. A statement from the two companies said there would be further information available once the system was in place in the autumn.Currently, self-employed drivers' compulsory insurance policies do not offer life cover. AXA said that the French protection of Uber workers would cover medical expenses, disability indemnities, and survivor benefits in case of an accident.Across the world, large car insurers have begun rolling out coverage tailored to ride-hailing drivers.In some places that fills a void that had existed for drivers whose personal policies do not cover trips during which they are driving passengers for pay.In France, however, Uber services are restricted to drivers who already hold a minicab license. Its ride-sharing arm, UbperPOP, was outlawed in 2015.Drivers working for Uber in Britain will be able to access illness and injury cover under a new scheme run by the Association of Independent Professionals & the Self-Employed, Uber said earlier in April.In New York, Uber holds a group ridesharing insurance policy that covers accident during a prearranged trip, but also while the driver is waiting for a trip request. The protection insurance works only when a driver is logged in to the app.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

For example AXA (PA:AXAF), France's largest insurer, last year said it would stop investing in tobacco and divest all of its 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) of assets in the industry. At the time AXA called tobacco ""the biggest threat to public health in the world"". Unlike its rivals, Swiss Re said it would not be shifting its investments away from any particular industry or company.""It is very delicate to exclude whole sectors, keeping diversification in mind. The ultimate point is to put incentives to companies to become more sustainable over time,"" said Swiss Re's Fuerer.He said Swiss Re is the first insurer to base its whole portfolio on ethical principles, with portfolio managers being told to use MSCI's environmental, governance and social indices when making investment decisions.MSCI rates companies according to various ethical criteria, with the score combined with market capitalization weight to create an index. That means companies with a more ethical performance have a greater weight in the index.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The companies argued that it amounted to double taxation. The tax brought in 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) a year to France's state coffers.The AJEF group of French blue-chip companies welcomed the court's decision, saying in a statement it was a strong signal for France's attractiveness in terms of the business environment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"May 05, 2017 07:30AM ET",DBS to seek bids for non-life insurance distribution deal: sources,nan,"By Anshuman Daga and Sumeet ChatterjeeSINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - DBS Group (SI:DBSM) plans to invite bids from insurers keen to sell general insurance products across the key markets of Southeast Asia's biggest lender, in a deal potentially worth up to $350 million, sources familiar with the matter said.The move underscores the under-penetrated region's growing attraction to insurers who see a big opportunity to boost business as rising incomes generate demand for property, motor and travel insurance products.In the last few years, banks such as  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and CIMB Group (KL:CIMB) have formed partnerships with insurers as they were willing to pay hefty fees for access to lenders' branch networks and digital platforms.DBS, which has partnerships with subsidiaries of Japanese group MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc (T:8725) since 2005, plans to seek bids from insurers as soon as next month, three sources told Reuters. They declined to be identified as the news is not public.Two of the sources said the 15-year deal is estimated to be valued at up to $350 million, but it could change depending on the deal's structure and sales assumptions made by the bidders.DBS is expected to pick one or two insurance partners for the deal, which could cover all of its key markets of Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, China and Taiwan.MS&AD's units are expected to participate in the bidding process, which is also likely to draw interest from France's AXA (PA:AXAF), Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) and Australia's QBE Insurance Group Ltd (AX:QBE), the sources said.DBS, AXA, Generali, and QBE declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from MSIG Asia, a subsidiary of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company Ltd to Reuters queries.GOING DIGITALDBS has more than 7 million customers across its consumer, banking and wealth management businesses spread in 18 markets but the majority of these are from its key markets.The bank has spent billions of dollars in the last few years to digitize its businesses.One source said DBS was likely to leverage general insurance distribution partnership as a value-add offering for its wealth management clients. The sales volume for general insurance products tend to be lower than the mass-market life business.The sources said DBS was likely to complete talks and seal the deal by the end of the year.DBS' plan to seek partners follows the bank's move last year to allow Canada's Manulife insurer (TO:MFC) to sell life insurance through its Asia network in a 15-year deal.Reuters reported in March that  Citigroup  (N:C) will seek bids from global insurers keen to sell general insurance products across the U.S. bank's Asia-Pacific markets, in a deal that could be worth at least $500 million.In January, StanChart and Allianz (DE:ALVG) announced a 15-year deal that enabled the German insurer to sell its general insurance products to StanChart's customers in five Asian markets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"May 01, 2017 02:44PM ET","AllianceBernstein parent abruptly removes CEO Kraus, directors",nan,"By Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlinBOSTON (Reuters) - The French parent of asset manager AllianceBernstein fired its longtime leader Peter Kraus, replacing him with a new chief executive and and new chairman, and overhauled the firm's board, according to a filing Monday that offered little explanation for the unexpected changes.New York-based AllianceBernstein, which is 64 percent owned by France's AXA SA (PA:AXAF), named JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management executive Seth Bernstein as its new CEO and Robert Zoellick, previously president of the World Bank and a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive, as chairman. Kraus, who held the CEO and chairman titles since 2008, was ""terminated"" from his job as CEO, according to a securities filing. AllianceBernstein, with $497.9 billion in assets under management at the end of March, gave no hint of changes in the works when it reported earnings on Thursday.The filing also said that on Friday an AXA unit removed nine directors from the AllianceBernstein board, including Kraus, and the next day named replacements to fill most of the seats on the board which now has eight members.A spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the changes. Representatives at AXA's Paris headquarters were not available to comment on the moves, which came eight months after Thomas Buberl took over as CEO of the giant French insurer.AllianceBernstein shares fell 3.28 percent to $22.15.Kraus, himself a Goldman Sachs veteran, took over as CEO and chairman in 2008, just as the financial crisis gripped Wall Street. He helped shepherd AllianceBernstein in the difficult years that followed, but it has not fully recovered. AllianceBernstein's assets of $497.9 billion are well below the $800.4 billion it managed at the end of 2007. It is now dwarfed by companies with stronger lineups of passive investment products such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), which ran $5.4 trillion at the end of March.On a conference call on Monday morning, AXA Board Chairman Denis Duverne thanked Kraus for his service as CEO.""After eight years, we decided it was time to put in new leadership,"" Duverne said during the call. Analysts pushed for more detail on the abrupt changes at the top, but Duverne declined to say what, if anything, was lacking during Kraus' watch.In a note to investors Jefferies analysts wrote the shake-up ""produces more questions than answers"" and that the new management structure may signal a closer alignment between AllianceBernstein and AXA, where six board members now have ties.AXA executives cited a changed industry since Kraus came in, the Jefferies analysts wrote, implying that ""AXA disagreed with the strategy being pursued by the previous management team and did not want to wait until the end of Peter's contract to make changes as industry headwinds are only accelerating.""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) William Katz wrote however the change may not reflect strategic or financial issues because management had little other news, and that ""potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change.""Kraus had given no indication of changes ahead. On a conference call after the company's earnings last week, he said: ""We've focused for years on rebuilding our presence and regaining relevance with retail clients and are finally where we need to be.""Kraus has entered into a ""cooperation agreement"" with AllianceBernstein, under which he is entitled to termination benefits and salary, according to the filing. According to the filing AXA has agreed to buy from Kraus stock units worth $99.3 million. He may also receive restricted units in the future, the filing states.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

74,"Apr 05, 2017 01:10PM ET",EU watchdog to cut interest rate for insurer liabilities from 2018,nan,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - A European Union watchdog will cut an interest rate used to price liabilities at euro zone insurers such as Munich Re (DE:MUVGn), AXA (PA:AXAF) and Allianz (DE:ALVG), a step that could mean some firms having to hold more capital.The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said on Wednesday it would reduce the theoretical interest rate known as the ultimate forward rate (UFR), used to discount an insurer's liabilities over time.Insurers have work out their liabilities from policies going forward up to 60 years, but there are no reliable euro market interest rates extending beyond 20 years, hence the need for regulators to compile an extrapolated rate covering the 40-year gap.EIOPA is proposing to cut the UFR, currently set at 4.2 percent, to 3.65 percent over time from January next year. It would only be applied to liabilities denominated in euros.The regulator said the annual change in the UFR would not be more than 15 basis points, meaning the UFR will fall in January to 4.05 percent from 4.2 percent.Regulators believe a reduction would better reflect current historically low interest rates, and the impact will be to increase liabilities because the rate at which they are discounted is lower.""This methodology strikes the right balance between a stable UFR and the need to adjust it in case of changes in long-term expectations about interest rates and inflation,"" EIOPA Chairman Gabriel Bernardino said.""The methodology ensures that the UFR moves gradually and in a predictable manner, allowing insurers to adjust to changes in the interest rate environment and ensuring policyholder protection.""Higher liabilities could lower an insurer's solvency ratio, a closely-watched benchmark of overall health, forcing it to raise more capital to reassure investors.Insurers say regulators should review the sector's solvency rules more broadly, rather than focus on changing just one number.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Smaller deals could be funded from existing resources.Bannister declined to comment specifically on Prudential and Standard Life's annuity book, but said: ""We are very comfortable with annuities.... So yes, we are interested in a transaction in the UK market.""Britain's vote to leave the European Union had increased opportunities to buy assets, Bannister said, as foreign companies reassessed the market after the August interest rate cut, a drop in the sterling currency making dividends less attractive and concerns over bond market volatility.Thanks to its recent deals, Phoenix said it now expects to generate 2.8 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) of cash from operating companies between 2016 and 2020, up from an earlier target of 2 billion pounds.The company's shares were up 1.5 percent at 803 pence at 1037 GMT.($1 = 0.8058 pounds)"

""It's for you and only you to decide,"" Fillon told voters in his letter, adding: ""Nothing will divert me from the real aim of my presidential campaign: to get France back on its feet and bring the French together.""Opinion polls now show Fillon, a clear favorite until the jobs scandal erupted, is unlikely to reach a second round run-off, in which centrist Emmanuel Macron is seen beating far-right party leader Marine Le Pen.In a sign that the fake jobs allegations might continue to dog Fillon, French TV showed images of a few protesters banging on pots and pans on Wednesday as he visited Juvisy-sur-Orge south of Paris as part of his campaign. On Tuesday hecklers greeted him during another visit with cries of ""Crook! Thief!"" Uncertainty over the outcome of the election, which takes place in two rounds on April 23 and May 7, has this week driven the premium that investors demand for holding French over German government debt to multi-year highs.Heavyweight centrist Francois Bayrou, who has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, accused Fillon of being under the influence of ""financial powers"" and said French democracy was under threat.After apologizing on Monday for having employed family members, and with Wednesday's letter to voters, Fillon's new strategy includes attacking the legitimacy of the financial prosecutor's office investigating the fake jobs allegations.INVESTIGATIONThe investigation is ""void"", Fillon's lawyer Antonin Levy told journalists on Tuesday, in a change of tack after Fillon had said he welcomed the probe and wanted it to be concluded as quickly as possible.Fillon has said he would drop out of the presidential race if put under formal investigation. The investigation is so far a preliminary one and it is unclear when it will be over. Fillon's troubles started when the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported that Fillon's wife Penelope had received public money for work she may not have done. It later said two of his adult children had also received taxpayer money.Fillon has said his wife did work for him.On Wednesday BFM Business, a TV channel, said in an article on its website that Fillon was paid 200,000 euros in fees by insurance company AXA between mid-2012 and mid-2014 via his consultancy business 2F Conseil.French media speculated at the end of last year that former AXA (PA:AXAF) chief Henri de Castries could become finance minister.AXA and Fillon's entourage did not reply to requests for comment.A source in France's governing Socialist Party said grandees in Fillon's The Republicans party were unlikely to topple him now, given that no clear alternative candidate had emerged and that time had run out to organize a new primary contest.""They weren't far (from a party coup), but they got stuck,"" the source said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

85,"Jan 25, 2017 03:10PM ET","Generali finance chief to leave, takeover talk mounts",nan,"By Stephen JewkesMILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI) said on Wednesday its chief financial officer Alberto Minali would be leaving at the end of the month, at a time of uncertainty for the country's biggest insurer.The departure of Minali comes a day after Italy's biggest retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) said it was considering the idea of a tie-up with Generali in a move that could reshape the country's financial landscape.Generali, whose biggest shareholder is influential investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), said on Monday it had bought voting rights equal to 3.01 percent of Intesa, in a defensive move.In a statement, Generali said Minali, who is also general manager at the group, would be replaced as CFO by head of corporate finance Luigi Lubelli.It added Minali would receive a severance package of around 5.78 million euros ($6.2 million), plus a payment related to his long-term bonus package that was yet to be quantified, and said his role as general manager would not be replaced. Last year, Minali lost out to Philippe Donnet in the race to replace Mario Greco as CEO of Europe's No. 3 insurer and sources close to the matter told Reuters tensions have built up between the two.Recent leadership changes at Generali and political weakness in Rome have helped kindle bid talk about the 186-year-old company which for years has been at the crossroads of Italian finance.Italian newspapers have said Intesa's move is in part aimed at fending off interest in Generali from foreign companies such as France's AXA (PA:AXAF) and Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG). Donnet was formerly an executive of AXA.Generali and Allianz have declined to comment, while AXA CEO Thomas Buberl said in remarks published Wednesday he was not interested in a bid for Generali.Italian market regulator Consob, which met Intesa managers on Wednesday, is due to meet on Thursday executives of Generali and lender UniCredit , the top investor in Mediobanca.Like other European insurers, Generali has had to cope with falling investment returns and stiffer competition.The company, which generates most of its revenues and earnings in Italy, France and Germany, said in November it was looking to leave unattractive markets and cut costs to improve profits and boost capital.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

86,"Jan 23, 2017 02:20PM ET",Italy's Generali buys three percent of Italian bank Intesa in defensive move,nan,"By Valentina ZaMILAN (Reuters) - Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI) said on Monday it had bought voting rights equal to 3.01 percent of Intesa Sanpaolo's (MI:ISP) share capital, effectively blocking the lender from acquiring a large stake in Italy's biggest insurer.The move comes after newspaper La Stampa said that Intesa, one of Italy's biggest banks, was considering buying a stake in Generali and this could possibly be part of a broader deal between Intesa and Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG). Under the scheme, the paper said, the German insurer could buy some of Generali's assets while Intesa would buy a stake worth between 5 and 6 billion euros to protect Italian interests in the insurer. Intesa and Allianz declined to comment.However, Generali's move, made through a securities lending transaction, would prevent Intesa from making such an investment. The stake Generali has acquired in Intesa is worth 1.2 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters data. According to Italy's cross-shareholding regulations, a company cannot hold more than 3 percent of another entity's voting rights if the latter already has a stake of more than 3 percent in that company. This means Intesa could still buy more than 3 percent of Generali but its voting rights would be capped at 3 percent and it would be obliged to sell any stake above that level within a year. However, the limits would no longer apply should Intesa launch a takeover bid for at least 60 percent of Generali's share capital.Generali's shares rose more than 7 percent on Monday after the press reports and closed up 3.94 percent at 14.25 euros.The insurer's market value of 21 billion euros is less than half what it was at the onset of the financial crisis in 2007-2008. The company has repeatedly been at the center of takeover speculation, with France's AXA (PA:AXAF) often mentioned in media reports as a possible buyer.La Stampa said Allianz had already looked at making a bid for Generali last summer but had decided not to pursue it because of AXA's interest.The chief executive of Allianz, the third-largest insurer in the Italian market after Generali and UnipolSai Assicurazioni (MI:US), said earlier this month he favored a ""big takeover"" because buying small companies would not make sense.Analysts were sceptical about a possible three-way tie-up, saying it would likely trigger antitrust concerns in Italy for both the German company and the Italian bank, which also has an insurance business,  Intesa Sanpaolo  Vita.""Given the market share that Intesa Sanpaolo has reached in the life business a deal could raise antitrust problems,"" broker ICBPI said in a note. Generali's biggest shareholder and Intesa's domestic rival is Milanese investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), which has pledged to cut its 13 percent stake in the insurer to 10 percent and has said it could reduce it even further.Jean-Pierre Mustier, CEO of Mediobanca's major shareholder UniCredit (MI:CRDI), said in an interview this month that it was important for the country that Generali remained Italian and that Mediobanca had to preserve the insurer's independence.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

88,"Jan 12, 2017 09:18AM ET",UniCredit says will complete cash call in time for bond payouts,nan,"By Valentina Za and Gianluca SemeraroMILAN/ROME (Reuters) - The chief executive of Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) pledged on Thursday to complete a 13 billion euro ($14 billion) share issue by March 10, in time to make payouts due on high-risk bonds that came under pressure on the market.UniCredit's shareholders met on Thursday to approve Italy's biggest corporate cash call to help clean up its balance sheet and restructure under new CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, distancing itself from the protracted banking crisis.Responding to market watchdog Consob, UniCredit on Thursday clarified the cash call had not been requested by European Central Bank supervisors.UniCredit detailed a plan last month to offload 17.7 billion euros in bad loans and cut 14,000 jobs. It said then that loan writedowns would make up two thirds of 12.2 billion euros in one-off charges it would book in the last quarter. UniCredit warned on Thursday that fourth-quarter charges could make it hard to pay coupons on Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds due in March if it did not carry out the share issue.The comments weighed on UniCredit's outstanding AT1 bonds. By 1340 GMT (8:40 a.m. ET) the 8 percent bond  on which the coupon payment is due yielded 9.5 percent, slightly higher on the day but below a session high of 9.7 percent. A 6.75 percent AT1 bond the bank issued in December  yielded 8.6 percent, up from 8.3 percent at Wednesday's close.UniCredit can temporarily write down the value of its AT1 bonds if its core capital falls below a certain threshold. It can also cancel their coupon payments at any time.Mustier, however, told La Stampa daily that UniCredit would not have to do so.""It (the share issue) will be completed in time for the UniCredit bond payment on March 10,"" he said.UniCredit has found a group of banks to take on any unsold shares, unlike rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) which in December had to be rescued by Italy's government after failing to find buyers for its stock.Mustier said the share sale had drawn interest from both Europe and the United States but ruled out that a rival bank could use it to buy a stake.""We'll have only financial investors. Ours is a plan for standalone growth; we won't turn it into something different,"" he said.PARANOIAThe French banker also sought to dismiss long-standing concerns about a possible takeover of Italy's top insurer Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI) by French rival AXA (PA:AXAF).""Let's put a stop to this paranoia,"" he said in the newspaper interview.Concerns have mounted in Italy that more companies would fall prey to French rivals after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) became the biggest shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and, more recently, aggressively built a large stake in broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS).The appointment of Frenchman Philippe Donnet as CEO of Generali and the arrival of Mustier at UniCredit have further stoked speculation.""For me, as an 'Italian citizen', Generali is crucial for the country ... Generali must remain Italian, Mediobanca must preserve the insurer's independence,"" Mustier said.UniCredit is the top shareholder in Mediobanca, which in turn is Generali's biggest investor.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We are looking for innovative companies that are going to address clients' need in a new way.""Northwestern Mutual is also an investor in New York-based robo-advice firm Betterment and Rize, a startup that provides digital tools to help consumers save.Investments from corporate venture arms constitute an increasingly significant share of venture funding for fintech startups. In the third quarter of 2016, corporates participated in 30 percent of global VC-backed fintech deals for the second consecutive quarter, according to a report from data provider CB Insights and KPMG.Financial institutions with active fintech venture arms include  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) (MC:BBVA),  Axa  Sa (PA:AXAF), Allianz Se (DE:ALVG) and  Aviva  Plc (L:AV).Northwestern Mutual's new venture fund also comes at a time when investment activity into early-stage insurance technology companies is growing. Early-stage insurance tech companies raised $508 million in 2016, up 56 percent from the previous year, according to CB Insights."

92,"Dec 27, 2016 11:33AM ET",U.S. mutual fund trustees feel the heat of investor lawsuits,nan,"By Ross KerberBOSTON (Reuters) - Before New York's famed 21 Club steakhouse drew attention in November for hosting Donald Trump, the wealthy U.S. president-elect, it quietly fed other public representatives: trustees of Paris-based AXA SA (PA:AXAF) investment funds. The trustees - board members tasked with overseeing AXA funds - had events there and at other ritzy spots, legal records show. A 2011 holiday party at a Del Frisco's restaurant cost $25,775, a $1,000 average for each of roughly 25 people present. ""The wine was very good,"" a trustee recalled of one meal.The trustees' dining experiences emerged in a federal case decided in August. Investors including a teacher and a retired police officer accused the firm of collecting excessive fees, a charge the firm denied.U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan sided with AXA in his 146-page decision, but he wrote the suit had prompted a ""more scrupulous and rigorous"" review of board expenses. One result was to reimburse investors for some of the meal costs.In courts across the land, investors are subjecting mutual fund boards to greater scrutiny. Trustees, often paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, are under pressure to prove they have stood up for shareholders in an industry that has $16 trillion under management.The lawsuits accuse fund boards of missteps such as failing to scrutinize fees or pass along to investors economies of scale as their funds grow with rising markets. The claims illuminate the long obscure role of fund trustees, sometimes known as directors.Despite their compensation and influence, at many fund families these individuals rarely appear before investors and face few official qualification requirements. Many are current or retired executives, attorneys or academics, much the same as at large publicly traded companies.Defendants include large fund managers like BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Pacific Investment Management Co, or Pimco. The fund managers deny wrongdoing. An AXA spokesman declined to comment. FEES A SENSITIVE TOPICIn theory, mutual fund trustees can demand lower fees on the funds or fire the managers who choose the funds' investments. But firings, which investors could see as disruptive, hardly ever happen.A common concern is that the boards are more focused on following technical rules than looking out for shareholder interests, said Stephen Davis, a senior fellow at the Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance.Fees are a sensitive topic for many actively managed mutual funds, which are losing billions of dollars in assets to cheaper index-tracking funds. Even a small reduction in fees can make a big difference for investors who include many U.S. workers whose savings are in 401(k) retirement plans.A 2015 Morningstar study showed that while industry assets increased by 143 percent over a 10-year period, fund fees charged to clients fell only 27 percent while industry fee revenue rose 78 percent, showing companies benefiting from the gains more than their investors.LAWSUITS AGAINST BLACKROCK, PIMCOIn one suit, in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, plaintiffs accuse BlackRock units of benefiting too much as assets of its Global Allocation Fund  more than doubled to about $58 billion at Oct. 31, 2013, from about $23 billion at Oct. 31, 2007. U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson last year denied a BlackRock motion to dismiss, writing that plaintiffs at least had raised enough doubts about fund trustees that there remained ""sufficient allegations that allow for an inference of rubber-stamping by the Boards."" BlackRock defended its boards of trustees. A BlackRock spokesman wrote via email that Global Allocation is priced competitively, adding, ""The suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against the action.""A judge has asked both sides for reports on the discovery process by Jan. 19.A suit in federal court in Seattle compares Pimco's well-known $78 billion Total Return fund  with the $2.3 billion Harbor Bond Fund,  a similar fund Pimco subadvises. The plaintiff cited how Pimco charged holders of Class A shares of Total Return 0.85 percent of fund assets, while investors were charged just 0.53 percent of fund assets to own a comparable Harbor Bond Fund share class. The plaintiff claimed Pimco trustees ""have been subverted by defendants and no longer serve in their 'watchdog' role"" and cited the trustees' generous pay.Pimco argues its board follows a rigorous process and called the comparison to Harbor Bond Fund inapt because its in-house funds can require it to perform additional work and assume additional risks. Last year U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez denied a Pimco motion to dismiss the case, currently awaiting trial. A Pimco spokeswoman declined to comment.Some complaints against directors have been knocked down. In a case against Hartford Funds in Camden, New Jersey, U.S. District Judge Renee Marie Bumb likened claims that Hartford's fund board allowed excessive fees to ""armchair quarterbacking and captious nit-picking."" Closing arguments in the case are set for January. But elsewhere even unsuccessful actions have brought board critiques.In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Gary Feess in 2009 dismissed a challenge to fees at American Funds but wrote the board's oversight process ""seems less a true negotiation and more an elaborate exercise in checking off boxes and papering the file."" An American Funds spokesman said the company in response provided trustees more information about its approach to compensation. Directors were unavailable to comment, he said.For a graphic on fund board compensation, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-FUNDS-FEES/010031442H3/index.html  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

93,"Dec 22, 2016 08:21AM ET",London offices have designs on tech as Brexit puts brake on finance,nan,"By Esha Vaish and Sarah Young(Reuters) - High up in western Europe's tallest skyscraper, an office layout shows how the power balance in London's property market is shifting in favor of booming tech companies and away from finance firms which may shrink in London after the Brexit vote.Some employees of digital marketing agency Jellyfish work from hot desks at The Shard, gathered around a long pine table suggestive of a trendy coffee shop, enjoying views of St Paul's Cathedral. Edged by a bar with a screen displaying train times, floor-to-ceiling whiteboards, cozy sound-proofed booths and a tap dispensing barista-style coffees, the design encourages staff to work together.""We wanted to be taken seriously, not just frittering client money away with crazy guys on roller skates, so this is a serious space,"" said the company's Chief Creative Officer Mark Deeprose. Jellyfish's offices are one sign of how fast-growing tech firms are calling the shots in the London property market, outshining the finance sector which accounts for around 8 percent of British GDP and has long been the cornerstone of the capital's property scene.Property developers are ditching the marble fittings, suspended ceilings and tight rows of desks associated with the grand old banks, replacing them with more spacious irregular offices finished with the brickwork, colorful furniture and exposed wires beloved of tech companies.Since Britons voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, some financial services companies have threatened to move operations to other European capitals over fears that Brexit may prevent them serving EU clients.Tech companies, however, have shrugged off the vote and are expanding in London, with Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) leading the charge, helping property developers with a greater tech exposure to outperform their peers.""Immediately after Brexit no one was doing anything but once we got into August and September, all of the tech firms just seemed to say, well, we're moving on,"" said James Roberts, chief economist at property consultant Knight Frank.According to the broker, rental demand from tech names including Apple (O:AAPL) and WeWork meant that 2.7 million square feet (250,000 square meters) of central London office space were leased in the quarter that followed the June 23 vote, a 15 percent increase on the previous three months.Interest from the likes of Spotify and Deliveroo promises to support future office demand, and UK online fashion retailer ASOS (L:ASOS) has announced plans to expand in London this month, drawn to the city's talent pool and international status.By contrast,  Barclays  (L:BARC) has announced it is sub-letting a quarter of the space in one of its main offices in the Canary Wharf financial district.COFFEE SHOP STYLE For ASOS's expanded and redeveloped London headquarters, it has used software to map how its people use the building to encourage different units to work together. It will also have a quiet library, and a concierge service to help employees with their needs outside work.""(Tech) is an active sector at the moment and we're seeing developers beginning to acknowledge this within the way that they're building,"" said Simon Calvert, senior director of advisory and transaction services at property firm  CBRE  (N:CBG).But the growth in tech may not be enough to fill new commercial property space. The City of London warns that up to 10 percent of jobs in London's financial district may be lost if Britain fails to secure adequate EU access after Brexit. At the same time, London office construction has reached its highest level since 2008, according to Deloitte. British Land  (L:BLND), developer of the ""Cheesegrater"" office tower in London's historic financial district, is reducing the amount of office space it builds without a guaranteed tenant, and is instead refurbishing sites to add more flexible accommodation.It has amended an existing planning consent at a site in Paddington, west London, to introduce features such as sun terraces, a rooftop basketball court and collaborative work spaces that position the building more towards the TMT (technology, media and telecommunications) sectors. ""We'll adapt tactically, but we're confident that's good for the longer term,"" CEO Chris Grigg said, after the firm in November posted a fall in the value of its office portfolio which gets 17 percent of its rent from banks and finance firms and 7 percent from TMT.French insurer AXA's (PA:AXAF) investment management arm has decided to go ahead with a new skyscraper in London's financial district, reversing a decision taken in the wake of the Brexit vote to put the project on ice. Harry Badham, who heads the UK development team at AXA IM – Real Assets, said the 22 Bishopsgate site would aim to attract tech clients with a plan to offer space for an incubator workshop for start-ups where they would charge lower rent.Luring established tech clients requires not just space with an industrial, retro vibe, but also flexible rental deals, said Andrew Sell, commercial director at Real Estate Management (UK), which handles The Shard. ""Whereas before there was an aversion from the owners to have lease breaks, we recognize it's really important for the tech sector because their rate of growth is colossal,"" he said.Software firm  Sage Group  (L:SGE), for example, negotiated at least two breaks in its lease when it moved to The Shard, he said. Sage added extra space less than a year later.Providing tech-friendly offices may also eventually serve to attract financial services firms anyway, said Neil Prime, JLL's (N:JLL) lead director of Central London Markets. ""Ten years ago maybe the banks' model was rack it, stack it and squeeze them in,"" he said. ""(But) the banks are going to be competing with the Googles for these digitally-enabled people, they are going to need to have that (tech-friendly) environment,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

98,"Nov 23, 2016 12:20PM ET","Generali to exit weaker markets, cut costs",nan,"By Stephen Jewkes and Pamela BarbagliaMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's biggest insurer Generali (MI:GASI) is looking to raise at least 1 billion euros ($1.06 billion) by selling businesses in unattractive markets and is to cut costs in an effort to boost profit and capital.Reiterating 2018 targets on Wednesday, Generali said it is reviewing its presence in 13-15 countries and aims to cut operating costs in mature markets by 200 million euros over the 2016-19 period.These plans provide more evidence of how insurers are having to respond to a squeeze on margins between investment income and policyholder returns as a result of low interest rates. This has prompted the likes of Europe's biggest players Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  Axa  (PA:AXAF) to rethink their business models.European insurers got a boost this month from rising bond yields triggered by Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential elections. But uncertainty over a referendum that could unseat prime minister Matteo Renzi is weighing on Italian shares.If yields go up and the spread (between Italian and German 10-year bonds) doesn't widen too much we are much better off,"" Chief Financial Officer Alberto Minali said.Generali shares, which rose sharply on Tuesday after reports by Reuters and business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore of potential job losses, dropped by nearly 4 percent on Wednesday, with some analysts expressing concern over the insurer's dividends.The company denied that it was considering laying off 8,000 workers outside Italy.""This number does not exist ... there are no redundancies or restructuring plans,"" CEO Philippe Donnet told reporters on Wednesday.Donnet later told analysts there could be a reduction in headcount in coming years in countries without strong enough growth rates through slower hiring, natural attrition and restructuring plans.The group's headcount of about 76,000 had already fallen by 1,500 since March from slower hiring rates and staff departures, he said. Generali, which generates most of its revenue and earnings in Italy, France and Germany, did not specify the markets it is considering leaving, though broker Intermonte said that South American or Benelux countries could be among the candidates.Donnet, who took the helm when Mario Greco left to join rival Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN) in March, said Generali was aiming for a 15 percent productivity boost by 2019. ""Our goal is leadership in our chosen markets, not measured by size but by profitability,"" he said.REINVESTINGEurope's third-largest insurer said its strategy was not based on mergers and acquisitions but it is open to reinvesting the 1 billion euros from disposals if the right opportunity came along. Donnet said the group was interested in small and mid-sized companies easy to integrate and run in markets where Generali was already strong but said the group was in no rush to buy.Asked about the controlling stake in asset management division  Banca Generali  (MI:BGN), he said the insurer had no plans to sell down its stake.The company, which gave no details on solvency capital targets, said it intended to change the business mix of its life operations by shifting to more capital-light products.Generali is more focused than its main rivals on capital-intensive traditional life products rather than unit-linked or index-linked policies.It stuck to its targets to generate more than 7 billion euros in cash by 2018 and pay more than 5 billion euros in dividends. The company currently has a dividend payout ratio of 55-60 percent, Minali said.Analysts at Intermonte said its own dividend estimates were below the targets given by Generali. ""We believe consensus could be revised downwards,"" they said.Generali shares closed down 3 percent, among the worst performers on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

100,"Nov 21, 2016 07:20PM ET",Startup Trov aims to disrupt insurance with the swipe of an app,nan,"By John McCrank(Reuters) - The on-demand economy, which uses smartphone technology to immediately fill consumer needs, has changed the way people order food, a car, or a place to stay. Now, technology startups are targeting the next business frontier - insurance - offering coverage with the swipe of an app.Trov, a San Francisco Bay Area firm that provides smartphone-based on-demand insurance for individual assets, like computers or cameras, for any duration, launched in the United Kingdom on Tuesday, backed by insurance firm AXA SA (PA:AXAF).""We literally track risk to the second so when you turn something on, it turns it on to the second and then it prices your usage to the second should you want to turn it off,"" Scott Walchek, Trov's chief executive officer, said in an interview last week. ""It's literally the same swipe right to turn it on, swipe left to turn it off."" The multitrillion-dollar dollar insurance industry is poised to be transformed ""beyond recognition"" by new technologies like artificial intelligence, new payment systems, drones and blockchain, CommerzVentures GmbH said in a white paper in March.""Effectively cooperating with startups may be the only way for incumbent insurers to fend off potential competitors such as Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Facebook (O:FB) and other non-traditional players,"" said CommerzVentures, the fintech venture capital fund of CommerzBank (DE:CBKG).Trov has been doing business in Australia for the past five months in partnership with Suncorp Group Ltd (AX:SUN) and plans to launch next year in the United States, where it has teamed up with Munich Re (DE:MUVGn), Walchek said.Trov's main users are millennials who live ""untethered"" lifestyles, meaning they might work from home or from a coffee shop with their laptop, which they want to protect, Walchek said.The firm started with electronics and photography equipment coverage in the UK, and will add other insurance categories going forward, such as sporting goods, Walchek said.The insurance industry has been slow to adopt new, potentially disruptive technologies, in part because it is subject to moral hazard and adverse selection, said Erik Brynjolfsson, professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.""Meaning that one party may know information that the other doesn't and markets tend to break down in those situations,"" he said in an interview.Technology firms' ability to mine vast amounts of web-based data, along with the type of ratings systems used by firms like Airbnb and Uber to verify trustworthiness and reliability, may help insurers overcome those barriers, he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

104,"Nov 07, 2016 02:46PM ET",HSBC investors fear timetable to find new bosses is slipping,nan,"By Sinead Cruise and Simon JessopLONDON (Reuters) - Some major shareholders in HSBC (L:HSBA) want the bank to give greater reassurance on succession-planning for its chairman and chief executive, concerned that a timetable for replacing veterans Douglas Flint and Stuart Gulliver may be slipping.Three of four top-20 shareholders interviewed by Reuters said they were worried a revamp of the bank's long-serving leadership had been knocked off course by several competing demands, denting hopes for a speedy refresh of HSBC's culture and strategy.Europe's biggest bank said in March that it had begun searching for a new chairman and pledged to nominate a successor to 61-year old Douglas Flint during 2017. The new chairman would oversee selection of a successor to 57-year-old CEO Stuart Gulliver, who is expected to leave in 2018, it said.But six months on, the investors said the lack of a progress update had started to cause concern, with some suggesting the board had been tied up with navigating the economic slowdown in Asia, investor consultations on its 2017 executive pay plans and the recent appointment of Clara Furse to chair its UK retail business.They also said they felt that it was looking less likely that former  Axa  (PA:AXAF) boss Henri de Castries -- widely regarded as frontrunner for the chairman role when he joined HSBC's board in March -- would take the job. They cited speculation among investors and market players that de Castries is keen to take up a role in French politics after the presidential election in the spring. The three shareholders who expressed concern about the succession process declined to be named because they are in continuing dialogue with the company.Their views suggest the bank's challenging task of finding a chairman and CEO within two years has become a source of concern among some of its biggest investors.'GET IT RIGHT'Yet James Laing, fund manager at top-10 investor Aberdeen Asset Management, said his firm believes that Gulliver and his team are doing a good job and patience is needed.Aberdeen would ideally like Gulliver to remain at the helm, said Laing. But if he is to leave, Laing said that an internal candidate would be preferable.""I accept that there are some investors who want to have an external CEO candidate. Fine, but it had better be the right external candidate and with banking experience, because if he or she doesn't, that's not acceptable,"" Laing said. ""He or she would need to be an outstanding candidate as, currently, for us it makes sense for HSBC to look for an internal candidate.""In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Gulliver said the bank remained on course to appoint a successor to Flint ""at some point during 2017"". When asked about investor concerns about the succession process, he said he hoped to update shareholders early in the new year, without giving further details. He was speaking after the bank reported a rise in profit but warned of a dim outlook for its British business next year because of slowing economic growth as a result of the vote to leave the European Union. It gave little detail on how its chairman search was progressing.De Castries did not respond to requests for comment via his personal secretary. LONG-SERVINGThe replacement of Flint and Gulliver represents a big shift for HSBC. The pair have more than 55 years of service between them and held several management roles with the company before rising to their current positions about six years ago. Roiled by swelling costs, spiralling pay packets and a number of regulatory and strategic missteps, investors have hoped for fresh blood for several years, concerned that the duo were too entrenched to address some long-standing problems. They include a long-awaited cultural revamp to move from higher-risk banking to more measured and sustainable lending, as well as the group's high costs and uncertain position in the United States. The three investors with concerns about the succession said that the planned process could deter candidates for chairman because the new person would have to make the crucial decision of choosing a new CEO while learning the ropes.After a meeting with Sam Laidlaw, chairman of HSBC's Group Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee, one shareholder raised the subject of switching the order of the new appointments so that Flint could lead the CEO selection process.While HSBC has pledged to break from tradition and appoint an external candidate as chairman, investors and sources within the bank broadly expect the new CEO to come from within.With this in mind, appointing a new CEO might be an easier and faster process if led by someone more familiar with the skills and abilities of the top executives, the shareholder said.However, Gulliver told Reuters such a switch of appointment timing would be unlikely, because it could fan governance concerns.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

121,"Sep 12, 2016 02:20PM ET",Lloyd's of London has lined up of would-be joiners: chairman,nan,"By Carolyn CohnMONACO (Reuters) - The Lloyd's of London  insurance market has a lined up of companies wanting to join, Chairman John Nelson said on Monday, even as Britain's vote to leave the European Union casts doubt over its European business.Nelson said last week that Lloyd's, the world's leading specialty insurance market, would have to operate some business from the EU after Brexit if Britain fails to keep so-called passporting rights for financial companies to sell products across the bloc.A decision on where those operations might be based has yet to be made, but the Brexit uncertainty has not deterred would-be entrants to the market, Nelson told Reuters at the reinsurance industry's annual meeting in Monte Carlo.""The pipeline of people wanting to join the Lloyd's platform is still very healthy,"" he said. ""There are quite a few who'd like to come on, it's a very attractive platform.""Recent entrants have come from Brazil, China, Mexico, the United States. From inside the EU, France's AXA (PA:AXA) joined this year as part of its effort to expand in Africa in areas such as political risk.Nelson did not name any potential newcomers but said they covered a broad geographical spread and comprised businesses looking to set up new operations or buy one of the market's existing 90 or so syndicates.Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) could be one such acquirer and is reported to be in talks to buy U.S. insurer AIG's (N:AIG) Lloyd's operations.About 11 percent of the 25 billion pounds ($33.28 billion) in gross written premiums at Lloyd's last year came from the EU, though Nelson said that some of that was reinsurance business, which is less dependent on passporting rights.While Nelson thinks there is a ""good chance"" that Britain will lose its passporting rights, he also believes that some agreement can still be reached because European companies want to continue selling their products in Britain.""A lot of EU businesses are on exactly the same page as we are,"" he said.($1 = 0.7513 pounds)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""In this environment, the 'double-hit' scenario cannot be ruled out, EIOPA said, referring to the prospects for insurers to be hit simultaneously by a rise in the value of their future liabilities and a drop in the value of assets held to meet those liabilities.EIOPA Chairman Gabriel Bernardino warned that particularly for occupational pensions funds, prudential regimes might be underestimating the risks. EIOPA has made recommendations to improve clarity in this area, he said.The regulator is currently conducting stress tests of how well the insurance sector can respond to financial stress.Big, diversified insurers such as Allianz (DE:ALVG),  Axa  (PA:AXAF) and Generali (MI:GASI) are seen as financially robust but smaller life insurers are seen as vulnerable the longer interest rates stay low.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

143,"May 23, 2016 05:30AM ET",Insurer AXA to pull out of tobacco investments ,nan,"By James Regan and Martinne GellerPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) plans to stop investing in the tobacco industry, citing the impact of smoking on public health, and said it plans to sell its 1.8 billion euros ($2.02 billion) of assets in the sector.AXA said it would divest its 200 million euros of equity holdings in tobacco companies immediately. It plans to stop all new investments in tobacco industry corporate bonds and to run off its existing holdings worth about 1.6 billion euros.""With this divestment from tobacco, we are doing our share to support the efforts of governments around the world,"" incoming AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said in a statement on Monday.It is the latest in a string of setbacks for Big Tobacco, whose profit margins provide strong returns despite Western countries' ongoing decline in smoking rates.""This decision has a cost for us, but the case for divestment is clear: the human cost of tobacco is tragic; its economic cost is huge,"" Buberl said.AXA said that tobacco kills six million people a year and that the figure is expected to rise to eight million by 2030, mostly in developing countries. The cost to society is greater than that of alcohol or obesity, the company said.The move comes as countries around the world are cracking down. Last week, new tobacco packaging laws went into effect in the European Union, while the United States banned the sale of cigars to minors.AXA is not the first investor to ditch tobacco, though a spokeswoman said she believed it was the first global insurer to do so.The decision reflects a shift in the role of health insurers toward preventing health conditions, AXA said, including increased use of technology.The head of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) said it would continue to encourage other companies to follow AXA's lead.""We need companies like AXA to signal that investing in an industry that kills its customers is simply the wrong thing to do,"" UICC Chief Executive Cary Adams said.""This announcement to divest 1.8 billion euros is a milestone step in the right direction.""The AXA spokeswoman declined to say which tobacco companies' stocks and bonds it owned, but said the holdings were longstanding and a small part of its general accounts.AXA shares were up 0.5 percent by 0853 GMT, broadly in line with the European sector (SXIP).Shares of  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB), two of the largest tobacco companies, were flat."

HSBC said last week that it had begun to look for a replacement for Flint and expected to nominate someone in 2017.""I think Henri de Castries is quite likely to replace Flint, (I) have been hearing that for the last nine months,"" one HSBC shareholder told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.""He is in a learning phase now and could step up next year"".HSBC said the bank did not comment on speculation.De Castries tried to dampen the speculation, saying that people should not turn the timing of the announcement of management changes at AXA and HSBC into an ""event"".AXA SPLITS TOP JOBSIncoming CEO Buberl is expected to focus on shareholder returns and changes in digital technology, a London-based analyst said. Shares in AXA were up 1.1 percent at 1140 GMT.The announcement of Buberl's elevation represents a generational shift at the insurer, where chief executives normally serve for at least 10 years.But the move also retains some continuity of management. AXA said it will split the chairmanship role from that of chief executive. The current deputy CEO in charge of finance Denis Duverne, 62, will replace Castries as chairmanBuberl would be a rare foreign boss among leading French companies. He was born in the German town of Wuppertal and educated in Germany, Britain, and Switzerland.Since joining AXA in 2012, he has headed the group's life and savings business as well as its health line. Previously he worked at the Winterthur group, which was acquired by AXA in 2006, and Zurich Insurance Group.($1 = 0.8881 euros)"

158,"Oct 27, 2015 06:29PM ET",Life insurers admit to offering 'kickbacks': Senator Warren ,nan,"(Reuters) - Senator Elizabeth Warren said 13 major U.S. life insurers had admitted to using incentives such as expensive vacations and gifts, which could encourage agents ""to put their own interests ahead of their clients.""The senator had launched an investigation into 15 major annuity providers in April amid concerns about the ""kickbacks"" they offered to brokers who peddle products to retirees.Warren voiced her concern about the loopholes in law that allows some advisers to steer customers into complex financial products for higher rewards. ""Research suggests that this loophole costs Americans an estimated $17 billion every year,"" she said in a report released by her office on Tuesday.Annuity providers, including American International Group Inc (N:AIG), offer anything from luxury cruises, trips to Tahiti, Costa Rica or Rome, creating conflicts of interest, Massachusetts Democrat Warren said. ""Companies shouldn't be allowed to offer expensive vacations, prizes and other kickbacks to agents in exchange for selling costly, second-rate investment products to unsuspecting customers,"" Senator Warren said in the report. The report was based on responses from 15 companies to letters asking for information on whether they offered non-cashincentives.Annuities are popular among retirees because they can offer a steady stream of income. There are a variety of types, including some that provide a guaranteed payout and others whose payout is pegged to the performance of underlying securities.Earlier, the U.S. Labor Department proposed new rules to curb conflicts of interest that could lead brokers to steer retirees into less-than-ideal investments.Companies mentioned in her report include,  Prudential  (L:PRU) Annuities (N:PRU), Jackson National Life, Lincoln Financial Group (N:LNC), Allianz Life Insurance Co (DE:ALVG), TIAA-CREF, New York Life, Transamerica, AXA USA (PA:AXAF), Nationwide, Pacific Life, Forethought Annuity, RiverSource Life Insurance and Security Benefit Life.Prudential's spokeswoman said the company had received the report and was reviewing it, while TIAA-CREF said ""as a matter of policy (it) does not engage in product-based incentives.""Jackson National spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that it does not offer any of the non-cash incentives described in Senator Warren's letter or in the report issued by her office.AIG, New York Life, Lincoln Financial, Allianz Life Insurance, Transamerica, AXA USA, Nationwide, Pacific Life, Forethought Annuity, RiverSource Life Insurance and Security Benefit Life were not immediately available to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

191,"Dec 07, 2014 04:09AM ET",African insurers in vogue as incomes rise ,nan,"By Carolyn Cohn and Helen Nyambura-MwauraLONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A growing middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is enticing European and South African insurers to buy local firms focussing mainly on life insurance and pensions, in the face of mature markets and strong competition at home.Rapid economic growth in countries such as Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria has increased the number of people with money to spend on insurance to protect their wealth, while regulatory changes are encouraging the growth of domestic savings and pensions.Several major companies, including Swiss Re (VX:SRENH), Prudential (L:PRU) and Sanlam (J:SLMJ), are buying insurers in Africa, with the focus on life and pensions products in the more economically advanced sub-Saharan countries.Notwithstanding the challenges, the race is definitely on. David Hodnett, Barclays Africa's deputy CEO, told a banking conference in Johannesburg in November: ""Every insurer that you look at has probably about five or six suitors.""A Standard Bank report published in August said while the size of the ""middle class"" in sub-Saharan Africa may have been overstated in some studies, growth rates were nevertheless dramatic.Its study of 11 sub-Saharan economies concluded the ""middle class"" had risen from 4.6 million to 15 million since 2000 and would be over 40 million by 2030, with Africa's biggest economy Nigeria leading the way.Insurance penetration, or premiums written as a percentage of gross domestic product, was 11.5 percent in Britain in 2013 but just 0.6 percent in Nigeria. For life insurance, penetration was 8.8 percent versus 0.2 percent, according to Swiss Re data.Life insurance premium volume in dollar terms rose 18.6 percent last year in Kenya, 13.8 in Angola and 13.5 in Nigeria, compared with a 3.9 percent rise in Britain, the data showed.""The level of life products and penetration is very low,"" said Davinder Sikand, head of Africa at private equity firm Abraaj. ""There are a lot of opportunities to develop products to fit the needs of the people.""One of the latest deals was French insurer AXA's (PA:AXAF) $250 million purchase last month of a majority stake in Nigeria's Mansard Insurance, which offers life and general insurance.South Africa-focused companies such as Old Mutual (L:OML) and Liberty (J:LBHJ) are also eager to expand in the life market in sub-Saharan Africa.LeapFrog Investments, which invests in financial services in emerging markets, launched its second Africa and Asia fund in September while British insurer Prudential (L:PRU) has bought life insurers in Kenya and Ghana this year.HARD TO REACHInsurance specialists say middle-class and lower middle-class customers in Africa are not as affluent as developed-world middle classes, tend to be harder to reach and can require a larger use of face-to-face agents.The numbers in the Standard Bank survey are based on households that consume more than $15 a day.A shortage of skilled insurance staff, fragmentation of the market across a large number of countries with many small insurance firms and regulatory hurdles present more obstacles.""It's quite challenging, a lot of work is required,"" said Frank O'Neill, head of Middle East and Africa at Swiss Re. ""It's not as straightforward as if you look at Brazil: one single country.""Getting regulatory approval can take more than a year for each new company bought, and frameworks differ from country to country, industry specialists say.""Wherever you go there are new regulations to learn and comply with,"" said Victor Muguto, head of insurance for consultancy PwC in Africa.""There are shortages of staff in some of the countries, experienced staff are not always easy to come by,"" he said.Would-be insurance buyers will also need to do their homework to work out which of the many local insurers offer the most value. Profits across the board in Kenya's insurance sector, for example, rose 24 percent last year, but that covers nearly 50 companies.Insurers are more likely to do well if they partner with banks, said Dudu Tembo, portfolio manager at wealth manager Citadel Investment Services, as ""the challenge has been issues around distribution"".Reinsurance, or sharing the burden of insurance risk, is another growth area, for instance for energy projects in countries such as Angola or Mozambique. An Africa-focused reinsurance company, One Re, launched last month.(Graphic by Vincent Flasseur; editing by David Clarke)"
192,"Dec 01, 2014 06:30AM ET",EU watchdog expects quick action from insurer stress tests,nan,"By Jonathan Gould FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Union's insurance watchdog said on Monday it expected rapid action from insurers and supervisors to address weaknesses in capital and business models it had identified in a series of stress tests. In findings released on Sunday, the independent body said nearly one in four European insurers could have trouble meeting obligations to policyholders in coming years if the era of wafer-thin interest rates continues. ""From now until the end of next year, we are going to see a flow of actions - possibly capital in some situations - but also other types of balance sheet management,"" Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), told a news conference. Unlike the European Central Bank's stress tests for the banking sector, completed in October and prompting capital raisings by lenders, EIOPA did not release the names of individual companies that fell short in its tests. Bernardino also played down prospects that financial markets would try to pressure insurers to raise capital. ""We don't have the expectation that the market will want to close the gap immediately,"" Bernardino said. National insurance supervisors would use the stress test results to home in on weaker insurers, seeking to correct mismatches in their assets and liabilities, reviewing their product mixes and risk management and encouraging changes to their business models, he said. In its report, EIOPA said 24 percent of insurers would not meet its solvency capital requirement (SCR), a key regulatory threshold, in a ""Japanese-like"" scenario of prolonged low interest rates. ""A continuation of the current low yield conditions could see some insurers having problems in fulfilling their promises to policy holders in 8-11 years' time,"" the watchdog said. ECB interest rates are effectively at zero, with further easing of credit conditions under preparation. Low yields on relatively safe government and covered bonds hurt insurers' investment income, making it increasingly difficult to meet future obligations to policy holders. The companies most at risk were those with a mismatch in the maturity of their assets and liabilities and life insurers that had given long-term guaranteed interest rates on savings policies, it said, pointing to insurers in Austria, Germany, Malta and Sweden as showing the biggest vulnerability. DOUBLE-HIT SCENARIO EIOPA calculated a baseline for its tests using insurance capital safety rules known as Solvency II, which take effect in January 2016. That baseline showed the sector was generally well capitalised, though some firms came up short even before the stress test scenarios. ""Nevertheless, 14 percent of the companies, representing 3 percent of total assets, had an SCR (solvency capital requirement) ratio below 100 percent,"" EIOPA said. Industry observers say big diversified insurers such as Allianz (DE:ALVG), Axa (PA:AXAF) and Generali (MI:GASI) are well prepared for Solvency II rules. Smaller firms appeared more at risk in its most severe ""double-hit"" stress scenario, involving a drop in asset values combined with a rise in the value of future obligations. EIOPA said 60 insurance groups and 107 individual companies took part in its core stress test, representing 55 percent of premiums at the EU level. Companies from all 28 EU member states, plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland were involved.  (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt) "
193,"Sep 13, 2014 08:20AM ET",Reinsurers flock to Monte Carlo as market storm brews,nan,"By Jonathan Gould MONACO (Reuters) - For a financial sector posting a double-digit rise in earnings and boasting large cash piles, reinsurers sure see a lot of storm clouds on the horizon.That's because they are facing what many see as an unprecedented problem: an abundance of reinsurance supply coupled with a lack of demand from insurance company clients that is driving up competition among reinsurers and driving down prices for all of them.The gloomy outlook has pressured the share prices of the world's top reinsurers this year and the frustration of normally staid industry executives - who gather this weekend at the Mediterranean resort of Monte Carlo for their annual jamboree - is palpable.""I am disappointed, exasperated, and even rather appalled by what is happening in the market,"" said Nikolaus von Bomhard, chief executive of the world's biggest reinsurer, Munich Re.""I've been in the business long enough to be able to say: this is bad news,"" he told a news conference last month.Looking at reinsurers' current profits, things might seem fine.The world's 31 top reinsurers - whose business is to help insurers pay big damage claims for disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes in exchange for part of the premium - posted a 12 percent rise in net income to $14 billion in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to insurance broker Aon Benfield.Unusually low payouts for natural catastrophes in recent years have also bolstered the bottom line, contributing to a rise in the amount of capital available for reinsurers to act as insurance companies to insurance companies - which Aon Benfield said increased by 6 percent to $570 billion at the end of June from the end of December.On top of the big cash piles held by reinsurers such as Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re, outsiders have also been muscling in.Capital market investors such as pension, hedge and sovereign wealth funds as well as wealthy individuals, looking for higher returns than they can find on government or corporate bonds, have been pouring money into the reinsurance market via specialized investment vehicles.PRICE WARAs if that were not enough, insurers like Allianz, Axa and Zurich are feeling financially stronger and more capable of retaining risk, prompting them to cut back on the amount of reinsurance protection they buy.With the market shrinking, many reinsurers have been forced into successive rounds of price cuts or have granted improved terms and conditions to their customers to protect market share.Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's sees prices on average down by 5-10 percent this year and next, with smaller and non-diversified reinsurers having the toughest time.""Those who aren't able to defend their competitive positions and their bottom lines could struggle to survive,"" said S&P analyst Dennis Sugrue.Consolidation among smaller players has long been predicted but little has come to pass so far. Market observers predict the internecine price war is unlikely to come to an end any time soon and share prices will remain under pressure.The STOXX Europe 600 insurance index, which includes insurers and reinsurers, has risen by 4.8 percent since January - however this has been driven by insurers, with many reinsurers having lost ground.Munich Re's shares have fallen by 2.4 percent and No.2 player Swiss Re's by 1.2 percent. French reinsurer Scor is down nearly 10 percent so far this year.Faced with a difficult reinsurance market, big reinsurers are choosing to boost dividends and buy back their own shares, a move that credit rating agencies say makes sense.""Returning capital to shareholders reduces the pressure to do something that has higher risk,"" said Moody's analyst Stan Rouyer.""This is the right time to return capital to shareholders.""(Editing by Pravin Char)"

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday,
led by banks after European finance ministers agreed to
safeguard the region's lenders, and  as investors snapped up
bargains following three days of losses.	 Stocks rose across the board, with the STOXX Europe 600
Banking Index up 2.4 percent, though it is still down
more than 35 percent in 2011. Heavyweight risers included BNP
Paribas and Credit Agricole , both up 6.8
percent. 	 At 0829 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 	
European shares was up 1.6 percent at 902.24 points, having gone
as high as 907.74, after falling 2.7 percent on Tuesday. The
index has lost more than 19 percent in 2011.	 ""This rally may not last. Lots of stocks look cheap. We need
a strategy for resolving the sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone. We need s strategy to get on top of the U.S. debt
problem,"" Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley,
said.	 ""Until we get answers, the market can stay cheap. Economic
authorities in Europe have continually failed to come up with a
robust policy. Now they're in the last chance saloon.""	 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to safeguard
their banks as doubts grew about whether a planned second
bailout package for debt-laden Greece would go ahead.	 Hours earlier French-Belgian municipal lender Dexia
 became the first European bank to have to be bailed
out due to the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis. 
 	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX 	
 and France's CAC40 rose between 1.8 and 2.2
percent. 	 Italy's benchmark rose 1.2 percent, despite Moody's
lowering its rating on Italy's bonds by three notches, saying it
saw a ""material increase"" in funding risks for euro zone
countries with high levels of debt and warning that further
downgrades were possible. 	  WEAK ECONOMIC BACKDROP	 The market maintained gains despite some weak economic data.
  	 The euro zone's private sector contracted for the first time
in two years last month, shrinking faster than first reported as
new business dried up, while the debt crisis cut expectations
for the future to two-year lows, surveys showed. 	 ""The data highlights the damage that the mixed messages and
the prevarication are doing to sentiment across the euro zone,
with leaders that can't decide on a co-ordinated response to 
the crisis,""  Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets,
said. 	 The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index rose 3
percent, as copper prices rebounded. 	 Fortunes contrasted for British supermarkets. J Sainsbury
 , Britain's No.3 grocer, rose 4.3 percent after posting
an expected rise in second-quarter underlying sales, as store
extensions and growth in convenience stores, online and non-food
ranges helped it to overcome tough trading conditions.
 	 Tesco however fell 0.2 percent after posting one of
its biggest-ever falls in underlying sales 	
 	 French insurer AXA rose 4.7 percent after saying
it was fully committed to delivering its mid-term earnings
targets and its balance sheet was ""robust"" despite the market
environment. 	 Later, the ADP jobs report in the United States will give
pointers on the strength of the recovery in the world's biggest
economy.

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - European shares hit their lowest
in more than two years on Monday, as investors fretted
policymakers were not acting to address a deepening euro zone
crisis that may see Greece default on its debts.	 French shares extended losses after an explosion at a French
 nuclear site.  	 Adding to the gloom was the failure of the weekend's meeting
of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised
nations to come up with fresh proposals for boosting global
growth.  	 ""There was hope there would be something more resolute out
of the G7 meeting over the weekend,"" said Ian King, head of
international equities at Legal & General, which has 356 billion
pounds ($566 billion) under management.	 ""And there are German politicians saying they need to
organise an orderly Greek default. Clearly, the rhetoric is
stepping up in Germany. They're getting fed up with the
periphery. 	 ""My view is that if there is to be a default or
restructuring in Greece, you would get a crystallisation. But
there's a lack of certainty, which is the enemy of markets.""	 Stocks fell across the board, with banks the standout
losers. The STOXX Europe 600 banking sector index fell 4
percent and hit a 29-month low. 	 French bank shares tumbled on concern about their exposure
to Greek and Italian sovereign debt, as well as a possible
downgrade by Moody's credit rating service, and talk of partial
nationalisation.  	 Heavyweight BNP Paribas fell 13.4 percent, with
volume at more than 105 percent of the 30-day average. 	 Societe Generale slumped 8.9 percent. SocGen
shares have fallen more than 60 percent in 2011, pushing its
market value below 13 billion euros ($17.8 billion). It will be
ejected from the STOXX Europe 50 Index at the end of
this week. 	 At 1158 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was down 3.3 percent at 885.56 points, and
had gone as low as 883.04, its lowest since July 2009. 	 The index has lost more than 20 percent in 2011. Investors
have cut their exposure to risky assets such as stocks following
an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis, and weak economic
data from major economies, sparking recession worries.	 The index fell 2.6 percent on Friday after the European
Central Bank's German board member Juergen Stark quit amid
disagreements over its policy of helping out troubled euro zone
nations by buying up their sovereign bonds, highlighting
divisions within the ECB on the handling of Europe's debt woes.	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 2.5 percent;
Germany's DAX shed 3.5 percent and went below 5,000
before recovering; and France's CAC40 dived 4.7 percent.	 An explosion at the nuclear site of Marcoule injured four
people, France's ASN nuclear safety watchdog said, but police
said there was no risk of contamination. 	  TOUGH REGULATION	 Insurers, exposed to the equities market, were another major
casualty. The STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index fell 4.6
percent, and French heavyweight Axa tumbled 10.3
percent. 	 But Britain's banks outperformed, with investors feeling the
effect of new regulations was already in the price, after recent
steep falls.	 The banks face some of the world's toughest regulation under
reforms outlined on Monday which require them to insulate their
retail lending activities and store billions in extra capital at
a cost of up to 7 billion pounds. 	 However, Barclays fell 0.5 percent. 	 Back in the wider market, technical analysts were bearish on
the outlook.  	 ""The situation for euro-denominated stocks is actually a
good deal worse than the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is indicating,"" said
Bill McNamara, technical analyst at Charles Stanley. 	  On the DAX, he said: ""There is precious little in the chart
to suggest that a bottom is in place ... If it breaks lower from
here the next area of possible support is all the way down at
4,570 or so.""	 Strategists said the wider macroeconomic and political
picture would continue to preoccupy investors, despite some
equities looking very cheap after the sell-off. 	 ""Valuations don't work when you've got such extreme
uncertainties,"" King said. 	 ""We would expect policymakers to stimulate the economy, but
they are finding it difficult to reach common,"" said Veronika
Pechlaner, a fund manager on the Ashburton European equity fund.	 ""The longer they wait, the more difficult it will be, and
that is what the market is looking at.""	 Greece must decide for itself whether to leave the euro
zone, but Athens cannot expect further aid unless it enacts
reforms, a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Conservatives said on Monday.  	 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default rose to record levels for Greece and Portugal. 	(Additional reporting by Joanne Frearson; Editing by David

 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - European equities fell heavily on
Friday as traders took risk off the table ahead of a key report
on the U.S. labour market that may indicate whether the world's
biggest economy is headed for a recession.	 Sagging consumer confidence likely discouraged already
skittish U.S. businesses from stepping up hiring in August,
economist shave forecast, which would keep pressure on the U.S.
Federal Reserve to provide more stimulus to aid the economy.	 The non-farm payroll likely increased by 75,000 jobs,
according to a Reuters survey, after rising 117,000 in July. The
Labor Department will release the report at 1230
GMT. 	 However, more recent estimates indicated a lower reading. 	 ""Were it to be a very small number, that would confirm the
picture of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy,"" said Andy
Lynch, fund manager at Schroders, which manages 197 billion
pounds.	 ""If it's 110,000 or zero then it has significance. If it is
a few thousand away from forecasts, that is random noise.""	
 	 European stocks fell across the board, snapping a four-day
rally that had seen a key index rise 5.9 percent.	 The heavyweight financial sector came under renewed
pressure, with Greek banks down 5.1 percent after the
country said on Thursday it would miss its budget deficit
target.	 Talks between Greece and inspectors from the European Union,
International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank on whether
it has met conditions for a new aid tranche have been put on
hold, a Greek official said. 	 The STOXX Europe 600 banking index fell 2.8 percent,
weighed by a New York Times report a lawsuit was being prepared
to be filed against big U.S. banks such as Bank of America
 and Goldman Sachs .	 The report said investors fear that if banks were forced to
pay out billions for mortgages that defaulted, the suit could
sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across
the financial services industry.	 Deutsche Bank  fell 4.8 percent. 	 At 1101 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares was down 1.9 percent at 955.01 points. The index
fell 10.6 percent in August and is down 14 percent this year,
with recent economic data raising fears about a recession.	 Volumes were low, at less than 29 percent of the index's
90-day average. Giles Watts, Head of Equities at City Index said
investors were looking to minimise risk ahead of the payroll
figures.	 Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis
Global Markets in Brussels, said: ""Despite the fact we recently
got some better than expected economic releases, recession fears
are dominating the markets.  The U.S. jobs report, the mother of
all economic releases, will be quite important. A weak figure
may bring QE3 a step closer,"" he said.	   INSURERS, LUXURY FIRMS FALL 	  Insurers were also weak. British group Aviva fell
3.5 percent, after it was downgraded by Collins Stewart. 	 ""While little appears settled in the euro zone, we think
that a period of prolonged low long bond yields is a more likely
threat to the composite insurance sector than a government debt
default,"" Collins Stewart said.	 Others to fall included Axa , down 3.9 percent. 	 Shares in Swiss-based luxury goods companies Richemont
 and Swatch fell 4.1 percent and 3.9 percent
respectively, after HSBC cut target prices in the sector, citing
concern about the economic backdrop. 	 Technical analysts said the Euro STOXX 50 , the
euro zone's blue-chip index, could fall back towards the 2,170
area where it had trendline support connecting the recent lows.
The index was down 2.8 percent at 2,240.75 points.	 ""It looks like the damage done in July and August will
likely resonate for many months to come. Although it is going
sideways at the moment, it is going sideways at lower levels and
ultimately that does not bode well for the index,"" said Phil
Roberts, chief European technical strategist at Barclays
Capital.

 By Harpreet Bhal	 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply to
four-month lows on Tuesday, as jitters intensified that the
deepening euro zone debt crisis could spread to larger economies
such as Italy and Spain, putting at risk the region's financial
stability.	 By 1046 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was down 1.7 percent at 1,079.20 points,
having earlier dropped to a low of 1,068.92 -- its lowest
intraday level since mid March when the market hit a low for the
year.	 Investors worried that the debt crisis that has so far
forced bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal could spread to
larger economies such as Italy, which has one of the largest
public debts in the world.	 Risk aversion prevailed as policymakers struggled to prevent
the debt crisis from spreading. Euro zone finance ministers
promised longer debt maturities and a more flexible rescue fund
to help Greece and other EU debtors, but they set no deadline to
act. 	 ""The euro zone is in real difficulty and with Italy and
Spain coming under pressure, it becomes evident that the current
strategy to buy governments time to reform by countries lending
money to each other has its limits,"" said Tammo Greetfeld,
equity strategist at UniCredit Group.	 Banks were among the most vulnerable to the sell-off as
investors worried about the sector's exposure to peripheral euro
zone debt. The STOXX Europe 600 shed 1.7 percent to
leave it down nearly 14 percent so far this year.	 Italian banks Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit
 , however, reversed earlier falls to trade 2.3 and 2.6
percent higher after Italy sold its targeted 6.75 billion euros
of 12-month bills, although yields soared. 	 Italy's FTSE MIB also pared losses to trade 0.3
percent lower. Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit have fallen 15 and 
19 percent respectively since the beginning of the month.	 ""It is very difficult to see what policymakers can do (to
shift market sentiment) besides governments trying to push
through reforms in their own countries, but all this needs time
to be able to show positive results,"" Greetfeld said.	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX
 and Spain's IBEX fell 1.5 to 2.1 percent.	 Technical problems at NYSE Euronext  forced
the stock market operator to suspend the dissemination of levels
for its key European stock indexes, affecting France's CAC-40
 , Amsterdam's AEX , Belgium's BEL 20 and
Portugal's PSI 20 .	  INSURERS FALL	 European insurance stocks fell 2.1 percent to a
seven-month low, with the sector taking a hit from mounting
concerns over the euro zone debt crisis as insurers typically
hold large volumes of government debt. 	 Ageas was down 3.6 percent in heavy trade which
represented around 254 percent of its average 90-day trading
volume. ING , Allianz and Axa fell
between 2.7 and 3.4 percent.	 Strategists said the weight of recent macroeconomic events
could lead to a volatile summer trading period, with euro zone
debt concerns, disappointing labour market data from the United
States last week and expectations of further policy tightening
in China adding to uncertainty over the outlook for equities in
the medium-term.  	 ""We are currently being hit by a tsunami of bad news from
three time zones -- the disappointing economic figures out of
the U.S., the slowdown in China and the troubles in the euro
zone. Enough elements are on the table to continue the nervous
and volatile summer,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at
BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.

fifth straight day on Tuesday, with investors worried by slowing
economic growth and the euro zone peripheral debt crisis. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
fell 0.1 percent to 1,104.05 points, the lowest close since
mid-March. It has lost 3.3 percent in the five sessions in June.
 ""Equity markets can easily see another 10 percent drop from
here, and that would be my buying opportunity. The sovereign
debt issue has still not been addressed by politicians. All
we're doing with these bailouts is putting off the inevitable,""
said David Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Brothers, which has
15.2 billion pounds under management. Greek shares  lost 2 percent with Greek banks
 down 3.7 percent. Europe must take tough decisions before the IMF can release
its next block of aid for Greece, the Fund warned on Tuesday,
while ratings agencies and German banks cast doubt on whether
private investors can be expected to help. [ID:nLDE7561HN] ""I can see a Greek default, and more talk about whether it
stays in the euro,"" said Coombs. ""I'm in preserving capital mode
at the moment, with defensive equity income strategies. It's
boring, but boring is good at the moment."" Miners helped limit the index's losses, buoyed by metals
prices as the dollar hit a one-month low, with the Federal
Reserve expected to keep rates near zero for some time following
recent weak economic data. The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index  rose 0.7
percent. Rio Tinto , Vedanta  and Xstrata 
rose between 1.1 and 1.2 percent. Utilities also gained. E.ON  climbed 3.2 percent
after UBS added the company to its ""key call"" list, saying the
stock's 20 percent underperformance in 2011 was unwarranted. The
utilities sector index  rose 1.2 percent.  Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100  ended the day
flat; Germany's DAX  and France's CAC40  rose 0.3
and 0.2 percent.  ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS  For some investors, the recent pull-back has helped shares
look cheap, especially in Europe. Equity valuations on Thomson
Reuters Datastream showed the STOXX Europe 600  carrying
a one-year forward price-to-earnings of 10, compared with 12.6
for the S&P 500 . Felicity Smith, fund manager at Bedlam Asset Management
which manages $700 million, said that in the current
environment, there were buying opportunities. ""We will stay in a stock-picker's market and think those
companies which are less dependent on discretionary spending and
on abnormally strong economic growth are better placed."" She likes companies that supply materials and equipment to
the agricultural sector and prefers pharmaceutical companies,
which are becoming more efficient, cutting costs and improving
their new drug pipelines.  Credit Suisse strategists said in a note recent economic
weakness was just a mid-cycle slowdown, and they favoured life
insurance companies, arguing government bond yields would trade
higher as the recovery strengthened. Among life insurance companies, Credit Suisse likes AXA
 and Allianz . AXA rose 1.6 percent, while
Allianz gained 0.9 percent. Investors will watch Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's
speech at 1945 GMT for clues on the U.S. central bank's view of
the slowdown and its impact on monetary policy.

early trade on Tuesday, with miners among the gainers and German
utility E.ON  up after bullish comment from UBS. Traders said investors were picking up recently beaten-down
stocks, though low volumes were seen exaggerating moves. ""Shares in Asia were higher so that is giving us a mild
boost and some people think the falls yesterday may have been a
bit overdone,"" said Markus Huber, senior trader at ETX Capital.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,109.02 points by 0804 GMT,
recovering from an 11-week closing low on Monday after a
four-session losing run. Utilities were among the gainers, with E.ON up 2.2 percent
after UBS added the company to its ""key call"" list, saying the
stock's 20 percent underperformance in 2011 was unwarranted. The STOXX Europe 600 utilities index  rose 0.8
percent. Mining shares were also among the heavyweight gainers, with
the STOXX Europe 600 basic resources index  up 0.8
percent as copper prices steadied. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX
 and France's CAC 40  rose 0.2-0.5 percent. Greek shares  lost 0.9 percent with banks 
down 1.4 percent as uncertainty remained over the resolution of
the country's debt crisis, with questions remaining over how
much of a hit private bondholders may have to take. Mediobanca analysts said Greek banks would face a capital
shortfall of 8 billion euros if a 43 percent haircut were
applied to Greek bonds, although such a move seemed unlikely in
the short term.  BERNANKE EYED Caution was likely to persist after recent disappointing
data from the United States, including weak labour market and
manufacturing numbers, raised fears the pace of recovery in the
world's largest economy could be slowing.  Investors will closely monitor a speech by Federal Reserve
chairman Ben Bernanke at 1945 GMT for clues on the U.S. central
bank's view of the slowdown and its impact on loose monetary
policy.  Credit Suisse strategists said in a note recent economic
weakness was just a mid-cycle slowdown, and they favoured life
insurance companies, arguing government bond yields would trade
higher as the recovery strengthened. Among life insurance companies, Credit Suisse likes AXA
 and Allianz , the strategists said. They also like companies which can benefit from a rise in
companies' capital expenditures. They highlighted software and
advertising companies such as SAP  and WPP . However, Credit Suisse said it was too early to raise
cyclicals, which have a strong correlation to the performance of
the economy overall. ""We have not quite seen the normal perconditions for a
mid-cycle trough in equities (but we think we are getting close,
with insider buying, risk appetite and marco surprises near the
levels typically seen at market lows),"" they said.

trade on Wednesday, halting their week-long recovery as
investors awaited U.S. economic data for insight on the outlook
of the world's biggest economy. At 0839 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0.3 percent at 1,138.97 points. The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50  index
was down 0.2 percent at 2,854.72 points, failing to stay above
its 200-day moving average crossed earlier in the day. The two benchmark indexes have gained around 2.5 percent
over the past week, but the recovery rally was losing steam on
Wednesday as investors fretted about a recent patch of mixed
economic signals from the United States while the Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing programme is coming to an end. Data showed on Tuesday the Conference Board's consumer
confidence index falling to 60.8 from a revised 66.0 in April,
and well below economists' forecasts for 66.5. Investors awaited U.S. ADP employment figures for the month
of May, due at 1215 GMT, a harbinger for Friday's all-important
non-farm payrolls report. The focus will also be on Institute for Supply Management's
monthly factory gauge, due at 1400 GMT. ""It's never good to have sluggish data, but all in all, poor
figures from the United States would not necessarily be bad for
European stocks,"" Kepler Capital Markets trader Patrice Perois
said. ""We're in a carry trade pattern involving the U.S. dollar. A
lower dollar has been boosting equities, that's what people have
been playing lately, so anything dragging down the greenback
might be good for stocks."" Since late 2008, European stocks and the dollar index 
have had a negative correlation, with the 30-day rolling
correlation at -0.26 on Wednesday. The euro  hit a fresh four-week high against the
dollar on Wednesday, although fresh concerns over whether Greece
will get a new bailout package, as well as key chart resistance
levels were capping the single currency's gains. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index  was down 0.1
percent, Germany's DAX index  down 0.2 percent, and
France's CAC 40  down 0.1 percent. Nokia  dropped 9 percent in strong volume, adding
to the previous session's slump after the world's biggest mobile
phone maker by volume warned sales and margins would fall well
below its previous guidance and dropped its full-year outlook. AXA  rose 2.9 percent after the French insurer
unveiled 2015 financial targets and sold its Canadian
operations. The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index , one of Europe's
main fear gauge, hit a two-week low on Wednesday, signaling a

market rally on Thursday but ended off their highs after mixed
U.S. economic data, and some strategists said equities might be
stuck in a range until the macro picture improves. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
rose 0.7 percent to close at 1,138.63 points, having been as
high as 1,144.58, with volumes at 89 percent of the 90-day
average. The index remains in the range defined by the 2011 high it
hit in mid-February and the low in mid-March. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless
benefits fell last week, but other data on home sales and
regional factory activity suggested the economy remained on a
moderate growth path. [ID:nN19134058] ""We are a bit rangebound. Some of that macro uncertainty
needs to be less visible, if we're going to break out on the
upside,"" said Bill Dinning, head of investment strategy at Aegon
Asset Management in Edinburgh, which has 48.8 billion pounds
under management.   The energy sector  rose 1.1 percent, gaining from a
surge in crude prices late on Wednesday after U.S. stockpiles
fell. BP  rose 1.6 percent, helped by a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch upgrade to ""buy"". Investors, however, stayed cautious in chasing prices higher
on lingering concerns about Greece's debt crisis. Eurogroup's
president Jean-Claude Juncker said he remained opposed to a
total restructuring of Greek sovereign debt. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100  ended the day 0.6
percent higher, Germany's DAX  rose 0.8 percent and
France's CAC40  rose 1.3 percent.  Greek banks  fell 0.5 percent, with Greece's

boosted by an upgrade to ""outperform"" from ""hold"" by Daiwa
Capital Markets, which cited ""the shift towards more profitable
new business in life and savings as a positive development"".  Banks to gain included BNP Paribas  and Barclays
, up 2.5 and 1.8 percent respectively. Commodities trader Glencore  made a steady market
debut on Thursday, with shares trading just above the widely
expected launch price of 530 pence, giving it solid currency for
potential acquisitions. It was looking to raise up to $11
billion [ID:nLDE74I062] However, miners slipped slightly, with the sector index
 down 0.3 percent, as copper gave back some of the strong
gains it made on Wednesday. Most strategists say the index is more likely to break out
of the range on the upside than the downside. ""If you look at the world from a company point of view,
earnings or margins, it looks pretty healthy, with decent
valuations, not overvalued. Relative to government bonds,
equities are still attractive,"" Dinning said.  Equity valuations on Thomson Reuters Datastream showed the
STOXX Europe 600  carrying a one-year forward
price-to-earnings of about 10.8 against a 10-year average of
13.5.  ""I see the stock market's outlook broadly positive in the
near term. An exposure to industrials and natural gas stocks

confident it would raise profits this year in spite of a drop in
first-quarter sales as Europe's second-biggest insurer
implements a strategy shift focused on improving margins. Axa pointed to raised margins in the first quarter,
particularly its new business margin which was up 5 percentage
points to 26 percent, helped by price increases. ""The first quarter reflected our continued focus on
improving the profitability of our operations, in line with the
priorities we set early in 2010,"" Axa Deputy Chief Executive
Denis Duverne said in a statement. On June 1, Axa is due to present its strategic plan based on
a bigger focus on margins than on sales and increased
investments in emerging markets. ""The good news are the margins indicators,"" one Paris-based
analyst said. The strategy change has already led Axa to sell part of its
life insurance business in the United Kingdom and buy back Asian
operations from its Australian branch Axa APH. Axa posted a 2 percent drop in first-quarter revenue on a
comparable basis, hit by significant declines in business in
France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The insurance group generated revenue of 27.9 billion euros
($39 billion) in the three months to March 31, a figure which
remained flat year-on-year on a reported basis. The average first-quarter revenue expectations from four
analysts was 28.8 billion euros. Life and savings new business on an annual premium
equivalent (APE) --  an industry measure used to iron out market
volatility -- was down 44 percent in Italy, 4 percent in France
and 17 percent in the United Kingdom. Axa's life and savings revenue was down 4.9 percent to 15.9
billion euros overall in the first quarter. ""For now, the year is looking just as we expected in
February, so there is no change in outlook,"" Duverne told
journalists in a conference call. In February, Axa said the improved economic outlook should
help the insurer raise profits. Duverne said Axa did not have any additional figures on the
impact of Japan's earthquakes and nuclear crisis on top of an
estimate before tax of at least 100 million euros given at the
end of March.

biggest one-day fall in a month on Tuesday, with the main
indexes breaking below their 50-day moving averages, as Japan's
worsening nuclear crisis sparked a bout of profit taking. Alcoa's lower-than-expected revenue figures also fuelled
concerns over the upcoming earning season and rattled investors,
who were quick to book profits following an 8 percent rally over
the past month. Mining and metal stocks featured among the top losers, with
Xstrata down 4.1 percent and ArcelorMittal down 3 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares dropped
1.7 percent at 1,127.28 points, the index's lowest close in
nearly two weeks. The benchmark index, as well as the broader STOXX Europe 600
, the euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50, France's CAC 40 and
Germany's DAX all broke below their 50-day moving average,
sending a clear bearish signal. ""Strictly speaking, valuation levels remain very low, but
there are mounting doubts over the impact of rising energy and
commodity costs, as well as interest rates, on companies'
results. This hasn't been completely priced in yet in earnings
forecasts,"" said Pierre-Yves Gauthier, head of research at
AlphaValue in Paris. ""Earnings growth will not be as strong as hoped earlier this
year, probably 2-3 percent lower, and forecasts are being
trimmed which is never good for the market. On the positive
side, the long-awaited M&A revival has started. With current
interest rates, making acquisitions seems a no brainer."" Energy shares dropped, with BP down 2.8 percent, Total down
2.5 percent and Repsol down 3 percent, as U.S. oil futures
tumbled 3.6 percent to around $106 a barrel, trimming a small
portion of their recent sharp rally, as Goldman Sachs warned

said high prices could be eroding demand. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index fell 1.5 percent,
Germany's DAX index shed 1.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 lost
1.5 percent. Investors' risk aversion was on the rise on Tuesday, with
the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index surging as much as 15 percent
to 22.9 points, a two-week high. The higher the volatility index, based on sell- and
buy-options on the Euro STOXX 50 stocks, the lower investors'
appetite for risky assets such as equities. ""I'm not expecting very positive surprises from the earnings
season. All sorts of negative things should emerge. The dollar
has weakened and we have to adjust (European corporate earnings)
forecasts with that. The pressure will also come from higher
commodity prices,"" said AXA IM fund manager Chrysoula
Zervoudakis, who manages around 520 million euros ($752
million). ""On the positive side, stocks are very cheap compared with
other asset classes. Companies have started to raise their

high * Market breaks through key technical levels  * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Brian Gorman LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - European shares headed for their
highest close in more than a month on Friday, with miners up as
metals prices were boosted by an improving economic outlook and
a weaker dollar. At 1058 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.5 percent at 1,150.11 points, on course for the
highest close since early March and a third weekly gain. The European benchmark is up more than 78 percent from its
lifetime low of March, 2009. Strategists said monetary stimulus, such as the U.S. Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing was a key factor in continuing to
boost markets. It was helping investors look past a host of
negatives such as Japan's nuclear crisis, tension in the Arab
world, and the euro zone's debt crisis and rising interest
rates. ""The resilience the market is showing against a hostile
background is quite remarkable,"" said Richard Jeffrey  chief
investment officer at Cazenove Capital Management, which has 15
billion pounds under management. ""In some respects, it's an indication of the liquidity in
the international finance system through quantitative easing. It
would appear that is a more powerful force than the ECB
tightening."" However, the Fed is likely to end its $600 billion
bond-buying programme within the next two or three months and it
may raise interest rates. Jeffrey said markets might then
""hesitate"". Gold struck a record high on Friday, and silver crossed $40
an ounce for the first time since 1980, as a weaker dollar and
concerns about inflation sent investors piling into precious
metals. Base metals also gained sharply. Miners to gain included
 Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Fresnillo, up between 2.1 and
2.7 percent.
 Insurance stocks were also among the top gainers on Friday,
with AXA, Swiss Life, Old Mutual and Aviva, up between 1.7 and
3.3 percent.
  In a note to clients, UniCredit recommended investors to
take long positions on European insurance stocks and short
retailers' stocks as the ECB's rate rise will be supportive to
the insurance sector while crimping consumer spending.  TNT FALLS Among individual shares, Dutch mail company TNT fell 10
percent after saying it will push ahead with spinning off its
express unit, despite changing the outlook for the unit due to
oil prices, political unrest and natural disasters. Technical indicators were positive, with the pan-European
index having broken through key levels. The index rose above its
50-day moving average, and is also above the 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement level of its fall to its lowest point in
2011, in March, from a February high. ""A bullish continuation pattern....is confirmed,"" said
 Philippe Delabarre, technical analyst, at Trading Central, in
Paris, writing about the Stoxx 50, which rose 0.4 percent to
2,649.46 points. He gave a short-term target of 2,920. As expected, the European Central Bank raised interest rates
for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis on Thursday,
and market expectations of more hikes this year sent the euro to
a 15-month high against the dollar, boosting foreign investors'
appetite for the region's stocks as they seek exposure to the
rallying currency. ""The ECB's move is sort of removing the punch bowl, which is
a good thing at this point. The message is that overall, the
European economy has been improving,"" a Paris-based trader said.  Citigroup said in a note that global growth ""should support

 (Adds details of deal, background)	 By Denny Thomas and Elzio Barreto	 HONG KONG, April 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has
bought a 12.02 percent stake worth more than $900 million in
China's Taikang Life Insurance Co Ltd, giving the Wall Street
giant a foothold into the world's biggest insurance market.	 Goldman's long-overdue purchase could pave the way for
Taikang's planned initial public offering next year, bankers and
analysts say, as the insurer seeks more capital to fund the
rapid premium growth in China. Credit Suisse estimates China's
insurance market to grow more than 20 percent per annum for the
next decade.	 Goldman acquired the stake from French insurer AXA SA
 , which last month said it agreed to sell its 15.6
percent in Taikang to a group of investors for $1.2 billion.
[ID:nLDE72A1VY]	 China Guardian Auctions Co. and New Deal TEDA Investment
Co., Ltd were the others who bought the shares sold by AXA, the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said on its web

Goldman was picked as the preferred bidder last year.	 The stake purchase was approved by CIRC, a joint statement
from Goldman and Taikang  said.	 
 Taikang and New China Life Insurance Co. are among the
insurers which are now looking to tap the public market over the
course of the next year or so. Taikang has about $44 billion in
assets and 54 million clients across China. 	 U.S. buyout funds Carlyle Group and TPG 
have generated strong returns from their bets on Chinese
insurance companies. Carlyle's investment in China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co is already on course for its best
ever exit, after it raised $2.6 billion.	 Last year, TPG sold a $2.4 billion stake in China's Ping An

strong profit for the buyout fund.	 Goldman beat several bidders, including Kohlberg Kravis

245,"Oct 29, 2009 09:03AM ET",WRAPUP 1-Fund managers rebuild equity in volatile Oct-poll,nan," By Mike Dolan LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Top investors around the world
rebuilt equity holdings during a shaky October for stock
markets, boosting allocations from September's 7-month low and
cutting bond positions to their lowest since December 2008, a
Reuters poll showed on Thursday. The poll of 50 fund managers from the United States,
continental Europe, Britain and Japan -- conducted over the past
two weeks of this month -- indicates that the recent correction
in equity prices may be seen as a buying opportunity. The poll's average equity allocation worldwide bounced back
to 56.4 percent from last month's trough of 54.9, although it
remained below the peak of 57.1 from August and an average for
the 5-1/2 year history of the poll of 59.2. The re-established equity positions came against a
rollercoaster month for world stocks which, although broadly
flat since Oct 1 levels, retreated sharply over the past
fortnight from new 12-month highs set mid-month. ""Our marginal increase to U.S. equities stems from our view
that the probability of a double-dip recession is low, given the
backdrop of no pricing pressure,"" said Doug Gordon, investment
strategist at Russell Investments in Tacoma, Washington. That long-term confidence was reflected on both sides of the
Atlantic. ""We strongly think that growth is going to snap back,""
said Franz Wenzel, senior investment strategist with AXA
Investment Managers in Paris. And Japanese funds held their nerve on equity too.# ""Share prices will remain on a rising trend as corporate
earnings continue to improve,"" said Masaru Yamagishi, chief
strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, pointing out
that some 80 percent of the latest U.S. earnings had beaten
forecasts.  CAUTION ON BONDS Notes of ongoing caution about the state of world markets
was reflected in a bounce back in average cash positions to 4.6
percent this month -- its highest level since April and up more
than a point from August's 2009 low of 3.3 percent. However, the big loser was bonds, where allocations dropped
almost two points to 33.9 percent -- their lowest since December
of last year when the credit storm was at its height. The cutback in bonds comes amid growing speculation about
the timing of central banks' exits from super-loose monetary
policies and against waves of new supply of government debt. Many fund managers have also said they feel corporate debt
markets are also close to fair value after steep rallies over
the past six months. This also reflected views in some quarters that the best of
the equities rally this year was also finished as economies
struggle with persistent joblessness. ""We have been selling into any rally because our feeling is
that the rate of unemployment might get worse,"" said
Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management, a Cincinnati-based firm that oversees $20 billion. There was also concern the market may have fully priced in
the earnings recovery. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life,
said: ""Investors should fasten their seat belts once again."" ""There are risks that this (optimistic earnings outlook)
cannot be achieved against the backdrop of tighter fiscal
policy, continued problems with credit creation and debt
servicing, and central banks withdrawing excessively easy
monetary policies,"" Milligan added.  REGION TO REGION U.S. fund managers slightly increased their exposure to
stocks, the Reuters poll showed. Based on 11 management firms interviewed between Oct. 16 and
Oct. 28, they held an average of 64.5 percent of their assets in
equities, compared with 63.8 percent a month earlier and 60.6
percent at the start of 2009. Managers held 30.2 percent of
assets in bonds, down a touch from 30.3 percent in September. British managers built their equity positions to 61.9
percent in October from 57.2 percent the previous month, with
bonds down 4.4 percentage points to 22.1 percent. Cash was up
almost a point to 5.4 percent. Japanese fund managers also raised their average global
stock weighting and cut the bond weighting in model portfolios
for October. That poll of 12 fund managers, taken Oct. 14-26,
showed their average stock allocations rose to 52.6 percent in
October from 52.1 percent in September. Continental European fund managers took more cautious steps
in their portfolios in October, but also showed continuing
confidence in a risk-rewarding investment backdrop of recovering
growth and easy money. The monthly survey of 16 major fund houses in the region
showed holdings of equities rose on average to 46.9 percent of a
typical portfolio from 46.5 percent in September. Bond holdings also rose, to 41.9 percent from 41.4 percent
but cash was cut to 4.7 percent from 5.1 percent.

 as Europe's two biggest insurers, said its business environment
was getting better despite reporting a dip in nine-month sales
on Thursday. Sales fell to 68.09 billion euros ($101 billion). Analysts
in a Reuters poll had on average forecast 68.36 billion euros. Life and savings new business sales on an annual premium

while property and casualty insurance sales rose 2.5 percent. Although the global economic outlook remained uncertain, AXA
said market conditions for its sector were more positive than
earlier in the year. ""The outlook in global financial markets has improved over
the last six months, which provides a more favourable
environment for our business,"" Chief Executive Henri de Castries
said in a statement. Yet while insurers have benefited from a rebound in global
financial markets they have also had to contend with lower sales
as cash-strapped consumers delay purchases of new products or
opt to let existing insurance policies lapse. Britain's biggest insurer Prudential Plc reported lower
sales on Wednesday. AXA's share price was down 3.9 percent at 17.18 euros on
Wednesday, giving AXA a market capitalisation of around 36
billion euros -- roughly the same stock market value as Allianz. AXA's stock has risen around 8 percent since the start of
2009, in line with a 9 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx European
insurance sector.

lifetime low of March 9 and 19 percent for the year, but is
still down 39 percent from its mid-2007 peak. ""Investors now are in wait-and-see mode. They are waiting
for earnings news, with major U.S. financial companies beginning
to report tomorrow,"" said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at Fortis
Bank. ""Everyone would like to see top-line growth, but I think it
is possible companies could disappoint on this."" Financials featured among the worst performers, with banks
taking the most points off the index. A downgrade by Whitney on Goldman to ""neutral"" from ""buy""
also put pressure on the market. Whitney shot to fame by
predicting much of the banking sector meltdown. Deutsche Bank shares slipped 1.4 percent as traders cited
market speculation that Germany's biggest bank may be planning a
capital increase. Banco Santander, Barclays, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Lloyds
Banking Group were down 0.9 to 3.1 percent.
Insurers were hard hit. Allianz, Axa and Admiral Group were
1 to 1.7 percent lower.  OIL STOCKS HIGHER On the upside, energy stocks added the most points to the
index as crude gained 1.1 percent. BG Group, Dana Petroleum and
Total were up 0.3 to 2.4 percent. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, was 1.7
percent higher after a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the Asian
steel sector. Whitbread, Britain's biggest hotel operator, gained 2.1
percent after it reported a better-than-expected first-half
pretax profit boosted by strong growth at its Costa Coffee
chain. Turning to economic news, German analyst and investor
sentiment unexpectedly fell for the first time in three months
to hit its lowest level since July, a closely-watched survey
showed on Tuesday. The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank's monthly poll of
economic sentiment fell to 56.0 from 57.7 in September. The
consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts last week was
for a rise to 58.3. ""The ZEW expectations fell short of forecasts, but the index
is still at a high level signalling growth. ... The fact that
the ZEW has stagnated overall suggests that the Ifo institute's
business climate index cold head sideways in October too,"" said
Ralk Umlauf at Helaba. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 0.1 percent,
Germany's DAX was 0.4 percent lower and France's CAC 40 slipped
0.3 percent. (editing by John Stonestreet)

Monday, as Dutch giant Philips  helped reinforce
investor confidence in the third-quarter earnings season, still
in its early stages. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
rose 0.7 percent to 1,005.37 points, the highest close since
Sept. 23. The European benchmark index is up 56 percent from its
lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more confident
on the prospects of economic recovery.   Philips surged 7.7 percent after posting better than
expected third-quarter results, as the world's biggest lighting
maker and Europe's biggest consumer electronics producer
benefited from cost-cutting measures. [ID:nLC210070] ""The results of companies like Phillips are important, and

with Siemens  and Nokia  up 2.6 percent and

rose 1.4-2.4 percent. Most banks were higher. Banco Santander , Deutsche

banking sector , which had a dismal 2008, has jumped
nearly 170 percent since the market bottomed in early March. But two British banks bucked the trend. Lloyds  fell 2.5 percent after people familiar with

2.5 percent to more than $73 a barrel. Total , BP  and Royal Dutch Shell 
rose 1.3-1.8 percent. Among other individual shares, Vodafone  rose 1.6
percent, rebounding after falls last week helped by reassuring
comments from Deutsche Bank which repeated its 'buy' rating on

 By Brian Gorman LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - European shares edged higher in
early trade on Wednesday, building on a major gain in the
previous session, with miners among the biggest risers.
 At 0838 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.2 percent at 995.15 points. Miners extended gains from Tuesday, as gold prices held near
record levels, above $1,000 an ounce, and copper also remained
relatively strong. Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata rose
between 0.6 and 1 percent.
 On Tuesday, the European benchmark rose 2.2 percent, its
biggest one-day percentage gain in nearly two months, and is up
more than 55 percent from its lifetime low of March 9, as
investors have become more confident on the prospects of economic
recovery. Some analysts advised caution, arguing that much of the
recent surge in equities had been due to rises for commodity
shares, which had been fuelled by dollar weakness. ""Commodity demand isn't rising. Commodity prices are fooling
us, because you have the cloak of the dollar over them. Take off
the cloak and commodities will look weak,"" said Justin Urquhart
Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management. ""It's fool's
gold. Growth will continue to be weak."" ""But every time there's a dip, there are certain mangers
sitting on cash, desperate to get in. We could be in a trading
range."" The insurance sector was higher, benefitting from the rise
in equity markets worldwide. Aviva, AXA, Prudential rose between
1 and 1.1 percent.  Energy companies were among the biggest fallers, after crude
 pared gains late on Tuesday, though it is still above $71 a
barrel. Total, BP and Royal Dutch Shell fell between 0.4 and 0.8
percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 rose between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.  SAINSBURY FALLS British supermarket group J Sainsbury fell 3.3 percent after
meeting forecasts with a slight slowdown in quarterly sales
growth and saying that industry growth would moderate further as
food price inflation eases. Water groups Pennon and Severn Trent rose 2.3 and 2.2
percent respectively after they were upgraded by HSBC to
""overweight"" and ""neutral"" respectively.  Kingfisher rose 3.5 percent. UBS upgraded its recommendation
on Europe's largest home improvement retailer to ""buy"" from
""neutral"" and Morgan Stanley upped its stance to ""equal-weight""
from ""underweight"". Later, investors' attention will turn to the United States,
where Alcoa is due to kick off third-quarter earnings season. ""In the third-quarter earnings, companies' top lines will
look weak, and the bottom line will look good,"" said Urquhart
Stewart. ""That means they are cutting costs, peeling the bark
back. If you keep doing that, you kill the tree.""

higher by midday on Tuesday with the heavyweight banking sector
boosted by an upgrade from BofA Merrill Lynch. At 1057 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 1.4 percent at
984.69 points. The European benchmark index is up more than 52
percent from its lifetime low on March 9, as investors have
become more confident of the prospects of economic recovery. The index fell to a four-week closing low on Friday after
higher than expected U.S. jobless numbers, but U.S. services
data on Monday, showing expansion for the first time since 2008,
boosted investors' confidence. An interest rate rise by Australia's central bank also
signalled some policymakers were confident the recovery was
gathering pace. ""The data has been more reassuring after last week's
non-farm payrolls,"" said Philip Lawlor, chief portfolio
strategist at Nomura, in London. ""Equity markets are discounting mechanisms. They see a large
part of the recovery as in the bag. We had a V-shaped recovery
from Armageddon.""
 He added: ""There will be some aimless trading, up some days,
down on others until we start to get the data from third-quarter
earnings."" The heavyweight banking sector added most points to the
index, after BofA Merrill Lynch upgraded European banks to
""overweight"". BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Intesa
Sanpaolo and UBS rose between 1.5 and 5.1 percent. ""Sector EPS bottomed in Q2 and with further EPS upgrades
ahead reasonable valuations offer the potential for re-rating,
building on strong core profitability and positive trends in key
wholesale and property markets,"" BofA Merrill Lynch said. ""Capital risks remain a medium term concern but competing
aims of differing regulatory bodies suggest no rapid conclusion
to this debate; meanwhile, the resolutely dovish rate stance of
central banks underwrites abundant liquidity conditions.""
 Societe Generale reversed earlier falls to trade 0.6 percent
higher after unveiling a 4.8 billion euro ($7.0 billion) capital
hike to repay state support and pursue acquisitions. Insurers were also supported by increasing optimism on the
outlook for the global economy. AXA, Aegon, ING Groep and
Prudential rose between 2.1 and 4.4 percent.  OILS GAIN Energy stocks were lifted as crude rose 1 percent to more
than $71 a barrel.  BG Group, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and ENI added 1.5-2.1
percent. Miners were firmer as metal prices rose. Rio Tinto,
Antofagasta, Xstrata, Anglo American and Kazakhmys gained
3.2-6.4 percent. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC were up 1.5-1.6 percent. Tesco, the world's third largest retailer, reversed earlier
losses and was 0.8 percent higher after posting first-half
profit towards the top end of forecasts. Pharmaceutical company Shire was among the fallers, shedding
2.2 percent after UBS cut its rating for the drugmaker to
""neutral"" from ""buy""', citing valuation grounds. Futures for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up
between 0.8 and 1 percent. HSBC's global strategists were upbeat for the prospects for
equities. ""We expect that, for the next couple of quarters, growth
will continue to surprise on the upside but (interest) rates
remain ultra-low,"" it said in a note. ""That is an almost perfect
environment for equities; we stay positive and forecast indices
to rise 20-25 percent by end-2010.""

254,"Sep 25, 2009 09:00AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-FX moves giving investors a headache,nan," By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Increasingly volatile currency
moves are becoming a headache for largely-unhedged equity
investors and corporates as markets prepare themselves for
central banks to wind down super loose money conditions. The dollar hit a 13-month low against major currencies this
week as risk-hungry investors dumped low-yielding assets, while
sterling fell to its lowest in 6 months versus the euro after
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said a weaker currency was
helping to rebalance the nation's economy. The timing of the ""exit"", or scaling back of emergency
economic support, is key for investors of all asset classes as
interest rates, which are near zero in many developed economies,
will have to rise eventually to ease inflationary pressures. And policymakers may have already begun to take a step
towards the exit. Major world central banks announced on
Thursday they planned to wind down facilities allowing them to
inject emergency tranches of U.S. dollars into their banks. Events next week are set to bring more clues on exit policy
as finance chiefs move from Pittsburgh to Istanbul to attend the
IMF/World Bank meeting. The monthly U.S. employment report will
update on the state of the U.S. economy.
  As the third quarter draws to an end, the MSCI world equity
index have risen more than 16 percent since the start of July,
gaining more than 25 percent -- recouping more than half of last
year's losses. But on Friday the MSCI index hit a 1-1/2 week low. While
some say this is a natural correction after a big rally, others
warn investors are already getting prepared for an eventual rise
in borrowing costs or growing nervous about currency moves. ""(Stable currency markets) had been quite helpful for risk
appetites. People just felt a little bit more comfortable. That
disappeared,"" said Michael Dicks, head of research and
investment strategy at Barclays Wealth. ""Wobbles in currencies and a lot of second-order issues
associated with them got people worrying. There's real
uncertainty coming into the policy setting. And this is making
it harder work for the rally to be sustained."" Dicks said U.S. and UK real estate markets enjoy high
correlation but sharp currency moves could generate a shift in
performance, a factor which could postpone investment decisions. According to Thomson Reuters data, the S&P 500 index has
risen 16.3 percent in dollar terms, compared with less than 10
percent in euro terms.  PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTIATOR Standard & Poor's says the strength of emerging market
currencies against the dollar is providing U.S. investors a
positive performance differentiator. According to the firm, U.S. investors found a 12.2 percent
year-to-date currency tailwind from emerging market stocks. This
compares with only an 8.3 percent FX benefit from developed
foreign stocks. This is because many key emerging currencies like the
Brazilian real and the South African rand have risen far more
against the dollar than the euro or sterling. And some investors and businesses may not be ready for such
huge currency moves. According to a survey by Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets, 80
percent of UK businesses have no hedging strategy in place
against financial market risks.  The survey, which questioned 2,579 UK businesses, also shows
that 28 percent of companies are more concerned than six months
ago about FX movements, 18 percent about the impact of interest
rate volatility and 34 percent about commodity prices. Only 10 percent of companies are prepared to have a hedging
strategy in place to face risks from FX volatility.  EXIT ON HORIZON Apart from FX market uncertainty, changes in central bank
monetary policy are under way as the economy recovers, which
influences interest rates in the longer term. ""Emergency policy have to be withdrawn at some point.
There's a risk of leaving stimulus for a long time. We have to
be prepared for this. It will mean higher interest rates at some
point,"" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer of fixed
income at AXA Investment Managers. ""Big policy events out there on the horizon are very
important for financial markets. There is an expectation of
normalisation for interest rates in the next 2-3 years, which is
negative for government bonds."" Iggo prefers inflation-linked debt to play the exit policy
theme in the fixed income markets. ""Inflation is not an issue at the moment. But index-linked
bonds are attractive and they are a cheap insurance,"" he said.

255,"Sep 25, 2009 06:51AM ET",ANALYSIS-Russian stocks to outshine peers on cyclical play,nan," * Valuations, oil price rise boosting Russia stocks allure * Investors bet cyclicals will gain from inventory rebuild * Weak Russian economy, global growth doubts dog market  By Sujata Rao LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Cheap valuations and optimism
about oil and the world economy are luring cash back to Russian
stocks, with investors betting the market will benefit more than
most from a sharp rebuilding of global inventories. Moscow's dollar-denominated index  is up 16 percent
in September after gains of 5 percent in August, outgunning an 8
percent gain in the broader emerging equity market . The index has almost doubled this year, a stark contrast
with 2008 when it was one of the worst performing emerging
equity markets. Momentum has grown as investors became more
hopeful a recovery was on the way in the United States and
elsewhere. Add to that, stock valuations that are twice as cheap as
those in Asia -- in terms of multiples of forward earnings --
and the comparative case looks compelling. The latest fund manager survey by Banc of America/Merrill
Lynch showed Russia topped investors' list of overweights, while
they went underweight China for the first time in over a year.
Net overweights are 44 percent now versus zero in April. ""In the first phase of economic recovery, you want to be
positioned in cyclicals not consumption,"" said Credit Suisse
analyst Robert Ruttmann, who put Russia on overweight in July. ""As (consumer) demand has picked up in the past couple of
months, we have seen high levels of de-stocking so companies
will need to buy things like oil and steel."" Cyclical stocks are those which rise in value during an
upturn in the economy, like airlines or commodities. Energy stocks make up 70 percent of the MSCI Russia index
compared to 15 percent for the broader MSCI emerging index and
analysts surveyed by Reuters expect oil to average over $73 a
barrel in 2010 up from a forecast in January of $55.  That should lift Russia's economy from a 10-percent
contraction in the first half of 2009. Nor will the country suffer from its lack of a
well-developed manufacturing base as unemployment continues to
rise and consumers save rather than spend to secure themselves
against the fallout of the credit crisis. ""People wont be consuming as liberally as they did in 2007
so what is outperforming now and what will outperform throughout
the first phase of recovery, are the cyclicals,"" Ruttmann said.  VALUATIONS Moscow's stock market was one of the hardest hit in the
carnage that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers last
September, plunging over 75 percent versus a 55 percent loss for
the broader emerging index. That made valuations very cheap. Michael Penn, global equity strategist at Banc of
America/Merrill Lynch says Russian stocks still trade at an
average 8 times forward earnings versus over 15 times in China.  On a trailing basis, reflecting price ratios to most recent
12-month results, the Russian discount to emerging markets is 50
percent, he says, versus a historical average of 20 percent. ""Russia stands out as a big value play,"" Penn said. ""Oil
prices are on the rise and risks around the rouble have reduced.
The missing ingredient has been the economy and even here there
are some signs the Russian economy is improving."" Asian nations India, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan joined
China as fund managers' most significant underweights. ""Russia is a high-risk, high-reward market, much more than
China. If the global economy manages to recover on a sustainable
basis it's probably better to be in Russia,"" said Claude
Tiramani, who manages over $5 billion in China and east Europe
at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Paris.  CHEAP FOR A REASON But there are doubts and Tiramani himself has still
increased allocations to China after the recent market dip and
notes that the very rise in oil prices that is luring people to
Russia could choke off nascent global growth. ""People are betting on a global recovery but I see 10
percent growth in China as more likely than a strong global
recovery at this stage,"" he added. Russia has failed to diversify out of oil and other resource
industries and domestic demand is weak, while memories of past
corporate bust-ups mean governance and state interference remain
issues for some investors.  While India and China will post 6-8 percent growth this
year, Russia is still in recession, notes William Calvert, fund
manager at Axa Framlington. He has avoided Russia for a while on
worries over transparency and structural weakness. ""Russia is cheap for a reason -- the long term investment
story is very poor,"" he says. ""The big story in emerging markets right now is disinflation
supported by strong currencies, which is allowing interest rates
to fall to record lows in many places. In Russia that is not
happening, they are not benefiting from this trend."" (Editing by Patrick Graham)

256,"Sep 24, 2009 11:15AM ET",UPDATE 2-EU executive wary of derivatives trading change,nan," * McCreevy leaves exchange issue open but transparency key * Non-centrally cleared deals may face higher capital
charge * Industry says mandating exchange trading could raise
risks
 (Adds McCreevy comments) By Huw Jones LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Forcing privately negotiated
derivatives onto exchanges could contradict other EU laws that
promote competition in trading and damage risk hedging, the
bloc's executive body said on Thursday. Turmoil from the demise of Lehman Brothers bank a year ago
and the near-collapse of insurer AIG  prompted global
leaders to call for tougher rules to regulate the $600 trillion
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. The United States and European Union are debating new rules
for the sector, focusing on better transparency and requiring
as many of the privately traded contracts to be standardised so
they can be centrally cleared to cut risk. The U.S. wants to go a step further and shift as much OTC
contract trading as possible onto exchanges. U.S. lawmakers say if the EU does not follow suit, European
market participants could have an unfair advantage. ""Do we need to impose certain requirements for the trading
of derivatives? The U.S. seems to be going that route,"" EU
Internal Market Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, told a dinner
in Brussels on the eve of an EU-hosted conference on
derivatives. ""We shall follow their discussions very closely. What seems
certain is that there will have to be much more transparency in
the reporting of trades,"" he said. McCreevy said only part of the OTC market could be
cleared. ""We could also think about raising the regulatory capital
cost for bilaterally-cleared products,"" McCreevy said. Maria Velentza, head of securities markets at McCreevy's
internal market unit said earlier in the day: ""In terms of the
European situation, before mandating trading on regulated
markets we have to take into consideration the current law."" The EU introduced the markets in financial instruments
directive, or MiFID, two years ago to abolish stock exchange
monopolies in trading shares and spur competition. It led to
alternative trading venues that have lowered trading fees. Making OTC trading on exchanges mandatory would create a
""discrepancy"" with the MiFID rules, Velentza told a meeting of
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. ""We need to take a comprehensive view to avoid imbalances
with respect to different financial instruments,"" Velentza
said. The Commission recognised the need to avoid a one-size-fits
all approach and it was still unclear what standardisation --
which industry fears will kill innovation -- meant, she said. Sharon Bowles, chair of the European Parliament's economic
committee, which would have joint say with governments on any
EU law, said the derivatives were not a big factor in the
crisis. ""They performed better under stress than might have been
expected,"" Bowles said. A ""one size fits all"" approach to
regulating the sector may not be appropriate as there will
always be a need for bespoke, privately-traded contracts. Banks began voluntarily clearing credit default swap trades
transacted in the EU from July. The Commission, which has powers to initiate pan-EU
financial regulation, is consulting with industry as it
prepares to decide on how to supervise derivatives better. The derivatives industry and some of its top customers fear
if trading is forced onto an exchange it would be harder to
offer the bespoke contracts used to hedge risk. ISDA chief executive, Robert Pickel, urged a global
approach, noting that the U.S. has focused on standardisation
of products while the EU was more concerned with standardising
processes. Industry officials said exchanges were pushing their own
interests in lobbying regulators for exchange trading of
derivatives. ""In fact, mandating that all interest rates swaps or credit
default swaps be traded on an exchange is likely to result only
in higher costs and increased risks to the manufacturers... who
use OTC derivatives in the normal course of business,"" he
said. Daniel Trinder, executive director of government affairs at
Goldman Sachs  bank in Europe, said there would be some
benefits to exchange trading of some OTC contracts. ""The key is you can't force liquidity where it does not
want to go,"" Trinder said. ""Clients come to us looking for bespoke solutions. The
exchange business is a scale business. I just don't see the
possibility of migrating a lot of business onto an exchange,""
he added. ""Transparency is not always equal to liquidity,"" added
Pierre-Emmanuel Julliard of insurer Axa . Frederik Gentzel, head of prime brokerage for global rates
and commodities at Deutsche Bank  said: ""The current
proposed regulatory changes are unprecedented in scope and
could have unintended consequences, especially for liquidity
and overall effectiveness of the system.""

 (Adds detail) By Julien Ponthus and Matthieu Protard PARIS, Sept 18 (Reuters) - France's Areva is set to assess
bids for its T&D power infrastructure business, the company said
on Friday, including one from U.S. giant General Electric, a
source familiar with the matter said. ""We have indeed received a certain number of offers,"" a
company spokeswoman said. ""They will now be examined to select
which of them could lead to binding offers."" The nuclear reactor maker, in which the French state holds a
91 percent stake, wants to sell the T&D power transmission and
distribution unit as part of an 11 billion euro ($16.17 billion)
financing plan that includes a capital increase. Analysts value T&D at 3 billion to 5 billion euros. Engineering group Alstom confirmed it had submitted a bid
with Schneider Electric. Alstom sold T&D to Areva in 2004 for
less than 1 billion euros as part of a rescue plan. General Electric also made an offer in a consortium
including investment fund CVC, a source close to the matter told
Reuters on Friday. Axa Private Equity had said it was considering an offer for
T&D, a rival of ABB and Siemens. Axa declined to comment on
Friday. And Japan's Toshiba also planned to bid, sources with
knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier this month. The Areva spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of
bidders or their identity. The source close to the matter said whether the bidder was
French or not was not an issue, but rather bidders had to
provide a price range, an industrial plan and details of any
impact on the workforce.

Monday, with British confectionery group Cadbury soaring 38
percent following a 10.2 billion pound ($16.7 billion) bid
approach from U.S. company Kraft Foods. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares rose
1.4 percent to 975.90 points, just 0.3 percent away from an
11-month closing high. The European benchmark index has risen more than 51 percent
since it hit a lifetime low of March 9 as investor confidence
about prospects of economic recovery have grown. All major sectors rose on Monday, with food companies among
the most notable gainers. Britain's Cadbury soared 37.9 percent after turning down the
cash-and-shares offer from North America's biggest food group,
which it tipped to come back with a higher bid. ""Positive sentiment from Friday's close on Wall Street and
bid speculation on Cadbury are igniting things a little bit,""
said Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Banks. Other analysts said the market lacked direction with Wall
Street closed for the Labor Day holiday. Volumes were 70.6 percent of the 90-day average.  ""Everybody is cautious, and positioned for a downturn, but
you need a trigger. The trend for the moment is sideways,"" said
Giuseppe-Guido Amato, strategist at Lang & Schwarz. ""Last week,
we had good indicators, but the market couldn't go up.""  The food sector received another boost from an upbeat
trading statement at Associated British Foods, up 4.1 percent.
The company was able to point to strong trading at its sugar
business, as well as its Primark discount clothing chain. Whitbread, Britain's biggest hotel operator, surged 18
percent after it said full-year profit would beat analysts'
expectations, even as it reported a decline in sales. The rise took Whitbread's market capitalisation to more than
2.1 billion pounds and this may be enough to see it re-enter the
FTSE 100, which is going through its quarterly reshuffle, based
on values at the close on Tuesday.  FINANCIALS RISE  The heavyweight financial sector also boosted the index. Swiss Re rose 3.4 percent after saying reinsurance prices
were rising overall and it was well positioned for the January
2010 renewals season, with a considerably strengthened capital
base. Other insurers to rise included Aegon, Aviva, AXA, and Legal
& General, up between 2.3 and 3.5 percent. Banks to gain included Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC and
UniCredit, up between 1 and 2.4 percent. Spain's Telefonica rose 2.1 percent after the telecoms
company said on Sunday it had reached a deal with China Unicom
whereby each would buy $1 billion worth of the other's shares as
part of a strategic alliance.    Across Europe, the FTSE 100
index rose 1.7 percent to its highest close in more than 11
months. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both rose 1.5 percent.
 The market got support after Group of 20 finance ministers
and central bankers said they would not remove economic stimulus
until the global recovery was well established.    Standard Life
Investments advised investors to ""stay heavy"" in the UK as the
market was supported by favourable valuations, but said ""stay
light"" in Europe ex-UK as ""the region remains vulnerable to a
continued slowdown in world trade growth and

a third straight day on Wednesday, with financial stocks
suffering the most, as investors took profits after a strong run
in recent months. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.4
percent to close at 950.41 points. The benchmark index is still
up more than 47 percent from the record low it hit on March 9,
and the DJ Stoxx Banking Index is up more than 154 percent in
that time.  Shares have risen with growing investor confidence in
economic recovery. The euro zone's two biggest economies, France
and Germany, have both come out of recession. But some analysts say there is insufficient evidence of
recovery to justify the rally and worry about what will happen
when government stimulus measures are wound down. Banking stocks were among the worst hit after a sharp
sell-off in the United States on Tuesday and in Japan on
Wednesday. Banco Santander, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Lloyds, Societe
Generale, UBS and UniCredit fell between 1.5 and 6.2 percent. ""Part of this is just natural profit taking,"" said Philip
Lawlor, strategist at Nomura, in London. ""One catalyst for that has been China,"" he added, referring
to a 21.8 percent slide for the Shanghai Composite Index in
August. ""We have to wait now for companies to report third-quarter
numbers. We're in a vacuum, so it's not surprising to see a
dip.""   G20 countries still think it is too early to remove the
huge fiscal and monetary stimulus thrown at their economies but
any exit strategies should be executed in a coordinated way, a
UK government source said on Wednesday. Data showed the euro zone economy contracted only marginally
in the second quarter, dragged down by a plunge in inventories
and private investment. Data from the United States was mixed. The world's biggest
economy lost fewer private sector jobs in August than in the
prior month while companies also planned fewer layoffs,
suggesting modest improvement in the beleaguered labour market. Tentative signs of recovery were also evident in data
showing U.S. factories saw an increase in new orders in July for
the fourth straight month, though the rise was smaller than
economists had expected.  INSURERS FALL Insurers also lost ground, with Aegon, AXA, Allianz and
Swiss Re falling between 1.9 and 4.8 percent.  Legal & General closed 8.7 percent lower, partly as a result
of going ex-dividend.  Mining shares suffered as copper fell to a near two-week low
on worries prices in industrial metals have overheated. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto,
Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources fell 1.6-3.3 percent. A.P. Moller-Maersk fell 8.1 percent after the Danish
shipping and oil group said it aims to tap investors for close
to $1.8 billion through a share placement to boost its financial
flexibility. Alcatel-Lucent fell 7.3 percent after the company said it
was raising the initial amount of its convertible bond issue to
870 million euros. Heavyweight BP limited the index's losses after it made a
""giant"" oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, reaffirming the
area's importance to Western oil majors. Its shares rose 4.2
percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 closed 0.04 percent lower;
Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 were down 0.1 and 0.3 percent
respectively. (Additional reporting by Atul Prakash; editing by David

on http://www.reuters.com/summit/ChinaInvestmentSummit09) *BNY Mellon eyes helping China banks as depositaries for CDRs *Says its China fund JV should get license by year-end *Sees pick-up in ADR issues by Chinese companies By Michael Wei and Jason Subler BEIJING (Reuters), Sept 2 - The Bank of New York Mellon
 said it expects the first China Depositary Receipts (CDRs)
to be issued next year, in a highly anticipated new vehicle that
will allow foreign-headquartered firms to list in China. BNY Mellon has been working closely with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the country's two stock
exchanges, advising them on the rollout of CDRs, which represent
foreign companies' equity shares. Listing through CDRs in mainland China would be easier for
so-called ""red chips"" -- Chinese firms listed in markets such as
Hong Kong -- than to float shares in Shanghai or Shenzhen. ""The CDRs, I think, are still being actively considered, it's
a viable option,"" Larry Chen, chief representative in BNY
Mellon's Beijing office, told the Reuters China Investment
Summit. ""We are expecting to see them maybe next year. I don't know
if the first half or second half,"" said Chen, who oversees the
bank's business in China. Major Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms like China Mobile
<0941.HK> and CNOOC <0883.HK> have said they'd be interested in
making such listings. BNY Mellon would likely help major Chinese banks act as
depositary banks for CDRs, not serve as the depositary bank
itself, Chen said at the summit in the Reuters office in Beijing. Chen also said BNY Mellon expected to receive regulatory
approval by the end of the year for its planned fund management
joint venture with Xi'an-based Western Securities, in which it
will hold a 49 percent stake, the maximum allowed. ""We are in the final stage of getting regulatory approval
from the CSRC. All the signs are pretty positive,"" he said. ""The indication is we'll be getting the JV license by the end
of the year."" So far, more than 30 foreign institutions including American
International Group , AXA  and HSBC  have
entered China's fund management industry. [ID:nSHA74270] Chen said the venture would probably start by offering
domestic A-share funds, but would hope to issue funds investing
in overseas markets under the Qualified Domestic Institutional
Investor (QDII) scheme as soon as possible, which would be a
minimum of two years after the JV's launch under current rules. Bank of New York Mellon, created in 2007 by a merger between
the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corp, is among a number
of U.S. banks found to have sufficient capital under the
government's stress test. Chen added that the pipeline for Chinese firms issuing
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) was also picking up after a
relatively slow period in the wake of the financial crisis. The bank acts as depositary for more than 2,100 American and
global depositary receipt programmes, acting in partnership with
leading companies from 67 countries. ""There are quite a few in the pipeline,"" he said, adding that
the bank had done only one such deal so far this year ""We are expecting more Chinese IPOs by the end of the year.""

biggest one-day percentage fall in two weeks on Tuesday, led by
banks and commodity stocks, but analysts said the market was
likely to resume its climb after a period of consolidation. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 1.8
percent down at 954.15 points, the lowest closing level since
Aug. 20. The index is up 15 percent this year and has jumped 48
percent from a record low in March. Financial stocks took the most points off the index, with
HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, Societe
Generale and UBS falling 3.7-5.8 percent. But Commerzbank, rose 3.6 percent after its chief executive
Martin Blessing said in a newspaper interview that Germany's
second-biggest bank could return to profit as soon as next year.
 Analysts said the market slipped on profit-taking after
paring losses in the afternoon session on data showing the U.S.
manufacturing sector grew in August for the first time in over a
year and a half, while pending home sales surged to a two-year
high in July. ""It's surprising that the market didn't go higher despite
the good news. That's an indication that there is some kind of
fatigue starting to creep into investors' minds,"" said Franz
Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers, in Paris. ""The market is somewhat overbought. We wouldn't be surprised
to see the market consolidating in the near term, but that
should give some breath for the reminder of the year to climb
higher,"" he added. Figures also showed that euro zone manufacturing activity
shrank less than previously thought in August, but there were
stark differences amongst the bloc's countries with contraction
accelerating in Spain and Italy. Investors remained worried about the strength of an economic
recovery after a surprise drop in British manufacturing activity
last month and a sharp fall in consumer lending in July. ""Today's numbers have shown that there could still be a few
bumps left along the way for the UK economy, but as far as stock
markets are concerned, the mood for shares is still positive,""
said David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index. ""We have seen a couple of days of weakness around the world,
but for now there still seem to be enough buyers happy to step
in and provide support. It looks premature to start worrying
about a bigger correction.""  DEFENSIVES MAY GAIN  Analysts said that cyclical stocks such as financials might
suffer going forward, but defensive shares might be in demand. ""The strong rebound in cyclicals, which are now at
relatively high valuation, will lose steam and stocks seen as
more defensive, which have been shunned by investors this year,
will take the lead,"" said Francois Chevallier, strategist at
Banque Leonardo. Stocks in the FTSEurofirst 300 index now trade at 13.11
times expected earnings, according to Reuters data -- a level
not seen since July 2007, just before fears over banks' balance
sheets started to derail the market's 4-1/2-year bull run. Energy stocks lost ground after crude oil prices fell nearly
2 percent. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol,
Total and StatoilHydro were down 0.8-3.1 percent. Miners were also lower. BHP Billiton, Anglo American,
Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and ENRC fell 2.6-4.9 percent. Vivendi, Europe's largest entertainment group, rose 1.1
percent after it delivered forecast-beating second-quarter
profits and ruled out reviving talks with Kuwaiti telecoms firm
Zain. Eiffage fell 9.3 percent after the French public works group
posted a sharp drop in earnings and cut its revenue outlook for
2009. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 fell 1.8-2.5 percent. ""Maybe the market is just a bit uncomfortable at having
progressed non-stop against a background of incredibly good
newsflow,"" said Mike Lenhoff, strategist at Brewin Dolphin.(Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson in Paris; editing by

territory and with financials taking the most points off the
index. By 1025 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 1.3 percent at 922.74 points.The index has
risen almost 43 percent since reaching a lifetime low in March
and is up nearly 11 percent for the year. ""There is a bit of a follow through from Asia and the fact
that these markets do need to have a bit of a sell-off ... the
markets were looking overbought and in need of a correction,""
said Mike Lenhoff, a strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""I do not think it is going to go very far. If anything the
supporting news flow is still very positive and interest rates
are going to remain where they are. But the markets have gone
far enough in a very short space of time and are in need of a
pause."" China's stock market closed down 4.3 percent as investors
bailed out of the market, disappointed that authorities did not
take steps to support the market after the key index fell 20
percent from two weeks ago.    In Europe, banks took the most
points off the index. HSBC, Banco Santander, BNP Paribas,
Barclays and UniCredit were down between 2.2 and 3.2 percent.
HSBC traded on ex-dividend. Insurers were in the doldrums. Allianz lost 2.2 percent
after it said it would reach its sales goals in Asia and eastern
Europe later than planned due to the financial crisis. Axa, Swiss Re and RSA Insurance slipped 1.5 to 1.7 percent.  VOLKSWAGEN FALLS Carmakers were among the heavyweight losers. Volkswagen fell
6.5 percent as traders pointed to reports of increased
short-positioning in Europe's largest carmaker. Porsche bucked the trend and gained 6.2 percent as Exane BNP
Paribas upgraded the group to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"". Miners slipped as metal prices retreated on concerns over
the pace of the recovery. Copper was down 1.7 percent, aluminium
 fell 1.9 percent and nickel was 0.6 percent lower. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and
Xstrata were down between 0.4 and 2 percent. However, Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation was up 7
percent. The company posted a sharp fall in first half earnings
but the drop was smaller than expected and the miner predicted
further recovery in the second half thanks to demand from China.

recovery and the realisation of this will take the heat out of
the market. Earnings forecasts are still too high,"" said Heino
Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in Frankfurt. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 percent,

 By Brian Gorman LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - European shares fell to their
lowest close in more than two weeks on Monday, as investors took
profits, worrying that a recent rally was not supported by
economic data. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 2
percent to 921.96 points, the lowest close since July 29. The
index posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since July 2. The heavyweight banking sector took most points off the
index. Banco Santander, Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC, UBS and
UniCredit fell between 1.9 and 3.8 percent.  ""The market is too far ahead of the economy,"" said
Giuseppe-Guido Amato, strategist at Lang & Schwarz. ""We are not
there (in recovery) yet. We have stopped the patient bleeding
but the cancer is still there.""  ""The only good thing is liquidity and the underinvestment of
institutions. There comes a point where they must invest,"" he
added. But the benchmark index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008,
is still up 42.8 percent from its lifetime low of March 9. Figures from Friday showing a further deterioration in U.S.
consumer confidence overshadowed two more upbeat reports on
Monday. Japan became the third G7 country after Germany and France
to pull out of recession. A gauge of manufacturing in New York State moved into
positive territory in August, suggesting growth in the sector
for the first time since November 2007. The New York Federal
Reserve said the ""Empire State"" general business conditions
index rose to plus 12.08 from minus 0.55 in July. Economists
polled by Reuters had expected a figure of 3.00.  British Land, reported last week to be a bid target, fell
3.3 percent, ahead of results on Tuesday.   AVIVA BUCKS TREND  Insurers were also mostly lower, including France's Axa and
Germany's Allianz, down 2.4 and 2.7 percent respectively. Aviva bucked the trend, up 1.6 percent, after HSBC upgraded
it to ""neutral"", from ""underweight"" In an across-the-board sell-off, there were few other
gainers. Defensives such as drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline and
Vodafone were among the main risers, up 0.8 and 0.4 percent
respectively.
 Across Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index closed 1.5 percent lower;
Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 fell 2 and 2.2 percent
respectively. On Wall Street, The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite
 were down between 1.7 and 2.4 percent around the time European
bourses were closing. ""Signs of anaemia in the economic recovery are catalysing
some profit taking, but I don't think it is a matter of concern.
You can't just expect every single boat in the sea to be lifted
off by this rising tide,"" said Andrew Bell, head of research at
Rensburg Sheppards. ""We either needed to see a pause for breath because we are
not in an economic boom or perhaps we need to see a rotation
from the companies most exposed to the recovery story."" Worries about the worldwide economy saw crude oil slip more
than 2.5 percent to less than $66 a barrel. Metals prices also
fell.  Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Lonmin,
Rio Tinto, Vedanta Resources , Xstrata fell between 3.2 and 5.6
percent. Energy companies to fall included BP, Royal Dutch Shell,
 Repsol, Total and StatoilHydro, down between 1 and 2.5 percent. Volkswagen ordinary shares fell 9.9 percent, with traders
pointing towards speculation that Porsche may own more options
in the automaker than the block controlling a 17 percent VW
stake that it agreed to sell to Qatar Holding LLC on Friday. Porsche rose 3.1 percent.

Wednesday after slipping in the past two days, with impressive
results from E.ON boosting utilities and banks up ahead of
Federal Reserve statements on the state of the U.S. economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.1
percent at 942.06 points. The index, which slumped 45 percent
last year, is up 13 percent in 2009 and has surged 46 percent
since March's lifetime low. Germany's E.ON rose 5.4 percent after the world's largest
utility said it saw signs that demand for energy was stabilising
after a prolonged slump and tweaked its 2009 outlook higher
after first-half profits beat forecasts. ""For the reminder of this year, this kind of profitability
story is the main driver for people to revise next year's
earnings forecasts higher and that's positive for the market,""
said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers. ""Equity markets could easily go higher by about 5 percent in
the short term,"" he added. The DJ STOXX European Utilities Index was among the top
sectoral gainers, up 2.6 percent. GDF SUEZ, Centrica, RWE and
Severn Trent advanced between 1 percent and 4.3 percent. Financial stocks were also among significant gainers ahead
of the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting
committee meeting at 1815 GMT, which is expected to hold its
benchmark overnight rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent. The DJ STOXX banking index was up 1.3 percent, while
Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas and Natixis rose
between 2.1 and 5.4 percent. ""I don't think you are going to get anything negative out of
the Fed today. What you want to see is a central bank that is
not going to take any risks on the deflationary side and
withdraw policy earlier,"" said Bernard McAlinden, a strategist
at NCB Stockbrokers. UBS AG gained 3.1 percent after news that the Swiss bank and
the U.S. government have agreed to settle a long-running dispute
over the disclosure of names of wealthy American bank clients
suspected of tax evasion. Britain's Lloyds was up 6.4 percent. The bank said it would
sell the bulk of its Insight Investment unit to Bank of New York
Mellon for 235 million pounds ($386 million) as part of a
shake-up of its asset management units.  EUPHORIA Investors digested a slew of economic news. The Bank of
England said Britain's worst recession in decades would end
early next year, but it would take time for the gross domestic
product (GDP) to return to pre-crisis levels, pushing
unemployment up from the current 13-year high. ""There is a kind of euphoria starting to build in. The
markets are ignoring negative news and much more focusing on
positive news,"" Wenzel said. The U.S. trade deficit widened in June to $27 billion, as
goods imports rose for the first time in 11 months, and euro
zone industrial output fell in June against May, defying
expectations of a small rise. Commodity shares were in demand as crude and metals prices
rose. Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total and
StatoilHydro added 1.6 to 4.9 percent. Among miners, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Antofagasta and
Xstrata rose 0.5-2.8 percent. Volkswagen and Porsche were up 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent,
respectively. They have broadly agreed on details for a deal to
combine two of Europe's automakers, two VW supervisory board
members told Reuters. Among the losers, Nestle, the world's biggest food group,
fell 4.4 percent as the company pared its full-year outlook
after missing forecasts with first-half organic sales growth of
3.5 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were up 1-1.5 percent.

267,"Aug 11, 2009 04:06AM ET","UPDATE 5-Resolution in $3.1 bln Friends buy, seeks more deals",nan," * Resolution unveils recommended offer worth 79.4p per share * Cash and share deal at 6 percent premium to Monday close * Resolution's Cowdery eyes at least 2 other deals * Friends Provident H1 profit misses forecast * Friends shares up 1.1 percent, Resolution down 3.6 percent 
 (Adds further Cowdery comment, detail) By Myles Neligan and Clara Ferreira-Marques LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain's Resolution, an
acquisition vehicle founded by tycoon Clive Cowdery, clinched
the first of a hoped-for trio of deals with the 1.86 billion
pound ($3.1 billion) takeover of insurer Friends Provident. Resolution, created last year to buy life insurers and asset
managers, said on Tuesday Friends Provident's management had
backed an improved bid giving shareholders 0.9 Resolution shares
per Friends share, a month after rejecting an initial offer. Cowdery told reporters Resolution was looking for at least
two more acquisitions which would be merged with Friends and
floated on the stock market after two to three years of
restructuring.  The group's next takeover targets would probably be life
insurers rather than asset managers and could include local
subsidiaries of foreign insurers and local subsidiaries of banks
or large British insurers that may not wish to continue to focus
on the UK market, Cowdery said on a conference call. Future deals would be financed by raising funds from
shareholders, Cowdery said, estimating the group's 660 million
pound stock market listing in December had raised only a fifth
of the total sum investors were willing to commit. ""We remain confident that there is substantial capital that
can be attracted into the restructuring of the life sector,"" he
said.  PROFITS SLUMP Resolution's bid values Friends -- Britain's sixth-biggest
life insurer and an acquisition target since it demutualised and
listed in 2001 -- at 79.4 pence per share, a 6 percent premium
to Monday's closing price, but little more than a third of the
225 pence at which it was floated. Friends, which also reported a lower-than-expected first
half profit, saw its shares rise 1.1 percent to 75.9 pence by
1155 GMT, off earlier highs, while Resolution shed 3.6 percent
to 85.25 pence. Manoj Ladwa, a senior trader at ETX Capital, said
Resolution's potential targets included Scottish Widows, the
life business of Lloyds Banking Group Plc and the British life
units of companies such as Prudential Plc, Aegon NV, Axa and
Zurich Financial Services. ""There's a lot of rumours flying about. The one that I would
give a bit more credence to would be the life companies
belonging to Lloyds,"" said Shore Capital analyst Eamonn
Flanagan, citing forthcoming capital rule changes which could
prevent Lloyds from counting its life businesses towards its
capital base.
 PAY DEAL The Friends buy marks a critical first deal for Cowdery's
Resolution as it seeks to exploit an anticipated bout of
insurance industry consolidation, driven by falling sales due to
a weak economy, stricter capital rules and tax changes. Resolution also said it was considering changes to its top
executives' pay arrangements, which had been cited as an
obstacle to a deal with Friends Provident. Resolution executives currently stand to get 10 percent of
any profit on its takeovers over and above the risk-free rate,
based on the yield on three-month government bonds. This hurdle rate may be replaced because efforts by the Bank
of England to stimulate the economy have caused a sharp drop in
the risk-free rate this year, tilting the pay structure in the
executives' favour, Cowdery said. Resolution and Friends started talks in July but broke them
off the same month. A source close to the matter said pressure
from shareholders pushed Friends into allowing due diligence
only two days later. Friends posted a 38 percent drop in first-half underlying
profit to 131 million pounds, missing a consensus forecast of
148 million based on seven analyst estimates. The insurer
maintained its dividend. Friends shareholders will be given the option of taking a
cash payment for up to 2,500 of their shares, to a maximum total
value of 500 million pounds.

268,"Aug 07, 2009 05:18AM ET","UPDATE 3-Allianz Q2 beats forecasts, non-life disappoints",nan," * Q2 net profit 1.87 bln eur vs poll average 1.61 bln eur * Expects P&C combined ratio to improve in H2 * Prepared for market with structurally lower returns -CEO * Diversified enough to benefit from market upturn -CEO  * Shares erase losses to close up nearly 1 percent 
(Adds comments from CFO, detail, closing share price) By Jonathan Gould FRANKFURT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Improving financial markets
helped net profit at Germany's Allianz rise by nearly a quarter
though a set-back in property and casualty insurance worried
investors. Net second quarter profit at Europe's biggest insurer
swelled to 1.9 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from 1.5 billion in
the year-earlier quarter, beating forecasts as writedowns
diminished in the wake of a broad markets rally. But analysts and investors zeroed in on a sharp fall in
profitability at Allianz's main money spinner, its property and
casualty business, worrying about a rise in claims and costs
relative to premiums earned, known as the combined ratio.  ""The most important figure in our opinion is the somewhat
disappointing combined ratio,"" said DZ Bank analyst Thorsten
Wenzel in a research note, saying that he was reviewing his
""buy"" recommendation on the stock. Allianz shares fell by more than 4 percent and were the
biggest decliners on Frankfurt's blue chip DAX index before
turning positive late in the trading day. The share closed up 0.9 percent at 76.15 euros, in line with
the DJ Stoxx index of European insurance shares. Other European insurers such as France's AXA, Zurich
Financial Services, Aviva, and RSA all turned in above-expected
earnings performance this week that gave their shares a fillip. Allianz's property and casualty division combined ratio
jumped to 98.9 percent in April-June from 93.5 percent in the
year-earlier quarter as a slew of small damage claims and rising
expenses ate into profit. Operating profit in the division nearly halved to 895
million euros, falling below earnings at the smaller life and
health division for the first time in company history. ""If I compare ourselves to the competition, we don't have a
loss ratio problem, we have an expense ratio problem,"" Chief
Financial Officer Helmut Perlet told a call with analysts. Perlet said the company was working to trim costs and would
also raise prices in some markets, forecasting an improving
combined ratio in the second half of the year that would put a
ratio of 97 percent for the full year within reach. Analysts said high-tech pattern-recognition technology had
helped alert insurers to potentially fraudulent claims.  NEW NORMAL Chief Executive Michael Diekmann said Allianz was strongly
capitalised and able to withstand market shocks, echoing
comments from French rival AXA earlier this week. Allianz was also girding itself for a new era following the
financial market crisis, where mature markets would see lower
growth, emerging economies would play a bigger role in profits
and scale would become decisive for insurance players. ""Allianz is prepared for what we perceive as 'the new
normal', an ongoing challenging market environment with
structurally lower returns,"" Diekmann said in a statement. ""We are well diversified from both a regional and business
unit point of view, and are thus able to benefit from a market
upturn,"" he added. Like other insurance players, Allianz benefited from
rebounding financial markets and a more conservative investment
strategy. Writedowns on investments such as debt and equities fell
sharply, totalling 144 million euros compared with 506 million
in the second quarter of last year. Realised gains fell less
than 10 percent. Allianz reported improvements in life and health insurance,
where investment results and a 10 percent rise in premium income
helped boost operating profit in the segment by 40 percent. Its stock has fallen by 1.5 percent from the start of the
year, lagging a 5 percent rise the DJ Stoxx insurance index. According to StarMine, which weights analysts' forecasts
according to their track record, Allianz trades at 7.6 times
12-month forward earnings, making it cheaper than French rival
AXA, which trades at a multiple of 8.7.  ($1=.6954 Euro)

269,"Aug 06, 2009 08:12AM ET",Europe stocks up; ECB leaves rates unchanged,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index up 1 percent * ECB leaves rates unchanged * BoE raises quantiative easing * Earnings results push banks, insurers higher  By Joanne Frearson LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday
as the ECB left interest rates unchanged and the Bank of England
extended its quantitative easing programme to 175 billion
sterling, with banks boosted by results from KBC and insurer
Aviva. By 1154 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 1 percent at 943.57 points, having been up as much
as 945.47 points earlier. The European Central Bank kept its main refinancing rate
unchanged at a record low of 1 percent as it waits to see the
impact of efforts so far to revive the economy and credit flows.
 In the UK, the Bank of England extended its quantitative
easing programme, raising the size of its bond purchase scheme
to an unexpectedly large 175 billion pounds, from 125 billion,
and held interest rates at 0.5 percent. The decision enables the central bank to continue its
programme of asset purchases with newly created money -- which
it started in March to boost Britain's recession-hit economy --
as the last of the 125 billion pounds was spent in late July. ""The market came off a bit initially as it was not what the
market was expecting and investors started to panic. But the
market over the past couple of months has rallied over the Bank
of England's quantitative easing programme and this is just a
continuation of that,"" a London-based trader said. Banks added the most points to the index, although stocks
were mixed. Belgian banking and insurance group KBC surged 19.4
percent after it returned to profit in the second quarter,
following three straight quarterly losses. ""Financials remain the focus, the general view is if banks
are starting to show less bad results then the market view seems
to be that things are getting better,"" said Peter Dixon,
economist at Commerzbank. French bank Natixis rose 15.7 percent following market
rumours that it might be delisted. Among other banks Barclays, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse
 and Banco Santander were up 1.6-7.2 percent. However, Commerzbank retreated from earlier gains and was
down 0.2 percent. The bank's second-quarter operating results
beat analyst expectations, but it said it is reviewing whether

midday on Thursday as the Bank of England raised quantitative
easing to 175 billion pounds ($297.3 billion), with financials
boosted by results from KBC and British insurer Aviva. By 1119 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was up 0.9 percent at 942.49 points, having been up as
much as 945.47 points. The Bank of England extended its quantitative easing
programme, raising the size of its bond purchase scheme to an
unexpectedly large 175 billion pounds from 125 billion, and held
interest rates at 0.5 percent. The decision enables the central bank to continue its
programme of asset purchases with newly created money -- which
it started in March to boost Britain's recession-hit economy --
as the last of the 125 billion pounds was spent in late July. ""The market came off a bit initially as it was not what the
market was expecting and investors started to panic. But the
market over the past couple of months has rallied over the Bank
of England's quantitative easing programme and this is just a
continuation of that,"" a London-based trader said. At 1145 GMT, the European Central Bank is expected to keep
interest rates on hold at 1.0 percent for the third month in a
row as it waits to see the impact of efforts so far to revive
the economy and credit flows. ""Financials remain the focus, the general view is if banks
are starting to show less-bad results then the market view seems
to be that things are getting better,"" said Peter Dixon,
economist at Commerzbank. Banks added the most points to the index, although stocks in
the sector were mixed. Belgian banking and insurance group KBC
surged 16.9 percent after it returned to profit in the second
quarter, following three straight quarterly losses. French bank Natixis rose 17.9 percent following market
speculation it might be delisted. Among other banks Barclays, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse
 and Banco Santander were up 1.1 to 4.6 percent. However, Commerzbank retreated from earlier gains to be down
2 percent. The bank's second-quarter operating results beat
analyst expectations, but it said it is reviewing whether to use
the ""bad bank"" scheme.  RESULTS BOOST INSURERS Insurers were boosted by a slew of positive earnings.
Britain's Aviva rose 7.2 percent after it announced a dividend
cut less than some market players had expected and a partially
initial public offering of its Delta Lloyd. Swiss insurer Zurich Financial Services gained 2.4 percent
after it said its capital position was strong and it remained
confident it was well positioned in the financial crisis as it
beat second-quarter earnings expectations. AXA ticked up 1.3 percent after it posted a
smaller-than-expected decline in first-half earnings and said it
was ready to face any further downturn in the market. Food producers were among high movers. Unilever gained 6.4
percent after beating consensus expectations with a 4.1 percent
rise in second-quarter underlying sales and making a

 By Atul Prakash LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - European shares ended lower on Wednesday after staying in
positive territory during most of the day, with investors selling stocks, following data
showing the U.S. services sector contracted more than expected in July. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.6 percent lower at 934.47
points, hovering in a wide range of 931.11 to 946.70 points, after hitting a nine-month high
on Monday. Stronger-than-feared corporate earnings have helped the FTSEurofirst 300 to climb about 15
percent since July 10. The index is now up 45 percent since its lifetime low in March, but is
still down 43 percent from its multi-year peak in mid-2007. Energy stocks were among top decliners, also under pressure because of weaker crude prices
. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol, Total and StatoilHydro shed between 0.8
percent and 3.9 percent. ""Whether you're cautious or cautiously optimistic of a sustained recovery ... there is a
sense that after the recent strong climb to the current plateau, now is the time to take a
completely justified breather at this check-point before ideally pressing on to new heights,""
said Anthony Grech, strategist at IG Index. Miners also lost ground. BHP Billiton, Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Eurasian
Natural Resources fell 0.7-1.9 percent. The stock market slipped after data showed the Institute for Supply Management's services
index fell to 46.4 last month from 47.0 in June, below economists' forecast for a rise to
48.0. The dividing line between growth and contraction is 50. News that U.S. private employers axed more jobs in July also dampened sentiment and
overshadowed figures showing that new orders received by U.S. factories unexpectedly rose in
June.   ""In the very short term, it would be understandable if we went through a period of calm
after a tremendous rally,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. ""But in the longer term, I see equity markets rising further from the current levels. The
second-quarter reporting season has gone very well and analysts have been increasing their
forecasts,"" he added.  According to Thomson Reuters data, so far 146 companies in the DJ STOXX 600 have reported
their quarterly results in the current earnings season, of which 75 beat estimates, 2 matched
and 69 missed the estimates.  FINANCIALS ADVANCE On the positive side, shares in Societe Generale jumped 6 percent after it posted a
smaller-than-expected drop in second-quarter profits, helped by a surprisingly small bad debt
provisions and an investment banking recovery. AXA gained 1.7 percent after Europe's second largest insurer by market value posted a
smaller-than-expected drop in half-year earnings. Lloyds Banking Group jumped 10.6 percent after it fanned hopes for an imminent end to
Britain's UK real estate debt drought. It said that impairments in its multi-billion pound
commercial mortgage book had peaked. Other banks also advanced, with Standard Chartered , Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS
 and Commerzbank gaining 1.1-4.4 percent. Shares in German stock and derivatives market operator Deutsche Boerse fell more than 6
percent after the exchange published disappointing second-quarter figures late on Tuesday

 * UK services sector grows at fastest pace in 17 months
 (Updates with U.S. outlook, prices) By Ian Chua LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks clawed back early
losses on Wednesday while lower risk government bonds sagged
after upbeat economic reports and corporate earnings reinforced
views that the worst of the global recession may be over. But with two major central banks' policy meetings and key
U.S. labour data looming, investors mostly held their fire,
keeping a rein on the recent equity and commodity markets'
rally. U.S. stock futures pointed to a subdued start on Wall
Street, a day after the S&P 500 index ended at a nine-month
closing high above 1,000 for a second day running. Data showing British services sector unexpectedly surged in
July to grow at its fastest pace in more than a year underpinned
hopes the global economic recession may be losing its grip. In the euro zone, the deep slowdown in the services sector
eased in July further supporting the recovery theme, although
retail sales in June fell unexpectedly. ""The data surprised on the upside which is good news for the
UK economy as it indicates we're in for a slow grind of recovery
rather than a rapid contraction,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at
Commerzbank. MSCI's main world stock index recovered from an early fall
to be a touch firmer on the day at 271.84, not far off a
10-month peak of 272.33 hit the previous session. The index has
gained nearly 60 percent since plumbing a trough in March. European share markets rose with the FTSEurofirst 300 index
of top regional shares advancing 0.5 percent. London's FTSE also
gained 0.5 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.2
percent. Financial stocks led the rise after AXA, Europe's
second-biggest insurer by market capitalisation and French bank
Societe Generale posted results that beat forecasts, sending
their share prices up more than 5 percent. and Among commodities, U.S. crude oil traded at $71.40 a barrel,
not far off the recent high above $72 and copper was at $6,133 a
tonne, having earlier hit a new 10-month peak of $6,151. While the European Central Bank and Bank of England are
widely expected to keep interest rates at record lows of 1.0
percent and 0.5 percent respectively on Thursday, investors are
keen to see if both central banks will sound more upbeat about
the outlook and whether further stimulus measures will be added. The recent string of upbeat data, however, may keep the BoE
from expanding its stimulus programme, some analysts said.
Reflecting that view, interest-rate sensitive short sterling
futures fell across the 2010 strip, pushing implied yields
higher. Ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday,
investors will get a reading of U.S. private sector employment
as well as the U.S. services sector for July later in the day.  DOLLAR STEADIER The dollar was steadier against a basket of major currencies
having plumbed a 10-month low this week as improving risk
appetite drove investors in search of higher yielding currencies
such as the Australian dollar. ""Data today has the capability to spur a spike lower, but we
suspect it will be difficult to extend things in a sustained way
with key events such as meetings at the BoE and ECB, and
non-farm payrolls looming,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of
global foreign exchange strategy at Calyon. ""Instead, the market would likely prefer a pause and some
consolidation before embarking on a renewed attempt
to drive new levels."" The dollar index was a touch lower on the day at 77.651.
Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at 95.26 yen,
while the euro edged up 0.1 percent to 137.34 yen. The euro
edged up 0.1 percent versus the dollar to $1.4414. Sterling was a clear winner, rising 0.6 percent to $1.7034. Lower-risk assets such as government bonds erased earlier
gains and fell on the back of the upbeat data, pushing yields
higher. The euro zone's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose 3 basis
points on the day to 3.386 percent, while the equivalent U.S.
yield climbed 3 basis points to 3.720 percent. ""The UK data suggests recovery may already be underway,""
said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital. ""That's knocked the gilt market and has dragged Bunds down
as well, particularly at the short-end as the market worries
that the Bank of England will start tightening sooner than the
Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.""

around midday on Wednesday, rising for the 14th time in 18
sessions as forecast-beating results from Societe Generale and
Axa fuelled hopes of an earnings recovery. At 1100 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.5 percent at 944.19 points, led by strong gains
in financials. Shares in Societe Generale soared 5.7 percent after the bank
posted a smaller-than-expected drop in second-quarter profits,
helped by a surprisingly small bad debt provisions and an
investment banking recovery. Axa soared 5.6 percent after Europe's second largest insurer
by market value posted a smaller-than-expected drop in half-year
earnings. ""There is still room on the upside for stocks, because the
credit market has been coming back to normal,"" said Jean-Claude
Petit, head of equities at Barclays Wealth Managers France. European credit spreads, reflected in indexes such as the
investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index as well as the
Markit iTraxx Crossover index, have sharply tightened since
March. ""But mainly, the recent corporate earnings show that in the
most difficult times, companies have managed to scale down costs
and capital expenditures,"" Petit said. ""That means the results are better-than-expected and people
are now expecting that, as soon as the economic recovery
materialises, corporate results will improve faster than
previously thought.""  MORE BEATS THAN MISSED According to Thomson Reuters data, so far 146 companies in
DJ STOXX 600 have reported their quarterly results in the
current earnings season, of which 75 beat estimates, 2 matched
and 69 missed the estimates. The second-quarter overall earnings growth rate for the
STOXX 600 improved to minus 36.4 percent on Tuesday close from
minus 40.4 percent a week ago. Stronger-than-feared corporate earnings have given a second
wind to a stock rally that wilted in June after a 38 percent
gain in the FTSEurofirst 300 from its record low reached in
early March. Europe's benchmark index, now up 46 percent since its March
floor, has surged 16 percent since July 10. But it is still down
42 percent from its multi-year peak touched in mid-2007. Across Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.3 percent,
Germany's DAX was up 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 0.6
percent. Adidas added 6 percent as investors rewarded the sports
equipment company's consensus-beating quarterly results and its
plans to revamp its Reebok brand. European airlines rose sharply, with British Airways up 8.1
percent and Lufthansa up 8.6 percent, after their American peers
reported robust July traffic figures and Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific posted first-half profits, traders said. On the downside, shares of oil majors lost ground as crude
prices dipped. Repsol fell 0.7 percent and BP dropped 0.5
percent. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on
U.S. ADP employment figures, due at 1215 GMT, ahead of key U.S.
monthly jobs data due on Friday, as well as on ISM data, due at
1400 GMT. ""Should the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing index climb to 49

expectations that the U.S. recession is coming to an end,""

 (Adds analyst comment, details, background) By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Jason Rhodes PARIS/ZURICH, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Axa, Europe's second-largest
insurer, was wary over the sector outlook, despite smashing
profit forecasts, while a shock earnings slump at reinsurer
Swiss Re underlined the need for caution. Analysts said that half-year results from the pair on
Wednesday demonstrated that a market rebound since March has not
banished the insurance sector's problems, and warned that the
market rally could prove to be short-lived. ""I think that of the insurers that have reported so far in
the second quarter, some have benefited from improvements in the
financial markets, but older problems are only now clouding the
reported picture,"" said Standard & Poor's Equity Research
analyst Mark Nicholson. ""We've had a good run for a few months, but it would be
premature to say this is going to continue.""  REDUCED IMPACT Axa said tighter credit spreads had reduced the hit from
falling asset values in the first six months of 2009 by 819
million euros compared with a year earlier. That helped it post a half-year net income of 1.32 billion
euros, down 39 percent compared with last year, but comfortably
ahead of the mean forecast of 896 million euros in a Reuters
poll of 10 analysts. AXA shares rose as much as 5.4 percent to 16.14 euros in
early trading, their highest since January, but later pared
gains to close 1.6 percent higher. The French insurer, nonetheless, remained cautious regarding
its future prospects, saying only that while it was ready to
reap the benefits of a market rebound, it was also prepared to
cope with another slump. ""We are prepared to withstand a further possible market
downturn and we are well positioned to benefit from a market
upturn,"" Axa chairman Henri de Castries said in a statement.  LOSING STREAK Swiss Re, forced last year to sell convertible securities to
billionaire investor Warren Buffett after the U.S. subprime
mortgage meltdown tore holes in its balance sheet, illustrated
the dangers of calling the all-clear too soon. The reinsurer reported a surprise net loss of 381 million
Swiss francs for the second quarter after absorbing charges
totalling 2.1 billion Swiss francs. That missed by a wide margin the 139 million Swiss franc
profit expected by analysts, according to the average of 12
estimates collected by Reuters. While the charges largely comprised mark-to-market losses
related to a corporate bond hedging programme, they also
included a further 600 million Swiss francs in impairments on
asset-backed securities. ""These things do tick away in the background, and it can
take several quarters for them to work their way through the
accounts,"" Nicholson of Standard & Poor's Equity Research said. Swiss Re shares closed 2.1 percent lower at 42.48 Swiss
francs. European insurance stocks fell steeply in the first quarter
of the year on concerns falling equity markets and rising
corporate bond defaults could eat into insurers' capital,
potentially forcing rights issues. But the shares have since rebounded, helped by a broader
financial market recovery, and the DJ Stoxx European insurance
index is now flat compared with the beginning of the year.  CHALLENGING ECONOMY Standard Life, Britain's fourth-biggest life insurer, and
Anglo-South African rival Old Mutual, on Wednesday also struck a
cautious note on the outlook after reporting half year results
broadly in line with forecasts. Standard Life said that while financial markets had
strengthened, ""the economic environment continues to be
challenging,"" and warned that the outlook for retail savings was
set to remain ""subdued"". Old Mutual, hit last year by hefty losses at its U.S. life
business, said it was only now in a position to ""look past
theimmediate market challenges and begin to position ourselves
for the upside which will come as markets recover."" Standard Life shares closed 1.9 percent lower after the
company reported a half-year operating profit down 35 percent on
the year at 348 million pounds. Analysts had expected 338 million pounds, according to the
average of 11 estimates collected by the company. Old Mutual had pretax profit on an International Financial
Reporting Standard basis down 30 percent on the year at 538
million pounds, compared with the 555 million pounds pencilled
in by analysts. Shares in the company settled 1.2 percent
higher.

a breather on Wednesday while the dollar hovered near its 2009
lows with two major central banks' policy meetings and key U.S.

60 percent since hitting a trough in March. European shares were little changed with the FTSEurofirst
300 index of top regional shares up 0.1 percent. Earlier,
Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.2 percent. ""The market continues to be in a phase of cooling down a bit
and the clear focus today will be on macroeconomic data in the
United States later in the day,"" said Commerzbank's chief
strategist, Hans-Juergen Delp. ""Company earnings only seem to play a vital role when they
massively exceed or miss expectations,"" he said. Economic reports and corporate earnings continued to bolster
expectations that the global recession is past its worst phase. AXA, Europe's second-biggest insurer by market
capitalisation and French bank Societe Generale posted results
that beat forecasts, sending their share prices up more than 4
percent. and A closely-watched survey showed the deep recession in the
euro zone services economy had eased in July, although firms cut
jobs faster than previously thought. See Ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday,
investors will get a reading of U.S. private sector employment
as well as the U.S. services sector for July later in the day.  DOLLAR STEADIER The dollar was steady against a basket of major currencies
having plumbed a 10-month low this week as improving risk
appetite drove investors in search of higher yielding currencies
such as the Australian dollar. ""Data today has the capability to spur a spike lower, but we
suspect it will be difficult to extend things in a sustained way
with key events such as meetings at the BoE and ECB, and
non-farm payrolls looming,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of
global foreign exchange strategy at Calyon. ""Instead, the market would likely prefer a pause and some
consolidation before embarking on a renewed attempt
to drive new levels."" The dollar index was a touch lower on the day at 77.706.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 94.95 yen,
while the euro eased 0.4 percent to 136.66 yen. The euro was
down 0.1 percent versus the dollar at $1.4391. Lower-risk assets such as government bonds perked up,
driving yields slightly lower. The euro zone's benchmark 10-year Bund yield shed 0.3 basis
points on the day to 3.328 percent, while the equivalent U.S.
yield slid 0.2 basis points to 3.669 percent.

278,"Aug 03, 2009 11:08AM ET",NEWSMAKER-Art fan Fischer plans to add Opel to RHJ collection,nan," By Christiaan Hetzner and Philip Blenkinsop FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Leonhard Fischer may be a passionate collector of
modern art, but the head of RHJ International has not added to the Belgian private equity
firm's gallery of assets since he joined in late 2007. Loss-making European carmaker Opel might not be your average masterpiece, but beating out
heavily favoured Magna to win the bid would be a master stroke for Fischer and his hitherto
little-known European spinoff of U.S. leveraged buyout fund Ripplewood Holdings. Colleagues say the 46-year-old Fischer has all the skills necessary to restructure the
former General Motors unit successfully and sell the company off at a substantial profit.
""Lenny Fischer is highly intelligent and an excellent dealmaker -- someone who has a nose
for where money can be made,"" said a person who knows the former banker well. Some mistake the RHJ CEO's inherent distaste for fitting in with the mainstream as
diva-like behaviour, though. ""He does not adapt himself to conventions, either in his thinking or his actions,"" the
person added.  Fischer, who might be found wandering the museums and galleries in London in his spare
time, is not just another suit who lives only for his job, according to a former employee. ""People are quickly labelled, but you cannot reduce Lenny Fischer to a deal-obsessed
investment banker. Just because he began as a trader at JP Morgan doesn't mean by a long shot
that he is one forever,"" the ex-staffer said. Born in a small German town near the Dutch border, the oldest of three siblings, Fischer
was viewed as a wunderkind in the banking community, but this distinction may not always have
helped when competing with other alpha male egos. The youngest executive to enter the Dresdner Bank board at the age of just 36, he left
after clashing with colleagues and was eventually hired by ex-Credit Suisse CEO Oswald Gruebel
to overhaul the lender's Winterthur unit following a failed auction of the Swiss insurer. ""There were a lot of people who wrongly believed that someone who came from investment
banking over at Dresdner Kleinwort could not do it, but Fischer achieved this with bravura,""
his erstwhile employee said. He earned high marks with the 12.3 billion Swiss franc ($11.5 billion) disposal of
Winterthur to AXA, but was passed over in favour of Brady Dougan as successor to Gruebel. Fischer defected to RHJ, where Ripplewood founder Tim Collins was in need of a proven
turnaround specialist with strong experience in Europe's financial services industry. He now works out of a small Zurich office that complements the roughly dozen people in the
Brussels headquarters of RHJ, which has about 60 percent of its invested capital in three main
auto parts suppliers -- none of which made Automotive News's last annual ranking of the
world's 100 biggest parts suppliers.  POLITICALLY INCORRECT  Despite his connections in Berlin and Frankfurt, Fischer's first big deal fell through 12
months ago when German state development bank KfW picked U.S. private equity group Lone Star
over RHJ to buy stricken lender IKB -- the country's first subprime casualty. RHJ's audacious bid for Opel comes at a time when German politicians have condemned
risk-hungry investment bankers, hedge funds and leveraged buyout firms for the ""casino
capitalism"" that led to a near meltdown in the financial system last year. Fischer himself offered a very frank reckoning of his craft in April when he admitted in a
Handelsblatt interview that his industry had ""collectively disgraced"" itself. ""We failed in our most important field, risk management, and indeed to a degree that is
very difficult to grasp,"" he said. ""In the last 15 years, it was a widely held assumption that one could model the risks of a
complicated investment product or a bank's balance sheet with the same precision and
forecasting probability as scientific processes. This over-mathematisation was a colossal and
catastrophic failure,"" Fischer concluded. While GM's chief Opel negotiator has signalled he could sign a deal with RHJ immediately,
the private equity firm still needs to convince Germany to dump its support for Canadian group
Magna and fork out as much as 3.8 billion euros ($5.41 billion) in state aid. Berlin already jilted RHJ once in May, reportedly after Fischer offered a politically
incorrect explanation why a company with no experience building cars wanted to acquire Opel. Pointing to the billions in likely guarantees, he was reported to have said candidly: ""We
had a look at the asymmetric distribution of risks and then decided that we could wager this
bet.""

279,"Jul 23, 2009 11:32AM ET",ANALYSIS-ING bancassurance model next big target for breakup,nan," * Central bank, managers doubt value of bancassurance model * Dutch government wants banks to be simpler and smaller * ING seen splitting in medium to long term -- fund managers * Stock's price-to-book ratio is 0.54 vs 1.05 for sector  By Gilbert Kreijger and Ben Berkowitz AMSTERDAM, July 23 (Reuters) - Dutch ING, one of the few
bank-insurance hybrids left in Europe, is seen likely to split
its operations to unlock value as the combination offers few
benefits and regulatory pressure to streamline mounts. Sources told Reuters on Thursday that ING was looking to
sell private banking operations in Europe and Asia, part of
plans to raise up to 8 billion euros by asset sales. ING
declined to comment. But analysts said the next key step, in a few years, could
be a big one: spinning off insurance into a separate, listed
unit. Europe's biggest insurer in terms of balance sheet total is
already separating management of its insurance and banking
units, but Chief Executive Jan Hommen has said this was not a
prelude to a formal split of the entity. The Dutch government is pushing for more simplicity among
banks and insurers, in which it invested more than 13 billion
euros, of which 10 billion was put into ING. Earlier this month, in a report on the nation's financial
system, the Dutch central bank indicted the bancassurance model
in fairly strong terms, offering little hope for its prospects. ""With hindsight, analysis suggests that cost synergies were
only partially realised, as banks and insurers continued to
operate for the most part as separate companies, corporate
cultures proved different, and the crisis demonstrated that risk
diversification does not hold in times of distress,"" the DNB
said. Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos, who spearheaded an
investment of 10 billion euros in ING last year to shore up
capital buffers, wants banks to be smaller and simpler. He has
nominated two supervisory board members at ING. If ING were unwound, it would mark the reversal of major
deals done in just the last 18 years, since the government
legalised single ownership of banks and insurers.
Nationale-Nederlanden combined with Postbank Groep in 1991 to
make ING. Allianz's sale of Dresdner Bank in January was the clearest
sign yet that insurance and bank businesses are moving apart,
while U.S. Citigroup has decided to divest its Primerica
insurance unit among other assets. ""I don't think there is an urgency...but it is clear that
ING is separating into a bank and insurer,"" said Folmer
Pietersma, who co-manages 120 million euros for the Robeco
Financial Equities fund, including ING.  CONGLOMERATE DISCOUNT Breaking up the group would unlock what analysts called a
""conglomerate discount"" because currently it was too difficult
to value what ING was worth. ""I think the discount to rivals is at least 10 to 15
percent, looking at price-to-book value,"" SNS Securities analyst
Maarten Altena said. A bank's price-to-book ratio measures its market value
compared to its liquidation or book value. Fund manager Fred Huibers from Dutch wealth manager Het
Haags Effektenkantoor also expected a break-up of the group,
which could happen by listing the insurance operations
separately, to boost ING's share price. ING trades at a price-to-book value of 0.54 compared to the
median of 1.05 for the DJ Stoxx European Insurance sector,
Reuters Knowledge data shows. In Europe, ING stands out in combining banking and insurance
operations. The group got 83 percent of 2008 revenue from
insurance operations. This compares to 12 percent or less for European bank rivals
HSBC, Santander and BNP Paribas, while insurance rivals Generali
 and AXA get 3 percent or less of income from banking
operations. Huibers said he saw a split as inevitable down the road. ""ING will probably become a big retail bank. That is where
their strength is, in the retail area. They've proven this
internationally with ING Direct and locally with its Postbank
unit,"" Huibers said. Analysts say the group could wait until markets improve to
effect the split because it wants a good price for assets.  For a column on ING's future click here: For more stories on banking and insurance click here: (Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)

 (Adds company, analyst comment, shares) By Rhys Jones LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - British outsourcing group Capita
 posted an 18 percent rise in first-half profit but fell short
of expectations, despite benefiting from the recession as
government and companies continue to farm out work to cut costs. Britain's biggest back-office outsourcer, which takes
payments from UK television licence holders and produces
payslips, on Thursday reported a pretax profit of 141.7 million
pounds ($232.2 million) on revenues 11 percent higher at 1.31
billion pounds for the six months to the end of June. Shares in Capita, which have risen 10 percent in the last
quarter, were down 2.7 percent at 693.50 pence at 0950GMT,
valuing the group at around 4.4 billion pounds. ""Pretax profit was below the 144.3 million pounds we
expected and with profits likely to come under pressure over the
coming months, we downgrade our pretax profit forecast to 320.3
million from 332.3 million,"" said Panmure analyst Mike Allen. Broker Seymour Pierce downgraded Capita to 'hold' from 'buy'
on worries that the tough economic climate would have a negative
effect on future contacts and next year's growth prospects. However, Chief Executive Paul Pindar expects the group to
meet analysts' consensus profit target of 320 million pounds for
the year because demand for outsourcing continues to be buoyant
across the public and private sectors. ""We certainly expect to meet analyst expectations for 2009.
I think the consensus number is sensible and would represent
around 17 percent growth which would be a reasonable performance
in this economic climate,"" Pindar told Reuters in an interview. The group, which completed nine acquisitions worth 92.7
million pounds in the first-half, said it would make more
purchases over the next six months. ""There are acquisition opportunities we are doing due
diligence on as we speak so I think you will see further
acquisition activity from us in the second half. There will be a
focus on IT and financial services,"" said Pindar. Capita, which also collects business taxes and handles
medical calls for insurance companies, expects to grow its
revenues from central government in the near future as pressure
to cut costs mounts. ""Central government has been slower to respond to budgetary
pressures than local government but that is changing. In the
first half our share of turnover from central government crept
up to 11 percent from 10 percent and I see that trend continuing
for the next three or four years,"" said Pindar. Capita increased the interim dividend by 17 percent to 5.6
pence per share and said operating margins had jumped to 12.2
percent from 11.9 percent in the previous half-year period. The company said it had a bid pipeline of around 3 billion
pounds and that it had won new contracts with AXA Sun Life and
Britain's Office for National Statistics, among others, during
the period. Fellow back-office outsourcer Serco last month said it had
sustained high-levels of activity in the first-half and it was
on track to meet expectations for 2009.

stocks overshadowed falls in banking stocks. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares ended
0.2 percent higher at 890.05 points, the highest close since
early January, after trading in a wide range of 879.97-890.38

positive earnings news as U.S. peer Pfizer raised its full-year
forecast for earnings, excluding items, and revenue. Novartis, AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk were up between 0.5

gains. The company said that it had beat expectations with its

Germany's DAX was up 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 0.1
percent.  BANKS FALL Banking shares took the most points off the index after
Morgan Stanley reported its third consecutive quarterly loss,
while Wells Fargo reported rising credit losses. ""Morgan Stanley's operating loss per share looks on the high

paying back public aid has distorted results, it is not known if
this has been incorporated into analysts expectations of the
results,"" said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research. Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group were down 3.1 percent and
1.6 percent respectively, as National Australia Bank which owns
the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks reported a jump in UK bad

lower. Insurers were also lower. Axa, Zurich Financial and Swiss Re
 slipped 1.2 to 1.6 percent. Miners were in the doldrums. BHP Billiton fell 1.8 percent
after the world's largest miner reported a 10 percent fall in
iron ore output to 27.048 million tonnes after its operations
were hit by mining fatalities and flooding in Australia. Anglo American, Antofagasta and Eurasian Natural Resources

huge amounts of money the U.S. central bank has pumped into the
economy will not undercut its ability to push borrowing costs
higher when the time is ripe, but stressed that the weak U.S.
economy will likely warrant exceptionally easy policies for a
long time to come. The outline of the Fed's exit strategy from its
extraordinary monetary policy easing offered a preview of the

broadly welcomed David Walker's report on improving corporate
governance in banks, but baulked at the idea of the financial
regulator monitoring fund managers' compliance on engagement. In a widely anticipated report, Walker said on Thursday bank
governance should be overhauled and institutional shareholders
should be made formally accountable for the first time for their
engagement with bank boards. ""We question the recommendation that the FSA should
encourage commitment to the Principles of Stewardship as best
practice. This is not an appropriate part of the process of FSA
authorisation,"" said Richard Saunders, Chief Executive of the
Investment Management Association. ""We do not believe the regulator should get involved in what
is the best way to manage money."" Key plans include a proposal for the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) to monitor whether fund managers are fully
disclosing compliance with new rules on engagement with banks. Walker, tasked by Prime Minister Gordon Brown to examine the
governance failings that sparked the near-collapse of the
banking industry, also proposed greater powers for the Financial
Reporting Council (FRC) to ensure fund firms stick to new
""principles of stewardship"" set out by an industry body.  ""YOU GUYS ARE POWERFUL"" Peter Montagnon, director of Investment Affairs of the
Association of British Insurers, said: ""We do not believe that
the authorities should assess the level of compliance - this
does not happen to companies under the Combined Code."" Walker told Reuters that his proposals were tough and would
not be popular with some fund managers. ""What I am trying to do is make institutional shareholders
behave more like owners. I am saying 'You guys are powerful and
you should use the power you have in a more effective way with
an eye to improving sustainable performance in the long term'.""
 Institutional investors, the biggest owners of London-listed
companies, have been blamed for failing to hold companies to
account, especially banks, in the financial crisis. Last month in its first official response in the wake of the
financial crisis, the Institutional Shareholders Committee
(ISC), issued new guidelines in a bid to strengthen investor
activism. The ISC rules will form the bedrock of the new principles of
stewardship in the banking sector that all UK fund managers will
have to conform to on a ""comply or explain"" basis, Walker said. He said his report could be applied more widely. ""Institutional investors will, for the first time, have to
comply or explain the extent to which they execute engagement
responsibilities on behalf of clients. There is no place to
hide,"" said Shade Duffy, head of corporate governance at AXA
Investment Managers. ""It places a large onus on institutional investors to carry
out high level engagement and to put sufficient resources behind
this.""  COLLECTIVE ACTION The report also recommends the creation of a memorandum of
understanding to establish an informal but agreed approach to
specific corporate governance issues that may arise.  The report has called on the FSA to seek to develop further
guidance on the interpretation of acting in concert, often
criticised as a regulatory grey area which can stop investors
forcing change at companies. ""Helpfully, it removes the concern that there could be
negative legal implications for shareholders who collaborate on
engagement activity,"" said Axa IM's Duffy. ""That's useful because informally, some shareholders have
been collaborating on a wide range of issues including
governance but others have said they couldn't support such work
and now there is no excuse."" Fund managers should also exercise their voting powers and
should disclose their voting record.

287,"Jul 11, 2009 08:56AM ET",Japan's Nomura buys 35 pct of Indian fund firm,nan," MUMBAI, July 11 (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura has bought a 35
percent stake in LIC Mutual Fund in a deal which values the
Indian fund firm at 8 billion rupees ($163 million). The deal gives Nomura an entry into one of the fastest
growing mutual fund markets and offers LIC Mutual Fund, which is
largely a debt manager, international exposure and equity fund
management expertise. ""It is very important to have a local partner with a strong
reputation here.  Life Insurance Corp is the best brand in India
with respect to customer confidence,"" said Takumi Shibata,
deputy president and chief operating officer of Nomura Holdings. The deal values the Indian fund firm, a unit of state-owned
Life Insurance Corp, at about 2.5 percent of average assets of
324.1 billion rupees as at June. The company, India's largest life insurer, is a household
name in the country, managing $167 billion, and has sold more
than 200 million individual life policies. The valuation is lower than the 4-5 percent that most Indian
fund managers have fetched because more than 90 percent of LIC
Mutual's assets are in low margin fixed-income funds, analysts
said. Nomura, which managed $192 billion in March under its fund
management arm, already runs a brokerage, investment bank and a
large back office in India. Assets of Indian funds industry have risen by more than half
over the past two years to 5.8 trillion, luring the likes of
JPMorgan, South Korea's Mirae Asset and France's Axa. More than 20 firms, including Credit Agricole and UBS are
considering entering India's fiercely competitive fund market,
forecast by Boston Consulting Group to manage $520 billion by
2015.

fifth straight session on Wednesday to their lowest closing
level in 10 weeks, as investors faced further signs that the
pace of economic recovery will not be quick. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 1.1 percent lower at 817.12 points. The fifth consecutive
drop also marked the index's longest losing streak since
mid-January. Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were about 80 percent of its
90-day average daily volume. Financials were among the standout losers, with HSBC
, Banco Santander , UBS , BNP Paribas
, Aviva , KBC Groep , Legal & General
 and AXA  off 1.9 percent to 8.7 percent. Group of Eight leaders believe the world economy still faces
""significant risks"" and may need further help, according to
summit draft documents, while the International Monetary Fund
said the global economy was starting to pull out of recession
but recovery would be sluggish and government policies need to
remain supportive.
The economies of the 16-nation euro zone, and that of the
28-nation European Union, declined at rates of 2.5 and 2.4
percent respectively in the first quarter, it was confirmed by
Eurostat, the EU statistics agency. [ID:nL8729330] ""People will be very focused on economic data, the shape of
the recovery. A lot of people are betting on the V-shaped type
of recovery, and if that isn't validated by data, then we can
expect the market to come under pressure,"" said Ronan Carr,
European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. ""Equally, if we start to see an improvement in things like
job market data, that will help the market go higher,"" he said,
adding that investors would also be looking at corporate
earnings for clue on market direction. U.S. aluminium major Alcoa  is due to kick off the
second-quarter corporate earnings season later in the day. The pan-European index has rallied 38 percent from a
lifetime low hit on March 9, but the sharp bounce stalled last
month and the benchmark is down 8.2 percent since June 10. European auto makers , which had got a lift from the
spring rally, have also came under pressure recently, down
nearly 17 percent since June 12. On Wednesday, Renault  sank 7.5 percent, Peugeot
 shed 5.1 percent and Daimler  gave up 2.3
percent. Oil producers fell as crude prices  softened after
U.S. data showed a big rise in fuel stocks. BP , Royal
Dutch Shell , Total , Repsol  and
StatoilHydro  dropped 0.6 percent to 1.7 percent. OPEC said world demand for its oil may take years to recover
from the slump in 2009 because of economic weakness and demand
destruction. [ID:nL8624047] Shares in basic resources  fell along with metal
prices. Xstrata , Anglo American , Vedanta
Resources , Rio Tinto , Lonmin  and
ArcelorMittal  lost between 1.3 and 4.9 percent. DEFENSIVES IN DEMAND With mounting doubts over the prospect of a quick recovery,
investors' focus is turning to sectors seen as more defensive,
such as healthcare, telecoms and utilities. Drugmakers were among the top gainers, wtih GlaxoSmithKline
, Roche  and Novartis  rising 0.6
percent to 1.5 percent. Mobile phone giant Vodafone  advanced 0.7 percent,
while German utility E.ON  put on 1.7 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100  lost 1.1 percent,
Germany's DAX  slipped 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40
 shed 1.3 percent. ""What we've had is a clear re-evaluation on the prospects of
economic recovery,"" Bob Parker, vice chairman of asset
management at Credit Suisse. ""Market expectations were too
optimistic on the pace of recovery, which we think will be
painfully slow, though we are out of recession.""

289,"Jul 06, 2009 12:56PM ET","European shares fall, led by oil, banks, miners",nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index down 1.1 percent * Economic growth worries weigh on bank and commodity shares * Defensives gain; pharma group Roche up 2.3 percent By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, July 6 (Reuters) - European shares fell for the
third straight session on Monday on renewed worries about the
sustainability of economic recovery foreseen in recent sentiment
surveys on both sides of the Atlantic and in China. Oil & gas stocks, banks and basic resources took the most
points off the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares,
which fell 1.1 percent to 833.03 points -- its lowest close
since May 13. Those investors who stayed loyal to equities rotated
positions into traditional safe havens such as pharmaceuticals,
telecoms and food and beverages. The benchmark index, which lost as much as 2 percent early
in the European day before Wall Street opened after the long
Independence Day weekend, is up 29 percent from the all-time low
set on March 9. That rally was driven primarily by an improvement in
economic sentiment indicators. ""The market has priced in a lot. Now it remains to be seen
whether things turn out that way,"" said Joerg Treptow, a trader
at M.M. Warburg. Among Europe's oil majors, ENI fell 2.7 percent, BP declined
2.6 percent and Royal Dutch Shell lost 2.1 percent as the crude
price gave up more than 3.5 percent to trade below $65 a barrel.
 Shares in miner Rio Tinto fell 7 percent and steelmaker
ArcelorMittal dropped 4.7 percent. The DJ Stoxx basic resources
index shed 5.2 percent. Copper fell more than 3 percent to a two-week low as the
dollar strengthened and investors fretted over how long it would
take major economies to overcome recession, allowing demand to
recover. Among financials, ING Group tumbled 4.5 percent, Deutsche
Bank fell 3.2 percent, AXA lost 3 percent, UniCredit closed 2.9
percent lower and Royal Bank of Scotland also was down 2.9
percent. But reinsurer Paris Re surged 14.5 percent on news that
Bermuda-based reinsurer PartnerRe would acquire it in a $2
billion deal. Pharma group Roche gained 2.3 percent, in telecoms Vodafone
 added 1.7 percent, and in the food and beverages sector British
American Tobacco rose 1.8 percent.  SINKING SENTIMENT Investor and analyst sentiment in the euro zone worsened
unexpectedly after showing three months of improvement, data
from the Sentix research group showed. The world's leading economies, should not presume a global
economic recovery is near, World Bank President Robert Zoellick
said. Interventions by central banks and governments appeared to
have ""broken the fall in the global economy"" by stabilising
financial markets and boosting demand. ""Yet 2009 remains a
dangerous year. Recent gains could be reversed easily, and the
pace of recovery in 2010 is far from certain,"" Zoellick said. Strategists at Goldman Sachs saw attention shifting towards
the durability of any economic growth recovery. ""The market's attention is likely to continue to shift away
from the focus of the first half of the year -- is the global
economy stabilizing -- towards what is likely to be the focus of
the second half of the year -- how sustainable is any recovery
likely to be?"" Goldman Sachs said. ""Our focus is shifting away from the very intense scrutiny
we have given to the major industrial and inventory indicators
and towards the consumer and other measures of sustainable final
demand,"" Goldman Sachs said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley, who assessed that market
consensus had tended to be consistently two months late this
year, upgraded equities to ""neutral"" from ""underweight"". ""We are not turning outright bullish, as there are still
plenty of uncertainties related to U.S. housing, European
earnings, the European banking system, the default cycle,
Chinese growth, and policy action,"" Morgan Stanley said. ""We would consider turning more positive if we get
comfort that the trough in earnings and U.S. house prices is
getting closer,"" Morgan Stanley said. The U.S. quarterly corporate earnings reporting season kicks
off this week with aluminium maker Alcoa on July 8. ""We believe second-quarter U.S. earnings will post a small
positive surprise,"" JPMorgan said. ""In contrast to Q1, we do not see the financial sector
driving the reporting season. Positive surprises are more likely
to arise within cyclical sectors with consumer discretionary and
technology our top picks,"" JPMorgan said. ""We look for a further 10-20 percent rally in equity markets
as an increasing number of investors are induced into recovery
trades or forced to cover defensive positions,"" it added.

290,"Jul 02, 2009 08:09AM ET",CORRECTED - COLUMN-Osmond plays Mr Nice Guy: Neil Collins,nan,"   (Removes reference to Punch Taverns in paragraph 1) -- Neil Collins is a Reuters columnist. The views expressed
are his own --  By Neil Collins LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Hugh Osmond is at it again,
trying to float his latest adventure, Pearl Group. Life assurance and public houses (an earlier adventure) have
little in common except, in Osmond's eyes, the chance to make
him serious money. Unfortunately, Pearl's route to the stock
market is currently looking decidedly gritty, thanks to the
little matter of a 6.58 percent 500 million pound sterling
eurobond. The bond is perpetual subordinated (Tier 1) debt, and was
issued by old Resolution, Clive Cowdery's lash-up of a life
assurer. After considerable drama, Pearl took over Resolution in
2008. Last March, Osmond announced that although Pearl had
plenty of money, he wasn't going to pay the interest. The price collapsed to 10 pence in the pound and the
bondholders were stunned. They thought they owned a relatively
safe slice of capital in a solvent life office, but Osmond begs
to differ. He argues that the bonds were in fact part of
Resolution's equity, that Pearl has no obligation and that the
responsibility rests with the old Resolution board or the
trustees of the bond. It's taken the bondholders a couple of months to get their
corporate heads round this, and even now their lawyers are only
""gathering evidence"". Perhaps they have a sneaking suspicion
that Osmond is right, and that he's entitled to treat the bonds
as zero-coupon perpetuals. With so many parties, and so much at
stake, this could turn into a corporate version of Jarndyce v.
Jarndyce, the interminable legal battle in Charles Dickens'
Bleak House. Fortunately for the bondholders, who include the usual
suspects like AXA, F&C and Fidelity, they have further leverage.
Pearl's refinancing is now complete, and Osmond is itching to
float the business [ID:nLT293015], not least to give him a
currency to exploit the opportunities ""unequalled for several
decades"" that he can see in the life business. New Pearl would go straight into the FTSE 100, and can
hardly afford to be scrapping with some of the biggest UK equity
investors. A resolution (sorry) is thus in everyone's interests,
and now Pearl's refinancing is in place, Osmond can afford to be
emollient. Sensing this, buyers have nibbled at these supposedly
worthless bonds, taking the price up to 20 pence in the pound.
There seems no realistic chance of repayment at par, but if
Pearl, the well-padded directors of old Resolution, the bond
trustees (and all the various parties' insurers) get together,
there could still be a happy ending, of sorts.  (Edited by David Evans)

lowest close in nearly six weeks on Tuesday, with financials
suffering most, and with home sales data in the United States
casting further doubt on the strength of the economic recovery. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
fell 0.4 percent to 833.67 points, the lowest close since May
13. But it is still up more than 29 percent from its lifetime
low on March 9. The heavyweight banking and insurance sectors suffered from
the renewed pessimism on economic recovery. BNP Paribas , Banco Santander , Barclays
, Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank  and
Standard Chartered  fell between 1.7 and 3.4 percent. ""After the sharp rally, my view was that there would be a
minor correction,"" said Bob Parker, vice chairman of asset
management at Credit Suisse.  ""This will last until mid to late August. Markets were
discounting too sharp an economic recovery. The pace of the
recovery is going to be mediocre."" Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rose at
a slower-than-expected pace in May, an industry survey showed. A
separate survey of manufacturing sentiment from the Reserve Bank
of Richmond gave mixed signals. [ID:nLN392294] ""It's right to say that the U.S. housing market is forming a
bottom, but it's wrong to say that it's forming a bottom and is
then going to recover sharply,"" said Parker. European macroeconomic news was also downbeat. French consumer spending fell unexpectedly in May and a
recovery in the euro zone services sector stalled in June, with
the Purchasing Managers Index slipping to 44.5. [ID:nLN873343] Parker also pointed to worries about central banks' exit
strategies. Governments and central banks worldwide have slashed
interest rates and spent billions on stimulus packages in their
efforts to combat recession.  The European Central Bank is not preparing to unwind its
support for the economy now but will be ready when the time
comes, Governing Council Member Christian Noyer said on Tuesday.
[ID:nLN588501] The ECB has cut its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent. Policymakers are concerned about fallout from generous
spending by governments, and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
warned on Sunday there was no room for more debt. [ID:nLL389299]  PHARMAS RISE Drugmakers helped limit the index's losses, led by
GlaxoSmithKline , up 1.6 percent. The company has signed
a deal with Chroma Therapeutics, giving it access to the
unlisted British biotech company's experimental compounds for
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Others in the sector to rise included AstraZeneca ,
Merck , Novartis  and Shire , up 0.8 to
2.2 percent. Broker downgrades sent insurers lower. Swiss Life 
fell 5.1 percent after UBS cut it to ""sell"" from ""neutral"". Legal & General  ended 7.9 percent lower after
SocGen downgraded it to ""sell"" from ""hold"". Other insurers to fall included Swiss Re , Axa
 and Zurich Financial , down between 1.3 and
2.3 percent. A slight bounce for oil prices , trading around $67.91
late in the session, was not enough to stop energy shares
falling. BP , Royal Dutch Shell  and StatoilHydro
 fell between 0.6 and 1.9 percent.
 Across Europe, Germany's DAX  gaind 0.3 percent, and
Britain's FTSE 100  and France's CAC-40  fell 0.1
and 0.2 percent respectively. As European bourses were closing, The Dow Jones , S&P

Tuesday, having briefly turned negative amid doubts about the
timing of a return to economic growth, which sent stock markets
in the United States and Japan sharply lower. UBS shone, rising 3.1 percent after the New York Times
reported the U.S. Justice Department may drop a case aimed at
forcing the Swiss bank to reveal the names of 52,000 wealthy
American clients suspected of tax evasion. At 0855 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 0.1 percent at 836.68 points, having fallen as
much as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the session. The European benchmark index ended 2008 at 831.97 points  U.S. stocks saw their worst one-day loss in two months on
Monday and Tokyo stocks fell almost 3 percent on Tuesday. ""After the massive three-month rally that sent all major
indexes significantly higher, we are now in the middle of the
long-awaited pullback,"" Close Brothers Seydler said in a note. ""Market participants start to realise that the recovery in
the economy and earnings is unlikely to be as strong as the rise
in stock prices since early March."" Despite its recent drop, the European benchmark index is up
around 30 percent from the record low set in early March. ""The pattern of the equity rally so far fits the traditional
template of a sharp rise and a 'stall' period,"" Goldman Sachs
said in a research note. ""Q2 will be a contractionary quarter and the forward
indicators do not suggest positive growth in the (United States,
Europe and Japan) until Q3,"" Goldman Sachs said. Euro zone purchasing managers index (PMI) data on Tuesday
showed that a recovery from the recession stalled in the
services sector in June while manufacturing fared slightly
better. Insurers were weak, with AXA down 1.9 percent and ING Group
 falling 1.3 percent.  ANGLO AMERICAN IN SPOTLIGHT The DJ Stoxx basic resources index, which includes mining
companies, was the weakest sectoral performer with a fall of 1.6
percent. Shares in Anglo American fell 2.3 percent after the mining
group rejected a merger proposal from rival Xstrata. Xstrata
shares fell 1.3 percent. Anglo American trimmed some early losses after dealers cited
market talk of bid interest from China's state-owned Chinalco.
Both Chinalco representatives in London and officials from Anglo
American declined to comment. Utilities E.ON, up 1.3 percent and Iberdrola, up 1.5
percent, drew strength from a JPMorgan sector upgrade to
""overweight"" from ""underweight"", citing ""a likely pickup in
power prices, a potential rebound in economic activity, improved
valuations and a relatively benign network price regulation"". The London-listed shares of Thomson Reuters Corp gained 5.4
percent on news that the data publishing and financial
information group, which is also listed in New York, plans to
withdraw its shares from the London Stock Exchange. Also among the winners, mobile phone maker Nokia advanced
1.7 percent after Credit Suisse raised its target price for the
stock to 14 euros from 12 euros, citing in a note ""increased
confidence on margins"". ""We continue to see scope for volume, revenue, margin and
valuation rebound in the second half of 2009,"" Credit Suisse
said. Later in the day, investors will focus on U.S. housing data
at 1400 GMT. ""Particular emphasis will be paid to existing home sales in
the United States and the (U.S.) house price index,"" said Heino
Ruland, analyst at Ruland Research. Eyes will also be on the U.S. Federal Reserve central bank,
whose Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day
meeting on interest rate policy. ""It is almost certain that the Fed will leave the policy
rate unchanged at this week's FOMC meeting; we believe it could
keep rates at extremely low levels right through 2010,"" ING said

on prospects that the global economic recovery was still on track
following recent improving economic data, with banks and
commodity stocks leading the gainers. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European companies closed
1.3 percent higher at 861.63 points on a ""triple witching"" day,
after rising 0.6 percent on Thursday to snap a four-session
losing run. Triple witching is the expiry of stock index futures, stock
index options and single stock options. The index, however, lost 2.7 percent this week -- the second
weekly loss since early March, which was the start of current
rally that has seen the pan-European benchmark up 33.5 percent
from the lifetime low hit on March 9. ""The third quarter when we start seeing the earnings coming
through and the corporate statements that come with it will be
the most interesting time,"" said Philip Lawlor, chief portfolio
strategist at Nomura. Lawlor said any indication from major companies that things
were not as bad as they had thought or order books were starting
to firm up would send the market higher. Banks were among the top gainers, with Barclays, Banco
Santander, Standard Chartered, BBVA, Credit Agricole and Societe
Generale up between 1.2 and 5 percent. European Union leaders agreed more steps to avert a repeat
of the banking crisis that has sapped the world economy and the
International Monetary Fund said 2010 might deliver stronger
growth than earlier forecast. Morgan Stanley downgraded its euro zone growth forecast for
2009 to minus 4.4 percent from minus 3.3 percent but said it was
starting to see upside risk building on its 2010 forecast of 0.5
percent growth. Insurers were also higher, helped by a positive sector note
from Deutsche bank. The broker upgraded price targets for Aviva
 and AXA, which gained 5.8 percent and 1.1 percent,
respectively.
Index heavyweight oil producers were in demand, buoyed by
firmer crude prices. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Repsol and BG
Group put on 0.6 percent to 3.8 percent. Firmer metal prices also lifted mining shares, with Xstrata
, Vedanta Resources, BHP Billiton, Fresnillo, Lonmin and Anglo
American rising 2 percent to 5.6 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.5 percent,
Germany's DAX was flat and France's CAC 40 advanced 0.9 percent. Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were nearly 140 percent of
its 90-day average daily volume.  VOLKSWAGEN, PORSCHE DOWN Porsche was down 1.4 percent after the car maker said big
gains on derivatives bets linked to Volkswagen shares offset a
decline in nine-month earnings at its core sports car business.
Volkswagen ordinary shares shed 3 percent. Within the auto sector, Daimler slipped 2.7 percent and BMW
 lost 1.5 percent. Telenor dropped 4 percent after Russia's bailiffs service
said it had passed an order to auction off Telenor's shares in
mobile firm Vimpelcom to cover a $1.7 billion fine for holding
back Vimpelcom's entry into Ukraine.

month, face further hurdles next week with the release of
leading economic data and a U.S. monetary policy decision. World stocks, which are on track for the first weekly loss
in five weeks, have been trading sideways after rising 40
percent since mid-March to hit a 7-1/2 month high early in June. While the jury is still out as to whether it was a bear
market rally or the start of a new bull market, much of the gain
has stemmed from optimism that the global economy has hit bottom
and corporate earnings will improve from here. However, investors have so far had insufficient evidence of
a recovery. Therefore, next week's euro zone purchasing
manufacturing surveys, the German IFO investor sentiment survey
and data on the U.S housing sector -- key for consumer spending
-- must strongly beat expectations to kickstart the rally again. ""We don't think green shoots are the prediction of a great
harvest in 2010. We might be in for a double dip,"" said Emiel
van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Fortis
Investments. ""It's not a good time at this moment to go into equities to
chase the rally. We're looking for reasons to go short as we
don't believe in the rally."" Fortis has found that during previous crises, bottoms in the
S&P 500 index have lasted from 3.5 to 11 months.  ""There's reason to believe that this bottoming process will
be longer than average,"" van den Heiligenberg said. Boston Consulting Group, which studied 61 leading economic
indicators in the United States, Germany, France, Britain and
Japan, found that only five are in the clearly positive
territory. Another 15 are in the ""positive trend but too early
to confirm"" category. ""We are neutral on equities. Central banks are still
fighting monetary problems. People went too far in playing
policy normalisation,"" said Sebastian Paris-Horvitz, head of
investment strategy at AXA Investment Managers. AXA is overweight bonds, with a preference for corporate
bonds and nominal government bonds.  EXIT DEBATE Investors are split on whether the Federal Reserve will
expand its existing $300 billion plan to purchase Treasuries
when it meets next week. If the Fed announces a plan to expand this purchase
programme, investors who had fled Treasuries in search of higher
yields might return to the risk-free asset to lock in recently
elevated Treasury yields. In the U.S. bond market, which has been under pressure for
three months, benchmark Treasury yields hit an eight-month high
of 4 percent last week as speculation intensified over the
timing of the Fed's exit strategy. Yields have since fallen
towards 3.8 percent. Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch found in its June
fund managers survey that more than half of the respondents
expected higher short-term rates in 12 months' time.  Its risk and liquidity composite indicator stood at 38 this
month, below the average of 40 seen since 2002. In this climate, Swedish bank SEB recommends a portfolio
which has slightly more weighting on fixed income -- including
corporate bonds -- than equities. On its Modern Aggressive portfolio, it recommends investors
allocate 28 percent to equities, 37.5 percent to bonds including
high yields, and 22.5 percent to hedge funds. ""We do not want to expose ourselves to a rapid economic
recovery, since this is not our main scenario, partly because it
represents excessive risk taking,"" Hans Peterson, chief
investment officer of private banking and head of investment
strategy at SEB, said in a note to clients. ""We combine corporate bonds, with the potential for good
returns if the economy rebounds, with assets that depend very
little on the economic cycle.""

Monday, with financials the main drag as the European Central
Bank (ECB) said euro zone banks may face further writedowns,
while commodity stocks fell as crude and metal prices retreated. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
2.5 percent lower at 863.34 points. The market has rallied
around 33 percent since reaching a life-time low in early March. ""The market has been losing momentum in the past 10 days and

It is a transition from a strong rally which we have seen since
March to a consolidation or fall back to more appropriate levels
as markets went too fast too far,"" Ruland said. Bank stocks weighed heavily on the index. The ECB said euro
zone banks face potential further writedowns of $283 billion
through 2010, while euro area insurance companies may face
significant balance sheet stress due to financial market
turbulence and weak economies. HSBC, Banco Santander, UBS, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were
down between 3.1 and 5.8 percent. Among insurers, AXA, Swiss Re and Allianz were 3.1 to 4.3

Lonmin fell 9.8 percent, following news it had shut down its No.
1 furnace on Sunday due to a production incident, and started up
three other furnaces with about half the capacity. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Eurasian Natural
Resources Corporation, Rio Tinto and Xstrata were down 2.1 to
7.3 percent. Bayer fell 4.1 percent after the chief executive of its
pharmaceutical unit, Bayer Schering Pharma, told a newspaper
price pressure in the industry is intensifying due to the
economic crisis. In macro economic news, the New York state factory sector
shrank at a more severe rate in June than during the previous
month, the New York Federal Reserve said, confounding
expectations of a slight improvement.     Meanwhile, the
16-country euro zone lost a record 1.22 million jobs in the
first quarter of 2009, data showed, highlighting the depth of
the recession and boding ill for hopes of a quick turnaround. ""Markedly weakening labour markets are a major threat to
recovery prospects in the Eurozone. Sharply higher and rising
unemployment will weigh down on Eurozone consumer spending,""
said IHS Global Insight Chief Economist Howard Archer. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.4 percent,
Germany's DAX was 3.5 percent lower and France's CAC 40 was down
3.2 percent.

rising amid cautious statements from major companies about the
outlook for a recovery from one of the deepest recessions in
living memory, raising questions over the rally's real strength. The heads of luxury, retail, consumer goods and car
companies are all singing from the same song sheet, telling
investors the trading environment is very tough and further
sales and margins declines may be in prospect. Yet stock markets, which aim to anticipate future trends in
company earnings, have been bidding up the shares in these
companies for much of the past 10 weeks, helping them recover
from a plunge that preceded the full onset of the recession. ""Two months ago, people had the impression the glass was
half empty. Today, investors' sentiment is that the glass is
half full,"" said Philippe Waechter, head of economic research at
Natixis Asset Management. But for CEOs, who have to deal with the urgent need to
restructure and slash jobs, the mood remains more cautious. ""The CEOs' visions are based on the order books, while
investors on the market are trying to anticipate what comes next
and when,"" Waechter said. Luxury group Richemont has said it saw ""very few encouraging
signs in the global economic picture"", while its UK peer
Burberry said trading will remain difficult as it focuses on
cutting costs. Meanwhile, Michel Rollier, chief executive of tyre group
Michelin, saw ""little sign of real improvement in the world
economy"" and warned of tough quarters ahead, while BMW's CEO
Norbert Reithofer does not expect the market to recover until
next year. ""There's a huge contrast between what the business leaders
say and what investors think -- to my mind, CEOs are being
rightfully cautious because there is still an extreme lack of
visibility about earnings,"" said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at
Fortis in Brussels. ""We're in uncharted territory but I would estimate that
there would be a lag of at least one year between macro data
stabilising and actual demand for companies' products picking
up,"" Gijsels said. Europe's DJ STOXX retail index, home of bellwethers such as
supermarket chain Carrefour and clothes retailer H&M, has surged
27 percent since early March and is now up 15 percent
year-to-date. The DJ STOXX personal and household goods index, which
includes names like L'Oreal and Philips has risen 23 percent
over the past 10 weeks and is now up 9.3 percent in 2009,
despite the flow of gloomy retail sales data and rising
unemployment rates around the world.  NEW BULL RUN, OR SHORT-LIVED RELIEF RALLY? With the broader stock indexes, the FTSEurofirst 300 and the
STOXX 600, now up around 35 percent from their lows in March,
several fund managers and strategists say the market is getting
ahead of itself. For them a correction looks inevitable as the
macroeconomic backdrop remains broadly negative despite a few
""green shoots"". The sharp upward move in prices over the past couple of 
months could turn out to be more a relief rally than the dawn of
a new bull market. ""There has been an improvement in sentiment since last
February when people feared many companies and even countries
would go bankrupt,"" said Romain Boscher, head of equity
management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris. But ""the economic reality still contrasts with the broad
optimism among investors who have been hoping for a quick
recovery,"" he said. Arthur van Slooten, European equity strategist at Societe
Generale, said investors were keen on adding more risk into
portfolios, reassured by signs of improvement in the credit
market, and that the 10-week stock rise had not much to do with
the corporate forecasts. ""This rally has been a correction of the equity risk
premium, and obviously not based on an improvement on the
earnings side,"" he said.  CYCLICALS GETTING PRICEY Many fund managers expect jobs to continue to be axed over
the next few quarters with no tangible improvement in the ""real
economy,"" reflected in part by consumer spending and retail
sales, which remain weak. For Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers,
cyclical stocks such as consumer goods, retail, industrials and
autos, had reached pricey levels, with a 30 percent premium to
defensives compared to around 15 percent in the last recovery
rally of 2002-03. ""I never saw this before, which is making me cautious,""
Wenzel said. ""We recommend not to be too brave and refrain from
increasing exposure to cyclical stocks."" But he expects to see tangible signs of an economic recovery
at the end of the year -- suggesting that the stock market is
not completely devoid of rational investors. (Additional reporting by Mark Potter, David Jones, Helen

near this week's 2009 high and the euro hit a one-month high

September 1983. ""It's a terrible number but an improvement relative to the
very terrible numbers we had before,"" said Jay Mueller, senior

I am somewhat sceptical that we have seen the absolute worst of
it, but you can't rule that out."" TheMSCI world equity index was up 0.7 percent, largely
unchanged from before the jobs data. The index has gained nearly
40 percent since mid-March and is up 4.6 percent on the year. Equities and other risky assets have been firm after stress

withstand further shocks to the financial system. ""This (stress test result) could be seen by many as the last
hurdle for the markets to continue their stellar bull run,"" said
Chris Hossain, senior sales manager at ODL Securities.  ""Markets tend to show where we should be in 18 months' time,
and for the time being, a sense of optimism is in the air."" The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.4 percent while emerging

currency waned. ""A sustainable recovery is not a given and a W-shaped
outcome is as likely as this V-shaped recovery,"" said Chris

300,"Mar 18, 2009 08:40AM ET",ANALYSIS-Investors look far and wide for signs of stocks upturn,nan," * Atypical downturn forces analysts to study many indicators * Traditional equity metrics P/E, dividend yields unreliable * Investors look at leading indicators, freight costs * Financial sector bond spreads, platinum-to-gold ratio eyed  By Sitaraman Shankar LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Investors desperate to figure
out if global stocks can extend a rebound from 12-year lows are
looking at an unprecedented range of indicators to decipher
mixed market signals and avoid being burnt again. The unreliability of company earnings and traditional equity
valuation metrics like dividend yields has analysts anxiously
scouring data ranging from corporate bond spreads and freight
costs to the ratio of platinum and gold prices. ""We are currently going through a very special crisis, where
we have so many things happening that don't usually happen, at
least with this intensity,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, strategist at
UniCredit in Munich. ""There are new and different questions in this cycle
compared to other cycles that make it necessary to look at a
broader range of indicators,"" he said. The downturn has featured credit and housing crises, bank
solvency problems and a swift drop in economic activity. Key parameters normally correlated with equities have
behaved oddly: oil prices soared last year and then slumped as
the focus of investor worry shifted from inflation to growth.
Copper fell off a cliff last July but has recovered slightly on
slim hopes of renewed Chinese demand. ""A lot of things that have worked in the past no longer seem
to work,"" said Philippe Gijsels, Fortis strategist in Brussels. He said spotting a recovery had become an inexact science
relying on signals such as an end to big capital raisings by
financial institutions -- at the centre of the downturn.  LOOKING AHEAD...AND AT CHINA Amid the uncertainty, it's no surprise leading indicators
have risen in importance, like business and consumer confidence
polls from Germany's Ifo and similar French and Italian studies. ""In terms of top-down timing decisions on the equity market,
upper and lower turning points in the Ifo expectation component
have proved very helpful over the past 40 years -- however, they
were not perfect,"" said Greetfeld. Ifo is sending signs that are slightly positive: the latest
survey suggested corporate sentiment deteriorated slightly in
February, but its gauge of business expectations rose for a
second straight month. Purchasing managers' surveys -- usually encompassing new
orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and
employment environment -- are also in focus. And given the country's weight in the global economy in this
downturn, Chinese figures are eyed more closely than most. The Chinese purchasing managers' index (PMI) for February
rose to 49 from 45.3 in January -- still below the no-change
line of 50 that marks the difference between expansion and
contraction, but well above a record low of 38.8 in November. Figures released at the beginning of March produced an all
too brief spike in global share prices. Chinese demand could also be reflected in the Baltic Dry
Freight index, which has been ticking up since early December
after a collapse that began in mid-2008. U.S. industrial production ratios are also key. ""The new orders-to-production ratio is improving, but
overall the headline figure for production is too low. We are
also looking for an improvement in inventory-to-sales ratios,""
said AXA Investment Managers strategist Franz Wenzel. Strong new orders and low inventory could suggest improving
demand for goods, key to an economic recovery.  FROM BONDS TO GOLD, AND PLATINUM Even if investor focus has moved to the economy, the roots
of the crisis lie squarely with the banking system. While bank stocks have been battered, it is the sector's
bonds and their spreads over government debt, that could provide
early clues of an upturn. ""The best news is that non-financial high-grade corporate
debt has been behaving a lot better, but financial sector debt
needs to be better bid,"" said John Haynes, strategist at
Rensburg Sheppard in London. He said a directional change in the iBoxx financial index, a
benchmark for bonds from financial companies, was crucial. European financial bond prices have fallen almost 17 percent
on average this year, the iBoxx financials index shows,
suggesting investors are giving the sector a wide berth. Haynes said he was also watching the platinum-to-gold ratio. Platinum has a variety of industrial uses, notably in cars,
while Gold is boosted by its safe-haven allure. The ratio of the
two metals, in effect a ratio of economic growth expectations to
investor fear, has moved decisively in the direction of fear.
Platinum prices were double the level of gold in February last
year, but now the ratio is close to one. So far no one signal is strong enough to indicate an upturn
to analysts looking at a composite picture. ""You look at everything and try and work as you used to,
said Fortis' Gijsels. ""But should have an open mind and
understand that market internals have changed.""

301,"Feb 16, 2009 10:00AM ET",ANALYSIS-German homes as good as gold,nan," By Peter Starck FRANKFURT, Feb 16 (Reuters) - German residential property is
joining gold as a safe haven for investors disillusioned with
equities and afraid other assets will be eaten away as measures
to combat the financial crisis prompt a spike in inflation. ""Residential property is boring. There is no 'sexy story'.
But today, boring is beautiful. Today, capital preservation is
more important than high returns,"" said Udo Scheffel, Chief
Executive of German residential property company GBW. The German cities of Munich and Hamburg were the top two
investment locations in Europe for 2009 in accountancy firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers' latest annual survey of real estate
executives and fund managers, and four German cities were in
Europe's top 10. In both Munich and Hamburg, residential was the most popular
category, PwC said. ""Germany is the best port in a storm right now,"" said one
survey respondent. ""Residential will become more popular as it retains its
value,"" said another. Some economists say the huge monetary and fiscal measures
deployed by governments and central banks worldwide to boost
growth and lending could lead to significant inflation down the
road, which would benefit real estate prices. In such a scenario even triple-A-rated government bonds,
usually a safe haven for investors, stand to lose in value. Inflation could turn into an ""enormous problem"" leading to
""massive risks"" for investors on a two to five-year horizon, 
Credit Suisse Global Investment Strategist Stefan Keitel told a
recent mutual funds conference in Germany. ""The safe haven will turn into a battlefield,"" he said.  CASH FLOW Such fears have prompted many risk averse investors to bet
on gold, the price of which has risen over 25 percent in the
past three months. With diversification the golden rule of asset allocation,
investors are looking elsewhere, too. One of those drawn to German homes is Peter Brock, managing
director of Grainger Deutschland GmbH, the German arm of
Grainger, Britain's largest residential property landlord. ""German residential is going to become increasingly
attractive for institutional investors seeking long-term,
low-risk cash flows,"" he said. ""We still see a market that is extremely stable and a market
that has certainly proved its investment worth, especially when
you look at the comparative price falls in the UK,"" said Brock,
whose company entered Germany in 2006 and now owns or has
majority interests in around 7,300 German housing units, with a
market value of around 530 million euros ($676 million). Adjusted for inflation, German house prices fell less than 1
percent in the year to end-September, compared with a fall of
more than 14 percent in Britain, according to data compiled by
property consultancy BulweinGesa. Residential real estate proved more stable and less risky
during a turbulent 2008 than offices, retail space, hotels or
warehouses, measured by property consultants KingSturge's German
market sentiment index published in January. ""Residential will become more attractive for investment
because low new housing construction volumes mean rents will
grow and small valuation fluctuations guarantee stable returns,""
said Sascha Hettrich, partner at KingSturge in Germany.  BACK TO BASICS ""British and U.S. funds are back again, having forgotten all
about us for the past 18 months,"" said Johann Kowar, Chief
Executive of Austria-based residential property company Conwert
, which is also active in Germany. ""It's back to basics, away from exotic products such as
collateralised debt obligations or the securitisation of soccer
players' future transfer fees,"" he said. ""Stock market investors have a bloody nose. Those who are
holding bonds are worried whether they will have lost capital a
year from now. That uncertainty heightens the motivation to go
into tangible assets such as residential property,"" Kowar added. This year AXA Investment Managers, part of French insurer
AXA, launched a new German residential property fund, AXA
Immoresidential and is aiming for an annual return of at least 5
percent. ""Institutional investor interest in residential property has
increased noticeably,"" said AXA fund manager Ulf-Harald Koepke.

302,"Jan 27, 2009 11:48AM ET",ANALYSIS-Protectionism the danger beyond new love for govt aid,nan," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - It must have been clear to even
the most blinkered politician watching Japan's stock market on
Tuesday that investors are dumping any philosophical adherence
to free markets in favour of government help. The announcement of a bailout plan for capital-strapped
companies -- a heavy government footprint -- pushed the
benchmark Nikkei stock average  up more than 4.9 percent,
regaining more than a third of its year-to-date losses. A happy day for investors, but also a classic portrait of
recent market phenomena: desperation has prompted wide support
from investors for hands-on government globally, in stark
contrast to their past embrace of all things free market. The risk is that ""soft"" protectionism such as bailouts will
translate into something more virulent and ultimately damaging. ""The chances of a protectionist agenda emerging now is much
greater (than before),"" said Andrew Clare, professor of asset
allocation at Cass Business School in London. In the latest high-profile bailout, the Japanese government
said it would offer public funds to companies whose capital has
been seriously hurt by the financial crisis. But it is far from alone in this kind of thing. A number of
countries are now helping out specific firms or industries
alongside their macro stimulus programmes. Consider U.S. banks and automakers, for example, or Europe's
more relaxed approach to state aid and competition policy.
Britain offered loan guarantees to its automakers on Tuesday.  PROTECT AND SERVE Investors now clearly welcome this kind of intervention,
even if many see it as a necessary evil. A typical reaction has
been for stock markets to rise on the news, then fall as
uncertainty grips and investors ponder whether more is needed. But such support goes against the previous confidence that
markets could be left alone to purge what is unhealthy, righting
the system sooner or later. Protectionism is widely viewed by free marketeers as a major
cause of the Great Depression, and the U.S. State Department
says protectionist policies knocked 66 percent off world trade
in the five years after the Wall Street Crash in 1929. The argument is that while bailouts or trade laws protecting
a specific company or industry can be beneficial in the short
term, they are ultimately damaging over a longer period. Many of the actions taken by governments in the face of the
global financial and economic crises -- nationalisations,
bailouts etc -- would have brought howls of complaints from
competitors or competing countries in the past. This has changed primarily because most countries see
themselves now in the same boat. And, of course, because the
threat of joblessness, financial loss and political backlash is
real. ""Unfortunately we need government to do this now. Otherwise,
what is the alternative?"" said Franz Wenzel, senior investment
strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris.  THINGS TO COME Some see the danger of protectionism as quite acute. In a
recent note, for example, Societe Generale strategist Albert
Edwards suggested economic trouble in China could be a trigger. ""It is becoming clear that the Chinese economy is imploding
and this raises the possibility of regime change,"" he wrote. ""To prevent this, the authorities would likely devalue the
yuan. A subsequent trade war could see a re-run of the Great
Depression."" The more typical view, however, is that while current
government intervention may create a ""moral hazard"" -- that is,
precedent -- for trouble, lessons have been learnt from the
1930s and are unlikely to be repeated. Clare, of Cass Business School, agrees. But he also wonders
how smooth the transition will be when the global economy
recovers and governments around the world have to reassess their
role in companies and markets. Could it be then that the tensions between countries rise? ""The issue might be how (hands-on government) is withdrawn,""
he said. (Editing by Patrick Graham)

global economy pushed oil below $40 a barrel on Tuesday and
drove the two-year euro zone government bond yield to record
lows, while European stocks rose, helped by gains in banks. Data showing New Zealand's economy contracted by its biggest
amount in eight years in the third quarter and moves by some
U.S. manufacturers to cut jobs or benefits emphasised that the
global economy is worsening, which cuts energy demand and weighs
on risky assets. In light pre-Christmas trade, investors were torn between
the gloomy outlook and views that world stocks might have
bottomed, having gained 18 percent from a 5-1/2 year low on Nov.
21. ""We see a 25-30 percent decline in earnings next year, which
is a substantial headwind for equities. But the speed at which
earnings decline will slow by mid-2009,"" said Franz Wenzel,
strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. ""We would not rule out a 20 to 30 percent stock market rally
by the end of the year. So it will be a two-tier year: low for
the first half or three-quarters, followed by year-end gains and
an economic recovery."" MSCI world equity index was unchanged on the day. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares rose 0.7
percent. U.S. crude oil fell 1.3 percent to $39.41 a barrel. The two-year euro zone government bond yield fell to fresh
record lows of 1.764 percent, a day after the 10-year yield hit
a record low of 2.918 percent. U.S. stock futures pointed to a firmer start on Wall Street
after the grim outlook hit U.S. shares on Monday. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of heavy construction
and mining equipment, said on Monday it was cutting white-collar
pay by up to 50 percent and offering buyouts to as many as
25,000 U.S. employees. Textron, the world's largest maker of corporate jets, said
it will eliminate 2,200 jobs worldwide to cope with a global
downturn. ""As the year draws to an end therefore everyone is prepared
to sit on their hands, do very little and prepare for what will
hopefully be a better 2009, hoping that credit markets continue
to stabilize and that the (Barack) Obama administration stimulus
plans drag the U.S. back to life,"" Calyon said in a note to
clients. The March Bund future rose 12 ticks. The dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies. Emerging stocks fell 2.1 percent.

equities on Friday as oil hit its lowest in nearly five years on
worries over global demand, but the dollar clawed back some
losses at the end of the last full trading week of 2008. Oil fell below $34 to its weakest since Feb 2004 as the
global slowdown overshadowed record supply cuts by OPEC. ""The oil price is a real-time indicator for the global
economy,"" said Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy
at Unicredit in Munich. ""It is a zero sum game: a lower oil price shifts purchasing
power from oil-producing countries to consumers in oil-importing
countries."" U.S. stock futures fell, indicating a weaker open on Wall
Street, with the auto industry the latest focus for concern over
the U.S. economy. The MSCI world equity index fell 1.69 percent to 224.54. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares fell 1.22
percent. Friday is a quadruple witching day, on which stock index
futures, stock index options, stock options and individual stock
futures all expire. President George W. Bush will make a statement at 1400 GMT
on aid for U.S. automakers. Sources familiar with the talks told Reuters on Thursday
that General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC were
approaching a deal to secure emergency loans as part of a U.S.
government aid package. Ten-year Japanese government bond yields briefly fell to
3-1/2 year lows of 1.21 percent after the Bank of Japan cut its
key policy rate by 20 basis points to 0.10 percent, the lowest
rate since 2006. Japan joined the global trend for lower interest rates after
the United States took rates close to zero earlier this week,
pushing the U.S. currency sharply lower. However, the dollar recovered 2 percent against the euro to
$1.3952 as traders squared positions on the last Friday before
Christmas. The U.S. currency steadied at 89.45 yen after hitting
13-year lows earlier this week. Sterling also recovered some ground from recent record lows
against the euro hit on expectations of further rate cuts. Money market strains have eased recently, but U.S. and
European central banks announced new money market operations on
Friday and said they will continue to work together to address
pressures. Euro zone government bond yields rose slightly and March
Bund futures fell 11 ticks. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also
rose. ""(Quantitative easing) essentially ... is what central banks
have been doing in recent months -- printing money to buy bonds.
The next phase of it might be that they explicitly target buying
government bonds in order to reduce the level of long-term
interest rates,"" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for 
fixed income at AXA Investment Managers.

307,"Nov 30, 2008 10:02AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Unsynchronised recovery,nan," By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - If markets are forward looking,
investors might find themselves tempted to buy stocks and other
risky assets just as major economies, most of them already in
recession, deteriorate further. The euro zone, Japan, Singapore and Sweden are already
confirmed in recession and the United States, Britain and other
countries are half way into recession as the credit crunch since
August 2007 bites into consumption and corporate profits. However, markets and real economies are not synchronised. According to Barclays, in the early 1990s, when Sweden
struggled with its banking crisis, the stock market rallied the
month after the government intervened in banks, while the
economy worsened and was in recession for another three
quarters. Credit Suisse estimates that equities reach a bottom up to
five quarters before the trough in earnings and three months
before troughs in earnings momentum -- which currently is close
to an all-time low in Europe. World stocks, measured by MSCI, have risen every single day
after hitting a 5-1/2 year low on Nov. 21, helped by a round of
interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus packages worldwide. ""Generally speaking, markets have a pretty good track record
of seeing the end of recession before the real economy started
picking up,"" said Rob Hepworth, senior fund manager at insurance
firm Ecclesiastical. ""They are forward looking but they don't always get it
right... My yardsticks would be that things get so bad, news
seems so bad and it doesn't make stock prices go down. For me,
then, all the bad news is in price.""
Hepworth said an example of this could be found in the
triple-B corporate bond market, where spreads have blown out to
700 basis points above UK government bonds to yield around 11
percent, compared with historical spreads of around 50-80 bps.
""It's assuming an absolute Armageddon - one in every 15
companies go bust with no recovery. Even with this, you are
still better off buying triple-B bonds than gilts,"" Hepworth
said, adding that bond holders typically recover 40 percent of
money in the event that a company goes bankrupt. This week's data could add to the gloom on the economic
front. Friday's data is expected to show the U.S. economy has
lost another 300,000 non-farm payroll jobs in November. Both the European Central Bank and Bank of England are set
to lower the cost of borrowing again on Thursday, which could
make the climate more friendly for risk seeking investors. BUYING IN RECOVERIES Barclays analysis on U.S. assets since 1929 shows that
equities, bonds, Treasury bills gave the highest yearly real
returns of 14 percent, 9.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively
when growth and inflation was low. The second best return across three assets was achieved when
growth was high and inflation was low, at 10.6 percent, 5.2
percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Credit Suisse's analysis going back to the 1870s shows that
on the eight occasions equities have fallen by more than 20
percent in a calendar year, six of the following years have
produced positive returns -- but some of the rise proves to be a
bear market rally. ""In downturns, the earnings multiples of cyclical stocks,
after initially falling steeply, have a tendency, once the
downgrades cycle is past and the earnings outlook stabilises, to
then expand,"" said Raj Shant, director at investment management
firm Newton. He said European stocks are trading on an underlying
multiple for 2009 of 13 to 14 times earnings, assuming a severe
earnings recession next year. ""So the time to buy in recoveries can be when multiples look
high, and by the middle of 2009 multiples on some European
cyclicals could look very high,"" he said.  INFLATION... WILL BE BACK? A mix of a slowing economy and an eventual recovery points
to higher inflation in the medium to long term. Inflation-linked bonds offer protection against inflation as
payments to investors adjust automatically to compensate for
rising prices. Even when inflation is low, these bonds give
stable real returns. For UK index-linked bonds maturing in 2030, the real yield
would be 1.7 percent if inflation stood at 1-3 percent,
according to AXA Investment Managers.  With inflation of 10 percent, real yields would dip only to
1.5 percent. The redemption price would be 301.3 when inflation is 3
percent, compared with 231.318 currently. ""I don't want to predict an economic disaster but every time
there is one there is buoyancy in inflation-linked bonds,"" said
Jim Stride, managing director and head of UK equities at AXA. Performance data of UK inflation-linked bonds while the
economy had deflation is scarce. However, Stride said:
""Investors might be pleasantly surprised by what would happen to
linkers in a period of genuine deflation.""

 (For more stories on the global crisis, click By Mike Peacock LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The United States and Europe
prepared fresh measures on Tuesday to tackle a sharp economic
downturn, which top miner BHP Billiton cited in abandoning a $66
billion bid for Rio Tinto. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the third
quarter, revised data showed, and authorities announced an $800
billion life-support scheme for the U.S. financial system. A further deterioration is expected this quarter, putting
the world's largest economy into recession stretching into 2009. Wary of the effects of the worst financial crisis in 80
years, BHP Billiton called off its hostile bid for rival Rio,
catching markets off their guard. ""We have concerns about the continued deterioration of
near-term global economic conditions, the lack of any certainty
as to the time it will take for conditions to improve and the
risks that these issues imply for shareholder value,"" BHP
Chairman Don Argus said in a statement. U.S. consumers cut spending at the steepest rate in 28
years, according to a Commerce Department report underlining how
rapidly activity was slowing. China, the world's biggest consumer of many metals, this
month unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) spending package
to prop up its economy, but growth would still likely slow to
around 7.5 percent in 2009, the World Bank said. That would be China's slowest growth rate since 1990. Official data confirmed Germany is in recession for the
first time in five years. And falling consumer and business morale in Italy and France
pointed to a continent heading for a prolonged recession, with a
surprise tick up in consumer sentiment in Germany seen as an
isolated and temporary blip.  U.S. PUTS UP $800 BLN After Britain announced on Monday a 20 billion pounds fiscal
boost, including a 2.5 points cut in value-added tax, the United
States and European Union put their shoulders to the wheel. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion programme
to buy mortgage-related debt and securities and a $200 billion
facility to back consumer loans, including student, auto, and
credit card loans. ""This action is being taken to reduce the cost and increase
the availability of credit for the purchase of houses, which in
turn should support housing markets and foster improved
financial conditions more generally,"" a Fed statement said. What started more than a year ago as a meltdown in the U.S.
market for high-risk mortgages has engulfed the world, freezing
access to credit, sparking bank collapses and requiring the
financial bailout of entire countries. U.S. stock futures shot higher in response to the plan.
European shares reversed earlier losses. The European Commission will propose on Wednesday measures
to stimulate the recession-hit European economy including VAT
cuts and a call for lower European Central Bank rates. The draft proposal, obtained by Reuters, did not specify the
size of the stimulus plan, which Germany said last week could be
worth some 1 percent of European Union gross domestic product. The French government will launch its own ""quite massive""
stimulus in the next 10 days, President Nicolas Sarkozy said. ""In less than 10 days we will announce a revival plan to
save the car industry ... and strengthen the building sector,""
Sarkozy said during round table discussions in northern France. A more reticent Chancellor Angela Merkel said the German
government would decide in January whether additional measures
to support growth were needed.  RECESSION A REALITY Paris-based think-tank the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development projected the U.S. economy would
shrink 0.9 percent next year. It revised its forecast for the euro zone, saying it would
contract 0.6 percent, more than the 0.5 it had predicted. ""The recession which we are heading into now may turn out to
be even deeper and even the world economy at large may go into
recession,"" OECD chief economist Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel said. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Britain's fiscal
package would mitigate its recession but not solve it. ""The most pressing is to ensure that normal bank lending is
resumed,"" he told a parliamentary committee. ""Without that, the
downturn in activity could become protracted and extremely
damaging."" Following huge losses tied to the U.S. housing market
collapse, banks continue to hoard cash rather than lend it to
each other, to businesses and individuals. Corporate gloom was widespread, eclipsing relief at the
rescue of number two U.S. bank Citigroup. AXA, Europe's second-biggest insurer based on premium
income, cut its 2008 profit forecast and said its 2012 financial
goals were increasingly ""obsolete"". The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal is poised to
cut 16 percent of its U.S. workforce, beginning in January, the
Wall Street Journal said. Australia's Qantas airline cut its 2009 profit forecast and
Honda, the world's top motorcycle maker, said sales could stop
growing in 2009.

bounce  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - World stocks rose more than one
percent on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve unveiled a
programme to buy mortgage and consumer-related securities in its
latest attempt to support the U.S. financial system. The Fed will buy up to $600 billion of mortgage-related debt
and securities plus $200 billion of consumer debt securities.
The announcement boosted European stocks and U.S. futures, which
pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street later. ""(The programme) should improve liquidity in asset-backed
securities. When you have demand for risk products, that should
diminish some appetite of the extreme flight-to-safety that
we've seen recently,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at
Raymond James & Associates at St Petersburg in Florida. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares rose 1
percent, after rallying nearly 9 percent on Monday -- its second
biggest one-day percentage rise on record. MSCI world equity index rose 1.1 percent. U.S. stock futures
were up around 2.5 percent.  Washington's announcement late on Sunday that it would
shoulder most losses on about $306 billion of Citigroup's risky
assets and inject new capital boosted world stocks by 6.6
percent on Monday. On Monday, Wall Street capped its best two-day gain since
the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash. Earlier, BHP Billiton fell nearly 40 percent after the top
global miner walked away from its hostile offer for rival Rio
Tinto. AXA also fell more than 10 percent after the insurer cut
its 2008 underlying profit outlook. Emerging stocks rose 2.7 percent. The December bund future was still up 18 ticks while U.S.
Treasury prices steadied after the benchmark 10-year yield fell
to 3.22 percent earlier. ""The equity market rally we saw seems to be pretty much a
fleeting affair, consequently Treasuries remained underpinned,""
said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets. The yen was up 0.6 percent at 96.50 per dollar while the
dollar erased early gains to stand flat on the day against a
basket of major currencies. U.S. crude oil fell 3.8 percent to $52.39 a barrel after
rising more than 9 percent on Monday. Data confirmed that the U.S. economy is half way into
recession with third-quarter GDP contracting 0.5 percent.
Interest rate futures are fully pricing in the Federal Reserve
to cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 0.5 percent
in December. ""Although we expect the Fed to lower its Fed funds target
rate to zero in January next year, the market has not fully
priced in the Fed's zero interest rate policy,"" JP Morgan said

310,"Nov 16, 2008 10:02AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Unremitting gloom and capital flight,nan," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Investors enter the week
surrounded by unrelentingly poor global economic news, fading
hopes of a significant end-of-year stock market recovery and a
growing reliance on governments coming to the rescue. Attention is likely to be particularly keenly focused on
Britain, a G7 economy from which investment is fleeing; Russia,
which has been in free fall; and on global interest rate and tax
policy. But investors are also desperately sifting through the
market wreckage for new investments that may bring returns after
a year of mind-numbing losses for many.  ""We are sitting at a point where the data is unremittingly
gloomy, so any sign of life would be comforting,"" said John
Stopford, head of fixed income at Anglo-South African firm
Investec Asset Management. Investors are being battered by a wave of economic
indicators pointing to recession in the United States, Britain,
Germany and the euro zone as a whole, while major emerging
markets are toppling. This is leading in many cases to investment flight. Few places are currently under pressure as much as Britain,
where growth has tumbled, unemployment has spiked and interest
rates have been slashed. Sterling has lost a quarter of its value against the dollar
over the past 3-1/2 months and is down nearly 8 percent this
month alone. On a trade-weighted basis, the pound hit a 13-year low
against other currencies last week and a new record low against
the euro. This is showing up in fixed income investments. ""After a 12-month period of relatively stable flows of
foreign capital into and out of UK fixed income instruments,""
Bank of New York Mellon analyst Neil Mellor wrote last week,
""since mid-September we have been registering extremely heavy
outflows."" He estimated the outflows from UK fixed income instruments
since Sept. 10 have offset around 75 percent of the inflows seen
since the start of 2004. The flight is unlikely to be reversed by the Bank of
England. Just days after it slashed rates by 1-1/2 percentage
points to 3.00 percent, Governor Mervyn King said last week it
was prepared to cut rates further if needed to refloat the
economy. That left many investors expecting rates of just 1.5
percent or even 1 percent next year. Meanwhile, once-booming Russia is being clobbered by
investor capital flight, triggered by a mixture of economic
concern, falling oil prices and unease over the potential for
political intervention. Last week the authorities allowed what was effectively a 1
percent devaluation of the rouble against their euro/dollar
basket, and investors are concerned about more if oil continues
to fall. Russian stocks, meanwhile, have shed more than $1 trillion
since May with the dollar-based RTS exchange falling 73 percent
since the beginning of June.  EARNINGS RECESSION It is also becoming apparent to many investors that a hoped
for year-end rally on stock markets may well not materialise. MSCI's main gauge of world stocks, its all-country index, is
heading for its sixth consecutive month of losses, down around
45 percent for the year to date. The current batch of U.S. and European earnings have done
little to lift spirits despite lowered expectations and about as
many surprises on the upside as on the downside. Neil Dwane, European chief investment officer of fund firm
RCM, noted that companies are still reporting results that
trigger sharp stock falls, suggesting that corporate gloom is
still not properly priced in. ""Falls of 10 percent suggest the market is too optimistic,""
he said. It has all led some investors to predict a severe earnings
recession next year. France's AXA Investment Managers, for
example, is forecasting an overall global earnings decline of 25
to 40 percent over two years. Despite this, a number of leading investors have begun
looking at corporate debt, which is seen as having priced in too
much gloom. Stopford of Investec, for example, reckons the current price
of corporate bonds globally is assuming a far greater economic
disaster than the Great Depression.  GOVERNMENT HELP Little wonder, against this economic and market background,
that investors are becoming increasingly reliant on governments
and central banks to dig them out of the hole. Following the weekend meeting of G20 political leaders in
Washington, the focus is likely to be on new stimulus packages
and tax cuts to re-inflate consumer spending. Announcements of such plans in the past have lifted stock
market sentiment, but often only for a brief time. Stock markets, for example, rallied sharply a week ago after
China announced a nearly $600 billion stimulus package, but it
fizzled rapidly with world stocks falling for most of the week. Meanwhile the relative absence of inflation -- the result of
falling global demand -- is allowing central banks to cut or
promise to cut interest rates. On Wednesday, the Bank of England publishes the minutes of
the Nov. 6 meeting when it slashed rates. The Bank of Japan will
announce its latest decision on Friday. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
