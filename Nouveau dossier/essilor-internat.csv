The FTC has five seats, and no more than three can be from one party.Trump has also said that he would nominate Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be a Democratic member of the FTC.Another White House spokeswoman said that Chopra's nomination was also expected to be sent to the Senate shortly.The expectation is that the two men would be confirmed before Ohlhausen leaves, according to a government official who spoke on background.If not, only Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat, would remain.Under the FTC statute, one commissioner can make decisions because there is no quorum requirement, the government official said.The agency works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates allegations of deceptive behavior by companies.It is currently reviewing a number of big mergers in industries where there are already few players.One is a deal to merge industrial gases companies  Praxair Inc  (NYSE:PX) and  Linde  AG (DE:LING).

Luxottica also declined to comment.Luxottica shares last traded up 0.6 percent at 50.75 euros on Thursday, while Essilor closed up 0.3 percent at 112.50 euros.The deal was worth 46 billion euros when it was unveiled in January but a rise in the share prices has pushed up the value since then to 48 billion euros.Some rivals and opticians have expressed concerns that the merged company might persuade opticians to buy eyewear and lenses as a package, leveraging on Luxottica's strong brand portfolio which includes Ray Ban, Oakley and Persol as well as licensed names such as Chanel and Armani.The companies have told the EU competition enforcer that this was unlikely and also cited buoyant competition.Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said the imminent EU approval meant that the deal looks set to be cleared by competition authorities in all major markets without material concessions.The deal has already secured the regulatory green light in Australia, Canada, Colombia, India, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan. U.S regulators are also expected to give the go-ahead.However, the authorities in Singapore and Brazil are taking a closer look.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Antitrust enforcers must prove in court that a deal will hurt consumers.But vertical mergers often have indirect, pernicious effects on the giants' smaller competitors in a way that leads to higher prices. Frame makers may not get the lenses they want, for example, if the new, bigger company withholds sales, according to two industry experts who asked not to be named to protect business relationships.Despite this, six of seven antitrust experts said the deal was likely to be approved since the companies specialize in different aspects of the business. Still, several also expressed concern about the creation of an eyeglass giant with outsized clout. ""I would be surprised if they (the FTC) sued to block it. They might put some conditions on it,"" said Caroline Holland, a veteran of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. ""A Democratic administration would have been more skeptical of this merger and more likely to block it.""Essilor and Luxottica spokespeople said that the deal was pro-competitive and said in similar statements that they were working with the FTC.EU INVESTIGATESThe merger has already been approved by the competition authorities in several countries including India, Japan and New Zealand. But European Union antitrust regulators opened a full-scale investigation in September - suspended in October while it waits for data - saying the deal may reduce competition and lead to higher prices. The final outcome there could hinge on concessions the two companies make.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, worried that the combined company would refuse to sell to rival frame and lens makers. ""Smaller frame rivals and smaller lens manufacturers are going to struggle. (The consumer) they'll pay higher prices,"" she said. Luxottica, with Burberry, Chanel and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) frames, has 40 to 50 percent of the U.S. frame market, according to an industry and regulatory expert who spoke on background to protect business relationships.Essilor has about 40 percent of the U.S. lens market, according to an industry executive who spoke privately to protect business relationships. Other lens makers, Carl Zeiss Group and HOYA Group, are considerably smaller.Both companies declined to give U.S. market share data.The two companies are the biggest U.S. retail eyeglass sellers. Essilor is No. 1 with Vision Source, a group of 3,300 optometric practices, while Luxottica, owner of Pearle Vision and LensCrafters is No. 2, according to the trade publication VisionMonday.Luxottica also owns EyeMed Vision Care, the second-largest U.S. vision benefits company. EyeMed steers people who need glasses to Luxottica retail outlets, angering rival frames and lens makers, according to industry sources.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Reuters reported on Sept. 11 that the competition enforcer had expressed worries about the deal to the companies.Luxottica shares fell 1.4 percent to 46.86 euros in late trading, while Essilor's declined 1.3 percent to 103.35 euros.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the deal could affect a huge number of people.""Half of Europeans wear glasses and almost all of us will need vision correction one day. Therefore we need to carefully assess whether the proposed merger would lead to higher prices or reduced choices for opticians and ultimately consumers,"" she said.Key concerns include the possibility that the merged company may persuade opticians to buy eyewear and lenses as a package and exclude rival eyewear suppliers competing for ophthalmic lenses. The Commission will decide by Feb. 12 whether to clear the deal. Luxottica owns brands including Ray-Ban and Oakley. Essilor competes with Hoya (T:7741), Carl Zeiss [CZTOP.UL] and Bausch & Lomb [WPRISB.UL].  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

69,"Sep 13, 2017 04:42AM ET",Apple suppliers dent European shares as equity rally falters,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares faltered on Wednesday as a global equity rally showed signs of flagging, with Apple suppliers struggling after the new iPhone release disappointed with a later than expected shipping date.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) dipped 0.3 percent as weakness in chipmakers was compounded by a drop in miners (SXPP). [MET/L]Euro zone stocks and blue chips (STOXX50E) held steady, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), which touched its highest in nearly two months on Tuesday, fell back 0.1 percent.Chipmakers supplying to Apple (O:AAPL) were among the worst performers, with AMS (S:AMS) down 3.9 percent, while Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) slipped 1.7 percent and STMicro (MI:STM) fell 1.1 percent.Traders said their shares were under pressure due to Apple's new $999 iPhone X shipping later than expected, on November 3. The price tag could also dent demand for the device in markets such as China.""With the iPhone coming in around $1,000 it will be interesting to see how healthy demand is,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.""If it's relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and that consumers have confidence.""Chipmakers have been the best performing among Europe's tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector's outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. Richemont  (S:CFR) fell 1.6 percent despite reporting a sales beat for its first half thanks to a recovery in the Asian luxury market. UBS analysts said weaker retail growth may weigh on sentiment.Peer Swatch (S:UHR) also fell 2.5 percent, with some traders citing concerns that Apple's new watch could also dent the watchmaker's shares.The merging eyewear and lens makers  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and Essilor (PA:ESSI) were also among the biggest fallers, down 1.9 to 2.1 percent. EU antitrust regulators were set to tell the firms of concerns they have over the merger this week.Covestro (DE:1COV) was among a handful of risers, up 2.7 percent after German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (DE:BAYGn) sold a 9.4 percent stake in the firm, in order to finance part of its acquisition of  Monsanto  (N:MON).European stocks were struggling for a further boost after sinking 7 percent over the summer months.""Our view is that European equities still have potential for upside,"" said JPMAM's Bell.""The earnings outlook is quite strong still; Europe has among the highest operating leverage of any major market so if the global economy remains strong that should drive margin expansion and earnings growth."""
70,"Sep 11, 2017 02:55PM ET",Exclusive: EU regulators have concerns over Luxottica-Essilor merger - source,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU anti-trust regulators will meet  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and Essilor (PA:ESSI) this week to express concerns about their plan to merge into a 46 billion-euro ($55.12 billion) global eyewear powerhouse, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.The move suggests the European Commission wants concessions to address their concerns and that they could open an in-depth investigation if these are not given or seen as insufficient.Italy's Luxottica is the world's largest maker of spectacles, owning brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and has 9,000 retail stores. France's Essilor is the world's top lens-maker.Luxottica declined to comment. Essilor was not immediately available for comment.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Reuters this month that the deal would require careful vetting given the size of the two companies' market shares. The commission is seeking views from all interested parties.Some retailers fear being undercut by an Essilor-Luxottica group able to offer famous brands and prescription lenses at prices they could not hope to match without hurting margins.""This is a significant development which will result in huge supply-chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,"" Specsavers, an international retail partnership, said in a statement emailed to Reuters.Specsavers, which says it has 1,700 stores in 10 countries, and some others in the industry have said they doubt the merger would be felt immediately by consumers.In the first regulatory ruling on the merger, New Zealand's competition regulator approved the deal last week, saying Luxottica-Essilor would ""be sufficiently constrained by the presence of existing competitors with the ability to expand at all levels of the supply chain and in all relevant markets"".Lens-makers, too, are watching developments closely, given that Essilor will have access to Luxottica's retail chains spanning the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific.Essilor, in its half-year earnings briefing in July, referred to ""a challenging market reaction"" to the merger. It acknowledged that some of its customers had switched away from Essilor, but said there had been no major sales impact.""The eyeglass market is competitive. Customers have choices,"" Essilor Chief Operating Officer Laurent Vacherot said.Japanese lens-maker Hoya Corp (T:7741) expects the effect to be felt on the high street rather than on its own core business, with retailers pressured to lower prices by a few percentage points annually, said a source familiar with the matter.Hoya expects the pressure to be felt most keenly in the United States, which accounts for about a third of Hoya's global business, the source said. Hoya sells mostly to independent stores and wants to channel more of its sales via chain stores.($1 = 0.8345 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Sep 02, 2017 03:20PM ET",EU's Vestager says Essilor-Luxottica merger requires thorough vetting,nan,"CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - The proposed merger of Italian spectacles maker  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) with French lens manufacturer Essilor (PA:ESSI) will require thorough vetting by European antitrust authorities, the head of the bloc's competition watchdog said on Saturday.Luxottica, the world's biggest eyewear company whose brands include Ray-Ban and Oakley, agreed in January a merger with Essilor, the biggest lens maker, to create an industry giant with a market value of 47 billion euros ($56 billion), more than 15 billion euros in revenues and 144,000 staff. The deal needs to clear antitrust hurdles in several countries and if approved is expected to close around the end of the year.The EU Commission was officially notified on Aug. 22 .EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said it was too early to say whether approval may require the companies to make significant concessions.""These are companies that have very big market shares and also, when it comes to sunglasses and lenses for glasses, obviously this is an important market, it is a very valuable market so I cannot say,"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti business conference in Italy.A negative reaction from Essilor's customers to the merger, which the company said in July had affected its first-half sales, has raised concerns among analysts that the two companies may be required to take more substantial concessions to satisfy the competition regulators than initially anticipated.Exane-BNP Paribas analysts said in a recent note the examination of the deal by EU competition authorities would include sounding out competitors, clients, and professional associations as well as reviewing possible complaints. ""Hence our concern over the mounting pushback from customers, recently stressed by Essilor,"" they said. A 'vertical integration' between two companies operating at different stages of the production chain is normally less worrying for competition watchdogs than a ""horizontal"" merger boosting a firm's market share. But a vertical tie-up can still risk blocking rivals' access to suppliers or buyers, a process known as 'foreclosure'.Vestager said a careful examination was necessary given the size of the two companies.""Even if it is a vertical integration, when you have market shares of this kind, in the high double digits, of course we have to be thorough in our analysis to make sure you don't foreclose,"" she said.Also asked about possible competition hurdles for the purchase of the troubled Ilva steel plant in southern Italy by ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker, Vestager said it was a ""very tricky case"" but good cooperation so far with the Italian authorities boded well for the approval process ahead.($1 = 0.8434 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We have already cashed in the benefits of low interest rates,"" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Padoan suggested phasing out the scheme could be good for Italy's banks, which are groaning under almost 200 billion euros ($212.7 billion) in bad loans, as it would end an era of very low interest rates.""With higher interest rates the banks will have wider margin to get profits so this will help improve their balance sheet position,"" Padoan said.Following concerted stake-building by France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) in broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), and a merger between eyewear makers Essilor (PA:ESSI) and  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) which will create a Paris-listed group, Padoan said interest in Italian firms was a sign of their quality.""There is an element of paranoia in the debate,"" he said. ""The fact that many Italian companies are being considered by other companies is a sign that there are many good, profitable Italian companies.""Regarding Mediaset, which is controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Padoan said: ""We are of course watching what is going on, but these are private companies so the government has nothing to do or say specifically.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

95,"Jan 17, 2017 03:10AM ET",Luxottica's Del Vecchio says listing in both Italy and France still an option: report,nan,"(Reuters) - The group created by the merger of Italy's  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and France's Essilor (PA:ESSI) will consider a listing in both Italy and France, as well as the United States, Luxottica founder Leonardo del Vecchio was quoted as saying on Tuesday. The companies agreed on Monday a 46 billion euro ($49 billion) merger to create a global eyewear powerhouse with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros. They said the combined business would be listed in Paris.""The double listing is an option on the table which we will evaluate in the next days, and so will the listing on the U.S. market,"" said Del Vecchio in an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The all-share deal is aimed at helping the two businesses take full advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses, in a market worth 95 billion euros. It also removes - for the time being - uncertainty over succession at Luxottica, which has lost three CEOs since 2014 because of divergences with Del Vecchio.Del Vecchio rejected the idea that Luxottica was being sold off to the French and said that although his family investment company would dilute its position it would remain the biggest shareholder in EssilorLuxottica. ""The Luxottica world will always firmly remain Italian, with its head in Milan and its heart in the Belluno mountains,"" Del Vecchio said, referring to the manufacturer's base in the mountain town of Agordo.Through holding Delfin, the 81-year-old tycoon will be the biggest shareholder of the combined group, with a stake of between 31 percent and 38 percent.Del Vecchio, who returned to the helm of his company two years ago, will be the CEO and executive chairman of the merged group.Despite his hands-on-role in Luxottica, he said that ""as soon as I will realize that my presence is not essential I will leave any executive position in the group.""He added past organizational changes in Luxottica, much criticized by the market, were ""essential to have a stronger and more modern company capable of facing (the merger)"".

96,"Jan 16, 2017 10:53AM ET","Investors turn wary as Brexit, Trump uncertainty grows",nan,"By Nigel StephensonLONDON (Reuters) - Investors sold sterling and stocks on Monday, seeking shelter in gold and the Japanese yen as uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union and the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump curbed appetite for risky assets.U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Day holiday, crimping market activity and potentially exacerbating price moves.The dollar (DXY) rose, except against the yen, rebounding after suffering its worst week since November last week, when it was hit by a lack of clarity over what Trump, whose inauguration is on Friday, will do once he assumes office.The price of gold, a frequently sought haven for investors in uncertain times, hit its highest level since November.""The market is taking a reality check from Trump euphoria, equity markets are moving sideways, the dollar has steadied and bond yields are down, allowing gold to recover,"" Julius Baer commodities analyst Carsten Menke said.Yields on low-risk German government bonds fell, but those on Italian equivalents edged up after rating agency DBRS cut Italy's credit rating late on Friday, a move that could raise borrowing costs for the country's banks. But the eye-catching mover was Britain's pound, a day before a speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Media reported that she would lay out an exit from the EU that would see Britain lose access to the bloc's single market.The pound  fell as low as $1.1983 in thin early Asian trade, which, barring a sudden ""flash crash"" in October, was its weakest against the dollar in 32 years.Investors will scrutinize May's speech for clues to whether she plans to prioritize immigration controls in a ""hard Brexit"" that some analysts say could hurt the economy.The fall in sterling, which makes UK exports cheaper, has contributed to an unprecedented 14-day rally in the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index (FTSE).The index fell 0.2 percent on Monday but still outperformed continental European markets. The main STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.8 percent, as declines in autos and banks offset a rally in eyewear makers  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and Essilor (PA:ESSI), who agreed a 46 billion-euro merger.German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG), Daimler  and VW (DE:VOWG) fell between 1.6 and 1.8 percent after Trump warned he would impose a 35 percent border tax on vehicles imported to the U.S. market.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) eased 0.6 percent, Japan's Nikkei (N225) lost 1 percent as the strong yen hit exporters.Sterling last traded at $1.2055, down 1 percent on the day. The euro was up 0.6 percent at 87.97 pence (EURGBP=) while the yen was up 0.8 percent at 137.40 to the pound.""Every time there’s hard Brexit headlines, that triggers a fresh bout of selling,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said.""It's almost impossible to see Europe allowing the UK to remain a full member of the single market if it wants to regain control of the border and the laws and wants to strike its own agreement,"" he added.The dollar index (DXY), which measures the U.S. currency against six of its peers, rose 0.4 percent. The euro <EUR=> fell 0.4 percent to $1.0602 while the yen, another perceived safe haven investment, rose 0.5 percent to 113.99 per dollar. ITALY DOWNGRADEDGerman 10-year bond yields fell 2 basis points to 0.25 percent <DE10YT=TWEB>. Italian 10-year yields, by contrast, rose marginally to 1.90 percent.Italy's downgrade will mean Italian banks will have to pay more to borrow money from the European Central Bank when they use the country's sovereign bonds as collateral. It may also make Italian debt less attractive for foreign buyers.Oil held steady, though doubts that large oil producers will cut output, as agreed by the Organization of the Oil Producing Countries and others, put prices under pressure Brent, the international benchmark, last traded at $55.37 a barrel, down 8 cents on the day (LCOc1).For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

97,"Jan 16, 2017 09:34AM ET",Luxottica and Essilor in 46 billion euro merger to create eyewear giant,nan,"By Valentina Za and Sudip Kar-GuptaMILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Italy's  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and France's Essilor (PA:ESSI) have agreed a 46 billion euro ($49 billion) merger to create a global eyewear powerhouse with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros. The all-share deal is one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups and brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, with leading lens manufacturer Essilor. ""Finally ... two products which are naturally complementary -- namely frames and lenses -- will be designed, manufactured and distributed under the same roof,"" Luxottica's 81-year-old founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said in a statement on Monday.Shares in Luxottica were up by 8.6 percent at 53.80 euros by 1405 GMT (9:05 a.m. ET), with Essilor up 12.2 percent at 114.60 euros.The merger between the top players in the 95 billion eyewear market is aimed at helping the businesses to take full advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses due to an aging global population and increasing awareness about eye care. Jefferies analysts estimate that the market is growing at between 2 percent and 4 percent a year, while Luxottica and Essilor say that at least 2.5 billion people in the world still suffer from uncorrected vision problems.The deal also removes -- for now at least -- uncertainty over succession at Luxottica, which has lost three CEOs since 2014 because of rifts with Del Vecchio. ""The strategic rationale is strong,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove analysts said in a note, adding that the deal defuses the risk of growing competition between two groups that had been encroaching on each other's areas of expertise in recent years, with Essilor buying online retailers and Luxottica investing in lens manufacturing. ONLINE FOCUSBoth companies have been grappling with slowing sales growth, hit by weakness in North America, and face rising competition from cheaper rivals and the challenge of online distribution.While Asia and Latin America are seen by the companies as potential growth markets, e-commerce will also be a top priority. Luxottica's third-quarter results had showed revenue from its online platforms grew by 18 percent, with the company stating that e-commerce had been targeted as an area for accelerated growth in 2017. The third-quarter e-commerce growth far exceeded that for overall sales, which rose by 1.4 percent at constant exchange rates. The merger is expected to boost operating profit by up to 600 million euros in the medium term, the companies said.It will also leave smaller rivals lagging even further behind. Dutch retailer GrandVision (AS:GVNV) and Italy's  Safilo Group  (MI:SFLG) had revenue of 3.2 billion euros and 1.3 billion euros respectively in 2015. Though advisers on the deal have presented it as a merger of equals, Del Vecchio will be the biggest shareholder of the combined group with a stake of between 31 percent and 38 percent through his family holding company Delfin. Voting rights will be capped at 31 percent.Analysts said that Essilor shareholders are getting a good deal because the share exchange ratio implies a 5 percent discount to Luxottica's closing price on Friday, which was down 27 percent from its 2015 peak.Delfin will contribute its 62 percent stake in Luxottica at a ratio of 1 share in the Italian group for every 0.461 Essilor shares. The French lens maker will launch a mandatory exchange offer on all remaining Luxottica shares at the same ratio, with the aim of delisting Luxottica's shares.TWIN BOSSESThe merged EssilorLuxottica will have 140,000 staff and will be headquartered and listed in Paris. It will also have a complex governance structure, with Del Vecchio and Essilor Chairman and CEO Hubert Sagnieres effectively sharing the driving seat, while the 16-strong board will have an even split of Essilor and Luxottica executives. A source close to the deal said no arrangements had been made at this stage for when Del Vecchio will retire.Del Vecchio, who returned to the helm of Luxottica two years ago after taking a back seat for the previous 10 years, will be CEO and executive chairman of the merged group. Sagnieres, 61, will serve as executive vice-chairman and deputy CEO, but he and Del Vecchio will have the same powers.In a conference call with analysts, the two sought to play down concerns over the co-leadership.""We have and share the same values, we have and share the same vision, we have and share the same interest in the product ... If we really want to provide consumers with the best product, Leonardo and I will have to co-manage,"" Sagnieres said.Del Vecchio, who grew up as an orphan but is now Italy's second-richest person, said he had long dreamed of such a merger.""This marriage will take place and will work,"" he said.The deal is expected to close by the end of the year and Del Vecchio said he is confident there will be no problems gaining approval from competition authorities.Luxottica and Essilor, which have a market value of about 24 billion euros and 22 billion euros respectively, had explored a possible tie-up a few years ago.Luxottica said in September 2014 that discussions had taken place in 2013 but were dropped for a number of reasons, including shareholding governance issues.A source close to the deal said that the two companies' business models, operations and strategy have converged since then and that the merger makes more sense now, given growing competition. The source said the tie-up had been agreed in the past six weeks.Mediobanca advised Delfin on the merger, with Essilor advised by Rothschild and Citi. Delfin's shareholders are Del Vecchio's six children and his second wife.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sterling sinks to lowest level since October flash crashThe British pound tumbled to the lowest level since October’s flash crash on Monday, following media reports that suggested Prime Minister Theresa May's government was prepared to make a ""clean and hard"" exit from the European Union, ahead of her speech on Tuesday.The pound fell by as much as 1.5% to hit lows of 1.1988 in early trade, a level not seen since the flash crash of early October. It was last at 1.2059 by 5:55AM ET (10:55GMT), down around 1% on the day (GBP/USD).The euro gained 0.5% to 0.8781, well off a session high of 0.8852 (EUR/GBP), while sterling sank 1.25% against the yen to 137.74, recovering after hitting a daily low of 136.47 (GBP/JPY).The currency pared losses after a Downing Street spokeswoman said talk of a hard Brexit was ""speculation.""2. Global stocks mostly lowerEuropean equities were lower in mid-morning trade, as investors await more detail on the U.K.'s Brexit plan and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. later this week.Earlier, in Asia, markets ended broadly lower, with the Shanghai Composite in China closing down 0.3%, while Japan's Nikkei slumped 1%.U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday, a factor analysts said would likely limit global trading volumes.3. Gold climbs to 8-week highGold prices started the week higher, rallying to the strongest level in around two months with investors spooked by concerns over Britain's exit from the European Union, while U.S. policy uncertainty lingered ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.Prices of the yellow metal touched a session peak of $1,208.70 a troy ounce, a level not seen since November 23.

German automakers slump after Trump warningShares in German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) all fell about 2% after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned he will impose a border tax of 35% on vehicles imported from abroad to the U.S. market.In an interview with German newspaper Bild, published on Monday, Trump sharply criticized the German carmakers for failing to produce more cars on U.S. soil.All three carmakers have invested heavily in factories in Mexico, where production costs are lower than the United States, with an eye to exporting smaller vehicles to the U.S. market.5.  Luxottica  , Essilor merge, creating eyewear giant worth €46 billionItaly's Luxottica Group (MI:LUX) and France's Essilor (PA:ESSI) have agreed a €46 billion ($49 billion) merger to create a global powerhouse in the eyewear industry with annual revenue of more than €15 billion, they said in a statement on Monday.The deal, one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups, brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Oakley and Ray-Ban, with Essilor, the world's leading manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses.Shares were soaring 9% and 14%, respectively."

136,"Mar 02, 2015 08:08PM ET",Canada's Hardy Capital sees online shoe retailer IPO in 2015,nan,"By John TilakTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian entrepreneur and venture capitalist Roger Hardy said on Monday he is looking to take an online shoe retailing company public this year to tap investor appetite for e-commerce businesses.Hardy told Reuters by phone that he expects the company, which will be called Shoes.com Technologies Ltd, to record net revenue $250 million in 2015, with the United States contributing about 85 percent. The company's revenue was over $200 million in 2014, and its U.S. business is profitable, he said, projecting the firm's growth at more than 30 percent a year over the next five years.Though he said it was too early to release details of the potential IPO, Hardy said the company could currently be valued at $500 million to $750 million based on valuation metrics for e-commerce firms. A listing may either be in Toronto or a major U.S. exchange, or both. ""The footwear category is undergoing a tremendous shift. You're seeing this big migration to online purchases,"" Hardy told Reuters. ""We're trying to stay in front of this trend."" The e-commerce industry, dominated by giants such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and eBay Inc (O:EBAY), is highly sought by venture capitalists and investors as more consumers make their purchases online. China's e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) recorded the world's biggest IPO at $25 billion last September. Hardy made a name for himself last year when he sold Coastal Contacts Inc, a digital retailer of eyeglasses and contact lenses, to Essilor International (PARIS:ESSI) for about C$430 million. Coastal was listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. With help from his investing vehicle, Vancouver-based Hardy Capital Partners, he has since acquired OnlineShoes.com, which had revenue of $140 million, and Shoes.com, with revenue of $60 million. Those two businesses were merged with ShoeMe.ca, which targets Canadian consumers.Canada is the fastest-growing region for the company, in part because online retailing in the country is not as mature as the U.S. market. Less than 1 percent of Canadian footwear purchases are made online, compared with 10 percent in the United States, Hardy said.""Demand from investors is overwhelming. The market is hungry for fast-growing technology businesses,"" Hardy said. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research, expects the U.S. online footwear industry to reach $12 billion in 2015 and show double-digit growth.""The footwear industry is growing very quickly. The consumer has definitely voted in favor of the category,"" Mulpuru said.Still, some industry experts caution the climate for IPOs this year could be challenging, given higher volatility in equity markets. The competitive retail industry could also pose headwinds, with brick-and-mortar companies pushing aggressively online, they said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote
