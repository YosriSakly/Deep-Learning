Eviation is aiming for a first test-flight later this year and U.S. certification by 2022.On a single charge, Alice can fly 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) at 10,000 feet with a cruising speed of 276 miles per hour. Cape Air, a Massachusetts-based regional carrier, has taken an option to add a double-digit number of the $4 million planes to its fleet, Eviation disclosed at the show.FLYING BATTERYThe aircraft, with a flattened profile and propellers at its wing tips, was designed as an electric plane from the ground up, said Omer Bar-Yohay, Eviation's founder and CEO.""It's basically a huge battery with some plane painted on it,"" he told reporters.Among signs of growing interest from traditional players, engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) said on Tuesday it had bought the electric aerospace division of Germany's Siemens - which is also one of the suppliers of motors to Alice.Engineers see a bigger future for hybrids, which can combine lighter, downsized jet engines with an electric boost during take-off and climb, for a 30% fuel saving. The additional thrusters or e-propellers also help stability, allowing a more streamlined airframe to reduce drag and consumption further.""Then you're starting to get to the kind of economics and sustainability that's closer to a bus than it is to aviation historically,"" United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Chief Technology Officer Paul Eremenko said during a panel discussion.UBS predicts demand for $178 billion in green aviation technologies by 2040 as they become more mainstream.""The consumer is probably going to demand an acceleration in this space,"" said Celine Fornaro, the Swiss bank's head of industrials research. ""It's starting to be more present in everyone's conscience.""Airbus is also looking at hybrid-electric technology for future passenger aircraft generations, but few would bet on its readiness to power the 200-seaters expected to replace the workhorse A320 jet family in the 2030s.Carbon emissions from commercial aviation account for about 2.5% of the global total but are set to expand in step with emerging middle classes, especially in Asia.To counter their impact, the industry is introducing the CORSIA program, which requires airlines to fund cuts to atmospheric carbon dioxide elsewhere, offsetting their emissions growth while awaiting hybrid planes and alternative fuels. 'DECADES AWAY'Reconciling airlines' growth ambitions with their promised 50% carbon emissions cut from 2005 levels will be no easy task.""We don't know how that's going to happen yet,"" said Greg Hyslop, Boeing's technology chief.But aerospace leaders are adamant that the answer cannot be fewer flights.""We've got to make aviation grow and be sustainable,"" Rolls-Royce CTO Paul Stein said during the same panel. ""Those who propose traveling less are heading for a darker place.""Brussels-based lobby group Airlines for Europe said ""taxing aviation is not a solution"", in a statement ahead of the EU ministerial meetings starting on Thursday in the Netherlands.But campaigners like Greenpeace transport specialist Sarah Fayolle say taxation and other regulation is warranted by the urgent need to slash emissions.""We're facing a climate emergency that cannot wait for uncertain technological solutions that are decades away,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1,"Jun 18, 2019 03:35PM ET",Airbus seeks new partners to expand in U.S. space market,nan,"By Andrea ShalalPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus' defense division is looking for new partners to expand its presence in the growing U.S. space market, and could potentially build components for a lunar program there, Airbus Defense and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke told Reuters.Airbus is ramping up production of more than 640 refrigerator-sized satellites for start-up telecoms services provider OneWeb at a facility in Florida, that Hoke said would already give it some leverage in the U.S. market.The company could also produce components in the United States for its European Support Module, a critical part of NASA's Orion spacecraft, if that is modified as a module to access the moon, Hoke told Reuters at the Paris Airshow.""We're also looking for new partners, with whom we could expand our footprint in the U.S.,"" he said. ""We have some very good products and systems so it's worthwhile to look at what we can do beyond what we do currently in Europe.""Airbus's defense and space division has long hoped to expand operations in the U.S. market, but lost out to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on a lucrative U.S. Air Force refueling plane contract in 2011.The company, which builds satellites and works with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) to build rocket launchers, now hopes the projected ""new space"" economy, which experts say could be worth $1 trillion a year, could give it another shot at a bigger U.S. role.Hoke faulted European leaders for failing to articulate a clear, unified vision for its ambitions in the space business, and said they were essentially ceding leadership to the United States and billionaire private investors, such as Elon Musk.""This is more than just a billionaire’s race to Mars. It is about having sovereign access to space, having access to resources in the long term, and of course, unfortunately, it is also a question of defense.""Failing to take action and jump start new research and development program would leave Europe ""in the second and third row position,"" he said, noting that it would also cause a brain drain of top talent.Rick Ambrose, head of U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin's space division, the lead contractor on the Orion spacecraft, told Reuters his company was in preliminary discussions with Airbus about possibly the adapting the European Support Module to bring humans to the moon and back to an orbiting lunar station.Ambrose said no decisions had been made, but it was ""a logical conclusion"" that some of the items developed by Airbus for the Orion spacecraft could be used to achieve U.S. President Donald Trump's goal of putting humans back on the Moon by 2024.""Getting to the moon by 2024 means .... we're going to have to reuse everything we can reuse,"" he said at the air show.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

CFM International, the GE-Safran venture, will deliver the first engine by 2020.The order is a blow to Pratt, a division of United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX)., which has grappled with delivery delays and groundings in India after spending $10 billion to develop its fuel-efficient geared turbofan for single-aisle jets. The deal strengthens CFM’s presence in India, the world’s fastest growing aviation market last year, with the local affiliate of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and state-run Air India Ltd. already using its turbines.A move by IndiGo, Asia’s biggest budget carrier by market value, to CFM “would be a key reputational negative” for Pratt’s geared turbofan and could hurt future sales campaigns, Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note to clients on May 30.IndiGo, which controls almost half of the local market in India, had ordered 430 A320neo-family jets, and chose Pratt to supply turbines for the first 150 of them. The airline, founded by billionaires Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, is in talks with Airbus to place another “large” order to fuel an ambitious growth plan beyond the subcontinent, Chief Executive Officer Ronojoy Dutta said in an interview last month."

France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Germany's MTU Aero Engines will jointly develop the new warplane's engine.Dassault and Airbus have delivered a joint industrial proposal to the governments of France and Germany. ""The first demonstrator phase marks another decisive step,"" they said in a joint statement. France had explored working with Britain on the project, bringing together Europe's two biggest military powers. But in July 2017, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced plans for the new Future Combat Air System (SCAF), including a fighter jet and a range of associated weapons such as drones.Britain launched its own new fighter jet plan last July, laying bare European divisions and deepening scepticism about the future of European defense cooperation.The French and German governments expect to invest an initial 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in the combat jet by 2025, with France, the project leader, contributing 2.5 billion euros, according to the French defense ministry.Paris and Berlin target the first flight of a prototype around 2026.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

6,"Jun 06, 2019 04:30PM ET","As Trade Troubles Brew, Defense Stocks Guard Industrial Fort",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. aerospace and defense stocks kicked off this year under a cloud of uncertainty, amid concerns around a possible peak in spending and a prolonged government shutdown, yet nearly half way through, they are raking in the biggest returns among industrial companies.The S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Industry Index has risen over 20% so far in 2019, exceeding the 16% gain in the broader industrials sector group. The biggest gainers on the defense index this year include L3 Technologies Inc. and Harris Corp (NYSE:HRS)., each up more than 46%, as well as TransDigm Group Inc., with its 38% advance.“Defense stocks have been winners this year with geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and a renewed focus by the Trump administration to prioritize defense spending,” said Rohan Reddy, an analyst at Global X ETFs. The analyst via email said that he expected the strength in defense stocks and domestically focused industrial companies to continue if trade negotiations keep getting dragged out.The back and forth on trade has continued, with latest reports suggesting the U.S. was considering delaying the threatened Mexico tariffs as talks over the flow of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs from Central America were ongoing.While the U.S. government has opened trade wars on multiple fronts, impacting companies across industries such as automotive, manufacturing and transportation, it has also worked on a major arms deal with Taiwan, and stepped up its involvement regarding Iran. Last month, President Donald Trump agreed to send more troops to the region after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on Saudi oil installations as well as four ships.In a note published earlier this week, Buckingham analyst Richard  Safran  (PA:SAF) said the market might be ignoring macro factors that favor the defense sector, which include a continued demand for defense products that is driving government spending beyond expectations, a declining 10-year yield making corporate dividends seem more attractive, and lastly, tariff-related fears sparking a flight-to-safety trade.Meanwhile, transports have languished. Airlines have been beaten down the most, amid rapidly fluctuating oil prices, slowing domestic demand and the fallout from the twin fatal crashes that led to the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.’s 737 Max jets. However, railroad companies and truckers have not been spared either, with demand softening and the possibility of a Mexico tariff creating further uncertainties.“Transport stocks are a high risk/reward investment in today’s environment,” Global X’s Reddy said, adding that such companies will continue to be volatile as trade negotiations take place. “Airlines are likely to face challenges in the near term” as margins keep compressing, “although lower commodity prices may provide temporary relief,” Reddy added.The S&P 500 Airlines Industry Index has risen just 4% this year, with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings lagging the most.(Updates with share closing in paragraph two, adds trade update in paragraph four.)"

10,"May 15, 2019 04:38PM ET",MBDA boss faces battle of wits as Airbus strategy chief,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - The chief executive of European missile maker MBDA is returning to Airbus as head of strategy as the planemaker seeks to modernize its factories and explore future options in defense.Antoine Bouvier, 59, replaces Patrick de Castelbajac who becomes head of Airbus Asia-Pacific, Airbus said in a statement. Castelbajac's responsibility for Airbus international operations had already been transferred to sales chief Christian Scherer.At Airbus, Bouvier will be embarking on a battle of wits with a new opposite number at arch-rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.Chris Raymond, until recently head of Autonomous Systems, has been named Boeing's group-wide vice-president for enterprise strategy under finance director Greg Smith, Boeing said in his biography on its website, confirming a Reuters report.Bouvier's appointment is the latest evidence of a management shake-up at Airbus, accelerated by the promotion last month of planemaking chief Guillaume Faury to CEO.A former civil servant who narrowly missed out on running France's DGA defense procurement agency two years ago, Bouvier brings experience in forging defense partnerships to Airbus, which is embroiled in a row with Germany over arms controls.He will be replaced at MBDA by former OneWeb chief Eric Beranger.From July 1, Castelbajac will also assume responsibility for Asia sales, recently a key battleground with Boeing.China Airlines last week announced a leasing deal expected to pave the way for the Taiwan carrier to switch its medium-haul fleet to the Airbus A320neo rather than the Boeing 737 MAX.The deal to replace older 737s took years to complete and was drafted before the 737 MAX was engulfed by a crisis involving two crashes and a worldwide grounding.Although day-to-day competition remains intense, Airbus seems wary of over-exploiting the 737 MAX problems, fearing they could destabilize the market and supply chains, some industry sources say. A U.S. industry official denied this. NEXT GENERATIONThe future of the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX - the industry's most successful models - is seen as strategically entwined and insiders say Airbus is also worried about the impact of the grounding on global certification..Decisions on what replaces the current generation of single-aisle jets from about 2030 and how they are built could define the aircraft industry well into the second half of the century.Early planning of those models will be a major topic for strategists at both Airbus and Boeing in coming years.Insiders say Faury wants Airbus to focus on industrial strategy and closing a perceived gap with Boeing in production technology, as well as the threat of increased environmental regulation, when designing new products.Airbus must also assess how to respond to rising defense spending after its failure to merge with Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) in 2012 left it heavily skewed toward commercial markets that are now approaching the end of an extended upcycle.It is involved on the German side of a nascent Franco-German fighter project along with French partner Dassault Aviation but faces competition for valuable systems work and a growing spat with the German government over export controls.At MBDA, Bouvier was credited with driving an Anglo-French agreement on the use of shared missile technology.Bouvier followed the classic path of a French mandarin from prestigious Polytechnique engineering school to ENA civil service academy. He had been linked to top posts at suppliers such as  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Thales, although was not hired. ""His appointment will be very credible with the French government,"" a person familiar with the appointment said. France and Germany own 11 percent each of Airbus.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

11,"Apr 30, 2019 05:36PM ET","GE cautious as profit rises, cash burn slows; shares, bonds rise",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co said on Tuesday it generated more profit and lost less cash than expected in the first quarter, suggesting an improving outlook under its new leader that sent its shares and bonds higher.New Chief Executive Larry Culp cautioned, however, that the results stemmed largely from the timing of payments to suppliers and from customers, and did not alter GE's financial outlook for the year.""One quarter is a data point not a trend,"" Culp said on a conference call with analysts. GE's profit from continuing operations more than tripled as sales rose in GE's aviation, oil and gas, and healthcare units. At the same time, negative cash flow from industrial business was $1.2 billion, much less than the $2.16 billion outflow that analysts, on average, were expecting.Culp had set low earnings targets in March and warned that GE's industrial cash flow could be negative by as much as $2 billion.GE's shares rose 4.5% to close at $10.17, after the call. They had risen more than 10% before the market opened.GE bonds also rallied, extending a recovery in more than $100 billion of GE debt. Yields on dozens of longer-dated issues were at their lowest since Nov. 1. A $1 billion GE Capital bond with a 4% coupon due in July 2035 was up more than 1.5 cents at nearly 87 cents and a yield of 5.2%, compared with a low of 63 cents on the dollar last November to yield more than 8%.Investors have been keen for a turnaround since GE named Culp last October to restore earnings and improve a stock price that has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016. GE took a string of multibillion-dollar writedowns last year, so the slowing in cash outflows in the latest quarter raised hopes that its fortunes have started to improve. GE's industrial free cash flow showed a ""much smaller outflow than we expected,"" said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), and ""should drive a positive reaction in the stock.""But while the Boston-based conglomerate stuck to its full-year financial forecast, it noted ""new risk"" from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jet, for which GE engines with partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA of France. The plane model was grounded worldwide last month after a second fatal accident in less than five months. Profit margins also contracted at GE's aviation, power and renewable energy businesses, the three core units that GE plans to retain as it undergoes a break-up announced last year. A 1.6 percentage point drop in GE's industrial margins in the quarter is a ""stark reminder of the challenges that the company still faces,"" said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody's. He added that he expects margins to be flat or slightly improved by year-end.GE's cash balance was boosted mainly the $2.9 billion sale of locomotive business to Wabtec Corp.Culp has said the 2019 ""reset"" of GE would result in negative cash flow at its most-troubled business, power, through 2020 before turning positive in 2021. GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill at the unit last year.In the latest quarter, power orders fell 14% and profit fell 71% to $80 million on revenue of $5.7 billion, down about 22% from a year earlier, GE said.Some saw signs that the power unit's prospects will improve. ""This was a business that everyone gave up as dead ... but (it) is more than able to fend for itself,"" William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann told Reuters.Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders rose to $954 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $261 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, GE earned 14 cents per share. Analysts had expected 9 cents per share, on average. Total revenue fell 2% to $27.29 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $27.05 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Trump said on Twitter. ""The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"" Trump's public attack on the EU came even as his administration has yet to hammer out trade deals with China and neighbors Mexico and Canada.A day earlier, the U.S. Trade Representative proposed targeting a list of EU products for tariffs, ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine, as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The final list is expected this summer.In response, the European Commission said earlier Tuesday it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.""The Commission is starting preparations so that the EU can promptly take action based on the arbitrator's decision on retaliation rights in this case,"" a Commission spokesman said. ""The European Union remains open for discussions with the United States, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome.""Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings.Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions.The EU is already facing U.S. tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports and Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement.""When I see the situation global growth is in, I don't think we can afford to have a trade conflict, even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe,"" he said. 'MORE TIT-FOR-TAT'The U.S. tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods.Airbus shares closed down nearly 2 percent, while Boeing dropped 1.4 percent. Airbus suppliers such as  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA and Leonardo SpA also closed lower. Analysts were divided over whether the ramped-up dispute would lead to greater global trade issues. ""Get ready for more tit-for-tat scrapping to follow,"" said John Woolfitt of London brokerage Atlantic Markets.Germany is particularly apprehensive of possible U.S. tariffs on car imports. The United States is a major market for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW.Moody's said on Tuesday that potential U.S. tariffs on imported autos and parts represented a significant risk to global growth and would hinder economic momentum in Germany, Japan and Korea."" ... The U.S. wants to pressure the EU to engage in meaningful trade talks, but without having to apply the more painful measure of automotive tariffs,” said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit.Fabiana Fedeli at Robeco sees the latest moves as tactical.""The new tariffs ... are a drop in the ocean as a percentage of the overall trade between the U.S. and Europe and we view them as a negotiating tool to set the tone for what the really important negotiations are, namely autos,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Apr 09, 2019 03:20AM ET",Could This Be Third Time Lucky for European Bulls?: Taking Stock,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- What a difference four years make. The last time a broad gauge of European stocks set a record high was in April 2015. At the time, David Cameron was U.K. prime minister, Donald Trump hadn’t announced his candidacy, Angela Merkel was set to become Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year,” and the Swiss National Bank had just abandoned its euro ceiling.Fast-forward to now and the Stoxx Europe 600 is again making a run at that peak, as it did unsuccessfully in each of the past two years. This time could be different, even if we get another dip along the way. In support, the Fed has become increasingly dovish, the ECB is looking at new ways to help the economy, China is in stimulus mode and Brexit might soon find its epilogue. A vast majority of investors are underweight European equities ahead of the earnings season kicking off next week.Europe has lagged behind other markets in a catch-up rally of a region plagued by political instability, sluggish growth and a preference for U.S. equities -- boosted by technology and fiscal measures. The rise of the euro in 2017 was also a drag and since then, the single currency has dropped significantly. Despite being cautious on European shares, Amundi strategists believe euro-zone growth should gradually recover by the end of the year, driven by household consumption.“Valuations are less compelling, as many undervaluation gaps closed during this year’s rebound. On the other hand, the participation in the rally has been low, and this could further support the positive momentum,” the strategists write.Market sentiment is also hinting at an increasingly bullish mood, especially for stocks, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists say, adding that any dip in the market should be bought.It’s not an entirely rosy picture though of course. The 2019 rally has been propelled by cyclicals like miners, retail and technology -- sectors that could run out of steam after surging more than 20 percent this year. So European equities may face a few more hurdles before achieving new highs. Positive news on the political front and stronger earnings growth are needed to support further upside, Amundi strategists write, highlighting an ageing bull market.Sylvain Goyon, head of strategy at Oddo, says that with earnings growth for 2019 expected at 5 percent and a target cost of equity of 8.45 percent, he’s struggling to see upside for the market.“In a nutshell, I either need much more earnings-per-share growth or much lower cost of equity (below 8 percent) to create more upside,” Goyon says. “With GDP growth reverting to potential I doubt the first, while the second seems a bit aggressive.”The technicals are also starting to look stretched. We’re reaching important resistance levels of the 2018 highs, and the market has been going in and out of overbought territory. It’s another challenge to overcome if European equities don’t want to fall at the final hurdle.In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading down 0.1% ahead of the open.SECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY:COMMENT:COMPANY NEWS AND M&A:NOTES FROM THE SELL SIDE:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Stoxx 600 index:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Euro Stoxx 50 index:MAIN RESEARCH AND RATING CHANGES:UPGRADES:DOWNGRADES:INITIATIONS:MARKETS:MAIN MACRO DATA (all times CET):"

20,"Mar 14, 2019 02:46PM ET","General Electric CEO sets low 2019 profit targets, vows better from 2020",nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Sanjana Shivdas(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co Chief Executive Larry Culp on Thursday set conservative profit targets for this year and staked his reputation on hitting them and doing better in 2020 and beyond, igniting a rally in the stock.Culp's detailed pep talk, which drew praise from Wall Street analysts on a conference call, swiftly reversed an earlier rout in the stock as he stressed GE was serious about its targets after years of missing profit expectations.The forecast was low largely because GE will be spending $2.5 billion on restructuring this year, Culp said, adding the investment would pay off after a tough 2019.""This is what constitutes a 'reset,'"" Culp said, using a word many analysts had longed to hear. ""The market should interpret a high level of conviction (in the forecast) simply because this team, in a public forum, is laying this roadmap out, mindful of the realities of 2019 but I think also optimistic ... about the impact of what we're doing.""Culp did not soft-pedal the short-term pain. He said 2019 adjusted profit would be 50 cents to 60 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 70 cents, and GE could lose as much as $2 billion in cash from its industrial businesses, putting a number on a warning he issued last week.The company expects free cash flow at GE Power to remain negative in 2020 before turning positive in 2021. Investors are looking closely at GE's cash and earnings after the company lost nearly $23 billion last year.The outlook is ""arguably better than expected,"" said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The company did not make reference to any potential hit to its jet engine unit from the recent global grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX aircraft. GE and partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA make the engine that powers all 737 MAX planes.GE shares were up 2.9 percent at $10.31 in afternoon trading, after falling 4 percent in premarket activity shortly after the forecast was released. GE bonds also rose slightly.""While lowered guidance is not a positive, we think GE's plan and progress show it's moving in the right direction,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at CFRA.Culp also left considerable wiggle room in the forecast by including an unspecified amount of ""contingency"" money to cover hard-to-predict costs, such as when it will conclude big asset sales and how its power unit will perform.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa voiced concern that the gap between GE's cash flow and earnings forecasts was the widest he had seen, which likely will mean analysts' profit estimates are too high.Culp said that although GE was taking ""a safe conservative posture in this reset year ... Rest assured, operationally, we're running hard.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

21,"Mar 14, 2019 01:36AM ET",Boeing 737 MAX deliveries in limbo after deadly crash: sources,nan,"By Conor Humphries and Eric M. JohnsonDUBLIN/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets were effectively frozen on Wednesday, though production continued, after the United States joined a global grounding of the narrowbody model over safety concerns, industry sources said.The 737 MAX is banned from flying in most countries across the world following an Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday that killed all 157 people on board. It was the second deadly incident for the relatively new Boeing (NYSE:BA) model in five months.Airlines, aircraft industry experts and financiers said that although the ban would theoretically not prevent some domestic deliveries, most airlines would avoid taking a jet banned from entering service on the wake of two crashes in five months.""Who is going to take delivery of a plane they can't use,"" said an aviation financier, asking not to be named.Boeing produces 52 aircraft per month and its newest version, the MAX, represents the lion's share of production, although Boeing declined to break out exact numbers.Boeing is expected to continue with production of the 737 at its factory outside Seattle, and has been planning to speed up production again in June.Manufacturers avoid halting and then speeding up production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. But having to hold planes in storage consumes extra cash in increased inventory.Each month of the grounding could cost Boeing around $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion in delayed revenue, according to analyst estimates, although that could be recouped once the ban is lifted and the planes are delivered.Boeing in January provided guidance it would report $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion of revenue in 2019.Asked how the global grounding of the 737 MAX would impact deliveries, a Boeing spokesman said: ""We continue to assess.""Boeing's main U.S. customers -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines -- declined comment. So far they have voiced their confidence in the safety of the MAX.""Although this MAX crash is clearly 'bad news' for Boeing, we think the company will ultimately battle through,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a client note. COMPENSATIONBoeing has already been working through supplier delays on engines from CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, and fuselages from Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc that led to dozens of planes being parked outside its Renton, Washington factory last summer. This week, at least three freshly built 737s were parked at or near the factory with yellow weights hanging in the place of engines, signs of lingering issues, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.""We are still a few weeks behind the requirement, but have a line of sight to be back on track in the second quarter of this year,"" CFM spokeswoman Jamie Jewell said.Boeing's 787 Dreamliner was grounded for 123 days in 2013 after its lithium-ion battery packs caught fire. The jet went on to become a popular twin-aisle with a strong safety record.Aircraft contracts do not typically contain a clause that automatically allows airlines to claim compensation for a regulatory action like a grounding.However, planemakers do sometimes pay out compensation to cover the cost of financing when an airline is left without a promised airplane, said a senior industry source.Even then, they generally balk at paying for other indirect costs borne by the airline.UK-based aviation consultancy IBA estimated the financing cost of a 737 MAX at $360,000 a month or $12,000 a day.Norwegian Air said on Wednesday it would seek compensation from plane maker Boeing for costs and lost revenue due to the 737 MAX 8 grounding. Stallard said it was very difficult to estimate the amount of compensation Boeing would provide customers.He added it would be impractical for airlines to try to switch their orders to the rival Airbus SE A320 narrowbody because there were no delivery slots available for a few years.(Reporing by Conor Humphries in Dublin and Eric Johnson in Seattle; Additional reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore, Tracy Rucinski in Chicago, Tom Westbrook in Sydney, Cindy Silviana in Jakarta, Heekyong Yang in Seoul, Aditi Shah in New Delhi, James Pearson in Hanoi and Alwyn Scott in New York; Writing by Tracy Rucinski; editing by Tim Hepher and Michael Perry)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

22,"Mar 11, 2019 06:34PM ET","Boeing shares, vanguard of the Dow, hit hard after second 737 MAX crash",nan,"By Sanjana Shivdas(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares tumbled more than 5 percent on Monday after China, Indonesia and Ethiopia ordered airlines to ground the aircraft maker's best-selling line of jets after the second deadly crash of one of the planes in just five months.While the slide lopped off $12.7 billion in the market value of one of the 10-year bull market's powerhouse stocks, the one-day loss was far more limited by the closing bell than earlier in the session as some investors bet long-term risks were limited.Dropping in the early moments of trading by the most since Wall Street reopened after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, the stock recouped nearly two-thirds of its losses on the heaviest trading volume in nearly six years.""Despite the immense tragedy we think the company will fix what we believe is largely a software and training issue,"" said Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, which counts Boeing among its largest holdings.The volatility followed Sunday's crash of a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines just minutes after takeoff from the country's capital Addis Ababa, killing all 157 on board. The same model, flown by Lion Air, crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board.The single-aisle 737, the world's most-sold commercial aircraft, is central to Boeing's future. The MAX line is the fastest-selling jetliner in the company's history with more than 5,000 orders booked and a backlog valued at nearly $500 billion at list prices.The 5.3 percent drop in share price on Monday wiped nearly $13 billion off Boeing's market value - an abrupt reversal for a stock that had been the runaway top performer so far this year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With a stock price of about $400 a share, it was by far the largest drag on the price-weighted, blue-chip index on Monday, shaving more than 150 points off the Dow's advance.It was unclear whether the accident would pose a long-term risk to a stock that has delivered the richest total return among the 30 stocks in the Dow over the 10 years of the current bull market. Since U.S. stocks began rebounding from the 2007-09 financial crisis in March 2009, Boeing shares have delivered a total return - including reinvested dividends - of nearly 1,600 percent, or four times the performance of the full index.Boeing's shares shed 12 percent in the weeks following the Lion Air crash last year, but have since more than recouped those declines. (GRAPHIC: Boeing shares hit after Ethiopia jet crash - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ca96E7) Spreads on Boeing's bonds, a measure of the added compensation investors demand for owning its debt, were also broadly wider, data from Refinitiv showed. Its credit default swaps, a form of insurance against a Boeing default, rose sharply in price, according to IHS Markit. The company has about $13.8 billion of bonds issued. Boeing said on Monday the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in its early stages and there was no need to issue new guidance to operators of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft based on the information it has so far. In an email seen by Reuters, Boeing's chief executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the U.S. manufacturer's 737 MAX aircraft in the wake of two deadly crashes since October.Wall Street has been overwhelmingly bullish on Boeing - 19 of the 24 brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or higher, while five have a ""hold"" rating. No brokerage has had a sell rating on the stock since July 2017.Even with Monday's drop, it remained the Dow's best performer so far this year with a gain of 24 percent compared with 10 percent for the full index. BUYING OPPORTUNITY Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said there would be concerns about safety, production, groundings and costs, but that those should all be manageable longer term.He said the bank's positive ""overweight"" recommendation on Boeing shares was not changing, and that any corrective action the jetmaker has to take on its best-selling passenger plane will likely prove a longer-term buying opportunity.Investigators have found the black box from the fatal crash with both the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data, Ethiopian state TV reported on Monday, which should shed light on the cause of the crash.Earlier in the day, China's aviation regulator grounded nearly 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines after the crash.Shares of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co - the biggest operator of the MAX 8 - fell 0.3 percent, while American Airlines Group Inc, which has 24 MAX 8 jets, gained 0.4 percent.Southwest and American said overnight they remained fully confident in the aircraft and were closely monitoring the investigation.The 737 MAX 8 uses LEAP-1B engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA. Safran shares fell 1.7 percent on Monday, but GE rose 3.3 percent.Boeing delivered 806 aircraft last year, missing its target by four jets, but still retaining the title of the world's biggest planemaker for the seventh straight year. European rival Airbus SE delivered 800 planes in 2018.Shares of Boeing's European rival Airbus rose 1.3 percent in Paris.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Mar 11, 2019 04:54AM ET",StockBeat: Deutsche-Commerzbank Merger Talk Gets Serious,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- European stock markets have started the week brightly, taking their lead from a surprisingly strong Asian market performance and an interview at the weekend with U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that underlined the central bank’s reluctance to tighten monetary policy in the near term.At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.6 points, or 0.2% at 371.18. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.6% while Germany's Dax was up 0.2%.With no one story dominating the news, banks are leading the way higher after a torrid last week.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was up 2.8% and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) up 4.8% after reports at the weekend said Deutsche’s executive board has given CEO Christian Sewing a mandate to pursue a merger with its smaller rival. To make the math work, Sewing is insisting on much sharper cost cuts than current agreements with the two banks’ labor unions would permit, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt.Analysts are still skeptical that the combination of two banks with chronically low profits will actually make a stronger one.“Is this the type of stuff that people in 15 years’ time will say ‘it sounded good at the time’?” Stefan Gerlach, chief economist with EFG Bank in Zurich, said via Twitter.The market earlier shrugged off a surprise drop in German industrial production in January, which were offset by more upbeat trade data – a rare instance of German ‘hard’ data beating expectations in recent weeks.Elsewhere, Boeing (DE:BA) depositary receipts in Frankfurt fell over 7% on the news that China had grounded its 737 MAX airliners after a second fatal crash involving the 737 MAX at the weekend. France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF), which supplies engines for the airliner, fell 1.6%.Meanwhile, oil and gas stocks were broadly higher after reports saying Saudi Arabia would continue through April to pump less oil than it is allowed to under an OPEC-led supply restraint deal.

26,"Mar 10, 2019 11:04PM ET","Ethiopian Airlines flight crashes, killing 157",nan,"By Duncan Miriri, Maggie Fick and Aaron MaashoNAIROBI/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board and raising questions about the safety of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8, a new model that also crashed in Indonesia in October.Sunday's flight left Bole airport in Addis Ababa at 8:38 a.m. (0538 GMT), before losing contact with the control tower just a few minutes later at 8:44 a.m.""There are no survivors,"" the airline tweeted alongside a picture of Chief Executive Tewolde GebreMariam holding up a piece of debris inside a large crater at the crash site. ""The pilot mentioned that he had difficulties and that he wanted to return,"" Tewolde told a news conference.Passengers from 33 countries were aboard, said Tewolde.The dead included Kenyan, Ethiopian, American, Canadian, French, Chinese, Egyptian, Swedish, British, Dutch, Indian, Slovakian, Austrian, Swedish, Russian, Moroccan, Spanish, Polish, and Israeli citizens.At least four worked for the United Nations, the airline said, and the U.N.'s World Food Program director confirmed his organization had lost staff in the accident. Weeping relatives begged for information at airports in Nairobi and Addis Ababa.""We're just waiting for my mum. We're just hoping she took a different flight or was delayed. She's not picking up her phone,"" said Wendy Otieno, clutching her phone and weeping.The aircraft, a 737 MAX 8, is the same model that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct 29, killing all 189 people on board the Lion Air flight. The cause of that crash is still under investigation. A senior U.S. government official said it was too early to tell if there was any direct connection between the two accidents, but that reviewing the issue would be among the top priorities for investigators. The 737 is the world’s best selling modern passenger aircraft and is seen as one of the industry’s most reliable. A preliminary report into the October crash focused on airline maintenance and training and technical questions about the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor.Boeing is working on a software patch on the system, while insisting cockpit procedures were already in place to deal safely with problems the Lion Air crew experienced. Ethiopian's new aircraft had no recorded technical problems and the pilot had an ""excellent"" flying record, Tewolde said.“We received the airplane on November 15, 2018. It has flown more than 1,200 hours. It had flown from Johannesburg earlier this morning,"" he said. ""UNSTABLE SPEED""Flight ET 302, registration number ET-AVJ, crashed near the town of Bishoftu, 62 km (38 miles) southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, with 149 passengers and eight crew aboard, the airline said. The flight had unstable vertical speed after take off, the flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted.Data released by the Sweden-based service suggested the aircraft had climbed almost 1,000 feet after taking off from Addis Ababa, a hot and high-altitude airport whose thinner air requires extra effort from an aircraft's engines.It dipped about 450 feet before rapidly climbing another 900 feet until the point where satellite tracking data was lost.The aircraft had shattered into many pieces and was severely burnt, a Reuters reporter at the scene of the crash said. Clothing and personal effects were scattered widely over the field where the plane came down.There was no immediate indication of what caused the crash and safety experts said it was too early to speculate, adding most accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors. They said investigators would examine the wreckage and bodies for any signs of burns or unusual forces and study the shape and size of the wreckage field. An urgent priority will be to find the two crash-protected cockpit recorders - one for data and the other for pilots' voice recordings. Boeing said it was sending a technical team to help with the Ethiopian-led investigation.ANGUISHED RELATIVESAt Nairobi airport, many relatives were left waiting at the gate for hours, with no information from airport authorities. Some learned of the crash from journalists. Robert Mutanda, 46, was waiting for his brother-in-law, a Canadian citizen. ""No, we haven't seen anyone from the airline or the airport,"" he told Reuters at 1pm, more than three hours after the flight was lost. ""Nobody has told us anything, we are just standing here hoping for the best."" Kenyan officials did not arrive at the airport until 1:30 p.m.James Macharia, the cabinet secretary for transport, said he heard about the crash via Twitter.Nineteen staff from at least five U.N. and affiliated organizations died, including the World Food Program, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, the International Telecommunications Union, the U.N. Environment Program, the World Bank and the International Organisation on Migration, the IOM said.ETHIOPIAN AIRLINESUnder international rules, responsibility for leading the crash investigation lies with Ethiopia but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also participate because the plane was designed and built in the United States.Representatives of Boeing and Cincinnati-based engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and General Electric Co and France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, were expected to advise the NTSB. Ethiopian is one of the biggest carriers on the continent by fleet size. The plane was among six of 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets the rapidly expanding carrier has ordered. The fleet will continue flying since the cause of the crash is not clear, the CEO said.Its last major crash was in January 2010, when a flight from Beirut went down shortly after take-off, killing all 90 people onboard. The Lebanese blamed pilot error, which was disputed by the airline.North American airlines that operate the 737 MAX 8 said they were monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) flies 31 MAX 8 jets while American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet. Southwest said it remained confident in the safety of its more than 750 Boeing jets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Mar 10, 2019 10:10PM ET",Boeing's 737 MAX back in spotlight after second fatal crash,nan,"By Tracy Rucinski and David ShepardsonCHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest version of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's best-selling 737 family - a global industry workhorse - has again been thrust into the spotlight after a fatal crash in Ethiopia, months after a deadly crash involving an identical brand-new jet in Indonesia.A Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Adaba, killing all 157 on board. The same model flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board.There are still unanswered questions about the causes of the Lion Air crash, and officials and safety experts said it was too soon to draw links with the Ethiopian incident.Boeing did not respond to questions about the 737 MAX 8 on Sunday but said in a statement it would send a technical team to the crash site to provide assistance.Boeing's shares lost 12 percent in the weeks following the Lion Air crash, but have more than recouped those declines, closing on Friday at $422.54, 18 percent higher than before the Oct. 29 incident in Indonesia.Boeing's 737 MAX is the newest version of a jet that has been a fixture of passenger travel for decades and the cash cow of the world's largest aircraft maker, competing against Airbus SE's A320neo family of single-aisle jetliners.The decades-old 737 family is considered one of the industry's most reliable aircraft.Boeing rolled out the fuel-efficient MAX 8 in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737, and had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft by the end of January.Former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said the catastrophic crashes of two new airplanes soon after the 737 MAX 8 was introduced were ""highly unusual"" and both had broad similarities in that they went down soon after takeoff.While it is unclear if there is a direct link, “this is now an extraordinary issue” for aviation safety officials to grapple with and will prompt a sweeping investigation to determine if there are common issues, Rosenker said.Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co is the biggest operator of the MAX 8, with 31 aircraft, followed by American Airlines Group Inc and Air Canada with 24 each.Southwest and American said on Sunday they remained fully confident in the aircraft and were closely monitoring the investigation. Aviation analyst Scott Hamilton cautioned against drawing comparisons between the two crashes, especially before the black box recorders are recovered. Ethiopian has a strong reputation and good safety record, he said in a blog post.Still, the crash puts fresh pressure on Boeing just days before it had planned an event to debut another aircraft. Late Sunday, Boeing said it would postpone the planned ceremonial debut of its 777x widebody aircraft that had been set for Wednesday in Seattle and was to be livestreamed. The company said it is focused on ""supporting"" Ethiopian Airlines and ""will look for an opportunity to mark the new plane with the world in the near future.""INVESTIGATION AND LITIGATIONFollowing the Lion Air crash, Boeing faced criticism from some U.S. pilot unions for not having detailed in its flight manual a change in the way that software on the MAX reacts in a stall compared with a previous version.Boeing has insisted that cockpit procedures were already in place to deal with problems that the Lion Air jet experienced.A preliminary report into the Lion Air crash focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the technical response of the anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a reason for the crash. Since then, the cockpit voice recorder was recovered and a final report is due later this year.Boeing was expected to introduce a software patch to help address the scenario faced by the Lion Air crew in late March or April, government and industry officials told Reuters in recent weeks.Boeing is already facing a string of lawsuits in the United States by families of the Lion Air crash victims, including five cases in U.S. federal court in Illinois where Boeing has its Chicago headquarters.The 737 MAX 8 uses LEAP-1B engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It can start seeking offers in 2019, subject to launch.""Boeing is signaling full speed ahead but there's still a lot to be decided in these programs,"" Plueger said at a conference, noting the company had met with Boeing in Seattle on Friday. In an emailed statement, Boeing said it is still working through the business case for the new jet, adding: ""If we decide to offer the airplane and the market responds positively, we will proceed with a launch decision sometime in 2020.""Air Lease, one of the largest aircraft lessors, said it sees interest in Boeing's proposed mid-market aircraft from airlines, some of which are looking for longer range while others, such as Asian carriers, seek the lowest possible cost per seat kilometer.Still, Boeing is taking a ""thoughtful approach"" to the potential project following a series of cost overruns and delays with its last jet program, the 787, and has yet to discuss possible pricing, Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said.Air Lease will meet on Saturday with Airbus SE, which is preparing to counter the potential new jet by Boeing with a new version of its A321 and the larger A330neo.While Boeing and Airbus have traditionally launched new jets alongside purchase commitments from airlines, interest by aircraft lessors like Air Lease is forming an increasingly important role in the decision-making process, industry sources have said.Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Monday that it is interested in a mid-market aircraft from Boeing to replace 200 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade.Last month, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) dropped out of the race to power Boeing's planned jet, strengthening a leading position in the high-profile contest for a transatlantic venture involving  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).""Somebody had to drop out and the competition at this point is progressing normally,"" Plueger said.Pratt & Whitney is also a potential supplier for the new Boeing jet.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I think that you better clean your own house before you start to complain about someone else's.""SpaceX told the U.S. Trade Representative in a letter dated Dec. 10 and first reported last week that European subsidies to Arianespace, Europe's primary space launch provider, created an ""imbalanced competitive advantage that threatens fair trade"".ArianeGroup, a joint venture of Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF) and majority owner of Arianespace, is developing Ariane 6 rocket at a cost of nearly 4 billion euros ($4.55 billion).SpaceX urged the U.S. government to seek remedies in upcoming U.S.-European Union Free Trade Agreement talks - an appeal that U.S. officials say they are taking very seriously given the growing importance of the commercial space market.The SpaceX letter, first reported by France's Les Echos newspaper last week, flagged another potential conflict between Washington and Brussels, already at odds in the trade arena over car and steel exports.The European Union had no immediate comment but the German Economy Ministry said the EU viewed aid to ESA as fully allowed under World Trade Organisation rules. Neuenschwander said European officials were focused on completing the Ariane 6 rocket, due to have its maiden flight in 2020 at 40 percent less cost than the current Ariane 5.""Buy America"" laws prevent Arianespace from competing for U.S. government launches, cutting off a huge market at a time when commercial launches are down sharply. European officials also see hidden aid in the fact that SpaceX gets twice as much for U.S. government launches than it seeks in European tenders.European officials are pushing Berlin to favor Ariane 6 in a competition with SpaceX to launch a German spy satellite called GEORG, said conservative German lawmaker Alexander Throm.Thomas Jarzombek, the German government's aerospace and space policy coordinator, told Throm in a letter in January ""it really would not make sense to use public funds to develop a new rocket and then not use it for public purposes.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

31,"Feb 21, 2019 12:16PM ET",Ariane 6 rocket sees first commercial deals in race with SpaceX,nan,"By Andrea ShalalBREMEN, Germany (Reuters) - Ariane 6, Europe's next-generation space rocket, is expected to win its first two commercial launch orders in coming weeks, company officials said, a key milestone as the European launcher vies for orders against Elon Musk's U.S. competitor SpaceX.Operator Arianespace faces increased competition from SpaceX and Blue Origin, owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos. Japan and India also pose a growing challenge.Ariane 6 has three institutional orders in hand from the European Commission and France and is close to signing deals with two commercial customers, said Mathias Spude, spokesman for ArianeGroup, a joint venture of Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF), that is the majority stakeholder in Arianespace.ArianeGroup has invested 400 million euros of its own funds in the 3.4-billion-euro development of Ariane 6 - a project key to ensuring Europe's independent access to space and a market valued at over $1 trillion by 2040.Manufacturers say the rocket will be more versatile than Ariane 5, able to carry out missions from placing as many as 90 small satellites in low-earth orbit to taking classic spy satellites to far higher perches in geostationary orbit.But the business case depends on drumming up enough commercial business to augment the 5-6 institutional launches expected in Europe annually in coming years, about a quarter of those planned in the United States.European governments also face industry pressure to use Ariane 6 even if they could get cheaper rides using SpaceX.""Europe continues to need its own access to space - the market of the future,"" said Matthias Wachter with the BDI German Federation of Industry. ""It doesn't make sense to use European tax money to develop our own rocket but then launch satellites with competitors from the United States or Asia.""Ariane 6, due for a first launch in 2020, was designed to save significant costs compared to Ariane 5, but industry experts say it will still cost around 70 million euros per launch - well above the rate offered by SpaceX, which uses reusable rocket technology and can count on larger U.S. orders.Ariane 6's designers insist innovative production techniques will favor the European launcher when the commercial market recovers from a recent slump.""When it wakes up ... we will be on the market with a rocket that is 40 percent cheaper, and will continue to reduce costs after that,"" Spude told Reuters at the Ariane 6 production site.Still, experts say SpaceX is widely credited with jolting the overall market with a keen focus on cutting costs, forcing Europe to shake up its launch industry.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

33,"Feb 05, 2019 05:45PM ET",France and Germany to launch first contracts on future combat jets,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany will on Wednesday announce a 65 million euros ($74 million) contract financed equally by both countries over two years as the first act of the joint program to design a next-generation combat jet, a French army source said.Dassault Aviation and Airbus, which will build the jet that is expected to replace Dassault's Rafale and Germany's Eurofighters by 2024, will start work on the concept and architectures of the program, the source said.The companies are expected to launch demonstrators of aircraft and engine by mid-2019. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel first announced plans in July 2017 for the new Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which will include a fighter jet and a range of associated weapons, including drones.After nearly two years of preparatory work by the companies involved, Wednesday's agreements and contract signing will pave the way for the program to begin in earnest.Airbus and Dassault have been waiting for initial contracts to be signed to start work on the new project.France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Germany's MTU Aero Engines are expected to join forces to develop the engine for the new warplane, while French electronics firm Thales and European missile maker MBDA would also participate.French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly and German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen will preside over the signing ceremony at a Safran site in northeastern Paris on Wednesday.Germany removed a key obstacle to progress on the project last week when it bowed to French demands and excluded Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter from a multibillion-euro tender to replace ageing Tornado fighter jets that are fitted to carry U.S. nuclear weapons.Paris, Germany's closest European partner, had warned that buying the F-35 in particular would derail plans to develop the new Franco-German fighter by 2040 since it would constitute a potential competitor to that project.France and Germany will add Spain as a full partner in the program this summer, sources told Reuters in December.Britain, which is due to exit the European Union in March, unveiled its own rival aircraft development program, dubbed Tempest, at the Farnborough Air Show in July.European military and industry executives say they believe the two programmes could and should eventually be merged given the need to compete internationally and the many billions of euros needed to develop a new combat aircraft.The French army source said France and Germany were open to more European partners joining the program.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Jan 30, 2019 02:43PM ET","Boeing shares soar on profit, aircraft forecast",nan,"By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co raised its profit and cash flow expectations for 2019 on Wednesday, sending shares up more than six percent amid a boom in air travel and faster production, though it was still fighting supplier delays on its cash-cow 737 jetliners.The world's largest planemaker said it expects to deliver between 895 and 905 commercial aircraft in 2019, up from 806 aircraft it delivered last year, which - although just below company targets - kept it ahead of arch-rival Airbus SE for a seventh year.Investors closely watch the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms in a year for hints on the company's cash flow and revenue. Despite its rosy outlook, America's biggest exporter faces possible turbulence on a number of fronts in 2019, including financial stress felt by some of its airline customers, signs of a broader economic slowdown and U.S. trade tensions with China, where Boeing ships about 1 out of 4 aircraft that it makes. There are also unanswered questions related to the deadly crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia in October that thrust a spotlight on the newest version of the best-selling jet, as well as on airline training and maintenance.Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts during a conference call that he saw progress in fresh U.S.-China trade talks and separately said aircraft orders would be ""moderated"" but healthy in 2019, although deliveries dropped in January.Muilenburg said Boeing would make a final launch decision in 2020 on a proposed new mid sized jetliner, aimed at a niche market falling between narrow- and wide-body aircraft, depending on the results of a round of commercial pre-marketing which it may begin this year. He had previously spoken of a launch decision in 2019.The decision on whether to launch the new jet, known as NMA, is expected to reshape competition with Airbus, which dominates the top end of the medium-haul sector.Muilenburg said Boeing started running 787 Dreamliner assembly lines at a rate ready to support higher output of 14 jets a month, confirming an earlier Reuters report, bringing it within reach of a closely-watched goal designed to boost cash and reduce costs. The 787 transition to 14 per month will be completed by the second quarter, Muilenburg said.Chicago-based Boeing said its quarterly operating margin on commercial aircraft increased to 15.6 percent from 11.6 percent from a year ago, driven by higher 737 production and higher margins on its Dreamliner.Boeing's upbeat forecasts and full-year 2018 results - which included surpassing the $100 billion revenue mark for the first time in its 102-year history - boosted shares nearly 7 percent to $388.64, helping boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average.737 ENGINE DELAYS Despite faster production, Boeing said it was still muscling through delays on engines supplied by CFM International - the trans-Atlantic venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), which contributed to a major bottleneck at the Seattle-area 737 factory last year. Related production problems dragged down quarterly free cash flow to $2.45 billion, below the previous year, Boeing said.""We are deploying additional resources with them into their factories and supply chain,"" Muilenburg said regarding CFM. ""We do expect to recover, we're seeing signs of recovery, but we still have work to go.""A chunk of the earnings call turned to newer aircraft, with Muilenburg telling analysts the first all-new 777X widebody test airplane completed final body join and power-on ahead of flight tests later this year. The program remains on track for first delivery in 2020, he said. Boeing also raised its full-year core earnings per share forecast to $19.90-$20.10 from $14.90-$15.10, and revenue to a range of $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion, from $98 billion to $100 billion, fueled by strong volume across its commercial, military and services businesses.The company forecast operating cash flow between $17 billion and $17.5 billion in 2019, compared with cash flow of $15.32 billion in 2018, and above analysts' average estimate of $16.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.It expects 2019 core earnings between $19.90 per share and $20.10 per share, and revenue between $109.5 billion and $111.5 billion. Boeing's core earnings rose to $5.48 per share in the fourth quarter, from $5.07 per share a year earlier, and came in above Wall Street's estimate of $4.57 per share.Quarterly revenue rose 14.4 percent to $28.34 billion, above analysts' average expectation of $26.87 billion. Boeing's 2018 revenue surpassed the $100 billion mark for the first time in its 102-year history.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

58,"Jan 23, 2019 07:21AM ET",Europe's Arianespace takes on SpaceX by cutting Ariane 5 rocket launch price,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Europe's Arianespace is discounting the price of satellite launches with its Ariane 5 rockets as it competes against U.S. rival SpaceX for customers before the release of the cheaper Ariane 6 rocket next year, a senior executive said on Wednesday.Arianespace is aiming for the cost of launching the Ariane 6 to fall by around 40 percent versus the Ariane 5 through design changes and higher volume production, bringing its prices more in line with Elon Musk's SpaceX, Arianespace Managing Director and Head of Sales for Asia-Pacific Vivian Quenet said.He said in current marketing campaigns, the company is offering customers such as telecoms an Ariane 5 launch for the same price as the Ariane 6.""We have made a lot of effort on the sales price. When we do that, the result is very positive,"" Quenet told reporters on Wednesday, declining to discuss details of profitability.Arianespace is competing for two major launch contracts in the Asia-Pacific region that should be awarded this year and expects there could be tenders for another three, he said.Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), completed 11 launches with its Ariane 5, Vega and Soyuz rockets in 2018, in line with guidance that had been lowered mid-year from an initial 14.The company, which has a mission of guaranteeing Europe independent access to space and is used by government and commercial clients, this month forecast up to 12 launches in 2019, with four of them targeted in the first quarter.The Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates the satellite launch services market is worth $5.5 billion a year. SpaceX has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.Another U.S. group, the United Launch Alliance joint venture between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), said last week it would conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months as it also looks to lower costs to better compete against SpaceX.Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said this month it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan.SpaceX, which media reports say is valued at $30.5 billion, said this month it would fire about 10 percent of its more than 6,000 employees, seeking to create a leaner company to deal with the ""extraordinarily difficult"" challenges of developing interplanetary spacecraft and a global space-based internet.Arianespace's majority shareholder, ArianeGroup, announced on Tuesday it had signed a contract with the European Space Agency to study a mission to the moon before 2025 with the aim of mining regolith, an ore from which it is possible to extract water and oxygen.Quenet said if the mission proceeded, it would be launched with the Ariane 6 at its facilities in French Guiana.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

To mitigate supply chain snarls, Boeing helped expand production capacity at suppliers who have hired workers, including retirees this year.In October, its biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc said it was back on track to meet the surging demand for its aircraft parts.CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, also affirmed in the same month its commitment to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 units despite being roughly four weeks behind schedule.ORDER BOOMBoeing also looked set to beat Airbus for aircraft orders on a like-for-like basis in 2018 after booking 893 net orders, excluding cancellations in the year.Meanwhile, Airbus ended November with 380 net orders, to which it has since added confirmed deals for another 220 aircraft. According to industry sources, it won another 150 from Asian-backed leasing companies that are yet to be announced, with Boeing also getting a lift from Chinese demand.The Airbus tally, however, included 120 of the former Bombardier CSeries, a Canadian plane program which it bought last year.Orders for Boeing and Airbus are seen down compared to 2017 as airlines fret over trade tensions and the slowing global economic growth.

Safran, which co-produces engines for narrowbody jets with  General Electric  (N:GE), said it was gearing up for a new cycle of research and development (R&D) partly driven by a new mid-market jet being studied by Boeing (N:BA), depending on whether it goes ahead.It also pledged ""targeted"" R&D efforts at Zodiac and a 30 percent increase in broader research and technology spending as it laid out plans for better propulsion aircraft with more electrics and connected cabins, and wider use of 3D printing.It predicted like-for-like revenue percentage growth in mid-single digits over 2019-2022 and a recurring operating margin ""trending to a 16-18 percent range"" by 2022 after the engine model switch and the recovery of Zodiac's interiors business.Safran made a 14.6 percent margin in the first half.The company plans to invest in more maintenance and repair activities as it relies more heavily on power-by-the-hour contracts for its new 'LEAP' engine, underpinning a forecast of high single-digit growth in civil aftermarket sales in 2018-22.Safran said it was accelerating the operational recovery of Zodiac Aerospace from the repeated production problems that forced it into Safran's arms earlier this year. It confirmed a goal of 200 million euros ($228 million) of annual pre-tax cost savings from the merger by 2022 and said ""further upside has been identified"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They said ""significant progress"" had been made on a program to develop a new fighter to replace the Eurofighter and Dassault's Rafale beginning in 2040.The statement said the French and German defense ministers agreed on Monday that Airbus and Dassault would co-lead a study on ""a common concept and architectures (including connectivity)"" for the new Future Combat Air System (FCAS), to include a jet fighter and a range of associated weapons, including drones.Industry sources said the study would last two years, while the statement noted that additional studies and contracts for work on aircraft and engine demonstrators would be announced at the Paris Air Show in June 2019.Airbus Defence and Space CEO Dirk Hoke, who had warned France that demanding too big of a share of the program could prevent approval by the German parliament, welcomed that the agreed study would have ""clearly defined responsibilities"". No comment was immediately available from Dassault.French electronics maker Thales is also expected to take a role in the program, along with European missile maker MBDA, German engine makers MTU Aero Engines and French enginemaker  Safran  (PA:SAF), industry experts say.Peter Harster, director of the Next Fighter Project at MTU, welcomed the commitment to build demonstrators for both the new aircraft and its engine, saying it would be crucial to test new technologies such as 3D printing and emerging materials.Key technology challenges for the firms will be the design of an engine fulfilling the needs of a stealthy aircraft with high connectivity and excellent performance.While France will lead the warplane project, Germany will head up development of a new battle tank, with a conceptual study to be agreed by the end of 2018. Germany's Rheinmetall AG and Franco-German tank maker KNDS would be asked to propose further studies beginning in mid-2019.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"Nov 14, 2018 10:33AM ET",U.S. safety board holds hearing on fatal Southwest engine explosion,nan,"By Diane Bartz and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigative hearing on Wednesday into the fatal engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) Boeing 737 that killed one passenger.Dallas-based Southwest has been under scrutiny since an engine on a flight headed from New York to Dallas blew apart in mid-air over Pennsylvania, shattering a plane window, flinging shrapnel and killing passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard. The episode, which has raised concerns about the safety of similar engines, was the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009. The hearing in Washington turned to a detailed summary of the engine failure on flight 1380, including details of the fan blade design and development history of the engine type that failed, a CFM56-7B made by CFM International, a transatlantic joint-venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF).The hearing also focused on engine fan blade inspection methods.A CFM representative told the NTSB panel that coating condition, lubrication and the length of operating time contributed to the fan blade separation.The NTSB also released factual findings that disclosed the flight crew had difficulty reaching flight attendants after the engine failed and did not immediately learn that a passenger had been injured. The engine on the plane's left side spewed shrapnel when it blew apart, shattering a window and causing rapid cabin depressurization that nearly pulled a female passenger through the hole, the NTSB said.The NTSB report said two passengers were eventually able to pull the woman, who was still in her seat belt, back inside the plane. Representatives from Chicago-based planemaker Boeing (N:BA), and Southwest Airlines were also at the hearing.""We all have the same goals,"" Southwest said in a statement, ""to share facts, learn what happened, and ensure this type of event never happens again.""Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said safety was the planemaker's top priority and it will continue to support the NTSB and provide technical assistance.A CFM spokeswoman declined comment while the hearing was in process. The hearing comes as Indonesian authorities investigate last month's deadly Lion Air crash involving a newer version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, the 737 MAX.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

72,"Nov 08, 2018 05:31AM ET",China seat supplier looks for way into stretched market,nan,"By Stella Qiu and Brenda GohZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China is squeezing itself into a gap in the market for aircraft seats - a low-key effort compared with plans for a Sino-Russian jetliner or the military might paraded at this week's Airshow China, but one that may earn it a key role in global supply chains.Bottlenecks in the supply of seats have disrupted jetliner production and created a major headache for Western planemakers in recent years, as manufacturers struggled to keep up with booming air traffic and growing demand for customized cabin features.Consolidation has already reshaped the market; first B/E Aerospace became part of U.S. business Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), then France's Zodiac Aerospace lost a bid to stay independent and got taken over by  Safran  (PA:SAF).Now China is trying to secure its place in the new landscape. ""It's a big opportunity,"" Wu Si, a sales manager at Jiatai Aircraft Equipment Co Ltd, a subsidiary of state aerospace giant AVIC, told Reuters.China's expansion into seats reflects an ambition to build its position as a broad supplier to foreign planemakers while deepening the skills and post-sales experience needed to develop its own aircraft industry, analysts said.The breakthrough is not immediately obvious at China's largest air show, where AVIC's seats are tucked in a corner beyond promotional displays for fighters.Jiatai has been in the seats business since 1995, mainly supplying China-made aircraft like the Xian MA60 turboprop. It also equips the recently introduced ARJ21 regional jet. But it is speeding up its exposure to foreign markets, encouraged by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), who are still smarting from delays caused by a production crisis at Zodiac and are working to smooth seat supply.PRESSURE ON ESTABLISHED SUPPLIERSLast week, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that Airbus had delivered an A320 equipped with Jiatai seats for the first time.And Boeing said at the show it had recently added Jiatai's products to the catalog of available seats for its best-selling 737 jet. The company has fitted out at least 25 Boeing jets since 2016.The move ""continues the indirect pressure on traditional seats suppliers"" including Recaro, Zodiac and B/E Aerospace, Agency Partners said in a note.Recent profit margins are a poor guide because of production problems, but in 2016, the last year before it was delisted, B/E Aerospace had an operating margin of 16.6 percent. In the same period, Airbus made 5.9 percent and Boeing 7.7 percent.Analysts say margins are especially high on premium seats, but for now the Chinese business focuses mainly on economy seating.Jiatai says it has capacity for 20,000 seats a year - enough for about 130 medium-haul jets - but is only making 13,000-14,000. It is adding a second production line.The risk is that hurdles in certifying each new seat variant and maintaining output will prove even more challenging than it did for longtime specialist Zodiac, analysts said. ""The problem is with orders. Airlines are so used to the status quo, preferring to upgrade with their existing seat choices. It takes time for the market to accept our brand,"" said Cai Li, a sales manager at Jiatai.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"Nov 07, 2018 06:00PM ET",Boeing to report lower 737 deliveries amid supplier delays: executive,nan,"By Eric M. JohnsonSEATTLE (Reuters) - Days before the numbers are due to be announced,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) warned that October aircraft deliveries to airlines would be lower than normal as the world's largest planemaker continues to be dogged by supplier delays on engines and other components. Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference in Chicago that deliveries would rebound in November and December despite persistent problems with engine-maker CFM International Inc, a venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).Boeing is expected to release its orders and deliveries figures for October next week. Deliveries are a closely watched metric since that is the point when airlines pay the bulk of the money for a new jetliner.""The deliveries for the balance of the year will be backloaded,"" Smith said. ""You'll see a lighter October than you would typically, and you'll see higher-than-production-rate delivery profile for November and December.""Boeing is working through its recovery plan for its best-selling 737 single-aisle jetliner caused by delays on fuselages, engines and other components which created a production bottleneck at its Seattle-area plant over the summer.Smith said the focus now is ""on GE and GE supply chain, getting them back on the recovery plan.""""We're still not fully recovered and don't expect to until the end of the year,"" he added. His comments come after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive on Wednesday to address how to handle erroneous data from a sensor on the Boeing 737 MAX jet in the wake of last week's Indonesian jetliner crash.Boeing said in a statement that it had alerted pilots to the issue. The FAA said it was mandating that airlines follow the Boeing bulletin.Boeing has delivered 568 aircraft in the first nine months of 2018, as it works to overcome the 737 factory snarls, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago, putting it on track to deliver another record year of plane sales.That keeps the manufacturer, which aims to deliver 810-815 planes in 2018, in front of its European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

74,"Nov 04, 2018 07:01AM ET","Trade war, spy claims cloud horizon for China airshow",nan,"By Brenda Goh and Stella QiuSHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Trade frictions with the United States and accusations of industrial espionage are set to cast a cloud over China's largest aerospace meeting this week, as suppliers consider what the country's slowing economy could mean for booming jet demand.The biennial Airshow China, to be held in the coastal city of Zhuhai during Nov 6-11, is traditionally an event for Beijing to parade its growing aviation prowess in front of aerospace executives, diplomats and arms buyers from over 40 countries. But analysts say they are not expecting many headline announcements or big deals this year as a bruising trade war between Beijing and Washington and a slowing Chinese economy cause companies to be cautious.While the tarmac will be filled with planes from the likes of Airbus SA (PA:AIR) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3), the main symbol of China's own commercial aviation ambitions, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China's (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] C919 narrowbody jet, will not be there. A senior executive said it was undergoing test flights. Boeing Co  (N:BA), which is opening a 737 completion plant in China, will not display any of its planes but only models at its exhibition stand.""We're not expecting a big turnout this year,"" said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin. ""As you know the Chinese economy is not doing great this year, so companies that would normally send 10 people will only send five instead."" China has become a key hunting ground for foreign firms to do deals as its airlines have expanded fleets to keep up with surging travel demand, putting the country in a position to overtake the United States as the world's top aviation market in the next decade. But China's economic growth has weakened to its slowest pace since the financial crisis and its relations with other countries have been tested by Beijing's ambitions to grow its own domestic champions in industries such as aviation. And while U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs, analysts said they were still waiting to see what the trade war would spell for U.S. companies such as Boeing, Honeywell (N:HON) and Gulfstream, who face fierce competition in China from the likes of Airbus and other suppliers. The United States exported $16.3 billion of civilian aircraft to China in 2017, the biggest category of goods it exported to China, according to a paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.""It is not unlikely that China might strategically steer future aircraft purchases to Airbus rather than Boeing,"" said Marc Szepan, a China aviation expert at the University of Oxford and former industry executive.""""In addition, there might be a re-evaluation of the relative attractiveness of industrial partners for China's future aircraft programs such as the CR929 which might favor European over U.S. component and structures suppliers.""SHOW OF STRENGTHSo far, Beijing has avoided showing its hand in either direction as deals by Chinese leasing firms to buy foreign aircraft are either pushed back or kept private.Recent U.S. allegations in court filings that Chinese intelligence attempted to steal information on a French-U.S. turbofan engine developed for commercial jetliners - a clear reference to the Safran-General Electric LEAP (PA:SAF) (N:GE) - could further fray relations, analysts said.Beijing has also criticized the U.S. decision not to send senior officials to a Shanghai import expo that takes place in the same week as the airshow and counts as one of China's most important foreign policy events for the year.""Right now the political winds are quite concerning,"" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will likely make a deal with China on trade, adding that a lot of progress had been made to resolve the two countries' differences but warning that he still may impose more tariffs on Chinese goods.China is expected to put on a show of strength in space and defense, with self-developed fighter training FTC-2000 aircraft, a historically high number of weapons as well as its latest unmanned aerial vehicles among the kit on display.China's air force said on Friday that a number of Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters would perform demo flights, after having debuted at the show two years ago with a 60-second flypast.Kelvin Wong, senior Asia Pacific defense technology expert at IHS Markit, said this would be part of the deliberate messaging often associated with the closely watched show.""It appears the PLA (People's Liberation Army) is definitely showcasing its growing confidence in the latest J-20 combat aircraft,"" said Wong.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"Oct 31, 2018 04:16AM ET",U.S. charges Chinese intelligence officers for jet engine data hack,nan,"By Sarah N. Lynch and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese intelligence officers conspired with hackers and company insiders to break into private companies' computer systems and steal information on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners, according to a U.S. indictment unsealed on Tuesday.The indictment said that at the time of the hacks, a Chinese-state owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in aircraft manufactured in China and in other countries.Chinese-made jets, including the C919 and ARJ21, currently use foreign engines but the country has been trying to develop a competitive homegrown alternative.The 10 people charged conspired to steal sensitive data ""that could be used by Chinese entities to build the same or similar engine without incurring substantial research and development expenses,"" the indictment released by the U.S. Department of Justice said. It said more than a dozen companies were targeted, but only  Capstone Turbine Corp  (O:CPST) was identified by name.The Justice Department said those hacked included a French firm co-developing a turbofan jet engine with a U.S. company. France's only civil turbofan engine maker,  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), co-develops engines with U.S.-based  General Electric  Co (GE) (N:GE) through their longstanding CFM International partnership, the world's biggest jet engine manufacturer by number of units sold.The venture's latest engine, known as LEAP, powers the largest category of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) jets and includes a version for China's new passenger plane, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) C919.A Safran spokesman in China declined to comment and the company's French head office could not be contacted outside normal business hours.GE declined to comment.The indictment charges Zha Rong and Chai Meng along with other co-conspirators who worked for the Jiangsu province Ministry of State Security, a unit of the foreign intelligence arm of the Ministry of State Security.It says their efforts to steal sensitive commercial aviation and other data took place from January 2010 through May 2015.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the charges were groundless.""The relevant accusations are pure fiction and totally fabricated,"" he told reporters in Beijing, without elaborating. This is the third major corporate espionage-related case involving Chinese intelligence officers brought by the Justice Department since last month.In late September, a Chinese national who had also enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve was arrested in Chicago for working for Chinese intelligence to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked for U.S. defense contractors.In October, the Justice Department also announced it had arrested a spy for China's Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets from several U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.In that matter, the FBI said the extradition of Chinese operative Xu Yanjun from Belgium was unprecedented, and the case highlighted the Chinese government's direct control over economic espionage in the United States.John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, highlighted the pattern of the three cases in a public statement. ""This is just the beginning,"" he said. ""Together with our federal partners, we will redouble our efforts to safeguard America's ingenuity and investment.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

77,"Oct 29, 2018 04:10PM ET",EasyJet expects to be flying electric planes by 2030,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet has pushed back its forecast for flying electric planes to 2030, but is more confident about a technology it expects to cut emissions and costs after a partner moved to the next stage of engine development, the airline said on Monday.Last year, Europe's No.2 low cost carrier after Ryanair said it was aiming to use the lower-noise electric aircraft by 2027 through its partnership with start-up U.S. company Wright Electric.EasyJet's CEO Johan Lundgren shrugged off the delay to the timeline, saying it was more important there was clear path to bringing the new technology into operation.""We can definitely see a way forward in how we will get this aircraft into the fleet,"" he said in an interview.Wright is now working on an electric engine for a nine-seater plane that will fly next year, after success with a two-seater, and will simultaneously start working on a 50-seater version, said its CEO Jeffrey Engler.An electric plane that cuts emissions, noise and travel costs would be attractive to all airlines given jet fuel is one of their biggest costs, and the price of it has risen sharply this year.Wright estimates electric aircraft will reduce the energy costs of a plane by about 30 percent, Engler said.A number of high-profile engineering companies are working on developing such an aircraft.Zunum, backed by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, will use an engine turbine from France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA to power an electric motor for a hybrid plane, while Siemens has been working on developing electric motors for aircraft in collaboration with Airbus.Engler said that after the 50 seater, Wright would move onto testing a 150 or 180 seater and it was still possible that an electric-powered 180-passenger aircraft of the type wanted by easyJet (LON:EZJ) could be ready before 2030.""There's no reason why we can't meet the original deadline, it's just that we're waiting on suppliers, we're waiting on batteries, so we're trying to be conservative,"" he said.EasyJet, which has not invested funds into Wright, said the Wright electric planes could fly routes of about 500 kilometers, which means it could use the aircraft on London to Amsterdam, Europe's second busiest route.The airline is already targeting a 10 percent cut in carbon emissions per passenger per kilometer by 2022 by using more fuel-efficient jets, such as the new Airbus A320neo.Wright has also filed a patent for a motor to be used in a larger aircraft and work is starting on a new design for an easyJet-sized aircraft, the British airline said."

Rescue officials said they had recovered some human remains from the crash site, about 15 km (9 miles) off the coast.(Graphic: Flight path of Indonesia’s Lion Air flight JT610 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OV3w18)Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, but its safety record is patchy. If all aboard have died, the crash will be the country's second-worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.The pilot had asked to return to base (RTB) after the plane took off from Jakarta. It lost contact with ground staff after 13 minutes.""An RTB was requested and had been approved but we're still trying to figure out the reason,"" Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, told reporters, referring to the pilot's request.""We hope the black box is not far from the main wreckage so it can be found soon,"" he said, referring to the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.(Graphic: Indonesia plane crash - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OWsv3Z)Search and rescue agency head Muhmmad Syaugi told a news conference that no distress signal had been received from the aircraft's emergency transmitter.Yusuf Latief, spokesman of national search and rescue agency, said there were likely no survivors.At least 23 government officials, four employees of state tin miner PT Timah and three employees of a Timah subsidiary, were on the plane. A Lion Air official said one Italian passenger and one Indian pilot were on board.Edward Sirait, chief executive of Lion Air Group, told reporters the aircraft had had a technical problem on a flight from the resort island of Bali to Jakarta but it had been ""resolved according to procedure"".Sirait declined to specify the nature of the issue but said none of its other aircraft of that model had the same problem. Lion had operated 11 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and it had no plan to ground the rest of them, he said.The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's workhorse single-aisle jet.Privately owned Lion Air said the aircraft had been in operation since August, was airworthy, with its pilot and co-pilot together having accumulated 11,000 hours of flying time.'BE PATIENT'The plane went down in waters about 30 meters to 35 meters (98 to 115 ft) deep.Bambang Suryo, operational director of the search and rescue agency, said about 150 rescuers and 40 divers were on the site, using an underwater drone to search for the fuselage, where many of the victims were believed to be trapped.""We need to find the main wreckage,"" he told reporters.Another agency official, Deden Ridwansyah, said authorities were focusing on an area about 1 nautical mile in radius based on debris found on the water and floodlights would be used to search through the night.The flight took off in clear weather at around 6.20 a.m. and was due to have landed in Pangkal Pinang at 7.20 a.m.Distraught relatives of those on board arrived at the airport in Jakarta and Pangkal Pinang.""Be patient, pray the best for papa,"" one woman arriving at Jakarta airport told a sobbing girl.The woman declined to speak to reporters.President Joko Widodo told a news conference authorities were focusing on the search and rescue, and he called for the country's prayers and support.Boeing was deeply saddened by the loss, it said in a statement, and was ready to provide technical assistance for the investigation.Under international rules, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will automatically assist with the inquiry, backed up by technical advisers from Boeing and U.S.-French engine maker CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF).Data from FlightRadar24 shows the first sign of something amiss was around two minutes into the flight, when the plane had reached 2,000 feet (610 m). It descended more than 500 feet (152 m) and veered to the left before climbing again to 5,000 feet (1,524 m), where it stayed during most of the rest of the flight. It began gaining speed in the final moments and reached 345 knots (397 mph) before data was lost when it was at 3,650 feet (1,113 m).Indonesia's worst air disaster was in 1997, when a Garuda Indonesia A300 crashed in the city of Medan, killing 214 people.Founded in 1999, Lion Air's only fatal accident was in 2004, when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of the 163 on board, the Flight Safety Foundation's Aviation Safety Network says. In April, the airline announced a firm order to buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets with a list price of $6.24 billion. It is one of the U.S. planemaker's largest customers globally.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"Oct 15, 2018 05:50PM ET",France's Safran improves Silvercrest engine design: executive,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) has improved the design of its Silvercrest engine to prevent a repeat of factory delays and plans further testing in the second quarter of next year to confirm the breakthrough, the head of its engines division told Reuters on Monday. Safran has suffered delays and penalties over the small new engine, but won a vital reprieve on Monday when business jet operator NetJets agreed to buy up to 150 future Cessna Citation Hemisphere jets powered by the French-designed powerplant.""NetJets is the market leader and gives a great deal of credibility to the aircraft and the engine,"" Olivier Andries, chief executive of Safran Aircraft Engines, told Reuters.Development of the already-delayed engine was thrown off course last year when Safran reported a problem with a compressor during certain types of high-altitude test-flying, prompting one planemaker to cancel plans to use the engine.But NetJets and Cessna parent Textron (N:TXT), the sole planemaker still committed to the engine, reviewed the program in France last week and announced the major launch order at the world's largest business jet expo in Florida on Monday.Safran has started producing redesigned parts and will start assembling them in early 2019, followed by ground tests during the second quarter to ensure the solution is working.""We are very confident in the new high-pressure compressor, and the second-quarter tests will allow us to confirm that,"" Andries said in a telephone interview.He declined to say when the Silvercrest engine would be certified since Textron wanted to keep this under wraps. Amid fierce rivalry to enter a rebounding market for luxury jets, experts say rival planemakers can work out details of the entry into service of a plane from engine certification details.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

83,"Oct 15, 2018 05:00PM ET","Textron, NetJets strike deal for more than 300 Cessna planes",nan,"By Allison LampertORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - NetJets, the luxury plane unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday announced a deal to purchase up to 325 Cessna Citation business jets from Textron Inc's (N:TXT) aviation unit, one of the biggest orders unveiled at a major jet show this week in Orlando, Florida.Rob Scholl, a spokesman for Textron Aviation, said he expects NetJets to firm up the orders for up to 175 super-midsize Cessna Citation Longitude aircraft and up to 150 Cessna Citation Hemisphere aircraft in the coming weeks.Deliveries are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.In a statement, NetJets said the Textron agreement could increase its Cessna Citations fleet, which it has operated since 1984, to more than 800 aircraft over the next 10 to 15 years. The Longitude will compete with the new longer-range, midsized Praetors launched by Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) on Sunday and Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) Challeger 350 and 650 aircraft. Planemakers and buyers were buzzing about the deal as they arrived in Orlando, Florida, for the National Business Aviation Association's flagship annual corporate jet show, which begins on Tuesday.Demand for luxury aircraft is seen rising thanks to a strong economy and tax cuts in the United States, the world's largest market for private planes.The NetJets agreement boosted shares of Textron and also came as a relief to French engine maker  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), which has relied on sales of Cessna's Hemisphere aircraft, the newest member of the Citation jet family, for its troubled Silvercrest engine.The deal could increase confidence in the Silvercrest engine made by Safran, which last month reached a financial settlement with Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD) over the engine's production delays. French planemaker Dassault recently scrapped plans for a new aircraft that was due to have been powered by Silvercrest and replaced it with a new model, the Falcon 6X, powered by engines built by Pratt & Whitney Canada, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).Dassault unveiled further details of the relaunched Falcon 6X in Orlando on Monday.Shares in Textron gained 1.64 percent $66.14 in U.S. trade on Monday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

86,"Oct 04, 2018 11:30AM ET",Electric airplane startup Zunum chooses Safran engine turbine,nan,"By Eric M. JohnsonSEATTLE (Reuters) - Aircraft manufacturer Zunum, backed by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, will use an engine turbine from France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA to power an electric motor for the hybrid regional airplane it aims to bring into service in 2022, the company said on Thursday.Zunum, based near Seattle, is among several companies seeking to reduce emissions, noise and travel costs with electric planes, underscoring growing investment in lightweight propulsion systems to bring the benefits of electric-cars to the sky.  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Holdings PLC, and Airbus SA joined forces last year on a hybrid electric aircraft propulsion system, while Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) has developed a high-capacity generator that could be used for electric flight. Zunum, which is also funded by JetBlue Airways Corp's investment arm, will offer its 12-seat, 700-mile aircraft - dubbed the ZA10 - to charter airlines, private companies and regional carriers globally, starting in 2022.Zunum's planes will be battery powered, with a jetfuel-powered turbogenerator to extend range. It chose the Safran Helicopter Engines' Ardiden 3Z turbine over competing turbines from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls Royce.The ZA10 will cost less than $300 million to develop, compared to the billions of dollars required to bring a traditional regional jet to market, Zunum's Chief Executive Officer Ashish Kumar told Reuters.Norway in June tested a two-seater electric plane, built by Pipistrel in Slovenia, and predicted a start to passenger flights by 2025 as the country moves to reach a government goal of making all domestic flights in Norway electric by 2040.""This is the future,"" Kumar said. ""This class of aircraft is going to replace conventional airplanes over these (short-haul) distances.""Siemens' e-aircraft unit told Reuters earlier this year its system will work like a Toyota Prius: a gas-fueled engine inside the plane will spin a generator, sending electricity to small propulsion motors on the wings.In Zunum's plane, those motors are powered by the battery packs and the turbogenerator installed near the rear of the fuselage. Kumar said the new aircraft will deliver operating costs of 8 cents per available seat mile or $250 per hour, which is 60-80 percent lower than comparable conventional aircraft.Zunum's prototype motor is due to be tested in early December, with an improved version flying on a test aircraft in summer 2019, Kumar said. Conversely, the Airbus, Siemens, Rolls-Royce system is scheduled to begin test flights in 2020.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

88,"Sep 11, 2018 12:39PM ET","Boeing 737 deliveries rebound in August to 48, from July low",nan,"By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it delivered 48 of its best-selling 737 single-aisle aircraft in August, bouncing back from the 29 it delivered in July, the fewest in years.Deliveries at the world's biggest planemaker have been delayed as unfinished aircraft pile up at its Renton, Washington plant as a result of production bottlenecks at its suppliers that have disrupted manufacturing.Boeing's 737 and Airbus' (PA:AIR) A320 family of single-aisle jetliners are the cash cows of the two aircraft makers, the world's largest.""Our team made good progress in August and we're focused on fully recovering the delivery schedule by the end of the year,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said.While monthly delivery figures can fluctuate, the numbers give a snapshot of how far behind Boeing is delivering planes against its production target of 52 narrowbodies per month. Deliveries are crucial to planemakers because that is when airlines pay most of what they owe for the aircraft. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said 737 deliveries were above his estimate of 30 to 35 units, and made him feel more confident about Boeing's ability to hit its 2018 targets.The snarl in Renton, fueled by shortages of engines and fuselages as Boeing sped production to record levels in June, is likely to hurt third-quarter results and threatens to hinder its efforts to boost build rates again in 2019, some analysts said after meetings in the Seattle area last week.Boeing largely attributes the logjam to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).As it works to clear the backlog, Boeing has deployed about 600 employees from other facilities to the Renton site, and sent engineering teams to suppliers, the company said. Boeing has also started hiring back retired workers on a temporary basis, Reuters reported on Monday.The retirees will get $500 monthly bonuses in addition to wages while also continuing to receive their pension payments, a union official said. Boeing executives said last week 2018 cash flow projections, a measure closely watched by investors, would remain unchanged, as would its goal to speed up production again in 2019, analysts said.Monthly 737 deliveries totaled 48, down from 50 a year ago, Boeing said. Total plane deliveries were 64 in August, compared with 66 units a year earlier and 39 units in July.Boeing said its total 2018 net orders were 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 planes toward the end of July.The company said its total 2018 net orders were 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 planes toward the end of July.Boeing's shares were up 1 percent at $345.49 in mid-day trading.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deliveries are crucial to planemakers because that is when airlines pay most of what they owe for the aircraft.Boeing started hiring retired mechanics and inspectors on a temporary basis after reaching an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Aug. 15, union spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said. Boeing had a similar agreement with the union last autumn following a round of voluntary layoffs, Kelliher said.Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said the company was dedicating additional resources to the Renton site ""to ensure timely deliveries to our customers.""Boeing has already deployed about 600 employees and new hires to Renton in recent weeks to help fix delays, analysts said. It was not clear how many retired workers Boeing intends to hire. 2019 SPILLOVER? About 50 semi-finished 737s were scattered around the Renton plant last week, analysts said, several times the number of semi-finished aircraft Reuters reported in July.Boeing largely attributes the snarl to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture between France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).""We are working closely with our suppliers Spirit and CFM as they track toward recovery, as well as our customers,"" Bergman said. ""Our team has been mitigating supplier delays, and our factory continues to build 52 airplanes per month.""CFM is working to fix delays by year-end, the GE-Safran venture said. Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Among airlines with large 737 fleets,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has seen slight delays on a small number of 737 MAX deliveries, while No. 4 carrier Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) sees ""minor changes"" on future deliveries, but the delays have not disrupted operations, company representatives said.Aircraft leasing company  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) was still seeing 737 delivery delays of ""a month or less,"" spokeswoman Laura Woeste said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Maintenance, repair and overhaul services are a lucrative source of revenues for engine makers.IATA on July 31 withdrew the CFM complaint after the company, a joint venture between  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), agreed to open up engine maintenance services to rival engine parts and aftersales service market suppliers.""IATA has not withdrawn the complaint against Honeywell,"" a spokeswoman for the body said.IATA said it was concerned about certain business practices that its members believe limit competition in the market for APU maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Honeywell is the largest producer of gas turbine APUs found on many aircraft.Honeywell said it was adhering to the rules.""Honeywell believes that our practices are fair and in compliance with all relevant laws. We have and will continue to cooperate with the European Commission's preliminary inquiry,"" the company said in an email.The EU competition enforcer has received the complaint and is assessing it, Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""And so therefore you'll see a much more heavily weighted Q4,"" Smith added. ""Those jobs are now in our factory and each one of those suppliers is getting more on track,"" he said.The top-selling 737 is powered by engines made by French-U.S. venture CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE) of the United States. CFM has had some industrial problems in producing its new LEAP engine for the 737 MAX and some aircraft for rival Airbus (PA:AIR).Boeing is also grappling with delays on fuselages supplied by Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR). Spirit, which makes some 70 percent of the structure of the 737, has faced disruptions this year in its own supply chain as parts makers scrambled to meet soaring demand. Spirit has said it is working to get back on track by mid-2018.Boeing aims to reach production of 57 of the narrow-body jets per month in 2019.Smith also said Boeing continues to spend a lot of time talking to airlines about a possible new mid-market jet it says will fill a niche between the bread-and-butter single-aisle planes that dominate most fleets and the bigger long-range, twin-aisle jets.Discussions continue to focus on the plane's economics and how airlines could use the aircraft to optimize their product lines, Smith said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

99,"Aug 03, 2018 06:06AM ET","Bezos throws cash, engineers at rocket program as space race accelerates",nan,"By Eric M. JohnsonSEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is racing to pull his private space company out of start-up mode and move into production amid signals that his firm's heavy rocket set for lift-off in 2020 may slip behind schedule, according to people familiar with the project.Blue Origin has added hundreds of engineers over the past three years and continues to ramp up in an expansion that one employee described as ""hyperbolic."" The Kent, Washington-based company is looking to double its current workforce to around 3,000 employees over the next two to three years, a top customer told Reuters.The urgency centers on a rocket dubbed New Glenn. The heavy-launch vehicle, which Bezos promises will be able to haul satellites and, eventually, people into orbit, is central to the company's hopes of winning lucrative military and commercial contracts.New Glenn's first-stage booster will be reusable, a key piece of Bezos' strategy to lower costs and increase the frequency of launches. Blue Origin executives have stated publicly that test flights will begin within two years. But whether Blue Origin can hit that mark remains to be seen.With the clock ticking on 2020, company engineers are still finalizing details on New Glenn's design and just beginning to build model components that must be put through extreme testing, people familiar with the project said. They requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.Blue Origin has privately acknowledged in conversations with French satellite firm Eutelsat SA [ETLXCE.UL] - its first New Glenn customer - that its 2020 time frame is ""very aggressive,"" a person with direct knowledge of talks between the companies said.The firms have padded their contract, which covers the launch of a geostationary satellite in the period 2021-2022, so that Blue Origin will incur no penalties if it is late, the person added. Yohann Leroy, Eutelsat's Deputy Chief Executive Officer, declined to discuss details of his company's contract with Blue Origin, but said he was optimistic New Glenn will be ready to carry his firm's satellite by the end of 2022. ""Of course, I cannot guarantee that they will respect their initial timeline, but we are confident that they will not be very far from it,"" Leroy said.A Blue Origin spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about the company's hiring practices, strategy or competitive challenges. The private firm has been tight-lipped on New Glenn's production status and plans for bringing it to market. Mounting a successful test in 2020 would give Blue Origin its best shot at fending off competing rockets and new ones expected to enter the market in the next few years, analysts said.Rivals include aerospace stalwarts United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT); and France's ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF). Japan and China are likewise designing reusable rockets. But 18 years after its founding, Blue Origin has found itself lagging a competitor closer to home: SpaceX. Founded by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, the Hawthorne, California-based company has upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars' worth of contracts, including deals with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense.SpaceX in February transfixed a global audience with the successful test launch of its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.Musk had predicted ""game over"" for other makers of heavy rockets if his launch succeeded. The good news for Blue Origin is that demand for satellite launch services is projected to soar.Around 800 small satellites are expected to launch annually beginning around 2020, more than double the annual average over the past decade, according to Marco Caceres, senior space analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group.""If New Glenn can be ready in the next two years (Blue Origin) may be able to seize that window of opportunity,"" he said. ROCKET SCIENCE Like Musk, Bezos is passionate about the prospect of humans living and working in space. Now the world's richest man, thanks to the success of online retailer Amazon, Bezos has been liquidating $1 billion of its stock annually to fund his interplanetary dreams.He set up Blue Origin in a warehouse some 20 miles (32 km) south of Seattle. The company's Latin motto means ""step by step ferociously,"" a reference to Bezos' belief that success comes through steady, incremental progress.But after nearly two decades, and with the private space race heating up, Bezos is intent on moving closer to commercialization, three Blue Origin employees told Reuters.Part of those efforts include selling sightseeing trips to the edge of space aboard another Blue Origin rocket dubbed the New Shepard, with ticket prices in the $200,000-$300,000 range. Blue Origin also is vying to supply its BE-4 engine to United Launch Alliance to power its forthcoming Vulcan rocket, ULA said.The recent hiring binge has focused mainly on throwing talent at the New Glenn, and has included more than 60 engineers who worked previously for SpaceX.Blue Origin's workforce of more than 1,500 has more than doubled from its early 2016 levels, three employees said. Its ranks are expected to double again by the time New Glenn is flying, Eutelsat's Leroy said. By comparison, SpaceX has more than 6,000 employees.Bezos' company has also invested more than $200 million in a rocket-making facility near NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Still, Leroy said he expects to see a New Glenn prototype no sooner than mid-2019.In the meantime, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and satellite companies are directing business to SpaceX.Matt Desch, Chief Executive Officer of McLean, Virginia-based Iridium Communications Inc, SpaceX's largest commercial customer, told Reuters that Blue Origin ""has been a little less clear"" about its strategy.""Nobody disputes that with the investment they're making they won't eventually be successful, but how and when they become reliable is still uncertain,"" Desch said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

JohnsonFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) will press for deeper price cuts from suppliers with overlapping operations once it completes its planned acquisition of the regional jet business of Brazil's Embraer, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters on Tuesday.""The key thing you are going to see is that through the combination between Boeing and Embraer, we will be able to increase volume for our supply chain, which is generally going to be beneficial. And that beneficial volume should also turn into more affordability and competitiveness,"" he said.Asked if he would expect further price cuts over and above those baked into Boeing's Partnering for Success cost-cutting drive, he said: ""Yes. Because you'll see additional increases in volume. And a very typical discussion we'll have with our supply chain is if there's an opportunity for them to increase volume or access to additional platforms, if we can gain a cost advantage in the marketplace, that's a mutual benefit.""Boeing, meanwhile, continues to ""keep a very close eye"" on consolidation trends among its major suppliers and will continue to expand where it sees it necessary to support its business.""In some cases, consolidation can be beneficial where it allows the supply chain to take costs out. If we get to a point where consolidation is reducing our sources to a level where we can't stand, we've had the opportunity to build new sources of supply. We always have that flexibility,"" Muilenburg said.Muilenburg indicated Boeing would continue to push into areas traditionally dominated by its suppliers, by bringing some parts of the supply chain in-house, a process known as vertical integration.Some aerospace suppliers have been rattled by Boeing's recent moves to integrate parts. In the most recent example, it set up a joint-venture with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) to break into the highly concentrated market for auxiliary power units.""We are very targeted in that area,"" Muilenburg said, when asked where he would set the limits for such expansion.Boeing has 30-40 categories or ""verticals"" across its platforms and when deciding which ones to invest in, it will be driven first by what adds value and then by whether there is a good services business attached, he said.Muilenburg was speaking shortly after Boeing unveiled a higher 20-year demand forecast for passenger jets driven by the untapped travel demands of a steadily expanding global middle class.He did not see any reason to modify those forecasts despite global trade tensions.""In the past where we had an aerospace sector that was largely dominated by U.S. and Europe, our backlogs were dominated there ... it's a much more globally distributed [business] today.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

102,"Jul 16, 2018 05:50AM ET",GE Aviation CEO says changes at GE no constraint for his business,nan,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The overhaul at U.S. industrial giant  General Electric  Co (N:GE) is not a constraint for its aviation arm, ""in fact I feel it's the very opposite,"" the head of GE Aviation said on Monday. Following a year-long strategic review, GE said last month it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE), effectively breaking up the 126-year-old conglomerate.""The changes in GE unlock if anything more capability out of GE Aviation. I don’t feel any constraints relative to what has happened in the past year - in fact I feel the very opposite,"" David Joyce, CEO of GE Aviation and vice chairman of GE, told a news briefing at the Farnborough Airshow.""We don't feel we are under a lot more pressure than we were before."" Asked about Boeing's plans for a new twin-aisle mid-market aircraft, Joyce said he expected a formal decision from Boeing (NYSE:BA) in response to engine offers in 2019.Joyce said, in reply to a question, that he had not yet managed to reconcile the various views on market forecasts for the middle of the jetliner market.The business case for potential engine manufacturers would depend on how many variants Boeing plans to offer, he said.GE has the largest stake of any engine maker in the industry's status quo, since it supplies engines for best-selling single-aisle aircraft to both Boeing and Airbus through its CFM joint venture with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).Industry experts say that means GE has the lowest strategic interest among engine makers in supporting the mid-market project, though most expect it to take part in the program if it goes ahead - especially if Boeing only chooses one supplier.Joyce reiterated he was open-minded about whether the program should have one engine supplier or two, but that GE would not take part if there were three suppliers on board.GE competes with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Pratt & Whitney, which some in the industry speculate could co-operate on the project.The mid-market plane would sit between single-aisle and wide-body jets and compete partly with the Airbus A321neo, the European planemaker’s largest single-aisle jet.Asked whether the mid-market plane could damage the business case for the LEAP engine, which CFM offers on the A321neo and other Airbus single-aisle models, Joyce it would not, based on the latest proposals for the aircraft, but did not elaborate.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

106,"Jun 28, 2018 02:30PM ET",Fox shareholder urges Murdoch to give Comcast time to beat Disney bid,nan,"By Carl O'Donnell(Reuters) - TCI Fund Management Ltd, a large Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) shareholder, has urged Fox executive chairman Rupert Murdoch to give Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) a chance to top Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) $71 billion offer to buy most of Fox's assets, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. The hedge fund, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, owns 7.4 percent of Fox shares and said he disagreed with Fox's view that Comcast's bid would come with higher regulatory risk. TCI is ""strongly motivated"" to support whichever deal came at a higher price. The letter highlights shareholder appetite for a continued bidding war between Disney and Comcast over Fox, whose stock traded 1.7 percent higher on Thursday at $49.62, more than $10 above Disney's revised, roughly $38 per share offer. Disney, Fox and TCI declined to comment. Comcast could not be reached immediately for comment. Hohn’s $17.5 billion hedge fund has held stakes in German carmaker  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF), and called for changes to boost their stock prices. Hohn said a U.S. judge's recent approval of AT&T Inc's (N:T) agreement to acquire  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) is ""unequivocally positive"" for similar deals, such as Comcast's bid for Fox. He also said the U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Disney earlier this week, which cleared the way for that company's planned acquisition of Fox, further reduced the regulatory risk for a potential Comcast deal. Hohn said the timetable for a Comcast deal would be roughly similar to a one with Disney, given the need for either transaction to obtain regulatory approvals internationally. Disney agreed to buy Fox for $71 billion in stock on June 20, trumping a $65 billion cash bid from Comcast. Disney had originally agreed to buy Fox for around $52 billion late last year. Fox delayed its planned shareholder meeting, scheduled for next month, to give Comcast time to come back with a higher bid. The Fox assets in play include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox’s stake in Hulu.Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. A deal for Fox would allow Comcast to better adapt to new trends in the pay-TV industry, as consumers abandon traditional cable bundles in favor of web-based offerings such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).The Financial Times first reported on the letter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It envisions a mid-market jetliner with 220 to 270 seats and a range of up to 5,000 nautical miles, with global demand for 4,000 to 5,000 jets over 20 years, though rival Airbus (PA:AIR) disagrees with that forecast. Boeing wants an engine that burns 25 percent less fuel for every pound of thrust it produces compared with the 757's decades-old turbines, the Air Current reported. The timing for choosing either one or two manufacturers was not immediately clear, it said.General Electric (N:GE) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rolls-Royce, which is facing problems with parts of the Trent 1000 engine that have led to the grounding of some 787s for repairs, said, ""whenever an aircraft manufacturer comes forward with a proposal we will have a technology response.""A Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) representative referred to comments made earlier this month by its commercial engine business chief Chris Calio: ""I think the (Geared Turbofan engine) scales well, and so we're always looking and interested in other applications for the GTF as long as it makes sense for us.""Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said in a research note that CFM ""is likely to be the keenest contender"", and might offer a derivative of its GE9X engine, which serves the forthcoming 777X.

He now expects around 11 satellite launches for the year.There might be a similar number of launches in 2019, but it is too early to give a definitive forecast, Israel said, adding the company was now focusing on gaining customers for the lower cost Ariane 6 rocket due to debut in 2020.Arianespace is facing increased competition for the launch of commercial satellites with the emergence of rivals like tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX and China Great Wall Industry Corp, which has put it under pressure to provide reliable launches at competitive rates.SpaceX has already completed 11 launches so far this year, almost 4 times more than Arianespace.The European satellite launch firm is betting on the Ariane 6 project to deliver the ""best mix between reliability, availability and competitiveness"", Israel said.ARIANE 6 PLANS Arianespace expects the cost of launching the Ariane 6 will fall by 40 percent versus the Ariane 5 through design changes and higher volume production, bringing its prices in line with SpaceX, Israel said on the sidelines of a telecommunications trade show in Singapore.The company has signed up three European-government linked launches for Ariane 6 and is hoping for four more to follow soon, along with the first commercial contract, he said. Arianespace, which also launches the smaller Soyuz and Vega rockets, plans to launch 11-12 Ariane 6s from its facilities in French Guiana a year. It currently launches 5-6 Ariane 5s annually. Arianespace conducts launches for the European Space Agency as well as for private groups including telecom service providers such as Britain's Avanti Communications Group PLC and Japan's SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings Inc. The European Commission this month said it planned to increase its budget for space programs to 16 billion euros ($18.74 billion) between 2021 and 2027, aiming to consolidate the bloc's role as a ""space power"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The plaintiffs, eight passengers from Flight 1380 on April 17 and one passenger's husband, filed suit on Tuesday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York.Passengers Cindy Candy Arenas, Jaky Alyssa Arena, Jiny Alexa Arenas, Elhadji Cisse, Donald Kirkland, Beverly Kirkland, Connor Brown, and Cassandra Adams, and Cindy Arenas' husband, Joe Leos Arenas, allege that Southwest acted negligently in its responsibilities to maintain and repair its aircraft and aircraft components. ""A passenger was sucked into the open window, and the other passengers, including Plaintiffs, were confronted with their greatest fear, the overwhelming horror of being trapped in a plane about to crash,"" the suit alleges. Another passenger, Lilia Chavez, filed suit against the airline in April.The incident occurred when a CFM56-7B engine on one of Southwest's Boeing 737-700 jets blew apart in midair, shattering a plane window, flinging shrapnel and killing passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard. The flight was headed from New York to Dallas.The episode was the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009.Also named in the lawsuit are  Boeing Co  (N:BA), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) S.A.,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Aviation and CFM International, the manufacturers behind the engine that broke apart. CFM is a transatlantic joint-venture co-owned by GE and Safran.Southwest has faced extreme scrutiny in the months since the accident, and federal regulators are probing the events that led to the engine explosion.

It also has a partnership with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) to make LEAP-1B engines for Boeing's 737 MAX.Boeing has been riding on strong demand for commercial jets, selling a record number of jets in 2017.

115,"Jun 01, 2018 12:06AM ET",New Airbus chief says challenging to meet delivery goals -staff memo,nan,"(Reuters) - Airbus faces an unprecedented challenge in ramping up production to meet 2018 delivery targets following engine delays, and must eventually overhaul a manufacturing system that belongs to a ""bygone age,"" the jetmaker's new president told staff on Friday.""We have a battle plan in place for this year and the engine manufacturers are working hard to meet their commitments. Still, we know it will be challenging,"" Airbus Commercial Aircraft President Guillaume Faury said in an interview for internal circulation seen by Reuters.""Delivering 80 to 90 aircraft every month in the second half of the year has never been done before. In the long term we must overhaul a single-aisle production system that belongs to a bygone age when high-rate production of aircraft wasn't needed.""Airbus has been hit by delays in getting engines from United Technologies (N:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, co-owned by  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE).It delivered 172 aircraft in the first four months of the year, lagging behind the pace needed to hit a full-year goal of 800 even though deliveries traditionally speed up in the final quarter.Faury was speaking to mark 100 days since taking over the European group's planemaking division from Fabrice Bregier.Echoing his predecessor, former auto executive Faury signaled a push to exploit digital techniques as Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) shift towards mass production of jet aircraft that are far ahead of standards previously seen in commercial aerospace.""Ultimately, we want to move to a position where our aircraft and the manufacturing system are designed as one,"" he said. Boeing is pioneering a new digital-based manufacturing system for a potential new mid-market jet, which could later be adapted to an eventual successor to the 737, its best-selling single-aisle model. Airbus is however expected to make the leap to the next generation in one step, starting from around 2030.In a separate interview with French newspaper Les Echos, Faury said no decision had been taken on whether to increase production of the single-aisle A320 to 70 jets a month, compared with the current level of 50 and a target of 60 set for 2019.Such levels of production are justified by strong demand from airlines, but Airbus is still studying whether its supply chain is strong enough, Faury said. Any step-up in production beyond 60 would happen at the start of the next decade, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

117,"May 30, 2018 07:40AM ET","Aerospace group Safran sticks to LEAP engine targets, no 'bad surprises' at Zodiac",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - French aerospace firm  Safran  (PA:SAF) is sticking to production targets for the LEAP jet engine, but is still unwilling to back proposals for higher output from Airbus and Boeing until it is convinced its own suppliers can keep up, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Safran co-owns the world's largest jet engine supplier, based on the number of units produced, along with  General Electric  (N:GE) and their plans for a record hike in output of LEAP are 4-6 weeks behind schedule.""I want to be virtually certain about the robustness of the supply chain before committing to higher production,"" Philippe Petitcolin said.CFM International, the joint venture that makes LEAP engines, aims to deliver around 1,100 of the engines this year, followed by 1,800 next year and hitting the 2,000 mark in 2020.Its factories are currently churning out 12 LEAP engines a week for the Airbus A320 family and 14 a week for the Boeing 737. By the end of the year it aims to raise the weekly rate by two engines for Airbus (PA:AIR) and 4-6 for Boeing (N:BA), Petitcolin said.Engine makers have been struggling to keep up with demand triggered by a new generation of fuel-saving engines. CFM has been spared most of the delays felt by rival Pratt & Whitney or technical problems seen at Rolls-Royce (L:RR), but its performance has widespread economic implications since it powers 75 percent of the world's most-used narrowbody jets.Petitcolin said CFM continues to see demand for the previous generation of engines, its decades-old CFM56, even as it switches to the new fuel-saving model. Analysts say airlines calculate that current engines are still economic on shorter trips.Safran is juggling the LEAP ramp-up against efforts to turn around French aircraft seats and cabin equipment maker Zodiac Aerospace , which Petitcolin said occupies much of his attention.Three months after taking control of Zodiac, Safran has not discovered any nasty surprises - seen as a significant fact in its own right after around 10 profit warnings from Zodiac beforehand.""There have been no major (bad) surprises but there haven't been any good surprises either,"" Petitcolin told the AJPAE aerospace media association, adding it would take 12-18 months for delayed airline seat projects currently being handled by Zodiac to work their way through the system.Petitcolin deflected questions about intermittent speculation in France of a future tie-up between Safran and French defense and aerospace equipment company  Thales  (PA:TCFP).The two companies faced pressure to merge more than a decade ago but never went through with a deal. Thales later fell into the orbit of Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), which has industrial control as part of a shareholder pact with the French state.Industry sources say the mosaic of state-influenced French aerospace companies could again come under scrutiny following the death this week of industrialist Serge Dassault.In 2012, one of his sons, Laurent Dassault, suggested a broad combination of Dassault Aviation, Thales, Safran and Zodiac as a counterweight to Franco-German Airbus group (then called EADS), but few in the industry publicly warmed to the idea.Petitcolin paid tribute to Serge Dassault as a ""great man"" of French aeronautics, but declined to be drawn on any future industry deals, saying his priority was to integrate Zodiac.Safran meanwhile hopes for an inaugural contract for its new E-Taxi electrically powered aircraft taxiing system at the Farnborough Airshow in July, Petitcolin said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There were either 104 or 105 passengers, including five children, plus nine crew members, various state media said.Five of the passengers plus the crew were foreign, media reports said. The Mexican government said Mexicans citizens were among the dead, without providing further details.""We should expect that the news will not be good, as there are a high number of people who appear to have been killed,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in broadcast comments.The fire from the crash had been put out and authorities were identifying bodies, the president said. The cause of the crash was not immediately known and Diaz-Canel said authorities were investigating.""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" said Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site in the agricultural area of Boyeros.The Boeing 737-201 aircraft was built in 1979 and leased by Cuban airline Cubana from a small Mexican firm called Damojh, according to the Mexican government. That would make it significantly older than most planes in service.GRAPHIC - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KAtxfmDamojh in Mexico said it did not immediately have any more information. Cubana declined to comment.Cubana has been the subject of complaints over service and delays in recent months.Blackened wreckage of Flight CU972 was strewn over the crash site area 20 km (12 miles) south of Havana, a Reuters witness said.

Problems included the cancellation of numerous domestic flights this year, and long delays which the company said were caused by technical problems with its aircraft.Earlier this month, the company was ordered to suspend flights by its six Russian built AN-158 aircraft, of which most had reportedly already been grounded.The last fatal crash in Cuba was in 2017, the Aviation Safety Network said. It was a military flight that killed all eight on board. In 2010, a commercial Aero Caribbean plane crashed in central Cuba. All 68 people on board were killed.The latest available information on Cuba from U.N. safety aviation agency ICAO, dating back to 2008, ranks it above the global average, though that preceded the latest three crashes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The crew diverted the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737-700 to Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport at about 11 a.m. EDT to inspect a layer of a windowpane, said Southwest spokesman Brian Parrish. ""The aircraft has been taken out of service for maintenance review,"" Parrish said.FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro, who confirmed no one was hurt, said the organization was investigating the incident.Wednesday's incident is damaging more to Southwest's public perception than evidence of any systemic issue, Teal Group Fleet analyst Richard Aboulafia said. The airline said in its first- quarter earnings report it is bracing for a decline in bookings following the April engine blowout.""It’s unfortunate only from an optics and image standpoint,"" Aboulafia said. ""Windows are made by window manufacturers. Nothing to do with technology that's unique to the 737 or to Southwest."" The FAA on Tuesday ordered additional inspections of fan blades in hundreds of additional engines similar to the one that failed in the deadly Southwest accident on April 17.Southwest has said it planned to complete ultrasonic inspections on all fan blades on the some 700 planes in its fleet with the CFM56-7B engines, the model involved in last month's blowout, over the next two weeks, meeting the FAA's August deadline by mid-May. The CFM engine is made by a joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).Southwest said it has not found any cracks on fan blades inspected since the accident.Shares of the Dallas-based carrier were down slightly at $52.79 in afternoon trading.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company's size and market power.The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment.UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value.A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time.Rockwell Collins' (N:COL) businesses are in avionics, seats and plane interiors. This is the second engines-to-seating supplier deal after French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) acquired seat maker Zodiac Aerospace  last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

124,"Apr 27, 2018 06:44AM ET","Airbus cuts A330 output, first quarter profit capped by engine delays",nan,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) announced a 17 percent drop in planned 2019 deliveries of its most successful wide-body jet on Friday following a series of order defeats to rival Boeing, while blurring near-term production plans for the much healthier A320.Europe's largest aerospace group is simultaneously juggling a drop in demand for its A330 wide-body jet - the only one of its class on which it currently makes a profit - against record demand for bread-and-butter models like the A320.Airbus said it was reducing deliveries of the 250-300-seat A330 to around 50 aircraft in 2019, compared with 67 last year and 60 planned for 2018. That comes after an upgraded version due to enter service this year failed to sell as it had hoped.The production slowdown came as Airbus posted a slender - though better than expected - core profit in the first quarter after delays in engine deliveries for its smaller A320neo.Together, the A320 and A330 families generate most of the cash and income needed to support future developments and other activities at the maker of airplanes, rockets and fighters.While the narrowbody A320neo remains a best-seller, with Airbus recently unable to produce the jets fast enough due to engine supply problems, the upgraded A330neo has been losing ground to the newer Boeing (N:BA) 787 at carriers like American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines.""We knew (the first quarter) was going to be grisly – and it is,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris in a note.""The A330 going down to 50 (a year) is overtly bad news, but we have suspected for some time the A330's slow sales could mean A350 production moves up at some point,"" he added.A320 PRODUCTIONShares in Airbus dipped just over 1 percent on the results, which came days after Boeing beat forecasts after improving deliveries and turning the corner on 787 costs.Airbus reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros ($17 million) after a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.12 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed full-year forecasts, however, predicting that A320neo deliveries would speed up later this year after a two-month break in some deliveries due to engine snags.Analysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro quarterly operating loss on revenues of 10.21 billion.Airbus said it saw continued strong demand for narrowbody jets like the A320, allowing it to explore future production rates of ""70 or 70-plus"" a month, up from around 55 a month now.But it softened recent indications that it planned to accelerate its goal in the short term, after an Airbus spokesman earlier this week confirmed a report it planned to increase output to 63 a month in 2019, instead of 60.Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said Airbus was only asking for ""surge capacity"" of that level and the only commitment was for 60 aircraft a month, while redefining the goal as a delivery target rather than a production figure.This is a change from the usual practice for high-volume aircraft program, where manufacturers typically announce monthly production rates that hold steady while deliveries can fluctuate from month to month. For the year as a whole, they tend to focus on deliveries, which drive revenues and cash.Airbus is keen to lock in a recent advantage over Boeing in narrowbody jets by speeding up the rate at which it turns orders into deliveries, but faces pushback from its engine suppliers.The head of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) this week warned against hasty production increases as suppliers work through an unprecedented speed-up plan already in motion.Germany's MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) said on Wednesday it too was cautious, because of tight supply chains.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

126,"Apr 26, 2018 11:21AM ET",CFM says more than half of engines inspected after emergency directive,nan,"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jet engine manufacturer CFM International Inc said on Thursday airlines have inspected more than half of nearly 700 CFM engines subject to an emergency order issued late Friday by U.S. and European regulators.The inspections cover engines like the one involved in a fatal Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) engine blowout last week. The directives for inspections by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency suggested rising concerns about CFM56-7B engines, built by the joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF). The same type of engine had a similar failure in 2016.Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required by May 10, the agencies said. A cycle includes one take-off and landing -- and 150 had already been inspected prior to Friday's order.Cincinnati, Ohio-based CFM International said airline operators have completed more than 60 percent of mandated ultrasonic inspections on CFM56-7B engines with more than 30,000 cycles.As soon as next week, the FAA was expected to finalize a separate directive on CFM56-7B engines it had proposed in August covering a different set of engines, two officials briefed on the matter said.The engine explosion on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 in Pennsylvania was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.The CFM56-7B engine powers the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Next-Generation 737. Approximately 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are operated by 60 companies worldwide.CFM said GE and Safran Aircraft Engines are supporting airlines with a team of 500 experts worldwide to complete the inspections quickly and help to minimize operational disruption. Southwest has said it is cancelling some flights as a result of inspections.CFM also recommends completing inspections of fan blades with more than 20,000 cycles by the end of August, and inspections to all other fan blades by the time they reach 20,000 cycles. After first inspection, operators are recommended to repeat the inspection every 3,000 cycles, typically about two years in airline service. Those inspections for fan blades with 20,000 cycles will affect an additional 2,500 engines by August.The engine that blew apart on last week's Southwest flight would have been affected by Friday's inspection order, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

128,"Apr 24, 2018 03:01PM ET","Germany, France agree main needs of new joint fighter program",nan,"By Sabine Siebold and Tim HepherBERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Germany and France have agreed on the central requirements for a new fighter jet to replace Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale warplanes beginning in 2040, German military sources said.This will kick start a program first launched in July last year and officials from the two countries will sign an outline document on the sidelines of the ILA Berlin Air Show, which will be opened on Wednesday by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.As well as being capable of acting on its own, or commanding a squadron of other weapons, including drones, the plane will also need to have the ability to carry out offensive or defensive missions, the sources said on Tuesday.It had not yet been decided if the new plane would be only manned or also have an unmanned option. The goal is to start operating them, with limited capabilities, in 2040.The move to develop a new warplane is seen as a preliminary step toward overcoming differences that have left Europe struggling to maintain three competing fighter programs -  France’s Rafale, the Eurofighter - representing Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain - and Sweden’s Gripen.Merkel and Emmanuel Macron first unveiled plans for the new program shortly after the French President's election in May in a significant gesture designed to give fresh impetus to Franco-German relations in the aftermath of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. Most defense experts believe the UK will eventually be invited to join the program.The statement of political intent is expected to be followed by an industrial declaration that sets out in greater detail how the partners, notably Dassault and Airbus, Germany’s defense aeronautics champion and a Eurofighter consortium member, will approach the multibillion-euro project.Dassault Aviation has made a strong pitch to be the senior partner.France was originally part of the European Eurofighter consortium that includes Britain, Germany and Italy, but opted in the 1980s to develop its own independent Dassault-built Rafale fighter, partly in order to guarantee high-value work for its state-owned engine maker, now part of  Safran  (PA:SAF).Airbus and Dassault declined comment ahead of the air show.Germany and France also plan sign a document at the air show in which they agree to explore the joint development of a new maritime surveillance aircraft, with a goal of making it operational by 2035, the German military sources said.That program, to be focused on anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and support, will be opened in the longer term to other countries in the European Union, NATO and elsewhere, the sources said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

By contrast, other major U.S. carriers had each canceled four or fewer flights on Monday, the website said.Southwest said the cancellations were the result of the company’s announcement last Tuesday that it would begin voluntarily stepping up inspections of some CFM56-7B engines over the next 30 days. The airline said on Sunday it canceled about 40 flights.It said on Monday it anticipated ""minimal delays or cancellations each day due to the inspections.""The company added it ""will continue our work to minimize flight disruptions by performing inspections overnight while aircraft are not flying, and utilizing spare aircraft, when available.""The Federal Aviation Administration and European regulators ordered emergency inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to the one involved in the fatal Southwest engine blowout.Southwest said the cancellations were not a result of the emergency directive. The engine explosion on Southwest flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009. Southwest has declined to answer questions about its CFM56-7B inspection program, including how many engines were inspected before the accident, and if the engine that failed had been inspected and if the new inspections turned up any problems.The FAA said on Friday the ""unsafe condition"" was ""likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.""

The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.""The unsafe condition,"" the FAA said in the order, ""is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.""The inspections ordered are a sharp step-up from actions by both the European and U.S. regulators after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. The European agency had given airlines nine months to check engines, while U.S. regulators still were considering what to do.Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required in the next 20 days, the agencies said on Friday. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday's Southwest flight would have been affected, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.The coordinated 20-day measure partially resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world's two largest and most influential aviation regulators, a person familiar with the discussions said and published documents show.The FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalized the measure by the time of Tuesday's fatal second accident.The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, matching the FAA's roll-out, saying data did not justify that.The divergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two agencies, especially on one of the world's most-used aviation products. CFM, which is jointly owned by  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both in the United States and in Europe.""It happens that there are disagreements about the right way to go in some cases, and this was one of them,"" the person familiar with the discussions said.On Tuesday, however, when news broke that a second failure had taken place involving the same model engine, aircraft and airline - this time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat - the two agencies agreed to act quickly, the person said.An FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue. An EASA spokesman declined to comment.On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of U.S. aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.The FAA and NTSB have different roles. Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and recommend possible changes to safety rules, while regulators have to assess whether safety risks could appear.Several major airline officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest.Southwest, which had opposed efforts by the engine maker last year to shorten the FAA’s earlier proposed deadline, on Friday said its maintenance program meets or exceeds the new requirements.United Continental Holdings (N:UAL) said that it had begun inspections earlier after a recommendation from CFM. American Airlines (O:AAL) said it does not have any CFM56-7B engines with 30,000 cycles and would not be impacted by the 20-day order. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it had begun complying and did not expect any operational impact to customersApproximately 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are in operation. CFM had initially recommended the inspections.The European order requires that after the first inspection, airlines should keep repeating the process every 3,000 cycles, which typically represents about two years in service.More than 150 have already been inspected.Inspections recommended by the end of August will affect an additional 2,500 engines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The order, which it initially proposed in August following an incident in 2016, will require ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of takeoffs.Airlines said that because fan blades may have been repaired and moved to other engines, the order would affect far more than 220 of the CFM56-7Bs, which are made by a partnership of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE).The CFM56 engine on Southwest (N:LUV) flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York's LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board. The explosion sent shrapnel ripping into the fuselage of the Boeing 737-700 plane and shattered a window. Bank executive Jennifer Riordan, 43, was killed when she was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat as the cabin suffered rapid decompression. Fellow passengers were able to pull her back inside but she died of her injuries. On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said the incident began when one of the engine's 24 fan blades snapped off from its hub. Investigators found that the blade had suffered metal fatigue at the point of the break.Sumwalt said he could not yet say if the incident, the first deadly airline accident in the United States since 2009, pointed to a fleet-wide problem in the Boeing 737-700. Southwest crews were inspecting similar engines the airline had in service, focusing on the 400 to 600 oldest of the CFM56 engines, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It was the second time this kind of engine had failed on a Southwest jet in the past two years, prompting airlines around the world to step up inspections.A NTSB inspection crew was also combing over the Boeing (N:BA) 737-700 for signs of what caused the engine to explode.Sumwalt said the fan blade, after suffering metal fatigue where it attached to the engine hub, has a second fracture about halfway along its length. Pieces of the plane were found in rural Pennsylvania by investigators who tracked them on radar. The metal fatigue would not have been observable by looking at the engine from the outside, Sumwalt said.Passengers described scenes of panic as a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a plane window, almost sucking Riordan out. Riordan was a  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company said.Videos posted on social media showed passengers grabbing for oxygen masks and screaming as the plane, piloted by Tammie Jo Shults, a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, prepared for the descent into Philadelphia.The airline expected to wrap up its inspection of the engines it was targeting in about 30 days.The GE-Safran partnership that built the engine said it was sending about 40 technicians to help with Southwest's inspections.Pieces of the engine including its cowling - which covers its inner workings - were found about 60 miles (100 km) from Philadelphia airport, Sumwalt said. The investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the FAA to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed.(editing by David Stamp)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

During the incident, he logged on to the plane's in-flight WiFi service to send messages to his family.""I thought, these are my last few moments on Earth and I want people to know what happened,"" said Martinez, who live-streamed the plane's descent into Philadelphia on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Southwest Airlines experienced an unrelated safety incident early on Wednesday when a Phoenix-bound flight was forced to land at Nashville airport shortly after takeoff because of bird strike.The airline said it would inspect the fan blades of CFM56 engines on all of its 737 jets within 30 days. Minimal flight disruptions may result, it said.NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said on Tuesday at the Philadelphia airport that a preliminary investigation found an engine fan blade missing, having apparently broken off, and that there was metal fatigue at the point where it would normally be attached. Pieces of the engine including its cowling - the smooth metal exterior that covers its inner workings - were found about 60 miles (97 km) away from Philadelphia airport, Sumwalt said.Sumwalt said the investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. NTSB officials said they would next brief the media on their investigation at 4:30 p.m. ET (2030 GMT).In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed.Riordan's death was the first in a U.S. commercial aviation accident since 2009, according to NTSB statistics.Riordan was a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to a Wells Fargo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

135,"Apr 18, 2018 05:23AM ET",Airlines inspecting Boeing 737 engines after fatal Southwest incident,nan,"By Jamie FreedSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some major customers of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's popular 737 jets including Korean Air Lines Co Ltd said on Wednesday they were inspecting engines of the type that blew apart mid-air on a fatal Southwest Airlines Co flight on Tuesday.European regulators this month began requiring an inspection by early next year, and a person familiar with the matter said U.S. regulators were near a similar rule, which affects a number of 737s in operation globally.Southwest Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday after an engine ripped apart mid-air, shattering a window on the 737 and nearly sucking a passenger through. One of 144 passengers died.The actions by regulators show that there has been some concern, albeit non-urgent, about the engine, a workhorse of the global civil aviation fleet that has logged more than 350 million hours of safe travel but was also being examined after a 2016 accident.The CFM56-7B engine type involved in the Southwest incident was produced by a joint venture of U.S. firm  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA called CFM International. It is one of the most common engines, paired with the world's most-sold plane, the Boeing 737. Southwest said it is speeding up inspections of all related engines out of extra caution, which it expects to complete within 30 days.An early review of the failed Southwest engine found apparent metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters on Tuesday.""We are very concerned"" about metal fatigue, Sumwalt said. ""There needs to be proper inspection mechanisms in place to check for this before there's a catastrophic event.""Korean Air said on Wednesday it had not yet been prompted by its regulators for a check but it planned to inspect engines used on its entire 737 fleet by November following the Southwest incident.About 20 percent to 30 percent of its 35 Boeing 737 jets use the same type of fan blade as the one on the Southwest jet, a Korean Air official said.A Japan Airlines Co Ltd spokesman said two 737 jets in its fleet had engines with affected fan blades and inspections were due to be completed by the end of the day on Wednesday.In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine, and debris ripped a foot-long hole above the left wing. Investigators found signs of metal fatigue.The 2016 incident prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to propose ultrasonic inspections of similar fan blades and their replacement should they fail the test. Sumwalt said the NTSB will review whether the engines involved in Tuesday's incident might have been subject to the directive, which is not yet finalised.The FAA proposal estimated that checks would require two hours of labor per inspection.Not all airlines operating 737s are affected.Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd, a large 737 operator, said its engines were of a slightly different model than those targeted for inspection.Spokespeople for several other major airlines operating 737s could not be reached immediately for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

136,"Apr 11, 2018 10:30AM ET",Bombardier delivered five CSeries in first quarter as delays ease: sources,nan,"By Allison Lampert and Victoria BryanMONTREAL/BERLIN (Reuters) - Canadian planemaker Bombardier delivered five CSeries jets in the first quarter and is making progress in tackling delays separate from previously disclosed engine hold-ups in producing its flagship CSeries jets, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The delivery data and comments from executives on progress come as Bombardier nears regulatory approval for its planned sale of the delayed CSeries program to Europe's Airbus.But the Montreal-based company could still face snags in coming months after delivering 17 CSeries in 2017, down from an initial target of 30 - a delay the plane-and-train maker has previously attributed to delays at engine supplier Pratt & Whitney.Bombardier has not publicly discussed separate delays stemming from general challenges as workers learn to make the 110-to-130 seat jet more efficiently.These include ""quality issues"" at French interiors and seat maker Zodiac Aerospace, three sources familiar with the matter said, echoing similar problems affecting other planemakers.It is not clear when Bombardier experienced these delays, but it delivered four planes in March, up from one during the first two months of the first quarter, one of the sources said. Another said there had been no new Zodiac delays.All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of commercial sensitivities.""It is well known across the industry that Zodiac is currently experiencing some production delays,"" Rob Dewar, vice president of Bombardier's CSeries program, told Reuters in a statement.""We are collaborating closely with their team, and we are making great progress, as reflected in our production rate of four aircraft last month,"" he added.Zodiac, recently acquired by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, is emerging from a three-year manufacturing crisis that drew criticism from planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).""We are very happy with the CSeries that are already flying with Swiss,"" Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Germany's Lufthansa Group, the parent company of CSeries launch customer Swiss International Air Lines. ""What we are not so happy about are the continuing delays to deliveries. The reason is not the engines but other difficulties at Bombardier,"" Spohr told Reuters.He declined to specify the reasons. Bombardier has not changed its target to deliver 40 CSeries in 2018. It is expected to make first-quarter delivery data public in May. Investors closely watch figures on aircraft orders and deliveries to help them accurately estimate revenues since airlines make the bulk of payments when planes are delivered. Investors in Europe are also monitoring Zodiac's recovery as France's Safran prepares to dive into its operations after repeated profit warnings by the seat maker.Safran, which recently completed its Zodiac purchase, declined to comment on whether Bombardier had suffered delays.The CSeries is itself at a crossroads as Airbus is poised to take a majority stake in the jetliner program, likely ahead of the aviation industry's flagship Farnborough Airshow in July.Bombardier executives are counting on Airbus to cut CSeries supply chain costs and boost production volumes through higher sales by using its procurement and marketing muscle.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

141,"Mar 23, 2018 11:03PM ET",Globalists buck U.S. index fund trend,nan,"By Trevor HunnicuttNEW YORK (Reuters) - Volatility in U.S. equity markets this year is pushing investors not only to invest in stocks abroad, but also to commit their money to an even more foreign place: the hands of stockpickers rather than index funds.A near decade of gains in U.S. stock prices has left investors on edge about the prospect that anything could end the party, including the prospect of interest rate rises under new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or a misstep by one of the market's darlings. For instance, the 9.2 percent two-day slide of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) earlier this week, which wiped out $50 billion in its market capitalization, underscored the risks to market leaders in the technology sector after the social media company faced questions from regulators and politicians about how its users' personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump's presidential campaign.Josh Shores, principal at Southeastern Asset Management Inc, said the time is ripe to look outside the United States as valuations are more attractive overseas relative to their risks.""At the end of an almost 10-year bull up-cycle where the U.S, and growth and passive have really dominated,"" he said, ""we feel good about being positioned the other way from here.""Small wonder. Stockpickers focused on investment abroad have been huge beneficiaries of new investor cash as many have beaten their benchmarks. Those funds are on course to post their second straight year of inflows even as their U.S. counterparts face the sting of investor flight to lower-cost index funds. Actively managed non-U.S. stock funds have already attracted $19.4 billion in 2018, far surpassing outflows at the same time last year, and nearing the $23.5 billion total for all of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. Their passively managed rivals have taken in $45.6 billion so far this year, through February.In 2017, 50.8 percent of ""foreign large blend"" funds tracked by Morningstar Inc beat their index-tracking rivals, while 59.1 percent of diversified emerging market funds succeeded, in both cases improving their less impressive long-term track record.The volatile start to 2018 for U.S. stock prices is giving investors all the more reason to defang portfolios heavily weighted toward technology giants. Facebook accounts for about 2.0 percent of an S&P 500 index (SPX) fund's return. ""Tech is not a heavy benchmark constituent in our part of the world,"" said Thomas Melendez, manager of the $11 billion MFS International Diversification Fund (O:MDIDX), whose performance has bested most rivals over the last decade, according to Lipper.'IT'S MORE THAN FACEBOOK'More cash to manage would be a boon to investors including Fabio Paolini, a portfolio manager on the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund (O:APCTX), which has turned in stronger performance than its peers and index over the past three years. Pictet Asset Management SA manages $197 billion.Paolini and other investors focused outside the United States see places where they can put the cash to work with bargain-priced, all-weather companies that will grow even if the economy stalls.""We see opportunities - a little bit everywhere,"" said Paolini. The company took a stake, for instance, in  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), the Parisian aircraft engine company that he said enjoys a near-monopoly position in its market.Southeastern, with $18 billion under management, has built up a stake in London-based  Hikma Pharmaceuticals  PLC (L:HIK) in recent months, as other asset managers have ditched stocks in the region.That stock's true value has been clouded by investors' pessimistic view on both generic drugs and the United Kingdom's negotiations to exit the European Union, but the drug company has valuable business units including injectable drugs, said Shores. More than four in ten fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are holding less stock in Britain than their benchmark, an all-time high.Many of the active international funds are taking big bets on small groups of stocks, hoping that they will end up with far better gains than index funds whose performance is diluted by hundreds of holdings.The  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Jennison Global Opportunities Fund (O:PRJAX) has fewer than 40 holdings, with top positions like Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) taking up nearly 6.0 percent of the portfolio.One of the portfolio managers, Thomas Davis, said he has high conviction in the Chinese technology giant's prospects. The company on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue that fell short of estimates but its profits were up 98 percent compared to the year prior.""You have Facebook, Opentable, Uber, Airbnb, some basic financial services all embedded within the Tencent WeChat app,"" said Davis, noting that the company offers many functions in one place.""It's more than Facebook.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"Mar 09, 2018 12:41AM ET",Exclusive: Boeing has 'cash horsepower' for targeted acquisitions - CEO,nan,"By Tim HepherCHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Thursday the U.S. planemaker can absorb transactions on the scale of a proposed tie-up with Brazil's Embraer without putting at risk internal investments in its business or returning cash to shareholders.Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was ""making progress"" in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion.""Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,"" Muilenburg said.""We have plenty of cash horsepower to do all three things: invest organically, return to shareholders and then make these targeted acquisitions,"" he added.Boeing is targeting operating cashflow of $15 billion and combined research & development and capital expenditure of $5.9 billion this year. It has pledged to return 100 percent of free cashflow to shareholders.Brazilian President Michel Temer is weighing a proposal for the two companies to forge a commercial aviation venture, his office said last week, after the government opposed an outright takeover of Embraer which also builds military aircraft.""We are not done yet; there is still work to go. But we are making progress so I am hopeful that we can complete it,"" Muilenburg said, reiterating the deal was not a ""must"" for Boeing.""We continue to evaluate all parts of the enterprise, different potential ownership structures"" that range from support to full ownership, he said.Boeing shares closed up 0.5 percent at $348.73.Asked whether such overseas tie-ups were more difficult with rising protectionist sentiment, Muilenburg said Boeing would not let up on its global expansion which, if done strategically, would increase jobs in the United States and abroad.OPEN TRADESpeaking in his 36th-floor Chicago office with views across to Lake Michigan, Muilenburg declined to be drawn on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs just prior to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement about them on Thursday.He reiterated his longstanding general support for open trade. ""Our position is we want free and open trade, good solid global trade is good for our business and we are going to be strong proponents of that,"" he said.Muilenburg downplayed concerns of a backlash from China, which has ordered thousands of jets. Boeing plans to open a new aircraft completion plant in China.""You see some tough rhetoric but when I look below the surface, and having talked with both President Trump and President Xi (Jinping), I think there is a true desire to have a productive trade relationship between the two countries,"" he said.Muilenburg said Boeing had not decided whether to appeal after losing a price dumping case against Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) but would sue again if provoked to do so again.He said Boeing was in ""no rush"" to decide whether to launch a new mid-market jetliner, which could enter service in 2024-25.""It is a decision we will probably get to over the next year or so,"" he said. The jet is expected to pioneer an advanced production system for Boeing, which is already building on record output of its smaller 737s, Muilenburg said, noting that suppliers are keeping up with demand.Asked about engine makers, most of which have faced technical or management problems in recent years, Muilenburg said: ""It is certainly something we are keeping an eye on. I will say that despite some of the challenges you have seen out there, our engine partners have been doing well on our commercial programs.""Boeing's biggest supplier,  General Electric  Co (N:GE), is undergoing a corporate makeover after heavy losses, but it is delivering engines on time for the 737 MAX through its CFM venture with  Safran  (PA:SAF) of France, Muilenburg said. Airbus has voiced concern about delays in similar CFM engines.GE, whose stock was the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last year as Boeing led the index higher, is coping well with the development of a new engine for the 777X jet, he said.""While it is an area to watch, I feel comfortable with where we are at,"" Muilenburg said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

145,"Mar 06, 2018 10:01AM ET",Aero engine maker Safran planning for worst-case cliff-edge Brexit,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - French aeronautics supplier  Safran  is contingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit that disrupts cross-border supply chains and could lead to divergence in British and European Union regulations, a senior company director said on Tuesday.Marie de Saint-Cheron, Safran's (PA:SAF) director for European Affairs, said she considered the proposed transition too short a period to negotiate new treaties and added that a hard Brexit, whereby World Trade Organisation rules apply, could not be ruled out.""It's a scenario we are preparing ... hoping that what we get is not as severe,"" Saint-Cheron told a panel discussion, sat beside a British official from the Department for Exiting the EU.British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday said Britain will not join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, worrying businesses such as Safran, whose British activities include the production of landing and transmission systems for jets.May also said Britain would explore how it could remain a member of a handful of specialist institutions like the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Safran's LEAP engine, made in a joint venture with GE Aviation (N:GE), powers all Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.Saint-Cheron described regulatory divergence as the ""key risk"", despite May's attempts to reassure concerns felt in the aviation industry.""What we worry about is that after the transition period ... regulatory divergence begins. And in that case it will be very difficult for us to work together,"" she said.Saint-Cheron said Safran did not envisage for now moving any of its subsidiaries out of Britain. In the event of a hard Brexit, she added, Safran would likely start by repatriating operations that do not require heavy investments, such as its maintenance operations.Aviation industry players are pressing May for more certainty over the way borders will work.Under a 1980 agreement among 32 members of the WTO, civil aerospace parts are not subject to duties. But the aerospace industry is concerned that extra paperwork caused by new customs borders may introduce expensive delays.Chris Hobley, director for market access at Britain's Department for Exiting the EU, said London wanted a ""strong, deep and ambitious"" relationship with the EU.He also reiterated May's pledge of a ""strong commitment"" to regulatory standards that remain as high as those of the EU.Airbus (PA:AIR), which manufactures its wings in Britain, said last week it might have to stockpile parts to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the EU. Saint-Cheron said customs data shows Safran makes some 70,000 France-to-Britain cross-border operations annually. ""We're thinking about putting people in place, and an IT system, to manage customs clearing,"" Saint Cheron told Reuters after the event. ""One or two additional days (at the border) will be costly so we're trying to put in place a system which would be smooth enough to avoid such delays in the supply chain.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

150,"Feb 15, 2018 04:39AM ET",Fresh A400M charge clouds strong Airbus 2017 profits,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus took a 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) hit on its delayed A400M military transport plane, lifting charges on Europe's troubled defense project above 8 billion euros and clouding higher than expected underlying profits and cash.Shares in Europe's largest aerospace group gained 9.2 percent, touching a two-week high, as Airbus lowered costs on its new A350 jet and confirmed it was looking at raising output of the best-selling A320 model by 17 percent to 70 a month amid strong demand.But it called on its engine makers to get to grips with delays that have disrupted deliveries of the upgraded A320neo and said its target of 800 total deliveries this year would depend on the performance of these suppliers.""We have plenty of challenges going forward, but it is manageable,"" Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday.Airbus posted an 8 percent increase in adjusted 2017 operating profit of 4.253 billion euros on flat revenues of 66.767 billion euros and predicted a 20 percent rise in the widely watched core profit item.Analysts were on average expecting adjusted 2017 operating profits of 3.996 billion euros and revenues of 67.343 billion.The company lifted its dividend by 11 percent.""Our caution on FY18 EBIT appears unfounded,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, keeping the bank's ""hold"" rating on the stock. ""At Airbus Commercial, things simply seem to have clicked into place."" Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Phil Buller wrote: ""The most important item for us and many others is cash and this beat expectations by around 700 million euros or 34 percent in Q4. Barclays rates Airbus ""overweight"". The A400M charge comes after Airbus last week reached a provisional agreement with seven European NATO buyer nations over further delays for the new troop carrier..""This certainly ain't pretty but we are making good progress overall,"" Enders told analysts, adding the deal would significantly reduce remaining risks.Airbus also took a 117 million euro fourth-quarter charge following a settlement with German prosecutors over a corruption case linked to a fighter sale to Austria in 2003. The charge includes 35 million euros of ongoing legal costs.ENGINE DELAYS On the commercial side, Airbus is in the midst of a switchover to an upgraded A320, but has been beset by delays in engine supplies mainly from Pratt & Whitney as well as some delays at engine maker CFM International.The company said it was still looking at the impact of a fresh round of problems with Pratt engines that saw some jets grounded and certain deliveries halted this week.Enders said he had been in touch directly with the heads of  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), the owners of CFM which has reported delays of several weeks in engine deliveries.The planemaker, which competes with Boeing (NYSE:BA), reported ""good progress"" on production of the new A350 wide-body jet and reiterated plans to reach output of 10 a month by end-year.In a respite from recent compliance rows, Airbus said it had reached agreement with European credit agencies allowing it to apply for export credits on a case by case basis. The funding was suspended in 2016 when Airbus acknowledged having made misleading applications, triggering a corruption investigation.However, it also raised the prospect for the first time that the United States could be drawn into the Anglo-French probe, saying it had been asked to supply information to U.S. authorities about conduct under their jurisdiction.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

152,"Feb 14, 2018 10:54AM ET",U.S. regulator warns about Pratt engine shutdown risk on Airbus jets,nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) - New engines made by Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) for the latest Airbus (PA:AIR) single-aisle jetliner, the A320neo, pose a potential shutdown risk, the U.S. aviation regulator said on Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Administration's formal warning follows a similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9, and cites a ""knife edge seal fracture"" in the engine that could lead to an engine stall ""and consequent inflight shutdown and rejected takeoffs,"" the FAA said in an airworthiness directive.The warnings mark the latest in a string of issues that have clouded the rollout of Pratt's new engines, which compete with market-leader CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France. A total of 98 engines could be affected, with 43 confirmed to have the problem and the rest possibly affected, Pratt said. The company declined to comment further.Pratt has not halted production or delivery of the engines, and the Connecticut-based company plans to submit a proposal to European regulators on Friday detailing how to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with the situation. It wasn't clear how quickly the European Aviation Safety Agency could approve the plan.The problem affects only PW-1100 series engines, not similar Pratt engines for Bombardier, Embraer or Mitsubishi jets, the source said.

It is in the midst of increasing output and last week said it may speed up further.A prolonged delay could have a financial impact for the planemaker, as it waits for payments that usually fall due on delivery, and for leasing companies, who start receiving rent on aircraft allotted to airlines as soon as they enter service.""It is too early to determine financial implications, but the fact that it impacts a limited population of engines is a potentially mitigating factor,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell said before the delivery freeze emerged.""Still, this will put GTF (geared turbofan) execution issues back in the spotlight after a smooth few months when news flow was mostly focused on solid orders and ramping production.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

155,"Jan 25, 2018 01:20PM ET",CFM says LEAP engine output four-five weeks behind schedule,nan,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - CFM International is 4-5 weeks behind schedule in producing its new LEAP jet engine for Airbus and Boeing jets, but remains confident about ramping up output this year.Company executives said it was also handling queries from planemakers about potential further increases in demand.The engine maker, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), aims to produce 1,100-1,200 of the fuel-saving engines in 2018 after delivering 459 last year, executives said on a media conference call on Thursday.CFM, which supplies all engines for the Boeing (N:BA) 737 and competes with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to power the Airbus A320neo, is in the midst of a product changeover while handling higher than expected demand for the older CFM56.The Cincinnati-based venture is working to catch up on production, but is meanwhile having to address teething issues with the version of the LEAP-1A engine developed for Airbus.CFM is about half way through overhauling some 70 LEAP-1A engines after quality problems with a turbine disc, announced by Safran last July, executive vice-president Allen Paxson said.The problem is different from one that disrupted flight tests of the Boeing 737 MAX last year, but the part of the engine involved includes some of the same suppliers, he added.A further problem with the coating used on a part inside the Airbus version has triggered efforts to allow the engines to stay on the wing for longer before they need to be maintained.Deliveries of the competing Airbus A320neo family have been delayed mainly by technical problems with the Geared Turbofan engine from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (N:UTX), but also by industrial issues at CFM, Airbus says.CFM had earlier targeted 1,200 deliveries this year, but executives said it was not toning down its assessment of production capabilities or the state of its huge supply chain.As LEAP engine production cranks up and airlines respond to an unexpectedly strong rise in traffic numbers, CFM has been responding to higher demand for current-generation engines.Planemakers have meanwhile begun sounding out CFM about pushing single-aisle aircraft production plans higher, beyond their targeted levels of up to 60 aircraft a month each for Airbus and Boeing by 2019.""We are answering requests of the airframers for information about our ability to support possible higher rates.

The scandal around French arms sales to the island in the early 1990s was one of a series of cases that underpinned accusations of widespread corruption during the final years of late French president Francois Mitterrand.Airbus said in a statement that its subsidiary behind the missile contract, Matra Defense, was ""reviewing the award before evaluating the next steps to take"".The arbitration fine comes three months after Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), radar supplier  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) said they had been fined a combined 227 million euros ($276.80 million) in Taiwan to settle the 25-year-old dispute over the wrongful use of commissions in the sale of 60 Mirage fighters to the island.""This was a commercial dispute and not a corruption allegation,"" said an Airbus spokesman.In a separate case, Airbus said it was in talks with Munich prosecutors that could lead to the termination of their investigation into alleged corruption in the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003.That investigation is one of several corruption cases still facing Europe's largest aerospace company. Airbus did not mention the status of a parallel Austrian investigation into the same arms deal.The company and individuals including CEO Tom Enders are being investigated in Vienna over industrial deals that were built into the Eurofighter sale and have denied any wrongdoing.Separately, Airbus faces UK and French investigations into the use of middlemen in commercial airliner sales.($1 = 0.8201 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is therefore crucial that EASA has received the mandate to put in place the safety regulatory framework for the deployment of this new technology,"" the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's meeting.Members include plane manufacturer Airbus,  Safran  (PA:SAF), BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR).Member states had opposed a registration requirement for drones throughout the negotiations, and the European Parliament had initially pushed for a registration threshold of 250 grams.Many countries fear the 80 joules threshold is too complicated and are not happy with the compromise.""I don't think there is one happy member state around the table,"" said one person involved in the discussions.The German pilots union wrote to the German transport minister on Tuesday urging him to endorse the EASA deal.

They dragged Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) down 0.2 percent, while euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) fell 0.1 percent. ""It's really the Fed driving the movement today. It was a pretty dovish rate hike and wasn't voted through unanimously,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.""Bond yields all dropped on the back of it, which is bad for banks.""HSBC (L:HSBA), Santander (MC:SAN),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) were the biggest drags to the STOXX. The weakness in financials put the brakes on a developing shift in investors' preferences from tech stocks into sectors more likely to benefit from rising rates.

168,"Nov 08, 2017 06:01AM ET",Airbus knew of software vulnerability before A400M crash,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS/SEVILLE (Reuters) - Airbus and European safety authorities were warned in late 2014 of a software vulnerability in the A400M military plane that was similar to a weakness that contributed to a fatal crash seven months later, Spanish investigators have found. The Airbus-built cargo and troop carrier crashed near Seville during a test flight in May 2015, killing four of the six crew, after three out of four engines froze minutes after take-off.Data needed to run the engines had been accidentally erased when Airbus workers installed software on the ground, and pilots had no warning there was a problem until the engines failed, Reuters reported weeks after the disaster, citing several sources with knowledge of the matter. A confidential report by Spanish military investigators into the crash, completed this summer, sheds new light on poor coordination and misjudgments that have dogged Europe's biggest military project.The findings confirmed the engines were compromised by data being wiped, according to extracts of the report seen by Reuters and three people familiar with the inquiry.The report also said the engine-makers had warned Airbus and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in October 2014 that software installation errors could lead to a loss of engine data, and that technicians may not receive any warning before take-off that a problem had occurred.When contacted by Reuters, Airbus said the crash was the result of ""multiple, different factors and contributory causes"", but declined detailed comment about the investigators' findings because they are not public.The planemaker has since reviewed all systems and acted to ""ensure the chain of identified causes could not happen ever again"", a spokesman added. EASA declined to comment.The engine-makers Europrop International (EPI), a pan-European consortium owned by Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), Germany's MTU (DE:MTXGn) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), declined to comment.Spain's defense ministry, whose air accident agency conducted the investigation, also declined to comment.The crash is seen by some safety experts as an example of how failures - though rare - can occur in increasingly complex aircraft systems when several apparently minor weaknesses line up together to produce a serious risk. DISAGREEMENTThe A400M was developed for Spain, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Turkey and has been beset by delays and cost overruns which have taken it well beyond the original budget of 20 billion euros ($23 billion). The A400M faced flight restrictions immediately following the crash but France's air force has since praised its performance in operations against Islamist militants in Africa's Sahel region, and it has also been used by France, Germany and Britain in hurricane relief efforts in the Caribbean.The findings of the investigators show a rift between Airbus and its engine suppliers, at a time when the planemaker is negotiating a new delivery schedule with European governments and expects further writedowns on the A400M project this year.Airbus and EPI disagree on who was responsible for installing the engine software, according to the investigators. The software was installed by Airbus workers using the planemaker's systems, but EPI says it should have been loaded by its own staff and using EPI systems, the report said. EPI argued that it had authority over the software installation under civil rules, according to the report, which sheds light on regulatory confusion at the time of the accident about civil and military jurisdiction over the aircraft. The A400M is a rare hybrid: a military plane with European civil certification. Airbus argues it was right to install the software itself because it had authority under military rules, but says the design did not meet its specifications - a claim denied by EPI, according to the three people familiar with the inquiry, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Spanish officials have backed Airbus, saying the assembly line is a defense facility and not subject to civil rules. RISK ANALYSISThe potential problems flagged to Airbus by the engine-makers in October 2014 involved the possibility of human error in the installation process, according to the investigators. The problem that actually occurred before the crash was of a technical nature, they added. The data for three engines was wiped when the software installation initially failed, and those files were never restored in the subsequent uploading process.The investigators said the response to the 2014 warning from the engine-makers was inadequate. ""The mitigation measures derived from that (problem) report were not sufficient,"" they said in their findings. The warning should have led to a fuller risk analysis of the installation process, they added.Once the plane was airborne, the fatal chain of events accelerated.Unable to understand how to run the engines because of missing data, the plane froze the power at maximum, priming the huge transporter to go higher and faster, according to the three sources familiar with the inquiry.But controllers ordered the crew to stay at 1,500 feet. Trying to obey, the crew reduced thrust, unaware that the faulty engines could only offer all or nothing, the sources said. The engines were then locked at idle, leaving only one working. Seconds later, the plane plunged into a field.Even though technical odds were against them, some experts have questioned how the pilots responded, saying that when an engine problem occurred they could have ignored controllers and climbed to safer levels before adjusting power.Investigators found the pilots had not been trained to expect this scenario and that the A400M's troubleshooting system did not help them. Airbus said the pilots were qualified and highly experienced. ($1 = 0.8649 euros)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

171,"Oct 23, 2017 01:40PM ET",Tensions ease over Pratt engine supplies to Airbus: sources,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is more confident in the ability of Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to speed up delayed engine shipments, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday, in a sign that supply-chain gridlock affecting European aircraft deliveries may soon reach its peak.Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in July that Pratt & Whitney's performance was ""unsatisfactory"" but a person familiar with the situation said on Monday the company had seen evidence the engine maker was overcoming its technical difficulties.""The level of confidence is improving,"" a person close to Airbus said.Airbus declined comment ahead of Oct. 31 earnings.Its shares closed up 0.8 percent.Pratt & Whitney declined comment.Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine is one of two types of powerplant offered on the A320neo and its fuel-saving performance is tied to the sale of more than 5,000 Airbus jets. A trio of technical problems has left over two dozen semi-completed jetliners parked without engines in Toulouse, driving Airbus profits down sharply at mid-year. Pratt & Whitney has fixed two of the problems - concerning fan blades and an oil seal - and may report progress on a third one related to the combustion chamber on Tuesday when its parent reports quarterly earnings, industry sources said. Airbus planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier said last week he expected engines with redesigned parts and a full service life to be delivered from end-year. He said Airbus's 2017 target of 200 A320neo deliveries was reachable but tough. Any breakthrough would not come in time to help Airbus's third-quarter earnings, however. Total Airbus deliveries fell 1.7 percent in the first nine months but those of single-aisle aircraft like the A320neo, which generate most Airbus profit and cash, fell 7.9 percent. ""We expect a weak third-quarter update with slow progress on the A320neo the key driver,"" Berenberg analysts said. Pratt & Whitney has repeatedly reaffirmed its target to build 350-400 engines this year. But within that total, more engines than expected have been diverted from airplane production to a pool of spares for airlines needing to swap engines for premature checks. The problem has been especially severe in India. Airlines can also choose engines from CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF). Airbus can alter the mix of aircraft powered by each type of engine on its production line, but needs four months' notice to decide which engines go on which airframe, meaning it has been left with aircraft for Pratt & Whitney customers but no engines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

172,"Oct 19, 2017 05:33AM ET",Airbus A330neo takes off on maiden flight,nan,"By Tim HepherTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Thursday began the maiden flight of its A330neo jetliner, an upgraded version of its profitable A330 line designed to sharpen competition with the latest version of Boeing's (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner.The wide-bodied, long-distance jet took off from the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters under overcast skies, watched by top executives from Airbus and Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), which supplies the engines.In service since the 1990s, the A330 family is Airbus's biggest-selling wide-body jet but the arrival of Boeing's composite-body Dreamliner has eroded that advantage.Airbus hopes the A330neo's refreshed design will help it defend its position in the lucrative 250-300 seat market. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus had decided to improve the plane's maximum take-off weight by around 4 percent to 251 tonnes so the A330neo can serve longer routes such as Kuala Lumpur to London.Separately, Bregier said the company still expected to deliver around 200 A320neo aircraft in 2017, but added that reaching the target would be tough in the wake of delayed engine deliveries.Bregier said Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), whose industrial problems have delayed deliveries of jets at Airbus plants, was testing re-designed parts for its engines and expected to start delivering the modified version at the end of this year.The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney’s new Geared Turbofan engine. CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), is also supplying engines for the A320neo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

173,"Oct 11, 2017 03:26PM ET",Dassault CEO not yet considering alternative engine suppliers,nan,"By Allison LampertLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) Chief Executive Eric Trappier said he wants to hear how aerospace group Safran SA (PA:SAF) will tackle engine development issues that have delayed the French planemaker's latest business jet before considering alternative suppliers.""For the moment we are waiting to see whether Safran are able to tell us how they will try to minimize the impact,” he told Reuters.Dassault is keeping its options open for the new long-range Falcon 5X business jet, Trappier said on the sidelines of a company event in Las Vegas during the National Business Aviation Association's (NBAA) flagship gathering this week. Safran was not immediately available for comment.Earlier this week, Trappier said that the business jet, which had already been delayed to 2020, would have to be postponed again, after Safran informed Dassault of performance issues with the high-pressure compressor.Trappier said Dassault has an execution contract with Safran over the new Silvercrest engine used to power the long-range jets, but he declined to say whether the French planemaker would receive compensation for the delays because such talks are confidential.Trappier also said he viewed the possibility of selling Dassault's Rafale fighter jets to the Canadian government as an opportunity for ""strong cooperation"" between Canada and France. The Rafale could be partly built in Canada, he said.Earlier this year, Canada froze talks on the planned purchase of 18 F-18 Super Hornet jets from Boeing Co (N:BA) for more than $5 billion, after the company launched a trade challenge accusing Montreal-based Bombardier Inc (TO:BBDb) of dumping its new CSeries airliners into the U.S. market.Canada needs the 18 jets to act as a stopgap measure until it is able run an open competition to replace its veteran CF-18 fighters, a process that could take five years. The CF-18 is the Canadian version of the F-18 Hornet, a design that is 40 years old.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

174,"Oct 03, 2017 11:30AM ET",Safran hopes new fuel-efficient jet engine can reshape air travel,nan,"By Tim HepherISTRES, France (Reuters) - French aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) unveiled a new engine prototype on Tuesday that would radically cut fuel consumption, potentially reshaping air travel from 2030.The Open Rotor engine, which places previously hidden whirring parts on the outside to capture more air, was developed with European Union backing and is being tested in specially built facilities at a French military base near Marseille.Shaped like an elongated egg with two rows of blades at the back, the engine aims to burn 15 percent less fuel than current conventional turbofan engines, which have also improved significantly in recent years.Clara de la Torre, a top European Union research official, said the new type of engine could help airlines cut air fares because it requires less fuel.Whether the engine enters service, however, depends on the strategies of airplane makers such as Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), whose best-selling single-aisle planes are expected to be renewed in around 2030.Such engines would most likely be placed at the back of the airplane instead of under the wing, leaving room for the two rows of scimitar-shaped carbon blades to swirl in opposite directions. It is not the first time engine makers have looked at revisiting the design of the traditional jet engine. U.S. engine makers looked at so-called unducted fans in the1980s before dropping the idea when oil prices fell. At the time, such engines were also considered too noisy. But the completely fresh design could become attractive as energy costs rise and regulations require fewer emissions, said Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin. ""If we want to be ready in 2030 we have to start now,"" he told reporters. ""If oil prices return above $100 I think there will be much stronger interest.""SHORTER-TERM SOLUTION Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) has also looked at the technology. One of the unknowns is the reaction of passengers to seeing a double row of fast-spinning blades, rather than an engine whose moving parts are concealed. ""It is a question to which we don't yet know the answer,"" Petitcolin said. Regulators would also have to work out how to certify the engine, using existing rules for failed parts and bird strikes. Safran is also looking at a shorter-term solution to cutting emissions and fuel consumption based on traditional engine architecture. Its ""Ultra-High Bypass Ratio"" engine would cut fuel consumption by 5-10 percent and would be ready for service by 2025. That could coincide with Boeing's tentative plans to produce a new mid-market jet in the middle of the next decade. Any decision to offer either engine to planemakers would be made through CFM International, Safran's joint venture with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). Beyond these ideas, Safran and others are already thinking about bolder schemes, such as hybrid electric technology and distributed power, which could usher in futuristic plane designs from 2040. ""Instead of one engine, there could be 10 or 20,"" said Safran's research chief Stephane Cueille.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

175,"Sep 28, 2017 04:00AM ET",China's COMAC says C919 jet completed second test flight,nan,"By Brenda GohSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's domestically developed C919 passenger jet completed its second test flight on Thursday, the jet's maker said, but the duration and near five-month gap since its first flight have raised questions over whether its latest delivery target can be met.The narrow-body C919, which will compete with Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 and the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320, is a symbol of China's ambition to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.However, the program has faced lengthy delays and missed its original target of delivery to customers by 2016 - a date reportedly pushed back to 2020. Sales to date have been restricted largely to its home market because it has yet to be certified by regulators in the United States and Europe.Thursday's flight was the second for the initial C919 test model, whose maiden flight was on May 5. The second of six planned test aircraft, which achieved power-on of its systems in July, has yet to fly.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet during a flight that took off from Shanghai's Pudong Airport at 07:22 a.m. (2322 GMT) and landed at 10:08 a.m. ""Various elements of the test flight, including with the raising/lowering of the landing gear, were all completed smoothly,"" COMAC said in a statement.The 166-minute flight time was more than double the maiden flight of 80 minutes, but 54 minutes shorter than plans detailed in an article published by state-backed news website ThePaper.cn earlier on Thursday. COMAC did not immediately reply to questions from Reuters on whether the flight was shorter than planned.Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher and reporter at Aviation Week, said the five-month interval between the aircraft's two flights was ""extraordinary"" and COMAC's reported delivery target of 2020 appeared not to be firm.""The conclusion must be that COMAC was not really ready for flight testing in May,"" Perrett said in an article published on Wednesday. ""A common view is that the C919 was put into the air so early for strictly political reasons, although there is no suggestion that doing so was unsafe."" Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Industries Ltd's (T:7011), Mitsubishi Regional Jet - Japan's first passenger aircraft - took its second flight eight days after it first flew in 2015 while the gap between the first and second flight for the Airbus A350 was five days, Perrett said. Strongly backed by China's government, COMAC has so far announced orders for 730 C919 planes from 27 customers, many of which are Chinese leasing companies.Though billed as homemade, the C919 relies on overseas technology from firms including  General Electric  Co (N:GE), France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).COMAC also said its ARJ21 regional jet was in the air at the same time as the C919 on Thursday, marking the first time two types of domestically made passenger jets have taken to China's skies simultaneously.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

176,"Sep 27, 2017 09:00AM ET",Britain's easyJet aims for electric short-haul flights,nan,"By Alistair SmoutLONDON (Reuters) - British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) could be flying electric passenger jets on short-haul routes within a decade in a push to cut plane pollution, the company said on Wednesday.The airline said in March it would partner with U.S. startup Wright Electric to develop electric passenger jets and is aiming for planes with a range of up to 335 miles (540 km), which could fly about 20 percent of easyJet's routes.EasyJet said its support for electric planes was part of a broader strategy to reduce carbon and nitrous oxide emissions in the aviation sector, following the lead taken by the rail and automotive industries.""For the first time, our industry can envisage a future which isn't wholly reliant on jet fuel and its harmful CO2 and NOX emissions,"" CEO Carolyn McCall said in a statement.The airline is already targeting a 10 percent cut in emissions per passenger per kilometer by 2022 by using more fuel-efficient jets, such as the new Airbus A320neo. The airline has two so far and 98 are on order for delivery by August 2022.Fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines and they have been investing in ways to reduce the amount they use, including by buying new aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines.Airlines such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL) have also been researching alternative fuels. Airbus (PA:AIR) has been developing electric planes and flew its two-seater E-Fan across the channel in 2015, but it expects hybrid fuel systems to come in first for commercial jets - until the batteries needed for electric-only planes become lighter.EasyJet also said it was partnering with French company  Safran  (PA:SAF) to trial a zero-emissions taxiing system for its aircraft, while electric tugs will be introduced at Gatwick.Peter Duffy, easyJet's chief commercial officer, told reporters at London's Gatwick airport that new technologies could ""entirely remove the use of carbon fuels and noise from all our airport operations"".British Airways (L:ICAG) said this week it was now using remote-controlled electric tugs to push its short-haul aircraft away from departure gates.Investors and analysts were also focused on an easyJet capital markets day being held at Gatwick. While easyJet was not providing any trading updates, analysts at broker Goodbody said, ""despite this, we still think the market will be pleasantly surprised by details behind the group's ancillary revenue streams and innovation on this front"".One such move to boost revenues is a trial of inflight entertainment, which will be introduced on five aircraft in easyJet's Swiss operations in autumn. Rather than seat-back screens, the system will allow customers to watch TV shows on their own devices, a model used by others including Lufthansa's Eurowings (DE:LHAG). EasyJet said the service would earn the airline extra revenue, despite being free for the customer to use.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

178,"Sep 05, 2017 11:15PM ET","UTC touts $23 billion deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic",nan,"By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE:COL).The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers.  United Tech  shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, ""to protect our interests.""The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing's statement, as analysts factored in United Tech's decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone.The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing's unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts. By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure. United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing's concerns.""The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines,"" Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism. Rockwell's skill with software combined with United Tech's expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new ""digital"" products that airlines want, he said.""We'll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can't do, and that's how you add value to airline customers,"" Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.HAYES ASSURED ENDERSHayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year. United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech.""Pratt has nothing to do with this,"" Hayes said, noting United Tech's aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace.Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal.But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term.""After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we're going to go back and look,"" he said.If the company's share price does not reflect its value, he said, ""we'll need to do something.""United Tech could sell ""non-core pieces"" such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, ""it's hard to make financial sense out of those transactions"" unless they fetch a high price, he said.Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82.""We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus,"" analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note. United Tech's engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review.The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA's pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace. Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal. United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry,"" Boeing said in a statement.The combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft, by dollar value, noted Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, referring to such components as flight controls and air conditioning. Michaels said he does not see the deal facing an issue from a competitive standpoint as there is virtually no overlap in products between the two companies.Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 while United Tech shares fell 5.7 percent to $111.21, in part on the warning from Boeing.There was also a sign that Airbus is preparing to ratchet up pressure behind the scenes. A source close to the European plane maker told Reuters there were concerns about a ""disconnect"" between United Technologies and the leadership of its Pratt & Whitney unit. Another Airbus source said any distraction due to the merger would benefit Pratt & Whitney’s main rival CFM International, co-owned by the U.S. manufacturer  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF).Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned United Tech to focus on delivering jet engines on time.If Boeing or Airbus opts to complain to antitrust enforcers, they can take the complaint to Europe's competition authority and either the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers for compliance with antitrust law.Their strongest argument would be if both companies made one or several parts and had few competitors.""Many initially assumed it would be a slam dunk because of the lack of overlap. But the EU probe may prove to be difficult, simply on the grounds that the combined company would be so big,"" said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners. Boeing could also be concerned about the ""portfolio effect,"" where companies are able to exercise leverage based on the fact that they sell a wide range of specialized products to certain customers.This argument was used to doom GE's plan to buy Honeywell in 2001, although it was European regulators rather than Washington who killed that deal.Boeing or other companies objecting to the deal could complain about a loss of competition. That would be the case if the government proves that either United Tech or Rockwell had plans to expand to compete with the other, said James Tierney, a former Justice Department antitrust expert now at the law firm Orrick.Antitrust enforcers would also be concerned by the reduced number of market players if United Tech and Rockwell were among the few companies that Boeing or Airbus could reach out to resolve technical problems, said Tierney. That concern would be amplified if the Defense Department agreed, said Tierney.Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission review proposed mergers to ensure they are legal under antitrust law. It is unclear which of the agencies would review this deal, antitrust experts said.(This version of the article corrects misstatement by source in 1st sentence to say combined company would have 50 percent of systems content on the Boeing 787, not 50 percent of all content in 4th paragraph. Also, in second sentence of 4th paragraph, corrects to say Michaels does not see a regulatory issue, not that this could be a bigger issue.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

182,"Aug 23, 2017 12:53PM ET",European companies seek help dealing with activist investor threat,nan,"By Clara Denina , Ben Martin and Maiya KeidanLONDON (Reuters) - European companies are being told by their advisers to open up and engage more with existing shareholders to fend off the increasing threat from activist investors, who force strategy changes to push up a target's share price.Activist investors are mostly hedge funds managing tens of billions of dollars of capital. The largest ones are from the U.S. and, having had success in North America and benefiting from a stronger dollar, they are flush with cash and looking for opportunities further afield.According to JP Morgan, activist investors have launched 119 campaigns in Europe in the 12 months to June 2017, compared to 100 a year earlier and 62 five years ago.That has pushed corporate management teams across Europe to ask investment bankers for help preparing defenses in case an activist crops up on their shareholder register.""We have seen a significant increase in calls from clients seeking our advice on how to prepare for when these investors knock on the door, especially after the activists' stakes in Nestle and Clariant-Huntsman became public,"" said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JP Morgan.New York-based fund Corvex is pushing for Swiss chemicals company  Clariant  (S:CLN) to abandon its proposed merger with U.S. peer  Huntsman  (N:HUN). Third Point, led by billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, took a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle (S:NESN) in July and has started calling for an overhaul.Though there are several well-known European activists, such as TCI Fund Management and Cevian, most of the world's largest funds such as Third Point, Elliott Management and ValueAct are American. Their success has crowded the U.S. market.Europe is seen as tempting as financial and political uncertainties have diminished. UK companies are thought to be particularly attractive targets due to corporate governance rules which give shareholders more influence, and the often large number of minority investors.Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton (L:BLT) has spent the past five months trying to fend off demands for a shake-up by Elliot Management. On Tuesday, BHP said it was looking at options to exit its U.S. onshore shale business, conceding to one of Elliott's demands.TACTICSOften activist investors initially engage with target companies quietly, discussing possibly strategy changes with them. Some firms welcome them, as they can help secure wider support from shareholders or insiders for major change. But mostly the funds are seen as a threat, especially when they start publicly calling for changes and criticizing companies who will not adopt their recommendations. ""More companies in Europe feel the need to have a discussion with their advisers on activism - no one wants to fend off an activist attack in the public eye,"" JPM's Cristerna added. Bankers said they advise clients to engage with existing shareholders to potentially dissuade them from supporting an activist attack. They also look at companies' assets and advise them if any could be sold to improve shareholder returns.These pre-emptive moves might explain why the success rate of activist campaigns in Europe has been falling since 2014. According to data from industry tracker Activist Insight in 2017 just 32.8 percent of campaigns have been ""at least partially successful"", compared to 43.2 percent in 2016.Among those that emerged as clear victors this year in Europe is Nordic hedge fund Accendo Capital Managers, which became the largest shareholder in fiber optic manufacturer Hexatronic Group (ST:HTRO) and whose stock has risen almost 80 percent since the initial investment. Others have achieved a more complicated victory, such as British hedge fund TCI, which became embroiled in aero engine maker Safran's (PA:SAF) offer for  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC). ""We got most of what we asked for,"" TCI partner Jonathan Amouyal told Reuters in May after  Safran  cut its offer. At the same time, TCI has yet to make any tangible impact at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) where it is pushing for change. Volkswagen stock has fallen 2.14 percent since the hedge fund launched its activist campaign.CULTURAL DIFFERENCEU.S. bankers said that as campaigns targeting European firms increase, they are looking to cash in on advisory work.""European institutional investors are less comfortable with the concept of activism from a cultural perspective, particularly when it's a U.S. hedge fund coming over,"" said Chris Young, head of contested situations at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.""In the U.S., activists are often treated like rock stars, they get a lot of favorable press coverage and that's not the case in Europe,"" he added.Citigroup  (N:C) this week announced it had hired Muir Paterson to head the bank's global team of bankers advising companies on activist shareholders.""We had teams in the U.S. dealing with activist issues and we also have now people in Europe, working closely with their U.S. colleagues because more often than not, these activists are the same,"" Severin Brizay, head of EMEA M&A at UBS said.For the funds themselves, this can also bring benefits. Harlan Zimmerman, a senior partner at Anglo-Swedish activist firm Cevian Capital, said some European companies are becoming more willing to engage with activist investors. ""With the proliferation of activism, companies and their advisers have gained a much better understanding of the spectrum of activism and how to engage with activists of all sorts,"" he said. ""There's no longer a stigma from having certain activists involved and on a board. In fact some boards see it as a validation and helpful to realizing their own objectives for the companies.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

185,"Aug 04, 2017 02:10PM ET",Airbus deliveries remain hampered by engine delays,nan,"By Tim HepherTOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus delivered 47 aircraft in July to reach the half-way point in its target for the year, but its narrowbody A320neo family continues to feel the disruption from delays in getting the latest generation of engines from their manufacturers.The European planemaker said on Friday it had delivered 9 of the upgraded medium-haul jetliners in July, bringing total A320neo-family deliveries so far this year to 68, just a third of the full-year target of 200 for that model.Airbus said last week its earnings had been hit by delays in receiving engines for the aircraft type and increased pressure on engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (N:UTX) that has been hampered by a series of glitches.Total Airbus airplane deliveries between January and July reached 353 aircraft, propelled by brisk deliveries of the earlier A320 model, Airbus said in a monthly data release. That compares with a full-year target of around 700.Evidence of the ongoing A320neo engine disruption could be seen on Friday in clusters of undelivered jets jammed into tight spaces around the perimeter of the Toulouse aerodrome where the world's second-largest planemaker has its main factory.Some two dozen aircraft were visible from the roadside, painted in the livery of their airline customers but yet to receive their engines or in some cases wingtip extensions.The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney's new Geared Turbofan engine, but a handful are also waiting for engines from CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF).A Reuters tally of jets parked without engines included six built for India: four for GoAir, a Pratt & Whitney customer, and two for CFM customer Air India. India said on Thursday Pratt & Whitney had promised a solution by September.Others with as yet unpowered jets included Mexico's Volaris.Asked to comment on the number of undelivered jets, an Airbus spokesman said it had delivered many more than at the same point last year, when A320neo output was in early stages, but that it had ""expected to be more advanced"" by mid 2017.""We still target full-year A320neo deliveries to be around 200 but in view of the engine issues, this target becomes more challenging,"" he said.Airbus introduced a caveat into its 2017 forecasts last week, saying its target of more than 700 jetliner deliveries depended on its engine suppliers.Airbus meanwhile said on Friday it had sold four aircraft in July - typically a quiet month in odd-numbered years coming after the Paris Airshow - to reach 252 for the year.That total fell to 205 after cancellations, leaving Airbus behind U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) in this year's order race. Boeing has posted 446 orders through July 25, or 386 when adjusted for cancellations.July's orders included one Airbus A350-1000, a large twin-engined jet due for its first delivery by the end of this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

186,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

188,"Jul 09, 2017 03:40PM ET",'Finance friendly' France scores late points in Brexit bank contest,nan,"By Leigh Thomas, Michel Rose and Gwénaëlle BarzicAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - A government push to make France more ""finance-friendly"" is raising Paris' chances of attracting Brexit-fleeing banks from London although it is raising its game at a late stage in the process, a group of senior financial industry executives said.Eager to keep Frankfurt from getting the bulk of jobs that leave London, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe outlined on Friday plans to ease the financial sector's wage bills and vowed to keep the regulatory burden competitive.Executives at a business conference in southern France this weekend said the election in May of former investment banker Emmanuel Macron had brought a night-and-day change in attitude towards their industry.""The government clearly wants to make France finance-friendly,"" UBS France head Jean Frederic de Leusse said, noting the contrast with Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande, who famously once declared the finance industry to be his enemy.Philippe announced the scrapping of the highest bracket of payroll tax for firms like banks that do not pay VAT, and canceled a planned extension of tax on share trading, both measures unthinkable under Hollande.The new policy will also ensure bankers' bonuses are no longer taken into account when labor courts decide unfair dismissal compensation. Deutsche Asset Management head, Nicolas Moreau, said that while Philippe's package of measures was a step in the right direction, Paris had a lot of catching up to do in the race with other cities trying to win jobs from London.""Today Frankfurt has a big lead, a lot of decisions have already been taken,"" said Moreau.Even though UBS historically has stronger ties to Frankfurt, Leusse said that nothing could be ruled out at this point about where it would decide to put staff.""Right now I don't know what to tell UBS bosses about what is going to change in France, whether things are really going to change,"" Leusse told Reuters in an interview.CATCHING UPDispelling the image of France as a country of high taxes and strict labor laws will be no easy task, however. ""The main blocking point is psychological. That means that our partners will have to be convinced that France is serious about developing its economy and attracting financial services,"" Generali (MI:GASI) France head Eric Lombard told Reuters.Paris is competing not only with Frankfurt but also smaller cites like Amsterdam, Dublin and Luxembourg, each of which is pushing its relative advantages.While Frankfurt is home to the euro zone's single bank supervisor, Amsterdam and Dublin can tout a business culture similar to London's. Luxembourg, for its part, is already a major fund management hub.But only the Paris region is comparable to London in size and boasts a rich cultural offering, major banks, insurers and asset managers and large corporate clients. ""We've entered a phase where competition between different European financial centers turns around fundamental issues that have little to do with taxes,"" Stephane Boujnah, the head of the Euronext European financial market operator, told Reuters. So far only HSBC has announced a major shift of jobs from London to Paris, with plans to move up to 1,000 posts to the French capital, where the British bank has long had big operations.Former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer, tasked by the government to lobby foreign finance firms to come to Paris, said that even when banks say they are seeking a banking license in Frankfurt that does not mean most of the jobs will be there.""I know of some people who say 'I'm setting up my base in Frankfurt but I'm putting my trading rooms in Paris in a subsidiary. I'll create a few jobs in Frankfurt but the bulk is in Paris',"" Noyer told Reuters in an interview.Many firms have held off making announcements about where they will set up European hubs until after the French election, which Noyer said was already a victory for Paris.""The current concentration, with the hyper-centralization in London following the introduction of the euro and single market, can be considered an aberration,"" said Ross McInnes, the Franco-Australian head of French defense group  Safran  (PA:SAF), who has been charged with promoting Paris as a financial center.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

190,"Jun 22, 2017 02:20PM ET","Beyond air show, newcomers challenge Airbus-Boeing duopoly",nan,"By Matthias Blamont and Victoria BryanPARIS (Reuters) - This year's Paris Air Show was dominated by the annual order battle between Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), but industry executives said the duopoly will be forced to share the stage at future shows as newcomers from Russia, China and Japan muscle into the passenger plane market. Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp (T:7011) brought its MRJ regional jet to Europe for the first time during the air show. China and Russia carried out maiden flights of new narrow-body aircraft last month in their bids to enter the $100 billion-plus annual aerospace market. The two countries have also set up a joint venture to build wide-body jets to challenge incumbents.Consultants Alix Partners estimates that of the current order backlog of around 13,000 planes, about 7-8 percent are for planes from new entrants, among them Russia, China and Japan.Delegates at the show said mounting a proper challenge will take Russia and China at least a decade. The newcomers face headwinds including proving their technology, and gaining customer confidence by deploying and maintaining a quality aircraft maintenance and support network.""Overall, there are big steps not only on the product side but on the support and services side for the airlines to feel confident that they can go in and order those aircraft,"" Pascal Fabre, managing director at Alix Partners in Paris, said. However, China and Russia are large enough markets that orders from their home countries alone could propel the respective airliner ventures.Among COMAC's first customers for its C919 was China Eastern, which has ordered up to 20 planes from the Chinese manufacturer, while Aeroflot is due to take the Russian MS21.COMAC said this week total orders for the C919 stood at 600 from 24 customers.Giorgio Callegari, strategy and alliances director at Russian carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT), said people he met at the air show showed great interest in the MS21 and the Russian-China wide-body cooperation. Aeroflot is set to lease 50 MS21 planes from state defense conglomerate Rostec. ""If maybe in the past, Russian airplanes were discarded as a non-factor, they are now taken much more seriously and people can see that they are potentially a serious competitor,"" he told Reuters.The chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, said he would not have a problem buying jets from Chinese or Russian manufacturers, provided they met operational and performance requirements.BATTLE FOR THIRD SPOT Some executives at the airshow said the marketplace would eventually settle on three major manufacturers and placed their bets on China's COMAC to win that third spot.""Twenty years from now, I think there'll be the big three manufacturers of Airbus, Boeing and China,"" said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.However, Leahy said it would be hard for countries to make billions of dollars of investments over decades to get the product line and support network up to scratch.Cedric Goubet, vice president of commercial engines at  Safran  (PA:SAF), said he too is betting on the Chinese. ""My feeling is that it will be the Chinese. They have the resources, the skills, the national ambitions and a huge domestic market,"" he said, while adding that it was also crucial to get export orders. Dang Thiehong, deputy head of marketing at China's COMAC, told Reuters the aircraft market was big enough to share. ""We hope to provide our services and products to the market no matter in which part of the world,"" he said. China is crucial to the growth prospects of all the major airliner manufacturers. Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing and sales at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, cautioned against the dangers of underestimating new rivals, ""Never sell your competition short.""Japan's Mitsubishi has set its sights on the regional jet market instead of going head to head with the larger planes sold by Airbus and Boeing or rising Chinese and Russian rivals. Yugo Fukuhara, vice president sales and marketing at Mitsubishi, told Reuters, ""Our vision of this business is to become one of two major regional plane makers. We don't compete with China and Russia.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

192,"Jun 22, 2017 09:40AM ET",Europe sets sights on cheap rocket engine by 2030s,nan,"By Andrea ShalalPARIS (Reuters) - Europe aims to develop a low-cost, reusable rocket engine for use after 2030 under a deal between Airbus  Safran  (PA:SAF) Launchers and the European Space Agency (ESA). They signed a development contract at the Paris Airshow on Thursday to develop a demonstrator engine, powered by liquid oxygen and methane.Airbus Safran said it would use new manufacturing techniques, including the use of 3D printers, to keep the engine's cost down to around 1 million euros ($1.1 million).""The commercial market - at least the European one - is asking for reliability, on-time delivery and cost, and we have to find the best way to answer these market expectations,"" its CEO, Alain Charmeau, told Reuters.The firm, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran that will become ArianeGroup on July 1, currently powers the rockets it uses to launch satellites for commercial clients with Vulcain 2 engines costing around 10 million euros each.Prometheus, whose partners also include Italy's Avio, GKN (LON:GKN) from Sweden, and Safran AeroBooster from Belgium, demonstrated Europe's commitment to remain a major player in the global ""race for access to space"", Charmeau said.As one growth driver for the industry he identified the adoption of technology enabling driverless cars, which would boost demand for communications satellites - and hence for rockets to launch them - to relay uninterrupted signals.""We know it will happen. We see prototypes that are already working in Germany and California,"" he said. ""We know this will be a big market but when is difficult to predict.""In the near term, ArianeGroup would remain focused on rolling out the successor to its current Ariane 5 rocket.""We need, and will have Ariane 6 in 2020, but we also have to prepare for the future ...and that is why this (Prometheus) program is important,"" he said.The jury was still out on the issue of reusability, however.California-based Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) earlier this year achieved what it called ""a huge revolution in spaceflight"" by reusing part of one of its Falcon 9 rocket on a subsequent launch.Charmeau said Prometheus would include work on reusability. ""(But) the market is not asking for reusability... As long as we have a limited number of institutional launches it's difficult to bet on reusability.""If the market grew significantly, reusability could become a more important factor, but that was unlikely for 15 years, Charmeau said, adding that ArianeGroup was not competing directly with SpaceX.He said the group would have estimated sales of 3 billion euros in 2017 and expected flat revenues with a slight upward trend over the next few years, with stronger growth to kick in from 2020.Avio chief executive Giulio Ranzo told Reuters that reusable engines were not necessarily economically efficient given their need to be refurbished. To cut unit costs, Avio had started standardizing components for different launchers, a solution that was ""as efficient as reusable engines"".($1 = 0.8956 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Conner was credited with cementing a shift in the company's strategy for single-aisle jets and focusing on market share.Six months into the job, he faced a four-month grounding of the 787 Dreamliner due to battery problems, from which Boeing emerged without losing any customers but with wounded pride, and set about stabilizing production of the new high-tech jet.But he clashed with unions over employment and efforts to make Boeing more competitive against Europe's Airbus.His departure marks a turning point coinciding with the planned retirement later this year of Airbus sales chief John Leahy, another industry veteran who went head to head with Conner in pursuit of deals worth tens of billions of dollars.""Ray is the best salesman I have ever known at Boeing and a friend,"" Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive of engine supplier  Safran  (PA:SAF), told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

194,"Jun 18, 2017 03:53PM ET",Viva Air Peru seen near $5 billion Airbus deal at Paris Airshow,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru looked close to reaching a roughly $5 billion deal with Airbus (PA:AIR) for medium-haul jets on Sunday, as Western planemakers seek to defy expectations of slow sales at this year's Paris Airshow.The Peruvian startup is set to order about 30 recently upgraded A320neo jets and 15 current-generation models known as A320ceo from Airbus, two industry sources told Reuters.A spokesman for Airbus had no comment.Viva Air Peru, which won an operating license earlier this year, is owned by Irelandia Aviation. Neither firm could be reached for comment. Apart from Monday's expected launch of a new version of Boeing's 737 MAX that could net the U.S. planemaker in the region of 150 orders, most industry analysts have muted expectations for orders going into the June 19-25 event.But there were indications on Sunday that Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) would try to pull off several surprises as they look for bragging rights at the world's largest air show.Bloomberg News reported that Ethiopian Airlines might order wide-body Airbus A350 aircraft worth $3 billion at list prices.Airbus declined to comment. Ethiopian could not be reached.Demand for long-haul, wide-body models is thin due to long waiting lists and fears of a potential glut later this decade.But Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said on Sunday he expected further demand to kick in to replace aircraft retiring in coming years.Still, this year's event will be dominated by small models.Leasing companies will be out in force as they try to pick up aircraft at competitive prices, since a multi-year boom of sales for fuel-efficient types is winding down.Industry sources say leasing companies  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) and Chinese lessor ICBC are hunting for deals and may order aircraft including Airbus A320neos. Leasing firm Avolon, another major buyer in past years, is also expected at the show.Engine makers will also be drumming up new business, with China Eastern expected to tap French-U.S. engine maker CFM International (N:GE) (PA:SAF) to provide the power for Airbus A320neos already purchased for delivery starting next year.European airlines group IAG (L:ICAG) could split an engine order to go with its new A320neo fleet, picking Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to power Airbus A320neo aircraft for its Vueling subsidiary and CFM to provide engines for British Airways.None of the companies was available for comment.Several aerospace firms are meanwhile expected to announce contracts for aftermarket services - a growing area for the industry thanks to powerful new data analytics.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline. Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights. ""Our plan remains to start deliveries this month,"" he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs.Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection. Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem ""within a few weeks.""Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far. The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said. Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus (PA:AIR) And China's COMAC.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At this critical time the company should be focused solely on the ramp up of the LEAP.""A spokeswoman for Safran declined to comment.Boeing says it has identified a problem with some of the low pressure turbine discs in the LEAP engine, which is made by a CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Safran.Safran, though, said on Thursday there was no design fault and that checks would be completed in a few weeks.It said production of the engines would not be affected because a second supplier for the same part was boosting its supplies. CFM aims to deliver ""as close as possible to 500"" in total for Boeing, Airbus (PA:AIR) and China's COMAC.Safran recently reported forecast-beating first-quarter revenue and reaffirmed its 2017 outlook, which includes plans to boost production of the LEAP engine to 2,000 units a year during the next three years.While Hohn said he backed Safran as it was structured now, trying to hit that target while also fixing problems at Zodiac would be a ""considerable and unnecessary distraction"".""It would consume management time and demand a reallocation of talented Safran employees to run Zodiac's troubled business. This would significantly increase the risk of the LEAP program developing expensive and damaging problems.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

207,"May 11, 2017 09:04PM ET",Boeing must clear 737 MAX engines with U.S. regulator to fly again,nan,"By Alwyn ScottSEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator must reapprove the engines on Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jetliner before it can take flight and begin deliveries, the engine maker said on Thursday, after the new aircraft was grounded due to an engine problem.The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the $110 million plane to airlines this month. The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory. Boeing and engine maker CFM International must submit data to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, and the FAA has to ""review it and determine that those engines can be cleared for flight,"" said Jamie Jewell, a spokeswoman for CFM, a joint venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France.It was not immediately clear how long that process might take. The FAA is working with CFM and Boeing ""to develop a proposed plan to clear the engines,"" said spokeswoman Laura Brown.The FAA certified the engine in March, but the emergence of the problem disclosed on Wednesday was an unusual occurrence that created uncertainty over the next steps. Boeing said it still plans to deliver the first of the planes to customers this month. It said on Wednesday it had suspended 737 MAX test flights due to a quality issue with some of the low-pressure turbine discs in the engine, known as the LEAP-1B. The nickel-based alloy discs had a flaw from forging that could make them prone to cracking, Jewell said, adding that discs from a second supplier were not affected. However, the FAA review applies to all LEAP-1B engines, Jewell said, not just the 30 to 40 with suspected bad parts.""In their mind, all LEAP-1B engines are equal,"" she said.KEY MONEYMAKER Boeing has engines at the factory without the suspect parts, but CFM and Boeing ""have to demonstrate to the FAA's satisfaction that the issue is not present,"" Jewell said.The engines could be installed in short order once approval is granted, Jewell said. The ""suspect engines"" will be shipped to CFM facilities in the United States and France for inspection and possible repair. Safran said earlier Thursday that it expected inspections to be completed within a few weeks. ""We are doing everything to ensure that the first delivery can go ahead in May,"" Safran Aircraft Engines' Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration.Boeing had been set to deliver the first 737 MAX on Monday to Malindo Air of Malaysia. Boeing has built up an inventory of planes outside its Renton, Washington, factory, and at a nearby Seattle airport known as Boeing Field. Reuters counted 23 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the facilities this week, excluding test aircraft.The 737 MAX 8 carries a list price of $110 million but typically sells at a steep discount.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Boeing uses a version of the engine called LEAP-1B.The suspension came after  Safran  discovered a quality problem in turbine disks provided by one of two suppliers, and it is not related to the part's design, Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.""There will be a temporary disruption to the logistics which we hope to fix within a few weeks,"" said Andries, speaking at a factory outside Paris where it co-produces the engines with  General Electric  (N:GE).Safran will fly part of the engines it has already delivered to Boeing back from the United States to its French factory, inspect them and return them to Boeing. It will take about a week for each engine and Safran is putting in place resources to handle several at once, Andries said.""It is not a design problem but a problem regarding the quality of the production,"" he added. ""The LEAP-1A engine is not affected.""Andries declined to name the supplier involved in the quality issue but said an alternative supplier had agreed to step up production to compensate.CFM's shareholders said last month they expected to deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier, although Andries said CFM still aimed to deliver as near as possible to 500 of those engines this year.Boeing's test flight suspension comes days before it was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to Malaysia's Malindo Air.Airbus, which offers a larger version called LEAP-1A on its new A320neo aircraft family, said on Wednesday it continued to conduct normal test flights and was unaffected.However, it continues to experience delays in deliveries of the other choice of engine for that type of aircraft, the Geared Turbofan made by Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).CFM builds the LEAP engines for the latest generation of Boeing 737 aircraft and offers them for Airbus’s competing A320neo model in competition with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX). It also provides engines for China’s new C919 passenger jet which staged its first flight earlier this month.Despite the latest glitch, Safran said Airbus has now delivered more of its A320neo with engines from CFM than Pratt & Whitney, which started six months earlier but has also run into widely reported technical problems.Shares in Safran, which is aiming to complete a merger with rival  Zodiac  (PA:ZODC), were down 0.9 percent in mid-session trading - among the worst performers on Paris' benchmark CAC-40 index (FCHI) which was flat.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer.Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last.Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67.The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts.A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, ""as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,"" said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners.""Investors are acutely focused"" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said.Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers.Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC), which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a ""a few days' delay."" ""This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email.Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine.""There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,"" Jewell said.All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said.It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,"" Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters.""I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.""At the moment, though, Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe.On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight.A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a ""major breakthrough"" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], relies on overseas technology from firms including  General Electric  (N:GE), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) subsidiary Goodrich.China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers.HARDSHIP, STRUGGLEConceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide.

213,"May 04, 2017 05:03AM ET",Exclusive: Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear program, a senior Iranian official said.IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (N:BA) is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities. But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review.So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say. Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added.""We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran,"" Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters.Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place. UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment.Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies. About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade. This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future. U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board.IRAN, UK ELECTIONS Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then.UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent.For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier  General Electric  (N:GE) or GE and its French partner  Safran  (PA:SAF).UKEF has said in the past it recognizes the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

214,"Apr 27, 2017 01:20AM ET","China, Europe pledge closer aviation ties ahead of landmark jet launch",nan,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese and European aviation regulators said on Thursday they will forge closer ties over aircraft manufacturing and certification as the global industry turns its eyes to China ahead of the maiden flight of the Chinese-built C919 jet.The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are holding a landmark meeting on aviation in Shanghai as China's government pushes for a bigger role in the global aviation market.The first flight in May of the C919 jet, built by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), will mark a major step for Beijing. The government hopes the jet will compete with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.A big hurdle, though, is that Europe and the United States have yet to certify a domestically built Chinese passenger plane and do not currently recognize Chinese certification procedures, limiting the countries to which China can sell its planes.""The ever closer ties between the Chinese and European aviation industries have created good conditions and a solid foundation to deepen cooperation on aircraft manufacturing and certification,"" CAAC administrator Feng Zhenglin said.Another CAAC official said closer ties would ""increase the global influence and competitiveness of Chinese aviation"".The meeting between CAAC and EASA is the first since the two signed an agreement in 2015 to cooperate more closely on aviation issues in a five-year project.The ties have already yielded some results. EASA said on Wednesday it had started the process of certification for the C919, though no decision had yet been made.China's first domestically made plane, the regional ARJ21 jet, has yet to receive U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or EASA certification, which had raised questions over whether the larger C919 jet would be approved in the West.The Shanghai meeting will see a raft of global aviation firms including COMAC, Airbus,  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Holdings PLC and British Airways, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) SA.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

215,"Apr 24, 2017 07:23PM ET",Ready for take-off? China's answer to Boeing now just needs to sell,nan,"By Brenda Goh and Tim HepherSHANGHAI/PARIS (Reuters) - When China unveiled an historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China's aviation ambitions.The COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force - illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR). ""They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group.Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training program, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say.And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this.Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad.""You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem,"" said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. ""After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness.""Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919.GLOBAL SUPPORT NETWORKThe C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown.In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January.Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them.While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, COMAC has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it's adopting a more outward-facing approach.While operating manuals for COMAC's smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919's will be in English to support sales.COMAC's sales and support networks - it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng - are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus.Still, COMAC's home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes - mostly from Boeing and Airbus.""Their sales person is the government,"" said a Chinese airline executive, who didn't want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. ""As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen.""Airline executives say the first flight is when COMAC can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing.""We haven't placed a deposit; at the moment it's intentions,"" said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines (SS:600029) (HK:1055), which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s.""We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they're able to produce it... They (COMAC) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates.""HOW SAFE IS IT?Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919's safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team.The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence.Although the EU has agreed to recognize some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie.""We are just at the start of the process,"" said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes.Without Western certification, ""sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible,"" said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week.The C919's only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent  General Electric  (N:GE) co-built the plane's engine with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).""Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has,"" Cheng said.-For graphic on 'Comparison of passenger jets' click: http://tmsnrt.rs/1kwEmC4  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

217,"Apr 14, 2017 06:45PM ET","Exclusive: Safran could lower, restructure Zodiac offer - source",nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) is exploring plans to lower its $9 billion bid for  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC) and may simplify its structure amid continued turmoil at the seats maker and pressure from its own shareholders, a financial source said.A new structure could involve a mixture of cash and shares in a more traditional offer for Zodiac, rather than a complex two-tier structure designed to woo family shareholders.But an increasingly wary Safran is unwilling to take any decisions on a range of options before Zodiac issues its newly delayed first-half results, the source said, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.Safran, which makes aircraft engines and other aerospace equipment, declined to comment.Zodiac said earlier it was postponing publication of its first-half financial results by a week to April 28 due to what it described as excess work amid Safran merger talks.The delay coincides with analyst concerns that Zodiac's rapid growth through numerous acquisitions has complicated its reporting processes, which in turn make it harder to resolve a two-year industrial crisis in its seats and cabins plants.Safran faces criticism over the value and structure of its offer from British hedge fund TCI, notably since Zodiac last month issued the latest in a spate of profit warnings, weeks after agreeing to the tie-up.Safran is unwilling to run the risk that the results delay could coincide with another warning and has given itself a few weeks to decide how to alter its 29.47 euro per share bid, the source said.Despite Zodiac's industrial woes, Safran has so far defended efforts to buy the company and believes it can bring Zodiac's factories under control due to its own track record.But CEO Philippe Petitcolin is seen as unlikely to put at risk a recent transformation of Safran around core aerospace activities by proceeding with the offer at all costs.Two sources said they could no longer rule out Safran walking away from Zodiac for the second time in seven years.The deal's unusual structure was crafted to allow a group of core Zodiac shareholding families to receive Safran shares without losing a longstanding tax status.It involves a cash bid aimed at ordinary investors holding 68 percent of Zodiac followed by a merger, which would draw in the Zodiac families without the hefty tax bill that would automatically be triggered by a classic cash or share offer.France's Socialist government has supported the scheme to create a new aerospace champion by agreeing to add its own Safran shares to a shareholder pact between the families, keeping their combined shareholding above a tax-neutral threshold.If Safran restructures the offer, experts say the families could notionally face hundreds of millions of euros in wealth tax and other charges unless another way can be found to smooth the deal, though the outcome would depend on individual factors.TCI has argued Safran is wasting its efforts to tailor the deal to family shareholders since Zodiac shares would fall sharply if Safran withdrew its offer. It has called for a shareholder vote before the first part of the deal goes ahead.Zodiac shares closed on Thursday at 23.56 euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Securing EU approval without conditions will be a major step toward closing the deal, which Rockwell aims to do within the next few months.Pricing pressures from Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) are seen as one factor which triggered the deal. The merged company has forecast cost savings of about $160 million due to greater buying power with suppliers and combined information technology systems.The Rockwell deal has also renewed speculation of more tie-ups in the sector. French aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) launched a $9 billion takeover bid in January for seats maker  Zodiac  Aerospace (PA:ZODC) to create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

However we are responsible to sustain the viability of Airbus,"" said the letter signed by Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque and Chief Executive Tom Enders and sent to the capitals of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey and the UK.Noting ""huge losses"" on the project, Airbus called for a meeting of ministers of those nations to take stock of the situation and agree on next steps in the best interests of the program, government customers and Europe's defense industry.It also called for talks with Europrop International (EPI), the consortium responsible for providing the troop carrier's turboprop engines, which have been involved in some delays.EPI is owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), Germany's MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP) of Spain.An Airbus spokeswoman declined comment on Thursday on details of the company's contacts with governments, but said there would be three elements to any discussions: the nations, the OCCAR pan-European procurement agency and the engine makers.Engine consortium EPI could not immediately be reached for comment.A spokesman for OCCAR had said on Wednesday the agency was in regular and ongoing dialogue with Airbus, but declined comment on the company's request for new measures.Airbus received a 3.5 billion euro bailout from the seven core purchasing nations in 2010, but has suggested it did not go far enough in limiting the company's financial exposure.Defence officials from the seven nations were expected to confer by telephone on Airbus requests as early as Thursday.Germany, the largest A400M buyer, has so far given a cool response, saying it is important that Airbus should resolve outstanding problems on the military program.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

231,"Jan 24, 2017 01:40PM ET",Zodiac family silver key to $9 billion Safran tie-up,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) has crafted a deal to persuade family investors in Zodiac Aerospace to give up control in a merger that would create the world's third largest aerospace supplier.But in a rare two-stage deal Safran must first convince ordinary investors, who hold 68 percent of the company, to sell their shares in the company for cash. If more than half of those investors accept, the deal will proceed to the second phase. This would offer the handful of families with historic ties a chance to keep shareholdings and industrial links while maintaining longstanding tax breaks - key to getting the families on board. The families lead a group that hold 32 percent of Zodiac voting rights and spurned Safran's first approach six years ago.The dual deal structure reflects how Safran is caught between the need to make the deal attractive to markets and keep long-term investors on board. Safran, which is 14 percent owned by the French state, wants to create a new aerospace champion and the tax umbrella reflects the policy of successive governments to smooth the path for such deals. Without that structure, the Safran deal with Zodiac would collapse, legal experts and people involved in the deal said.""It has to be done this way or there is no deal,"" a person directly involved in the negotiations told Reuters.A Zodiac spokesman and Safran spokeswoman both declined to comment on the discussions.But the unusual split structure has puzzled some ordinary Zodiac investors, who could collectively block the deal, according to people briefed on the discussions. Under the deal, Safran is first offering cash worth $9 billion or $29.47 a share for Zodiac, aimed at most investors. It does not allow shareholders outside the core group to exchange their own Zodiac shares for stock in the new Safran. ""Some shareholders are saying 'Why should we have to take cash? If the story is so good, why shouldn't we be able to take up shares? Why exclude us from the club?',"" said a European analyst, asking not to be named because of company policy. The analyst said he had been told this by his clients who are investors in Zodiac. WEALTH TAXSafran's backers say that is offset by a hefty 26 percent premium compared to Zodiac shares prices before the offer.Changing part two of the deal to a classic share offer would expose descendants of Zodiac's founders to French wealth taxes and other penalties that one analyst estimated could reach hundreds of millions of euros.""The problem ... is the wealth tax. If you don't find a way to make the deal interesting for the families, it can't happen...That is why a merger was chosen rather than a simple share swap,"" said a person close to the group of families.While France's tax system pounces on gains from selling shares for either cash or stock, shareholders tied together by a special pact don't face the same exposure when companies merge. That is not the reason bringing the two firms together, but is one factor Safran hopes will prevent the deal falling apart.After five weeks of intensive and secretive talks, held in rented rooms and protected by code names, the two companies last week unveiled a deal designed to satisfy two very different shareholder bases.Their offer aimed to reconcile two red lines: Zodiac's families wanted to be able to maintain their fiscally neutral shareholder pact and preserve their role as stable partners.And Safran wanted to avoid just taking majority control of Zodiac with a large minority block in place that might make it harder to get synergies needed to justify its tie-up with a company only just emerging from industrial problems. Full mergers typically lead to bigger cost cuts such as closing one company's headquarters. LOOKING FOR A SWEETENERTax is not the only issue, people involved in the talks said. Zodiac's core shareholders were also unwilling to fritter away double voting rights accumulated over many years, and negotiated the right to keep them in the enlarged group, those people said. Finally, Zodiac Chairman Didier Domange stressed the families wanted to stay involved industrially with Safran.The families also made concessions. They will be locked in for two years, limiting options at a volatile time, and the deal is structured to give them a slight discount.On Tuesday the merger ratio, 0.485 Safran shares for each Zodiac one, implied a 2.6 percent discount to the cash offer after stripping out a special Safran dividend adjusted for tax.Even so, success is only assured if Safran wins three quarters of Zodiac's freely traded stock in the cash bid. Sensing Safran's potential difficulty, some investors see a chance to put pressure on it to raise its bid. ""We consider this group of shareholders could push for a sweetener in order to take the cash offer,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said.Safran betrays no sign of being prepared to raise the offer and analysts say it could walk away with less egg on its face than Zodiac's ordinary shareholders if the deal fails.""Zodiac is nice to have, but not a must-have for Safran,"" a person familiar with the company's strategy said.While embracing Zodiac as an industrial partner, Safran appears to be gambling that the risk of Zodiac shares dropping sharply if the deal fails, with no new partner for the industrially stretched company in sight, will bring in votes.Under the merger, the French state plans to join a pact with the current core shareholders in Zodiac, which employs 7,000 workers in France. Some analysts view the state with suspicion.Two days before the deal became public, its four main architects - the CEOs and chairman of both firms - visited the Elysee palace to talk to President Francois Hollande.But while Hollande later welcomed the creation of a French aerospace giant, securing jobs ahead of elections in April, insiders said the government only joined talks in the final stages and did not try to steer the deal one way or the other. ""There was never any state interference,"" one said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

236,"Jan 04, 2017 02:13PM ET",Boeing inches toward goal with $8.25 billion order from GE,nan,"(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it had received a firm order for 75 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.25 billion at list prices, from  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm.The order, which Boeing said it booked in 2016, means the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 531 net jetliner sales last year, pushing it closer to its target of selling as many planes as it delivers.Boeing has said it expects to deliver between 745 and 750 commercial jets this year. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of widebodies remains sluggish.Boeing's order tally could climb again on Thursday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Through December 20, it had booked 470 net orders. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The order was placed by Northwest Airlines before it merged with Delta in 2008.Tallying those changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.77, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on January 25. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the target in July. In December Boeing said it would cut output of 777s by 40 percent this year due to slow sales.The deal for 75 Boeing 737 MAXs increases firm orders from GE Capital Aviation Services for the latest generation 737 to 170, Boeing said. The planes are powered by LEAP engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France. Boeing has received 3,419 orders for the 737 MAX so far. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.49 in early afternoon trading. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index (SPX).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

237,"Dec 23, 2016 09:42PM ET",Lockheed CEO tells Trump she will work to drive down cost of F-35,nan,"(Reuters) - The chief executive of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) told President-elect Donald Trump on Friday that she was committed to driving down the cost of the company's F-35 fighter jet, a day after Trump took aim at the cost of the F-35 in a Twitter post.CEO Marillyn Hewson said she spoke with Trump on Friday afternoon and assured him that she had heard his message ""loud and clear"" about reducing the cost of the F-35.Trump, in a tweet posted late on Thursday, suggested that an older aircraft made by rival aerospace company Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co could offer a cheaper alternative to the F-35. ""Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!"" Trump said.Hewson, in a statement posted on Twitter, said she had had ""a very good conversation"" with Trump on Friday.""I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively,"" she said in the statement.Lockheed shares closed down 1.3 percent on Friday, nearing their lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election. They were the biggest drag on a basket of defense-related stocks. Boeing's stock ended near the unchanged mark.Trump had met with the chief executives of both Lockheed and Boeing on Wednesday.Boeing's F-18 is an older generation aircraft that lacks the stealth capabilities of the F-35. One U.S. official said it was impossible to tell what Trump meant by his tweet, given the importance of stealth technology as a way to counter advanced defenses of near-peer states, like Russia or China.""Somebody needs to ask Donald Trump how he's going to be able to confront China without aircraft capable of penetrating anti-access and area denial systems, including air defenses,"" the official said.Most defense analysts do not consider the two jets as comparable aircraft. ""Impractical if not irrational,"" Richard  Safran  (PA:SAF), a defense analyst at Buckingham Research, said by email. ""First, the F/A-18 is a carrier-based naval fighter. Certainly it could not meet the U.S. Marine Corps need for vertical lift. It would not be suitable for the Air Force either - the extra weight of a carrier fighter makes it less than ideal for the Air Force.""""Unless the rules of physics have changed, you cannot make a non-stealthy, two-engined, carrier-based aircraft from the 1980s into a single-engine, multi-role stealthy fighter from the 2000s,"" Vertical Research Partners analysts wrote in a note on Friday.Still, Trump's dissatisfaction with the program, which has been dogged by problems while costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, is a clear risk for Lockheed. The F-35 program is a critical sales generator for the company, accounting for 20 percent of last year's total revenue of $46.1 billion.The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said on Thursday in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs.On Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive. Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program's costs. Trump's jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at Cowen & Co, wrote in a client note on Thursday.Trump unleashed his tirade about the hefty cost for U.S. aircraft earlier this month, first lashing out at Boeing over the cost of replacement Air Force One presidential planes and days later at Lockheed over the F-35.Since Trump's first tweet about Air Force One on Dec. 6, Lockheed shares have slumped around 6.4 percent, costing its shareholders collectively about $5 billion in lost market value. ""We have no idea how this plays out but believe 'Twitter risk' for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,"" Cowen's Schweizer wrote. ""This is Lockheed Martin's time in the barrel.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

What better way to get material than a crazy first job? For Reuters' ""First Jobs"" series, we talked to a few successful American authors about the jobs that got them started on the path to literary stardom.James PattersonAuthor: Along Came a Spider, 1st To Die, Kiss the GirlsFirst job: Hospital psych aide""I had grown up in a small town with not a lot of exposure to the world, and then I got a job as a psych aide at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. It was a real chance to grow up and meet different kinds of people. All sorts of windows and doors started opening up for me.""My job was basically to talk to people. At first I worked maximum security, where sometimes the patients could get violent, and you had to take them to the 'Quiet Room'. Then I started working the adolescent floors, where I met a lot of kids with drug issues or parent problems. I was like their big brother.""The only place I didn't like working was the one ward filled with people who had lobotomies. I found that very difficult.""That hospital was also where I started reading like crazy. Often I had the 11 pm to 7 am shift, and I would just read, read, read - I got up to a novel a day, that I bought from used bookstores in Cambridge. Soon after that I started scribbling stories.""The poet Robert Lowell was a patient there once in a while. A few of the other aides were English majors, so we would just sit in his room for hours and he would talk about his poetry. Some nights I would come home from work and feel like I was flying, because I was so exhilarated from moments like that.""Jonathan  Safran  (PA:SAF) FoerAuthor: Here I Am, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Everything Is IlluminatedFirst job: Jewelry store""I worked behind the counter at my dad's jewelry store in a Maryland mall. I also replaced watch batteries, which sounds mundane but is a actually bizarrely complicated thing to do. I remember I had a big crush on a girl at the time, and I used to etch her initials into everybody's watches.""I also sold jewelry, and I had a whole sales pitch worked out. If a customer wondered if they really needed something, I would say, 'The real question is: Do you want a family heirloom for your children or grandchildren?' I was too young to realize what a jerk I was.""That place was a real Petri dish of humanity, a very rich psychological environment. There is a certain kind of person who can sell things, and the people who had been there for decades enjoyed teaching me everything they knew.""We even had a code word if we ever felt threatened behind the counter: 'Mercury.' Thankfully I never had to use it.""T.C.

A friend of mine had been working at a men's clothing store, and they needed extra people for the holiday season. This was in a shopping center in my hometown of Peekskill, New York.""I had many problems in those days, one of which was: How could I possibly get any girl in my life? Thankfully I made enough salary at this nice clothing store to buy some cool stuff for myself, like pointy-toed shoes and skinny pants and big sweaters.""Down in the stockroom, my friend used to draw comic faces and write messages for me, and I would respond. In that graffiti we would make fun of the boss, and his wife, and his children. So soon after I was called in by the boss and fired -- which of course I richly deserved.

242,"Nov 03, 2016 10:41AM ET",'Weekend in Frankfurt?' - Paris perfects its pitch for London bankers,nan,"By Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - In the battle to attract Brexit-wary bankers fleeing London, the man in charge of Paris' charm offensive thinks he has the pitch that rivals can't match.""When did you last book a weekend in Frankfurt?"" Ross McInnes joked after a cross-party group of politicians put the Oxford-educated Franco-Australian chairman of French engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) in charge of the come-to-Paris campaign.Bankers in London have sometimes complained that Frankfurt would be boring after life in the British capital.In Paris' favor, McInnes said the French capital not only offered a deep talent pool of financial and legal experts but an attractive lifestyle unrivalled on the continent.Paris is vying with Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin to attract banks, insurers, start-ups and investors fleeing Europe's biggest financial center, since Britons voted to leave the European Union in June.French authorities have put on a rare united front to promote Paris, with the ruling Socialist government unveiling tax breaks for expats last July while conservative-controlled local authorities have gone on roadshows in New York and launched advertising campaigns.Stepping up the charm offensive on Thursday, the French government launched a one-stop shop to help firms fleeing London deal with bureaucratic procedures.McInnes urged foreign investors to look beyond the stereotypes of French red-tape and realize the country has been reforming labor rules and cutting employment costs in recent years. ""Anyone who's worked in France for the last few years knows to go beyond some of the cliches and look at hard facts, hard figures,"" he said. ""This is a business friendly country,"" he said, adding that he was living proof as a chairman of a big French company that people do not have to be from the French establishment to make it in France.Big U.S. banks in particular are looking to shift operations from London to the continent due to the prospect that they will lose their right to serve the full European Union once Britain quits the bloc.The head of the French Treasury, Odile Renaud-Basso, said that banks were preparing to take relocation decisions in the coming months and that any one financial center was unlikely to replace London.""Firms are adopting a strategy of diversification to use the comparative advantages of each center to their best interest and so activities will be spread around,"" she told a panel discussion at the French lower house of parliament.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

243,"Oct 29, 2016 09:10PM ET",American Airlines plane engine flung debris in rare failure,nan,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher(Reuters) - An American Airlines (O:AAL) jet engine that failed seconds before takeoff in a fiery runway accident at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport flung broken turbine parts as far as half a mile from the scene, a federal investigator said on Saturday.Disclosure of the ""uncontained"" failure,"" in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries.Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings.Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine.The  General Electric  (N:GE) engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing (N:BA) 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said.Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. ""That's a lot of runway to have left,"" she said.FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRISIn a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday.She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure.American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of ""industry-leading levels of reliability,"" Kennedy said.The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and  Safran  (PA:SAF) of France.In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

249,"Sep 27, 2016 02:40PM ET",Morocco signs deal with Boeing to attract suppliers,nan,"By Zakia AbdennebiTangier, MOROCCO (Reuters) - Morocco has signed an agreement that  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will seek to attract its suppliers to boost the kingdom's aeronautics industry. The ""Boeing ecosystem"" project aims to bring around 120 suppliers of the company to help raise Morocco's aeronautics exports by $1 billion and create 8,700 jobs. Boeing already has a joint venture with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) in Casablanca to build wire bundles and harnesses for aircraft makers, including Boeing and Airbus. Tuesday's agreement was signed in the royal palace of Tangier by Moroccan trade and industry minister Moulay Hafid Elalamy and the chief executive of Boeing's airplane business, Raymond Conner. Moroccan King Mohammed attended the ceremony.""Boeing will actively reach out to more than 120 suppliers in the near term to encourage this to happen,"" Conner said during the ceremony. Conner and Moroccan officials declined to give details or to say whether some of the suppliers have already commited to open new plants in the kingdom. Unlike some other countries in the region, Morocco has managed to avoid a big drop in foreign investments since the global financial crisis and the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, partly by marketing itself as an export base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.It has attracted some big auto and aeronautics investors in recent years, including Delphi, Bombardier and Eaton Corp.It has already exported 5.7 billion dirhams ($590 million) of aircraft parts in the first eight months of 2016, which represent around of 3.5 percent of Moroccan exports. The aeronautics sector has been growing by around 7 percent annually.Morocco expects auto industry exports to reach 100 billion dirhams a year by 2020 thanks to PSA Peugeot Citroen's decision last year to build a factory slated to produce 200,000 vehicles a year. It expects the Peugeot plant to raise industry to 20 percent of domestic product (GDP) from 16 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The debris did not penetrate into the cabin interior, the agency said.The plane, bound from New Orleans to Orlando with 99 passengers and five crew members aboard, lost cabin pressure and safely diverted to Pensacola. There were no injuries.The investigation update still leaves unanswered what exactly caused the ""uncontained"" engine failure, a rare and hazardous event in which components rapidly exit an engine and can collide with the aircraft. The NTSB said in a statement that it still must review the engine's maintenance records and examine blade surfaces for cracks.Representatives for Southwest and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, which produced the engine with  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA in a joint venture known as CFM International, said the companies continue to work closely with the NTSB on the investigation.The aircraft has been released to Southwest, which has started the repair process, a spokeswoman for the airline said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

254,"Aug 04, 2016 07:55PM ET",Airbus closes on rival Boeing in jet order race,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Alwyn ScottPARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) virtually closed the gap with Boeing in their intense battle for airliner orders in July after booking about half of the 197 firm sales unveiled at last month's Farnborough Airshow, according to the latest data from both companies.Amid a broad slowdown in purchases, the European planemaker said it had sold a total of 373 jets between January and July, or 323 after adjusting for cancellations.That compares with 383 airplane sales, or 333 after cancellations, by U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA).Combined orders at the world's dominant planemakers fell 17 percent from the same period last year, weighed by concerns over the economy and relatively low oil prices, which have taken the edge off demand for new fuel-saving models.Both planemakers are struggling to book new sales in a market that is seen as somewhat oversupplied with jets, especially larger wide-body models, industry experts said.The slowdown has raised some questions about whether the companies will maintain plans to boost output later this decade. Both have also faced a slew of order deferrals in recent weeks, while insisting the trend of postponements is stable.Two industry sources said Indonesia's Lion Air, one of the largest jet buyers with hundreds on order from Boeing and Airbus, is weighing the deferral of about 25 Airbus jets.Airbus declined comment and Lion Air was not available.Airbus was also hammering out details of an order for 100 more planes from Lion Air's regional rival AirAsia (KL:AIRA), announced in a shower of publicity at Farnborough.After a slow start to the year, Airbus had looked set to end the Farnborough Airshow with 380 net orders for the year to date including the AirAsia deal, which it described as a firm order.The deal did not make it into the new tally, however, and an Airbus spokesman said paperwork was being finalised. A person close to the talks said this only involved tying up loose ends.Latest Airbus data also suggested that another order secured at the height of an industry boom in 2012 had been trimmed back. Mexican low-cost carrier Interjet has canceled five of 40 A320neo jets it has on order, according to the monthly update.An airline spokeswoman said the change was part of an ""operational swap,"" without giving further details. The cancellation emerged as Mexican consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in two years amid a weak economy.DELIVERY WOESWhile Boeing remains ahead by a whisker in the race for new orders, it maintains a solid lead on deliveries which drive revenues, handing over 432 jets between January and July.Airbus delivered 339 jets between January and July, down 4 percent on the year, due in part to a shortage of Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines for its newly revamped A320neo.It delivered just three of those jets in July, including two powered by Pratt & Whitney and the first to be delivered with alternative engines from CFM International (N:GE) (PA:SAF).So far this year it has delivered 11 A320neos and 15 of its widebody A350s, another model suffering delays due in part to problems with suppliers. It aims to deliver 50 A350s this year.Industry sources say that besides widely reported problems with cabin equipment such as toilets, the A350 has faced other glitches including quality problems with wing spoilers from Austrian parts maker FACC (VI:FACC). An Airbus spokesman said these problems had been resolved. FACC declined to comment.New Airbus data also incorporated the cancellation by Qatar Airways of the first of 50 A320neo-family jets it has ordered.The Gulf airline has criticized Airbus and Pratt & Whitney over A320neo delays and said in June it would exercise a clause to abandon the first jet, one of several parked in Qatar livery outside the French factory waiting for engines .Parent Airbus Group said last week that upgraded versions of the engines were now being delivered. Meanwhile, Qatar Airways is in talks with Boeing for rival 737 MAX jets to diversify its fast-expanding fleet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

259,"Jul 12, 2016 10:20AM ET",Airbus in dash for deals as Farnborough struggles to take off,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Conor HumphriesFARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus sprinted toward deals worth $20 billion to seize the initiative at a rain-soaked Farnborough Airshow on Tuesday, but industry executives said the mostly lackluster event confirmed a recent boom in aerospace orders was finally fizzling out.India's GoAir said it had signed a preliminary agreement to buy 72 of the latest version of Airbus's top-selling A320 aircraft, worth around $7.7 billion at current list prices and doubling an existing order.There was some confusion over the status of the deal as negotiations continued behind the scenes following what may have been a premature announcement, but GoAir later confirmed the agreement.Meanwhile, AirAsia (KL:AIRA) Chief Executive Tony Fernandes flew into the UK to finalize an order for 100 A321neo jets to support the airline's expansion plans, confident of striking a deal at bargain prices as planemakers brace for a slowdown.The 185-seat A321neo is worth $125.7 million per plane at list prices, but AirAsia is expected to pay a fraction of that after placing orders for hundreds of jets and establishing itself as one of the planemaker's largest customers.One source close to the matter speculated the jets could be sold to AirAsia for less than its previous large order for the smaller A320neo model, though Airbus sales chief John Leahy insisted earlier that A321neo prices were improving.Some of the new jets will be for the Malaysian-based airline's leasing business.It was not immediately clear whether any of the aircraft orders to be unveiled on Tuesday replaced existing ones.In further evidence of efforts to galvanize what has been a relatively quiet start to the biennial air show, CFM (N:GE) (PA:SAF) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) were competing for the right to supply engines for the A321neos, with negotiators huddled over papers in the corner of an airline award ceremony.Europe's Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) have enjoyed years of strong growth thanks to rising air travel and demand for new fuel-efficient models. On Monday, they both increased their forecasts for aircraft demand over the next 20 years, betting rising wealth in Asia would continue to boost airline passenger numbers. But analysts are worried growing risks to the global economy, from slowing growth in China to Britain's decision to leave the European Union, could dry up orders or even lead to some cancellations. Indeed, air show participants report a lower level of dealmaking than in recent years. Airbus sales chief John Leahy expressed confidence that record production plans would be upheld, thanks in part to a strategy of building up spare orders, but some airlines that have dominated previous events are widely said to be quietly rescheduling their orders for Airbus or Boeing jets.""For both Boeing and Airbus, the question still isn't whether or not all the aircraft they produce will have a taker, but who this taker will be and at what price,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, managing director at Germany's DVB Bank.Underscoring the growing clout of Asia and the Middle East in the industry, Qatar Airways announced a deal to buy up to 10 percent of Latin America's largest airline LATAM Airlines (SN:LAN) in a $613 million deal.That follows the Gulf airline's purchase last year of 15 percent of British Airways owner International Airlines Group (L:ICAG), which like Qatar and LATAM is a member of the Oneworld airline alliance.Boeing, meanwhile, said an undisclosed Chinese customer had signed a commitment for 30 of its 737 family of planes, in a deal worth more than $3 billion at current list prices, while China's Kunming Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 10 737 MAX 7 planes, worth $660 million at catalog prices.Airbus confirmed an order from German airline Germania for 25 A320neos, worth $2.6 billion at list prices, as reported earlier by Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

262,"Jun 30, 2016 01:37PM ET","Airbus, Safran finalize space launchers merger",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) pledged on Thursday to make Europe competitive in the face of U.S. low-cost rival SpaceX as they completed a deal to merge their space launcher activities.The two aerospace groups said they were closing a deal that paves the way for the next generation of European rocket, the Ariane 6, which will make its first flight in 2020 and be used to put commercial and military satellites into orbit.The long-awaited deal calls for the integration of industrial assets, turning their existing Airbus Safran Launchers venture into an operational concern with 8,400 employees in France and Germany. The heads of both companies pledged to focus on making the venture competitive after Europe's position in the commercial launch market was threatened by Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which intends to offer cut-rate launch services by re-using its rockets.Under the final deal, French engine maker Safran will pay Airbus Group 750 million euros ($832 million) to ensure an equal 50/50 ownership split in the new venture -- slightly less than a previously expected figure of 800 million.. ""They needed to complete this deal so that they are ready to design an entire launcher for civil customers rather than government requirements, forcing the agencies to accept what they have done for their customers rather than work with what governments want,"" an analyst said, asking not to be named.The deal had earlier been held up for months as the two companies and the French government debated how the payment to Airbus should be treated for tax purposes.French tax regulations are not easily applicable to a partnership of equals in which both companies view the stake as strategic, and are locked in for the long term, so a compromise was reached sparing Airbus a hefty tax bill.Separately, the Safran board will meet on Thursday to make a preliminary selection from a dozen offers for its Morpho biometrics and security business, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Pfizer  is hiving off the business, which it acquired as part of the $16 billion takeover of Hospira last September, to focus on drugs.Infusion pumps provide exact dosages of intravenous drugs, sometimes by millilitres per hour, and are used in medical areas such as intensive care, emergency care or neonatal care. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is advising Pfizer on the divestment, the sources said.Pfizer, Goldman and Fresenius declined to comment while officials at Smiths were not immediately available for comment.Bloomberg, which reported earlier this year that the unit was for sale, said at the time that the field of bidders also included private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management.For Fresenius, whose main market for its infusion pumps is Europe, a deal would offer a broader geographic reach, as the unit for sale has a strong foothold in North America.The German healthcare group, whose businesses range from providing kidney dialysis and tube feeding equipment to running hospitals, has a history of large takeovers. It acquired injectable generic drugs maker APP for $3.7 billion in 2008, and more recently 3 billion euros worth of hospitals from  Rhoen Klinikum  (DE:RHKG) and blood collection equipment company Fenwal for more than $1 billion.""(Asset) prices have come down but we're very selective in what is a good deal and what isn't,"" chief executive Ulf Schneider said last month.Smiths Group - a diversified supplier of hospital equipment, industrial services and sensors to measure soot in diesel exhaust or to detect explosives in baggage - has said it would remain on the lookout for deals after buying Safran's (PA:SAF) U.S.-based Morpho Detection business for $710 million.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

273,"Apr 07, 2016 04:36PM ET",It takes a village of options to pay college tuition,nan,"By Beth PinskerNEW YORK (Reuters) - Until last week, high school senior Alex Gomez was missing a key piece in his puzzle-like plan to pay college tuition next year to the University of Colorado. The 18-year-old from Ruidoso, New Mexico had already lined up family savings, financial aid, work study and loans, and then won a $7,500 scholarship from student-loan lender Sallie Mae for making a video about how he was going to pay for college.""It feels incredible and very, very relieving,"" says Gomez, who just rented an apartment for next August in Denver. Although 20 percent of families can pay college tuition out of pocket, according to Sallie Mae, most families have to scramble every year to put together the cash before the first day of school. And they cannot really start to do this until they know what the final price tag will be. For high school seniors, that means waiting for financial aid offers that come in March and then having until August to pay the bill.""My phone is ringing off the hook,"" says Jodi Okun, president and founder of College Financial Aid Advisors, a consulting service. ""The panic comes from a lot of families not understanding how financial aid works."" For those still crafting a college tuition playbook, here are some tips from the pros: PAYMENT PLANSThe families calling Okun typically have tuition bills of $20,000 or more, and none of them can just write a check. Her top suggestion is to find out fast if the school has a payment plan, because many require families to sign up in May, rather than waiting until August. Otherwise, ""it just becomes a line item in the budget,"" says financial adviser John Scherer of Trinity Financial Planning in Middleton, Wisconsin.Even folks with significant incomes get squeezed. Erika  Safran  (PA:SAF), a New York-based financial planner who runs her own firm, has clients who make $250,000 a year and still have a hard time finding the cash for a $60,000 private-college tuition bill.""It's not always how much you make, it's also where the funds are going,"" Safran says.SPEND DOWN THE 529sSafran's clients usually have about $100,000 set aside in college savings plans, and she encourages them to stretch out the funds so they can keep accumulating value through investment. If your state offers tax deductions for 529 contributions, but does not have a limit on how long the money has to be in the account, you can put money in at the last minute and then spend it right away, says Ryan Fuchs, an adviser with Ifrah Financial Services, based in Little Rock, Arkansas. If you have more than one child, you can also move funds between 529 accounts as needed. ""If it's overfunded for one, you can use it to fund the other,"" says Safran. TAKE THE LOANS About 30 percent of students take federal student loans, according to Sallie Mae, while 7 percent take out private loans. John Scherer and Ryan Fuchs subscribe to the philosophy that families should take whatever subsidized loans you can in the student's name, because the interest is low and does not accumulate until after graduation. Scherer says that some families use this as a carrot and stick incentive - if you do well in school, we will pay off your loans; if you do not, you are on your own. But Erika Safran counters that there is no free lunch, and that families will incur origination fees for any borrowing. So if you have the money, you should pay it up front. RAIDING OTHER ACCOUNTSOn the list of other assets a family might have, Fuchs says many people forget that they can withdraw their Roth IRA contributions (but not the growth) without penalty, as long as the money was there for at least five years. While this impedes retirement savings, ""it can be a good source of quick cash,"" says Fuchs.Next on Fuch's list of the less-good options is a 401(k) loan, which typically can be 50 percent, or up to $50,000, from each parent's account. This option is not ideal if the parent is in a precarious job, will retire before the repayment period is over or it would greatly impede retirement savings. About 1 percent of families take home equity loans, according to Sallie Mae. Safran says this is most palatable for those who can combine it with a refinance. Okun has only had one client who went so far as to sell her house to pay for tuition for her daughter to go to a special opera program. ""Her mom said it had to be the best school no matter what,"" Okun says. (Corrects fourth paragraph to show the percentage who pay out of pocket is 20 percent, not about 25 percent.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

279,"Mar 09, 2016 12:43PM ET",Qatar Air says Pratt & Whitney engines not adequately tested,nan,"By Tim HepherBERLIN (Reuters) - Qatar Airways stepped up its criticism of U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) over delays and technical problems on Wednesday, saying that engines for its Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo aircraft had not been adequately tested.Qatar Airways has refused to take the jets because of engine glitches. Last month it threatened to switch to alternative engine supplier CFM International (PA:SAF) (N:GE).""I don't think this engine was tested adequately, especially for the temperatures in which Qatar Airways will operate,"" Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said.""We will only accept it when we are fully satisfied that it can operate efficiently and safely at Qatar operations (and) ... once we get sufficient performance guarantees and undertakings from both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney,"" he told a news conference at the ITB tourism exhibition in Berlin.""We are at the threshold of the walk-away clause in our contract, but I hope we will not have to exercise this.""Pratt & Whitney had no immediate comment but has said it is on track to eliminate problems with slow engine start-up times and erroneous software messages by June. Meanwhile, industry sources say that more than a dozen part-built A320neo jets are on the ground at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse waiting for their engines before they can be delivered.While keeping up the pressure in public, people familiar with the matter say that Qatar Airways is expected to give the planemaker and its engine supplier more time to fix the problems.""We’re confident that with Pratt & Whitney’s support we will address any early (lessons) and meet our targets,"" Airbus said.OIL FACTORCEO Al Baker disclosed that the airline had earlier deferred delivery of four Airbus A380s by one year when oil prices were high, only to agree to take delivery now prices have dropped.The company would consider exercising options for a further three jets if oil prices remain low, he said, though he warned that oil prices are a ""double-edged sword"" for airlines because premium traffic yields have slipped in the face of weaker business sentiment and a drop in spending by oil producers.On the airline's international ties, Al Baker predicted deeper links with British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG), in which it holds a 10.08 percent stake.Areas for possible cooperation include procurement, computer systems, fuel, insurance and even aircraft buying after a joint Boeing (NYSE:BA) purchase with Emirates in 2013.In Iran, he sees room for expansion after the lifting of sanctions that he said had been unfairly applied to the country's civil aircraft fleet -- an unusual statement from a senior Gulf state official amid rising tensions in the area.""My country has very good relations with Iran and has ... always played a balancing role in the region,"" he said.He dismissed warnings from some analysts that Iran's airspace would be dominated by foreign carriers, saying that ""there is enough demand for everyone"".On a recent trade row with major U.S. carriers, Al Baker taunted his airline's most vocal adversary by saying that a decision to fly to Atlanta would ""rub salt in the wounds"" of Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) but denied it would cause the airline harm.Atlanta-based Delta and others have said that Gulf carriers have received state support that contravenes Open Skies agreements, a charge denied by Gulf airlines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""This will be the most advanced of it kind in Europe,"" Cameron told a joint news conference, saying the project would create significant numbers of jobs in both countries.Each side will contribute equally to the Future Combat Air System project, based on a 120-million-pound joint feasibility study agreed in 2014, official said. Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), along with Dassault Aviation,  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Thales of France, are taking part, they added.France and Britain, both permanent veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council, are engaged in air strikes on Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Hollande and Cameron are also backers of the ""moderate"" Syrian opposition and repeated their concerns that President Bashar al-Assad's forces and allies including Russia were continue to target rebel forces despite a new cessation of hostilities deal.""We are putting pressure on all the players so that the bombings don't start again and that there is a real negotiation in which the opposition has its place,"" Hollande said, referring to inter-Syrian peace talks that are due to resume on March 9 in Geneva.""We need Russia to understand that there is an opposition that should not be confused with Islamic State,"" he said.Both men said it was vital that the government was in place before the Spring to ensure that Islamic State did not use migration routes across the Mediterranean to send fighters from Libya to Europe.

281,"Feb 15, 2016 06:21PM ET",Pratt & Whitney head says jet engine output risks easing,nan,"By Tim HepherSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney's new chief says the performance of suppliers is much better than year ago, easing concerns over its ability to execute a $10 billion gamble on a new engine as it seeks to reclaim a once revered status in the jet industry.But the industry veteran said he knew how to find out whether the company's make-or-break production goals for the latest short-haul airplane engine are under strain.""I will get every engine serial number and will see the parts that are committed and if it supports the engine shipment date,"" Robert Leduc told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow.Speaking after opening a high-tech fan-blade plant in Singapore, Leduc also played down concerns over aircraft demand, saying the company had seen no deferrals or cancellations.Once dominant in commercial aviation, Pratt lost its way in the 1990s after betting on the wrong category of plane and leaving the door open to  General Electric  (N:GE) and its French partner  Safran  (PA:SAF), who now lead sales by volume.It is seeking to regain its position with a fuel efficient engine for jets including the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo as well as Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and the latest model of Embraer.Developed at a cost of $10 billion, the Geared Turbofan engines claim to burn 15 percent less fuel and have already influenced the way some future jet engines are designed.Pratt has sold 7,000 of them and triggered other engine and plane developments. But analysts warn the company still has much to prove as it attempts to increase production seven-fold in the next four years.When the previous president stepped down earlier than expected last month after steering through development, the boss of parent United Technologies (N:UTX) named retired operations expert Leduc to take on the crucial early production phase.It was the second time the no-nonsense 59-year-old had been pulled out of retirement.Returning to Pratt & Whitney's Connecticut offices on Jan. 14, Leduc paid tribute to the advanced design, but told senior staff: ""Now we've got to execute and deliver to our customers. Our reputation depends on it,"" according to a person present.It plans to make 200 Geared Turbofans this year, roughly doubling in 2017. That number will grow close to 1,400 by 2020.GE-Safran venture CFM International also has aggressive output plans, but benefits from an existing supply chain.FIST FIGHTS OVERBoth engine makers are at the forefront of a record output drive that has triggered concerns over the ability of weaker suppliers to keep up.Any slip-ups could affect profit across the sector and Pratt must additionally demonstrate it can execute on an all-new civil project for the first time in years.""I have spent an inordinate amount of time on this in the last four weeks; it was probably my number one priority, digging into the industrial schedule,"" Leduc said.With $22 billion of long-term supply agreements, or 85 percent of its needs now in place, confidence in suppliers has risen in the past year, Leduc said. That allows Pratt to focus most effort on the engines where needed.""We weren't managing that way last year,"" Leduc said.""I think every engine was a fist fight; we didn't have the fidelity around the (supplier) commitments. Now the design is stable; once (that happens) you give your operations a fighting chance to deliver.""Even so, some glitches need to be resolved.The Airbus A320neo missed an end-2015 target for first delivery after it emerged the engines needed longer than usual to start properly, adding precious minutes to turnaround times.A part was redesigned and will be followed by a software fix in 3-4 weeks. But the problem is an example of the slim margin for error in the cut-throat short-haul airline market.Most modern jet engines need 150-180 seconds to start up. Pratt's new engines currently need closer to 350 seconds. By June the goal is to get this to 200 seconds, and by end-year back to normal, a person familiar with the repair plan said.The engines have also faced a problem with sophisticated control software sending erroneous messages to the cockpit, adding extra workload before the plane can take off.Engineers aim to eliminate 65 percent of the rogue messages by April and the rest by June. They are not related to aircraft systems and don't present any safety risk, Leduc said.He said there had been no schedule delays since he took the job last month. Industry sources have cited previous delays and say Airbus is renegotiating some deliveries. Both firms say output will be skewed towards the second half.""I have got a fair amount of confidence in what is going to happen. I think we have got enough fidelity around our plants now and our investment and our supplier commitments that we are confident that we are going to make this ramp-up,"" Leduc said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But industry experts considered the move unusual because the Pratt-engine version of the A321neo is due is to enter service before the version with CFM engines.Airbus said there's no change in plans for delivery, with the Pratt-equipped A321neo still expected to reach customers at the end of 2016, and the CFM-equipped version in early 2017.Pratt & Whitney noted that its Geared Turbofan is already carrying passengers on the smaller Airbus A320neo aircraft, the first version of which was delivered to Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) last month.

(N:UTX) The Pratt engine, which competes with the LEAP, developed a glitch that requires a longer than normal restart procedure under some circumstances.Pratt has said it expects the problem, which requires a three-minute cooling procedure before the engine can be restarted, to be fixed this month. CFM officials said on Friday the LEAP restarts consistently in 50 seconds per engine.The Pratt issue delayed delivery of the first A320neo by several weeks. Pratt and Airbus said on Friday they are in talks with customers about A320neo delivery schedules. Pratt's engine is available on the Airbus A320neo but not the 737 MAX.CFM said it expects to build more than 140 LEAP engines and about 1,700 CFM56 engines this year.

Boeing has sold 3,072 of the planes and is racing to sell more as it battles for market share against rival Airbus's (PA:AIR) competing A320neo, which earlier this month was delivered to its first customer, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).Boeing is expected to deliver its first 737 MAX to customers in 2017. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) is scheduled to be the first airline to add the 737 MAX to its fleet. The first flight of the plane, which is filled with test equipment, was expected to last about 2 1/2 hours.

287,"Jan 20, 2016 12:48PM ET",Revamped Airbus A320neo debuts as oil slide continues,nan,"By Tim HepherDUBLIN (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus said on Wednesday it had delivered the first A320neo, a fuel-efficient upgrade of its best-selling jetliner, to German carrier Lufthansa.The delivery marks the culmination of a five-year plan to give a new lease of life to Airbus's profitable A320 narrowbody jet family by revamping it with new engines.The handover is a boost for United Technologies (N:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney, whose decision to develop a new generation of engines accelerated plane projects from Canada to Russia and triggered a heavyweight riposte from Airbus and Boeing (N:BA).Both have amassed thousands of new orders and shored up their domination of the global jet market by refreshing their short-haul models, though Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer continue to compete hard for sales. But the arrival of the first re-engined jet coincides with a slump in oil prices that has sparked debate over the sustainability of demand for fuel-saving jets, as well as financial market losses caused by concerns over the economy.Aircraft financiers have been busy for the past few years bankrolling orders of the A320neo and Boeing's rival 737 MAX, due to enter service in 2017.But at the industry's annual gathering in Dublin this week, financiers have been split over what the slide in oil prices from $114 a barrel in June 2014, to barely $28 today, means for both demand and the revenues linked to the two revamped models.Brent crude fell 4 percent on Wednesday to $25.54 a barrel.""There's plenty of competition for A320neos, but it's not as keen as it once was,"" said Gueric Dechavanne, vice president for commercial aviation services at Collateral Verifications, an aircraft valuation company.""People are not willing to overpay for a plane; there's a lot more caution out there,"" he said. For some airlines and major leasing firms, the aircraft is still an effective hedge against a new rebound in oil prices.""It is just 15 months since oil was at $100, and that is not lost on airlines. The only way to manage that over the longer term is to have a modern asset, so I don't see any let-up in demand for new aircraft,"" Aengus Kelly, chief executive of AerCap, the world's largest independent lessor, said.""If a CEO of an airline is looking at taking aircraft for the next 12-14 years he will never trust in fuel staying at these prices.""The jet was delivered after a delay of three weeks caused by what Airbus officials described as problems with documentation.Qatar Airways earlier refused to take the first aircraft, sacrificing its place at the head of the queue to a European rival, after balking at lingering teething problems.The plane is also offered with alternative engines supplied by French-American joint-venture CFM International, owned by  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The LEAP engine was developed by CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France's Snecma ( Safran  (PA:SAF)) .The ultra-light materials also will be used in military engines, GE9X engines for Boeing's 777X jetliner and gas-fired power turbines, GE said.With $21.9 million in U.S. Air Force funding, one of the factories will make silicon carbon fibers under license from NGS Advanced Fibers, a joint venture of Nippon Carbon Co Ltd, Safran and GE.The adjacent plant will make ceramic matrix composite (CMC) tape, a long, stiff material that will be used by GE's recently finished plant in Asheville, North Carolina, to make jet engine parts.Construction on a 100-acre site is scheduled to start in mid-2016. Production is due to start in 2018. The factories will eventually employ 300 workers.The factories will supply more CMC materials as GE and CFM ramp up engine production. CFM expects to turn out 1,800 LEAP engines a year by the end of the decade, GE said. CMC parts resist higher temperatures and have about one-third the weight of current metal alloys, so their use in the engine's high-pressure turbine would make it more fuel-efficient, GE said.CMC is a significant shift in engine materials away from heavier metal alloys, GE said, noting it has been developing CMC for more than two decades.""We pretty much got to the point where you run out of the capability of metal,"" said Sanjay Correa, vice president of the CMC program at GE Aviation.

292,"Oct 21, 2015 05:40PM ET","Exclusive: China-made regional jet set for delivery, but no U.S. certification",nan,"By Siva Govindasamy and Matthew MillerSINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's first domestically designed passenger jet will be delivered without U.S. certification, a potential dent to both the aircraft's international credibility and to joint safety efforts by Chinese and U.S. regulators.The Comac ARJ-21 regional jet, which can seat up to 90 passengers, received the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) type certification last December and will be delivered to launch customer Chengdu Airlines shortly, two people familiar with the plane's program told Reuters.The plane will fly without U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification despite a five-year effort to have the FAA endorse CAAC's certification procedures, the people said.An FAA type certificate would have boosted the reputation of the airplane's developer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) and cleared the way for the plane to be sold and operated globally - though expectations for foreign sales had been low. Without it, the aircraft can operate only in China and some Asian, African and South American countries that recognize the CAAC's certificate. Chengdu Airlines, a low-cost carrier, is expected to fly the plane on commercial domestic operations in the first quarter of 2016. Comac has received nearly 350 orders for the ARJ-21, mainly from Chinese airlines and leasing firms.SHADOWINGSince 2010, the FAA has undertaken a shadow certification process to assess the CAAC's ability to conduct a technical assessment of aircraft. But tensions arose between the two regulators last year over various technical and bureaucratic issues, before the process ended in early 2015, those familiar with the program said.People close to Comac believe the FAA also was dragging its feet in part because of bilateral political and economic considerations. ""While the CAAC wanted to learn from the FAA, they felt the Americans were too rigid and unnecessarily delaying things. And the longer the delay, the greater the embarrassment to the Chinese,"" said one of those individuals.However, a CAAC official responsible for certification and people close to the FAA stressed that the two regulators were still working to resolve outstanding issues as a ""top priority"".In an emailed response to Reuters for this article, the FAA said the ARJ-21 was never intended to be certificated by the FAA under the shadow evaluation process, and Comac planned a derivative model of the plane to comply with FAA standards.""The FAA enjoys a good working relationship with CAAC and we continue to work together to develop a path to work towards certification of the derivative model of the ARJ-21 and, possibly, the C919,"" the FAA said referring to a narrow-body jet China is developing to compete with the Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 and Boeing (N:BA) 737 models.Also, the FAA said it could certify an airplane after it enters service if it can be shown to comply with all relevant airworthiness and manufacturing standards.AVIATION COOPERATIONPutting the ARJ-21 into service without FAA certification would be a setback to U.S. and China aviation cooperation, arguably one of the outstanding achievements since the two governments re-established diplomatic relations in 1979.Chinese airlines have bought hundreds of Boeing jets as the country's aviation sector opened up and boomed, and Boeing plans to open a completions and delivery centre in China for its 737 aircraft, its first plant outside the United States.U.S. aerospace firms have also invested heavily in China, and companies such as  General Electric  (N:GE), Rockwell Collins (N:COL), Honeywell (N:HON) and United Technologies (N:UTX) are suppliers for the ARJ-21 and C919 jet.""It could be seen as a loss of face for the Chinese given they deem FAA certification a key rite of passage for what will be the first domestically built jet to enter commercial service,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal, an industry news and data service.Comac could eventually ask the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to certify the ARJ-21 once it has been delivered, and ask it to help with the C919 as well, the people familiar with the program said.""Given the effort and prestige China is pouring into the C919, getting FAA or EASA certification is a definite requirement both for the image of the program and the ambition to garner foreign sales,"" said Waldron.""We don't know if and when the Chinese authority will apply to us for a certification,"" an EASA spokesman said.""LEARNING EXPERIENCE""China has been working for 40 years to produce and deliver a homegrown commercial airliner.It first developed the Y-10, a four-engined jet, in the 1970s but never delivered it to customers. It has exported some MA-60 turboprop planes, a civil version of the license-produced Soviet-designed Antonov AN-24 military transport.Comac plans to eventually upgrade the ARJ-21 so it's closer in performance to regional jets made by Embraer (SA:EMBR3), Mitsubishi Aircraft (T:8058) and Bombardier (TO:BBDb).The current version of the ARJ-21 and the program itself is a ""learning experience,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. ""Any airline forced to operate this jet will be at a severe competitive disadvantage against any airline with a modern aircraft.""That means China's hopes may rest on the C919.Comac aims to complete its flight test and certification program in less than half the time it took with the ARJ-21, say those familiar with the company's plans.""It has engaged foreign suppliers experienced in global aircraft programs with Airbus and Boeing much earlier, and they're far more involved in the C919,"" said one of those familiar with the program.""FAA or EASA certification would legitimize the program and create interesting new opportunities for China's aerospace sector. Such certification would be a watershed development,"" added Waldron at Flightglobal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

293,"Oct 20, 2015 12:10PM ET",Airbus taps Siemens executive to run defense business,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Georgina ProdhanPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has named  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) executive Dirk Hoke as the next head of its Defence and Space division, recruiting an industrial high-flyer with no previous aerospace experience to regenerate its second-largest division.Hoke, 46, will join Europe's largest aerospace group in January and progressively take over from Bernhard Gerwert, who is due to retire in mid-2016, Airbus said on Tuesday.The recruitment of the former  Renault  (PA:RENA) research engineer from his role as head of Siemens' Customer Services Division will reduce the average age of the 15-member Airbus Group executive committee, populated mainly by aerospace veterans in their late fifties or older, to below 55.He will learn the ropes during the first quarter of next year and take over from Gerwert on April 1, Airbus said, adding that Gerwert will continue to advise him until June at least.Hoke's appointment reflects efforts by Airbus CEO Tom Enders to reach beyond aerospace as it contends with competition from other high-tech companies and pressures to adapt to digital manufacturing techniques.Enders said Hoke is ""well equipped for a world and business environment that is ever more accelerating"" and noted his experience in project management and services.Speaking to Siemens investors in 2013, Hoke hailed a ""manufacturing renaissance"" but emphasized the importance of reducing lead times from concept to market -- a perennial headache for a defense industry that is plagued by costly delays.At Airbus he will face challenges including slow deliveries of the A400M military airlifter and questions over strategy for drones and the long-term future of the Eurofighter jet, which is also backed by BAE Systems (L:BAES) and  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI).He joins at a tough time for Europe's defense industry, which is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back military spending. The Munich-based Defence & Space division was recently combined and slimmed down under Gerwert to focus on warplanes, missiles, satellites and space rockets.It reported a loss on flat revenue in the first half but remains the group's second-largest division by sales and orders behind the commercial aircraft business. By recruiting from one of a handful of German groups famed for grooming the country's elite managers, analysts said that Enders appeared to have recognized the lack of a younger generation of German-born industrial leaders inside his group.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

303,"Jul 30, 2015 04:06PM ET",Airbus seeks to rebuild trust as A400M systems fall short,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group has told buyer nations of the A400M transporter aircraft that it cannot deliver all of its high-tech defenses according to plan, casting a shadow over some of its military uses as Europe battles growing instability on its borders.The troop and cargo lifter was developed at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion) for seven European NATO nations and is already in service with French forces in Mali. Other core buyers include Belgium, Britain, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey. Malaysia is so far the only export customer.Some of the state-of-the-art systems designed to warn of threats such as missiles or hostile radar are more difficult than expected to develop, handing buyers a choice between taking planes or waiting for upgrades, European defense sources said.But after years of political disputes and technical problems, a new military-aircraft management at Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is working flat out to rebuild trust worn down by delays and overruns that are typical of large defense projects.An internal audit and regular updates appear to be paying off, people close to the talks said, with fewer visible signs of tensions that have led to costly stand-offs in the past.A new setback came with the fatal crash of a plane being prepared for delivery to Turkey in May. Investigators are looking into a possible accidental data wipe.Ankara is negotiating with other A400M buyers to see whether it could get a replacement aircraft by swapping deliveries as it steps up its military role in the region, defense sources said.Although production is back to normal, a clampdown on some testing after the crash led to new development delays of up to three months, erasing the remaining ""buffer,"" they said.Even though the destroyed plane was insured, some analysts expect Airbus to take a further modest provision on the A400M with its results on Friday, adding to 4.76 billion euros of charges already generated by Europe's biggest defense project.Airbus declined any comment ahead of the results.SUMMER NEGOTIATIONSA senior executive told Reuters in comments published this week that Airbus was confident of meeting the upper end of its revised production goal of 13 to 17 planes this year, following the accident, but declined further comment.The group appears certain it can deliver 13 of those planes, leaving 10 to deliver for the rest of the year.The remaining four are the subject of negotiations over how many customized features should be slotted in and when, with France, Germany and Britain seen at the center of the debate.Airbus met buyer nations this week and several weeks of negotiations lie ahead, sources in two capitals said.Although some of the plane's advanced defenses will be later than planned, European defense sources say buyers have been assured it can tackle shoulder-held weapons held by non-state actors that are one of the region's pressing threats.One of the A400M's other roles is dropping parachutists.Free-jumping from the side doors has been approved but dropping paratroopers from both sides at once to speed up penetration of territory has introduced the risk of collision. Airbus is testing new parachutes to try to avoid this.Despite the flaws, supporters stress the A400M, which shot to the attention of the public in an action movie premiere last week, remains more sophisticated even than some fighters.However, Airbus has had to admit to buyers that refueling helicopters will be 'mission impossible' any time soon, because the shape of the plane subjects choppers to too much turbulence when tethered on their relatively short fuel hoses.France, which views this as crucial for its special forces, is considering buying  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130s, one of the planes the A400M was designed to replace, to address this gap.The setback could raise questions over ambitions to export the plane to the United States which uses C-130s to refill Black Hawks, though future research might overcome this -- at a cost.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

306,"Jul 23, 2015 01:32PM ET","Rheinmetall, Thales interested in Airbus sensor business ",nan,"By Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German defense group  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG) and French peer  Thales  (PA:TCFP) are among several groups interested in a defense electronics business that plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) is selling in an effort to streamline its operations, sources familiar with the transaction said. The two companies as well as U.S.-based Raytheon (N:RTN) and a number of private equity groups including Carlyle (O:CG), Bridgepoint, CVC, KKR (N:KKR), KPS and Triton are expected to hand in tentative offers for the Airbus business by a Friday deadline, they said. The price tag on the sale, dubbed ""Orlando"", which is led by investment bank Evercore (N:EVR), may reach up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), the people said. Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace group, is currently selling several businesses to focus its defense division on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites.Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine declined to comment on any specific talks, but told analysts that such opportunities were difficult to predict. ""Defense deals can only be opportunistic; it is too complex to make firm bets on a defense deal,"" he said in a conference call when asked about the company's criteria for expansion.A Rheinmetall spokesman said the company was following the divestment activities of Airbus, declining to comment further. The other companies and private equity investors all declined to comment. Europe's defense industry is struggling as most governments are keeping a lid on military spending and the asset sales are part of efforts announced by Airbus last year to sell half a dozen businesses with combined annual revenues of around 2 billion euros. The move breaks with the company's previous efforts to diversify into security activities and halts investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals. The business up for sale under the ""Orlando"" deal makes components for radars, optronics, electronic warfare and border control applications and has about 100 million euros in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on 1 billion euros in sales. The products are used, for example, in surveillance or for equipment that helps pilots to fly in fog or at night.Acquiring the business would allow Airbus's European defense peers to boost activities in an important area. But after looking at the initial information packages on the deal, some potential buyers said they doubted the business's financial prospects and did not expect it to sell at a high valuation.Although widely seen as a less likely outcome, defense sources said selling the sensors business to a non-European buyer would deal a further blow to the controversial Euro Hawk reconnaissance drone, which has been in limbo since Germany canceled it in 2013 over high costs. There have been reports that Berlin might revive the drone, developed by U.S. contractor  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC). But giving up manufacturing control of the drone's sensors could erode its European content and make other alternatives more attractive.The will to keep technology and jobs within certain regions, may hand German bidders good chances, as the business is significantly Germany-based, one of the sources said.But a third person said that any buyer would be sensitive to these matters and the nationality of the bidders did not really say much about qualities as a long-term owner.VIZADA In a separate deal, led by Lazard (N:LAZ), Airbus is selling part of its satellite communications arm Vizada and has attracted interest from groups including Thales and  Alcatel  (PA:ALUA) in a potential 700-800 million euro deal, people familiar with that transaction said. Disposals of other smaller businesses are also gaining pace. Airbus is in talks with a German investor over the sale of its ESG Elektroniksystem und Logistik business, which has about 250 million euros in sales, a person familiar with the matter said. Atlas Elektronik, a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG), also remains on the list of possible disposals. The German steelmaker is ready to buy the remaining stake in the supplier of sonar systems for maritime security it does not already own, but only at a price it deems reasonable, a person familiar with that process said.Last month, Airbus also sold a further stake in Elbe Flugzeugwerke to Singapore-based ST Aerospace, which now controls 55 percent of the maker of freight aeroplane components.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

310,"Jun 18, 2015 03:55PM ET",Airbus steals show with last-minute $14 billion Wizz deal,nan,"By Victoria Bryan and Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) won the Paris Airshow with a last-minute $14 billion deal to sell 110 jets to Hungary's Wizz Air on Thursday, diverting attention from a growing industry debate over how quickly a record backlog of jet orders can be built.The deal, sealed in an all-night negotiating session with ordered-in pizza, avoided a rare defeat for the France-based planemaker at its home arena and is expected to be followed by orders for dozens of A330 jets from China in weeks to come.Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) CEO Jozsef Varadi made light of the marathon but is likely to have received a steep discount for his A321neo jets, after Boeing (N:BA) bid aggressively and Airbus appeared to be facing a disappointing end to a subdued week.""I don't like these air shows, because every time I come I buy something,"" Varadi joked in front of beaming Airbus officials at a hurriedly arranged news conference.Airbus ended the trade part of the June 15-21 show with orders and commitments for 421 aircraft worth $57 billion, against 331 aircraft worth $50.2 billion for Boeing. In terms of firm orders, Boeing came out on top with 154 worth $20.2 billion, against 124 for Airbus worth $16.3 billion.Although the competition had been running behind the scenes for some months, a Wizz Air deal was not expected to be ready in time for the show. ""This was higher than I personally expected,"" Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus Group's planemaking division, said of the total orders. Going into the show, Airbus had the lead over Boeing in plane orders, with 247 so far this year versus Boeing's 175. That had looked set to change at Le Bourget outside Paris as Boeing sold 100 jets to leasing company AerCap (N:AER).Boeing also produced a flourish apparently timed to coincide with the show, announcing a preliminary deal for 20 of its 747-8 freighters from Russian cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group.The deal supplies a lifeline to a programme that had been running out of orders.Many analysts believe the commercial jet market is slowing after riding out the financial crisis due to demand in Asia.But Airbus and Boeing executives expressed confidence in the market and said they were on course to reach their targets of selling at least as many planes as they make this year.Many delegates described the show as muted, with the focus on how manufacturers and suppliers can execute on almost a decade's worth of orders, rather than on winning new deals. SUPPLIER TENSIONSThe show revealed some tensions between planemakers and suppliers.  General Electric  (N:GE) said it wanted to secure a record increase in engine production for single-aisle planes before deciding whether it could go higher, echoing comments from partner  Safran  (PA:SAF).""One gets the feeling the airframers are pushing up against the limits of what the supply chain is willing to do,"" analyst Nick Cunningham said. Bregier said suppliers risked losing business if they did not wish to go along with still-higher production rates and sales chief John Leahy pointed out Airbus had two engine suppliers for its single-aisle planes. ""In this business we need to take risks and I have to educate my partners that when I take risks, these risks are well under control and they have to share that with me,"" Bregier said.Airbus shares, down 3 percent earlier on Thursday as the euro strengthened against the U.S. dollar, pared gains and closed down 0.5 percent. Boeing shares traded up 1 percent. Manufacturers made no major product announcements at the show. Airbus said it was still considering whether to re-engine or slightly stretch its A380 superjumbo and reiterated it was studying whether to expand its A350-1000 twin-engined long-haul jet, but no decision is expected soon.Boeing said it had not yet decided whether to invest in a middle-market jet to fill a gap in a potentially lucrative part of the market, which includes its 757, which is nearing retirement.The new management of smaller planemaker Bombardier (TO:BBDb) showed off the new CSeries jet for the first time at an air show. It did not win any new orders for the plane, which represents its push to compete in the market for smaller narrow-body jets dominated by Boeing and Airbus.The Canadian firm had tempered expectations in advance of the show, saying it did not expect any orders for the CSeries in Paris. It did, though, announce test results showing the plane performing better than expected.""They need to be getting orders at this stage so they helped brace the market for it, but it's not good news anyway,"" said Espirito Santo Investment Bank analyst Edward Stacey.Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) had a solid show with 50 orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

311,"Jun 16, 2015 10:04AM ET",Commercial plane orders slow; jetmakers focus on backlog,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Andrea ShalalPARIS (Reuters) - The boom in commercial plane orders of recent years appears to be giving way to a more sustainable pace of demand at the 2015 Paris air show, with jetmakers increasingly focused on lifting production to meet their record backlog of sales.U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) continued to unveil a steady stream of deals on Tuesday, day two of the aerospace industry's main annual gathering.Boeing announced the biggest firm order of the event so far, with Dutch aircraft leasing company AerCap (N:AER) buying 100 737 MAX 8 jets in a deal worth $10.7 billion at list prices, confirming a Reuters report.Industry sources also said Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) would split a $6 billion order for 60 jets between Airbus and Boeing.However, the number and size of the deals to date is below that of many recent trade shows, when cheap borrowing costs and strong growth in passenger numbers encouraged airlines to splash out on new, more fuel-efficient planes.""The market is definitely slowing,"" said Sash Tusa, aerospace and defense analyst at Agency Partners. ""There are fewer orders this week than there have been at any air show in recent years. Manufacturers are going to have to fight much harder for what's available.""Some moderation in demand had been widely anticipated. Industry sources told Reuters on the eve of the show that, barring any last-minute surprises, Airbus and Boeing might struggle to announce 500 orders between them, compared with 697 at the Farnborough event last year with which Paris takes turns.There seems little prospect of a sharp deterioration in demand, however. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet sales on Monday, citing the rapid expansion of airlines in Asia and the Middle East and echoing a similarly upbeat outlook from Boeing last week.But the biggest challenge facing planemakers now is to ramp up production to meet the record $1.8 billion of orders they have booked for the coming decade. Boeing is already planning to increase output of its popular 737 narrow-body jet to 52 a month in 2018 from 42 currently. Its commercial airplanes chief, Ray Conner, said on Tuesday the company would be cautious about taking any decision to raise production towards 60 a month - a level mooted as possible for both Airbus and Boeing.PRUDENT ON PRODUCTION""We are going to be very prudent in how we approach any rates above 52. It feels like the demand is higher than that, but that can be short-lived. So we are ... going to see how things progress,"" he told reporters. ""The worst thing for any of us is to oversupply; our intention is to not oversupply.""Conner also issued a warning to Airbus following reports the European group might apply for government loans to develop a revamped version of its A380 superjumbo.""Whether they go forward with that, we will address as it comes along. That would not be in line with what the WTO (World Trade Organization) has said,"" he said.The United States and Europe have been in a long-running trade dispute over mutual accusations of aircraft subsidies, with the row now evolving into one over whether each side has complied with WTO rulings. In a bid to revive flagging sales of the A380, the world's biggest passenger jet, Airbus is in talks with customers about possibly adding new engines or making a version with about 50 more seats.Away from passenger jets, Airbus said on Tuesday it would start a two-year development phase for a new helicopter aimed at improving fuel-efficiency and comfort for civilian customers in markets such as search and rescue and the energy sector.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

312,"Jun 09, 2015 04:20PM ET",Exclusive: A400M probe focuses on impact of accidental data wipe,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - A tiny piece of data needed to run the West's largest turboprop engines is at the center of a complex chain of events under scrutiny following an Airbus A400M military plane crash last month, several people familiar with the matter said.The troop and cargo carrier crashed outside Seville, Spain, on May 9 after three of its huge turboprop engines froze just minutes into a routine, pre-delivery test flight, killing four of its six crew members.At the heart of the investigation are crucial computer files that tell Europe's new military carrier, developed at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22.50-billion), how to control its four engines, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Computers operating each engine cannot work if this data, which is unique to each of the turboprops, is missing.Investigations are at an early stage but the key scenario being examined is that the data -- known as ""torque calibration parameters"" -- was accidentally wiped on three engines as the engine software was being installed at Airbus facilities.An Airbus spokeswoman said the investigation was continuing and it was too early draw conclusions. ""Safety is our first priority and we will do all that is necessary to get the full picture of what could have led to this tragic accident and take the necessary action,"" she said, declining comment on any of the points in this article.European NATO buyers have now been instructed not to use the Airbus computer system that was used to conduct the software installation on the A400M, people familiar with the order said.Investigators are poring over maintenance records to see how safety procedures failed to notice the erased parameters.But the combination of lost data and incomplete checks may also have exposed a vulnerability in the amount of information provided to the pilots as they prepared for the maiden flight of the plane, which had been sold to Turkey.Under the A400M's design, the first warning pilots would receive of the engine data problem would be when the plane was 400 feet (120 meters) in the air, according to a safety document seen by Reuters. On the ground, there is no cockpit alert.That system has been in place since the A400M first flew in 2009. It was reviewed last year as the latest engine software was being released, but regulators approved it on the basis that the chances of failure were small and the installation procedure included extra checks, people familiar with the matter said.The European Aviation Safety Agency, which is responsible for A400M certification, declined to comment.A spokesman for Europrop International, a consortium of Rolls-Royce,  Safran  (PARIS:SAF), MTU Aero Engines and ITP, which makes the engine and its control software, referred all questions to Airbus.It is not unusual for engineers, facing finite resources, to focus on known risks and manage remote ones by putting extra checks in place, like the ones that appeared to fail the A400M.Yet as the pilots took off, another safety feature came into play only to turn against the crew, industry experts said.Without the vital data parameters, information from the engines is effectively meaningless to the computers controlling them. The automatic response is to hunker down and prevent what would usually be a single engine problem causing more damage.This is what the computers apparently did on the doomed flight, just as they were designed to do.""Nobody imagined a problem like this could happen to three engines,"" a person familiar with the 12-year-old project said.Europe's EASA has since issued an emergency warning of ""reduced control of an aeroplane"" if two or more engines are affected in this way, people familiar with the action said. A spokesman for EASA confirmed it had sent an unpublished directive to A400M buyers, but declined further comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is powered by the West's largest turboprop engines, designed by Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) of Germany.Problems in developing the engines, and particularly in certifying the engine control software, contributed to three years of delays and a new cash injection by governments in 2010.The Electronic Control Unit is one of two pieces of complex software that make up the engine control system, or FADEC, whose development was led by Munich-based MTU Aero Engines.The crash came amid new delays in fitting the aircraft with military systems and raised further questions over the timing of deliveries after Spain suspended pre-delivery test flights.Airbus has said the deliveries are ""under review"".

Trappier said there were no plans to revert to the previous proposal of splitting the two roles, which had been designed to reconcile differences between core shareholders Dassault and the French government over who should run Thales.Trappier also said Dassault intends to remain a shareholder in Thales for the long term, but does not seek a majority stake, something that would require a new shareholder pact.""The less we talk to the government, the better things go as far as that subject is concerned,"" he said.Dassault owns 25.3 percent of Europe's largest defence electronics group and has a shareholder pact with the French government, which owns 26.4 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

321,"May 11, 2015 01:49PM ET",Airbus shares fall after A400M military plane crash,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Sarah MorrisPARIS/MADRID (Reuters) - Shares in Airbus Group (PA:AIR) fell on Monday after the fatal crash of an A400M military plane weighed on Europe's largest and repeatedly delayed defense project, while the planemaker pledged to overcome the tragedy.The huge military plane crashed outside Seville on Saturday, killing four crew and prompting Britain, Germany, Malaysia and Turkey to ground their fleets of Europe's new troop and cargo carrier..France said it would keep flying its planes, while Airbus pledged to resume flight testing on Tuesday with the head of its military aircraft business, Fernando Alonso, on board.There was no official word on the cause of the crash but investigators' attention was expected to focus partly on the plane's turboprop powerplants. Germany's Der Spiegel magazine reported that one of the survivors had said the plane suffered ""multiple engine trouble"" shortly after takeoff.A source familiar with the matter confirmed that engines were one of the areas under scrutiny following the testimony but stressed it was too early to say what had caused the crash, with the crucial black box flight recorders yet to be analyzed.Airbus declined to comment. ""We have to wait for the results of the investigation,"" a spokeswoman said.Shares in Europe's largest aerospace group, which hit a record high in April, fell as much as 4.5 percent before closing at 62.09 euros, down 2.1 percent. The A400M Atlas was developed for seven European NATO nations -- Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey -- at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion).So far Malaysia is the only export customer.The plane entered service in 2013, more than three years behind schedule, and just 12 of 174 aircraft sold have been delivered.Problems in the development of the West's largest turboprop engines helped to generate billions of euros of cost overruns and a bailout by the seven launch nations in 2010.New technical problems with A400M military features surfaced last year, leading to fresh delays and a management shake-up.People with direct knowledge of the matter have said the plane suffered engine problems on its maiden flight in December 2009, delaying its landing in front of hundreds of VIPs.The engines were supplied by a European consortium of Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), MTU Aero Engines of Germany (DE:MTXGn) and Spanish aerospace firm Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP). The consortium was picked after European politicians objected to Airbus's proposal of an imported engine from Canada.MTU, which had borne the brunt of criticism over the earlier development problems, declined to comment on Spiegel's report.FRESH CONCERNAnalysts said the first A400M accident raised fresh concerns about deliveries and long-term exports of the plane, but Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders reaffirmed the company's commitment to the program as he paid tribute to the crew.In a letter to staff seen by Reuters, Enders said testing would resume as planned on Tuesday to ""demonstrate to our customers, the air forces, that we fully trust this great transport plane and are as committed to the program and the further ramp-up of deliveries and capabilities as ever.""Enders asked the company's 137,000 employees to observe a minute's silence for the captain, co-pilot and two test engineers who died in the crash. Two others remain in hospital.""The men who lost their lives in Sevilla were great professionals; they knew about the risks of their job and they would not want us to stop flying,"" he said.A memorial service was expected to be held in Seville's cathedral on Tuesday.In February, Airbus took 551 million euros in charges for the latest A400M delays, bringing the total company charges over the lifetime of the project to more than 4.75 billion euros.""Airbus can ill afford more delays,"" Hamburg stockbroker Berenberg said in a note.""Longer-term, this latest development will almost certainly hamper the ability to sell A400M in the export markets, the only way this program will ever make any money.""People close to the project expressed concerns over the impact of the crash on morale in the Spanish production plant.The crashed aircraft was due to be delivered to Turkey and was on its maiden test flight when it plowed into a field one mile (1.6 km) north of Seville's San Pablo airport.Alonso, the newly promoted head of Airbus Group's military aircraft business, said Airbus stood ready to assist investigators following the recovery of two black boxes.""At the same time we will give our total support to the investigating authorities and urge them for initial results as soon as possible,"" Alonso said in a staff memo.But the status of the investigation remained uncertain, with conflicting reports about who would be responsible for the probe. Three sources said the black boxes were being held by judicial authorities, delaying a start to the enquiry.A person briefed on the matter said late on Monday that the Spanish government had commissioned the country's military authorities to carry out the crash investigation.(This story has been refiled to add dropped reference to closing shares)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

322,"May 09, 2015 04:59PM ET","Airbus A400M military transporter crashes on test flight, killing four",nan,"By Marcelo del PozoSEVILLE, Spain (Reuters) - An Airbus (PA:AIR) A400M military transport plane crashed outside Seville on Saturday, killing four test crew and prompting Britain and Germany to ground Europe's new troop and cargo carrier.The aircraft was due to be delivered to another NATO customer, Turkey, and was on its maiden test flight when it crashed in a field one mile (1.6 km) north of Seville's San Pablo airport. It was the first ever crash of an A400M.Airbus said four Spanish employees had been killed and two surviving crew were in hospital in serious condition. The newspaper El Pais said the crew had detected a fault and asked permission to land, but hit an electricity pylon while attempting an emergency landing. Tracking data from the Flightradar24 website indicated the plane had wheeled to the left before coming down.An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on possible causes. Airbus said it had sent a team to investigate.The crash delivers a fresh blow to Europe's largest defense project, which is still struggling to overcome delays and cost overruns that led to a bailout by European governments in 2010.Britain and Germany said they were suspending A400M flights while they awaited more information on what caused the crash.A plume of black smoke rose from the site, where hardly anything was left of the plane amid black, scorched earth.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, speaking to journalists near the site, asked for maximum transparency from Airbus on the reasons for the crash. ""An incident like this is not the best for our industry ... It remains to be seen if it was purely circumstantial or if a mistake was made,"" he said, adding that the Spanish defense minister would meet his German and French counterparts on Sunday to discuss the incident.The A400M Atlas was developed for Spain and six other European NATO nations - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Turkey - at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22 billion), making it Europe's biggest single arms contract. It entered service in 2013 after a delay of more than three years.BUYER COMPLAINTSThe launch nations have ordered a total of 170 A400Ms. Malaysia, the plane's only export customer, has ordered four.The planes, costing just over 100 million euros each, are assembled in Spain, which has long sought to emerge from France and Germany's shadow within Europe's largest aerospace company.Problems in delivering the planes on time, and with all the required military features on board, resurfaced last year, triggering a management shake-up and more financial charges.After receiving stinging criticism from both Germany and Turkey over the delays, Airbus hoped it was finally turning the corner, with an executive saying last week that it hoped soon to get a second export customer soon..There was no immediate word on whether the accident would result in the halting of test flights, which could mean further delivery delays, nor whether the A400M would be grounded by its other current operators: France, Malaysia and Turkey.Designed to put troops and heavy equipment into remote battlefields or carry out humanitarian missions, the aircraft was intended to fill a gap between the smaller  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 Hercules and the Boeing (N:BA) C-17 cargo jet.It is powered by the West's largest turboprop engines, supplied by Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), MTU Aero Engines of Germany (DE:MTXGn) and Spanish aerospace firm Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP). Problems in developing these were blamed for much of the delay.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

323,"Apr 21, 2015 09:42AM ET",Safran faces AGM heat as revolt over French Florange law widens,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms are threatening to block key financial resolutions at French aerospace group  Safran  (PA:SAF), opening a second front in a battle between the French government and institutional investors over a new corporate law.The so-called Florange law is already at the center of a fierce debate over moves to introduce double voting rights for long-term shareholders in French companies to encourage stability.Safran has been able to sidestep the row over ""one share, one vote"" at companies such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) because it already has a system of double-voting for long-term investors that operates smoothly.But it is facing an investor revolt over a second, less publicized, provision of the law that grants more discretion to boards of French companies to repel takeover bids.Proxies representing big investors say they will vote against resolutions granting share issuance authority at Safran's shareholder meeting on Thursday, because they fail to suspend board powers to issue shares whenever a bid is imminent.Such share issues dilute a predator's stake and are seen by their critics as a form of ""poison pill"" that can hurt valuations. The government says clipping the wings of predators is part of its drive to focus on the ""real economy"".""Poison pills limit the powers of decision of shareholders and it is not up to the board to decide for them,"" said Hugo Dubourg, corporate governance analyst at France's Proxinvest.To many, the debate over Safran may seem academic: the maker of engines for France's nuclear missiles is already shielded by decrees protecting the defense sector from hostile bids.It's not the only company where proxy firms are gearing up for a fight over board authority to issue shares, with construction firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) also in the firing line.But Thursday's Safran meeting is seen as a potential test case for companies where the French state has a direct stake, setting the scene for a new clash over the Florange Law which groups a number of measures to make the economy less volatile.Safran and Bouygues declined comment.POWER SHIFTThe debate follows a fundamental change of French policy on the power balance between boards and shareholders during bids.Previously in France, the routine shareholder approvals allowing boards to issue shares were suspended in the face of a bid, under a principle known as ""board neutrality"".The term can seem misleading since boards have always been free to make their opinions heard, but until now they could not deploy share defenses without new backing from stockholders.Under the new law, a board can issue shares using existing approvals, even when a bid is imminent or under way. ""Before Florange, a board's hands were tied in the event of a bid and all powers were centralized in the hands of shareholders,"" said Hubert Segain, a Paris partner of international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.""This was the opposite of the Delaware principle, which gives primacy to the boards of quoted companies in the United States.""In an effort to soften the impact, resolutions to be put before Safran's AGM would allow the board to issue shares during a bid, but would limit this to 9.6 percent of the capital.But firms like Proxinvest and French corporate governance association AFG want shareholders to be consulted on all takeover defenses as a matter of principle.Institutional Shareholder Services, the world's largest proxy advisory firm, has urged investors in French companies to vote against financial resolutions ""if they can be used for anti-takeover purposes without shareholders' approval"".Several French companies have added the limitation sought by proxy firms. Safran, in which the French government owns 18 percent, is the first state-backed firm to ask shareholders to approve the extra board freedoms set out in the new law.Despite opposition, some say Safran's proposed 9.6 percent ceiling could reassure investors that the law can be enforced without driving a wedge between shareholders and the board. ""It's not so much a poison pill as a dose of cough medicine,"" said one French financial source.(The story was refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 10)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

324,"Apr 17, 2015 09:22AM ET","Airbus upbeat on jet market, still studying A380 upgrade",nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) sees continued strength in the aircraft market and may be able to increase production of its most popular jets beyond their planned rates if that trend continues, the head of the European planemaker said on Friday.Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the plane making unit of Airbus Group, said he believed Airbus would eventually recapture the top plane making slot from Boeing (NYSE:BA) as its new A350 jet comes into its own, but market share came second to profitable growth.Airbus is well placed to deliver 15 of the wide-body A350 planes this year and continues to expect more orders than deliveries in 2015, he said in Paris at a briefing to French aerospace media association AJPAE.Airbus plans to raise output of its best-selling A320 model to 50 planes a month from 42 month between now and 2017 and has talked of pushing output even further to 60 or beyond. Rival Boeing is on a similar course with its competing 737 jet.""The market is very strong and we have said we can produce 50 (A320s) a month by 2017 and if the market remains supported there is the possibility to go higher,"" Bregier said.Asked if he could give a theoretical estimate of how long it would take to reach such levels, he said it would depend on the supply chain but agreed with a suggestion that it could be around 2020, adding ""we are far from doing the studies on that.""Airbus and Boeing are increasingly reliant on such models to drive profits and provide the cash needed to complete new jets or carry out upgrades to other types of aircraft.Bregier reiterated Airbus would not abandon the much larger A380 after an order slump for that model, but said it would take a careful look at the business case before deciding whether to revamp it with new engines as requested by Dubai's Emirates.""We are working on the evolution of the aircraft and I have said there will be aerodynamic and engine options, just as there are across the portfolio, but we must launch them at the right time and when we believe there is a business case.""He said there was no connection between the study of an upgrade and the decision by Emirates to place a large engine order with Rolls-Royce for the existing version of A380.There has been speculation that Emirates' decision to drop its traditional U.S. engine supplier strengthened the chances that Rolls-Royce (L:RR) would agree to re-engine the A380.Airbus is in the midst of upgrades to its two other models, the medium-haul A320 and the long-range A330.Bregier said the first upgraded A320neo with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines would be delivered by the end of the year and that the first flight tests with alternative engines from CFM (N:GE) (PA:SAF) should take place before June's Paris Airshow.Bregier said the weak euro would not have much short-term impact on Airbus due to hedging, but that it would provide immediate benefits to small export-oriented parts suppliers.Some of those smaller companies in the supply chain may stop offshoring work to cheaper locations and start repatriating work to Europe as a result of currency moves, he added."

""It turns out that an autonomous vehicle is really a terrestrial drone.""Cars that complete whole journeys without human input are still many years away, but creeping automation is well underway, with models already on sale that can pilot themselves through slow traffic and hit the brakes when a pedestrian steps out.Analysts see a booming market for the vehicles and the connected services their hands-off drivers will be increasingly free to consume.

327,"Mar 26, 2015 02:33PM ET",German police search house of pilot who flew A320 into mountain,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Jean-Francois RosnobletPARIS/SEYNE-LES-ALPES (Reuters) - A young German co-pilot locked himself alone in the cockpit of Germanwings flight 9525 and set it on course to crash into an Alpine mountain, killing all 150 people on board including himself, prosecutors said on Thursday.French prosecutors offered no motive for why 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz apparently took the controls of the Airbus A320, locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately set it veering down from cruising altitude at 3,000 feet per minute.German police were searching his home for evidence that might offer some explanation for what was behind Tuesday's crash in the French Alps.French and German officials said there was no indication he was a terrorist. Acquaintances described Lubitz as an affable young man who had given no sign of harboring harmful intent.According to Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, Lubitz acted ""for a reason we cannot fathom right now but which looks like intent to destroy this aircraft"".Setting the plane's controls for rapid descent was an act that ""could only have been voluntary"", Robin said. ""He had... no reason to stop the pilot-in-command from coming back into the cockpit. He had no reason to refuse to answer to the air controller who was alerting him on the loss of altitude.""The captain, who had stepped out of the cockpit, probably to use the toilet, tried to force his way back in: ""You can hear banging to try to smash the door down,"" Robin said.Describing sound recordings from one of the plane's black boxes, Robin said most of the passengers would not have been aware of their fate until the very end.""Only toward the end do you hear screams,"" he said. ""And bear in mind that death would have been instantaneous...the aircraft was literally smashed to bits.""FlightRadar24, an online air tracking service that uses satellite data, said it had found evidence the autopilot was abruptly switched from cruising height to maintain an altitude of just 100 feet, the lowest possible setting. The plane crashed at about 6,000 feet.""Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 you can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting,"" Fredrik Lindahl, chief executive of the Swedish tracking service, said.The CEO of Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said its air crew were picked carefully and subjected to psychological vetting.""No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said.Attention will now focus on the motivations of Lubitz, a German national who joined the budget carrier in September 2013 and had just 630 hours of flying time - compared with the 6,000 hours of the flight captain, named in German media only as ""Patrick S."" in accordance with usual practice.""SUICIDE"" THE WRONG WORDRobin said there were no grounds to suspect that Lubitz was carrying out a terrorist attack. ""Suicide"" was also the wrong word to describe actions which killed so many other people, the prosecutor added: ""I don't necessarily call it suicide when you have responsibility for 100 or so lives.""The family of the co-pilot arrived in France for a tribute alongside other victims but was being kept apart from the others, Robin said.Police set up guard outside Lubitz's house in Montabaur, Germany. Acquaintances in the town said they were stunned. ""I'm just speechless. I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me,"" said Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of the local flight club where Lubitz received his flying license years ago.""He was a lot of fun, even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet. He was just another boy like so many others here.""A photo on Lubitz's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which was later taken down, shows a smiling young man posing in front of San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge.Robin said the conversation between the two pilots before the captain left the cockpit started normally but that Lubitz's replies became ""laconic"" as they started readying what would have been the normal descent to the airport of Duesseldorf.""His responses become very brief. There is no proper exchange as such,"" he said.Investigators were still searching for the second of the two black boxes on Thursday in the ravine where the plane crashed, 100 km (65 miles) from Nice, which would contain data from the plane's instruments.Pilots may temporarily leave the cockpit at certain times and in certain circumstances, such as while the aircraft is cruising, according to German aviation law. Cockpit doors can be opened from the outside with a code, in line with regulations introduced after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but the code can be overridden from inside the cockpit. Lufthansa's CEO said that either the pilot had entered the code incorrectly, or the co-pilot inside had overridden it.Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris. Madrid revised down on Thursday the number of Spanish victims to 50 from 51 previously.As well as Germans and Spaniards, victims included three Americans, a Moroccan and citizens of Britain, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Iran and the Netherlands, officials said. However, DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.The families of victims were being flown to Marseille on Thursday before being taken up to the zone close to the crash site. Chapels had been prepared for them with a view of the mountain where their relatives died.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,"" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter.Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard.Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said.French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms.Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. ""We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,"" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters.In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: ""A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.""It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world's most used passenger jets.It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December.SHARP DESCENTGermanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference.Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday.Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground.The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUDAs helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in.""There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,"" an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a ""dark day for Lufthansa"".""My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,"" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there.Family members arrived at Barcelona's El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others' shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff.In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught.

331,"Feb 25, 2015 11:19PM ET",Australian researchers unveil world's first 3D printed jet engine,nan,"By Jane WardellSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian researchers unveiled the world's first 3D-printed jet engine on Thursday, a manufacturing breakthrough that could lead to cheaper, lighter and more fuel-efficient jets.Engineers at Monash University and its commercial arm are making top-secret prototypes for Boeing Co, Airbus Group (PARIS:AIR) NV, Raytheon Co and  Safran  (PARIS:SAF) SA in a development that could be the savior of Australia's struggling manufacturing sector. ""This will allow aerospace companies to compress their development cycles because we are making these prototype engines three or four times faster than normal,"" said Simon Marriott, chief executive of Amaero Engineering, the private company set up by Monash to commercialize the product.Marriott said Amaero plans to have printed engine components in flight tests within the next 12 months and certified for commercial use within the next two to three years. Australia has the potential to corner the market. It has one of only three of the necessary large-format 3D metal printers in the world - France and Germany have the other two - and is the only place that makes the materials for use in the machine.It is also the world leader in terms of intellectual property (IP) regarding 3D printing for manufacturing. ""We have personnel that have 10 years experience on this equipment and that gives us a huge advantage,"" Marriott told Reuters by phone from the Avalon Airshow outside Melbourne.3D printing makes products by layering material until a three-dimensional object is created. Automotive and aerospace companies use it for producing prototypes as well as creating specialized tools, moldings and some end-use parts.Marriott declined to comment in detail on Amaero's contracts with companies, including Boeing and Airbus, citing commercial confidentiality. Those contracts are expected to pay in part for the building of further large format printers, at a cost of around A$3.5 million ($2.75 million) each, to ramp up production of jet engine components.3D printing can cut production times for components from three months to just six days. Ian Smith, Monash University's vice-provost for research, said it was very different to the melting, molding and carving of the past. ""This way we can very quickly get a final product, so the advantages of this technology are, firstly, for rapid prototyping and making a large number of prototypes quickly,"" Smith said. ""Secondly, for being able to make bespoke parts that you wouldn't be able to with classic engineering technologies.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

333,"Feb 20, 2015 12:39PM ET",Hack gave U.S. and British spies access to billions of phones: Intercept,nan,"By Eric AuchardFRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. and British spies hacked into the world's biggest maker of phone SIM cards, allowing them to potentially monitor the calls, texts and emails of billions of mobile users around the world, an investigative news website reported.The alleged hack on Gemalto (AS:GTO), if confirmed, would expand the scope of known mass surveillance methods available to U.S. and British spy agencies to include not just email and web traffic, as previously revealed, but also mobile communications.The Franco-Dutch company said on Friday it was investigating whether the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ had hacked into its systems to steal encryption keys that could unlock the security settings on billions of mobile phones. The report by The Intercept site, which cites documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, could prove an embarrassment for the U.S. and British governments. It opens a fresh front in the dispute between civil liberties campaigners and intelligence services which say their citizens face a grave threat of attack from militant groups like Islamic State.It comes just weeks after a British tribunal ruled that GCHQ had acted unlawfully in accessing data on millions of people in Britain that had been collected by the NSA. The Intercept report (http://bit.ly/19E0KUK) said the hack was detailed in a secret 2010 GCHQ document and allowed the NSA and GCHQ to monitor a large portion of voice and data mobile communications around the world without permission from governments, telecom companies or users. ""We take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such sophisticated techniques,"" said Gemalto, whose shares sunk by as much as 10 percent in early trading on Friday, following the report.The report follows revelations from Snowden in 2013 of the NSA's Prism program which allowed the agency to access email and web data handled by the world's largest Internet companies, including Google (O:GOOGL), Yahoo (O:YHOO) and Facebook (O:FB).A spokeswoman for Britain's GCHQ (Government Communication Headquarters) said on Friday that it did not comment on intelligence matters. The NSA could not be immediately reached for comment.A European security source said that mobile devices were widely used by terrorist groups and that intelligence agencies' attempts to access the communications were justified if they were ""authorized, necessary and proportionate."" The source did not confirm or deny that the documents were from GCHQ. The source also said Western agencies would sometimes hold on to data over time in order to decrypt the communications of specific intelligence targets.The source added that wireless networks in Iran, Afghanistan and Yemen were viewed as having significance intelligence value. These were identified by the Intercept as countries where Britain's GCHQ intercepted encryption keys used by local wireless network providers. SURVEILLANCEThe new allegations could boost efforts by major technology firms such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Google to make strong encryption methods standard in communications devices they sell, moves attacked by some politicians and security officials.Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning such encryption into a mass-market feature could prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.Gemalto makes SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards for phones and tablets as well as ""chip and pin"" bank cards and biometric passports. It produces around 2 billion SIM cards a year and counts Verizon (N:VZ), AT&T Inc (N:T) and Vodafone (L:VOD) among hundreds of wireless network provider customers.The European security source said that an assertion by The Intercept that GCHQ had taken control of Gemalto's internal network was speculative and not supported by documentation published by the website. The Intercept, published by First Look Media, was founded by the journalists who first interviewed Snowden and made headlines around the world with reports on U.S. electronic surveillance programs. It published what it said was a secret GCHQ document that said its staff implanted software to monitor Gemalto's entire network, giving them access to SIM card encryption keys. The report suggested this gave GCHQ, with the backing of the NSA, unlimited access to phone communications using Gemalto SIMs.French bank Mirabaud said in a research report the attacks appeared to be limited to 2010 and 2011 and were aimed only at older 2G phones widely used in emerging markets, rather than modern smartphones. It did not name the source of these assertions.Some analysts argued that if a highly security-conscious company like Gemalto is vulnerable, then all of its competitors are as well.Gemalto competes with several European and Chinese SIM card suppliers. A spokesman for one major rival, Giesecke & Devrien of Germany, told Reuters: ""We have no signs that something like that happened to us. We always do everything to protect our customers' data."" But while security experts have long believed spy agencies in many countries have the ability to crack the complex mathematical codes used to encrypt most modern communications, such methods remain costly, limiting their usefulness to targeted hijacking of individual communications.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

337,"Jan 16, 2015 06:00PM ET",Exclusive: GE finances first A350 powered by rival Rolls-Royce,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - When the Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 jet made its commercial debut with Qatar Airways this week, the event marked a milestone for engine supplier Rolls-Royce (L:RR), but slipping unnoticed under the radar with financing was its arch-rival General Electric (N:GE).Although powered by the latest generation of Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines, the first of a new series of jets on which the company has bet its civil business is owned by GE's aircraft leasing arm GECAS, Reuters has learned.The rare decision to invest in rival technology highlights the complexities of keeping ahead in a highly concentrated aviation industry, with GECAS seen as keen to diversify its portfolio even though its parent GE is perceived in the industry as more and more aligned with Airbus rival Boeing (N:BA).The deal also completes a series of twists in the history of Airbus's newest jet: a journey that insiders say has helped to reshape transatlantic aerospace competition.In this case, the world's largest lessor agreed to buy the aircraft from the airline immediately on delivery and rent it back, a routine type of financing called sale-and-leaseback. It is not the first aircraft equipped with rival engines to end up on GECAS's books but such deals are usually kept low key and seldom if ever happen on a high-profile debut of a new jet.The first A350 was delivered to Qatar Airways in a lavish ceremony last month in which Rolls-Royce had a starring role, but GE's involvement in the financing was not mentioned.The head of the airline confirmed the deal to Reuters.""We have had much interest in taking Qatar Airways' airplanes and leasing them back to us. The deal with GECAS was the best for the airline and so we concluded with them,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said after the first revenue flight.Rolls and GE compete fiercely for engine sales and the A350's Trent XWB represents half the UK firm's civil order book.Industry sources say there could be several reasons for GE getting involved in the A350. Qatar has a large fleet of GE-powered Boeing 777s and the relationship is crucial, both in engines and financing.Yet the move highlights a delicate balancing act as GECAS seeks to diversify assets to reduce risk, even as its parent GE forges ever closer ties with Boeing.Such juggling is becoming more difficult as the aerospace industry becomes increasingly polarized, but analysts say the pressure to keep leasing portfolios balanced will keep growing.""If you want a successful wide-body leasing strategy you have no option but to take aircraft with GE and Rolls-Royce engines,"" said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend.JUST FRENEMIESAirlines prefer to have a choice of engine supplier and engine makers have historically supported competing aircraft manufacturers in a convoluted world of industrial ""frenemies"".But designing big twinjets is increasingly a game played between Boeing and GE on one hand and Airbus and Rolls-Royce on the other as engine firms cut exclusive deals to pay huge costs.At the heart of this realignment is the story of the A350. In 2004, faced with what was to become the Boeing 787, Airbus's first response was to offer new GE engines on its A330.But customers including Al Baker rejected a ""quick fix"" and urged Airbus to invest in a newer family that would also offer an alternative to the larger Boeing 777. GE and Airbus disagreed, however, over whether both markets could be served by one family of planes and engines. Airbus's subsequent decision to build an all-new family led to a parting of ways between Airbus and GE on the A350 project and opened the door to Rolls-Royce as sole engine supplier.""That somewhat polluted the relationship between Airbus and GE,"" said a person who closely monitored the negotiations.A U-turn by Airbus last year only served to deepen the new alignment: Airbus now planned to upgrade the A330 anyway, but this time with Rolls instead of the original partner, GE.This year could see Airbus upgrading its A380 superjumbo with engines from Rolls-Royce, bringing further polarization.""It's a bad thing: it goes against globalization that helps drive the business,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.GE denied any cooling of ties with Airbus, saying it remains a major engine supplier for best-selling A320s through Franco-U.S. venture CFM (PA:SAF).""CFM is far and away Airbus's largest engine supplier across its current and future aircraft models. It's a huge relationship,"" a spokesman said.Rolls-Royce and GECAS declined to comment.(This version of the story has been refiled to remove formatting error, adds GECAS declined to comment)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

340,"Dec 29, 2014 09:15PM ET","Indonesia Expands Search For Missing AirAsia Jet, US Sends Warship",nan,"By Reuters - SURABAYA, Indonesia/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Countries around Asia on Tuesday stepped up the search for an AirAsia plane carrying 162 people that is presumed to have crashed in shallow waters off the Indonesian coast, with Washington also sending a warship to help find the missing jet.Soelistyo, head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, told local television the search area between the islands of Sumatra andBorneo would be expanded. The air force said authorities would investigate an oil spill sighted on Monday.Authorities would also begin scouring islands in the area as well as land on Indonesia's side of Borneo. So far the focus of the search has been the Java Sea.The Airbus A320-200 operated by Indonesia AirAsia lost radar contact in poor weather on Sunday morning during a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. The plane could be at the bottom of the sea, Soelistyo said on Monday.What happened to Flight QZ8501, which had sought permission from Indonesian air traffic control to ascend to avoid clouds, is still a mystery.Online discussions among pilots have centered on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow in poor weather, and that it might have stalled.Around 30 ships and 21 aircraft from Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea would search around 10,000 square nautical miles on Tuesday, officials said.They said the sea there was only 50 to 100 (150 to 300 feet) meters deep, which would be a help in finding the plane, which was carrying mainly Indonesians.The U.S. military said the USS Sampson, a guided missile destroyer, would be on the scene later on Tuesday.The U.S. Defense Department said assistance to Indonesia ""could include some air, surface and sub-surface detection capabilities"".""We stand ready to assist in any way possible,"" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said.China's Defence Ministry said it had sent a warship to the South China Sea and planes ""have begun preparatory work"" for search operations. FALSE ALARMSThere have been no confirmed signs of wreckage so far.Officials said one of the possible oil slicks seen on Monday turned out to be a reef and that while searchers had picked up an emergency locator signal off the south of Borneo no subsequent signal was found.The plane, whose engines were made by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and Safran of France, lacked real-time engine diagnostics or monitoring, a GE spokesman said. Such systems are mainly used on long-haul flights and can provide clues to airlines and investigators when things go wrong.The plane's disappearance comes at a sensitive time for Jakarta's aviation authorities, as they strive to improve the country's safety reputation to match its status as one of the airline industry's fastest growing markets.It also appears to be a third air disaster involving a Malaysian-affiliated carrier in less than a year, further denting confidence in that country's aviation industry and spooking air travelers across the region.Indonesia AirAsia is 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline's Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. NO SIGN OF FOUL PLAYOn board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French.U.S. law enforcement and security officials said passenger and crew lists were being closely examined but so far nothing significant had turned up and that the incident was still regarded as an unexplained accident. The plane, which did not issue a distress signal, disappeared after its pilot failed to get permission to fly higher because of heavy air traffic, officials said.Pilots and aviation experts said thunderstorms, and requests to gain altitude to avoid them, were not unusual in that area.""The airplane's performance is directly related to the temperature outside and increasing altitude can lead to freezing of the static radar, giving pilots an erroneous radar reading,"" said a Qantas Airways pilot with 25 years' experience flying in the region.The resulting danger is that pilots take incorrect action to control the aircraft, said the pilot, who requested anonymity.The Indonesian pilot was experienced and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, the airline said.The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002.At a crisis center at the airport in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, anger grew among about 100 relatives.""We only need clear information every hour on where they are going,"" said Franky Chandra, who has a sibling and three friends on the flight, referring to the search teams.""We've been here for two days but the information is unclear.

343,"Sep 25, 2014 01:38PM ET",Airbus conducts maiden flight of hot-selling A320neo ,nan,"By Tim Hepher TOULOUSE France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) successfully staged the maiden test flight on Thursday of an upgraded passenger jet on which it expects to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue, buoyed by an increase in the company's jet demand forecast. The A320neo touched down in Toulouse, southwest France, 27 years after the original A320 first took to the skies and opened up fierce competition with Boeing's medium-haul 737 in a slice of the jet market estimated at $2 trillion over 20 years.Powered by a new type of jet engine from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), the A320neo flew for two hours and 22 minutes, kicking off a year of flight trials. The same family of aircraft will also offer a competing engine from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (N:GE) and Safran (PA:SAF). Airbus is aiming for savings of 15 percent per seat compared with the current generation of medium-haul passenger jets. It said this gap would increase to 20 percent by 2020 thanks in part to a further two percent improvement due to be delivered by Pratt & Whitney, on top of its 12 percent contribution to the current improvement. The rest will come by adding more seats. With airlines running on wafer-thin profit margins and spending about 40 percent of their operating costs on fuel, such savings are at the center of a huge sales battle. Rival Boeing is bringing out its own updated version of the 737 just over a year after Airbus and the two companies face a gradual threat to their duopoly at the small end of the market from new competitors in Canada, Brazil, China and Russia. A smooth entry to service will however cement their position as market leaders for years to come, analysts say, Shares in both companies have risen sharply since the decision to revamp their most-sold aircraft was announced in 2010 and 2011. Airbus shares rose over 2 percent on Thursday. Airbus has sold 3,257 A320neo aircraft and said it expects this to reach 3,500 by the end of the year. Together, Airbus and Boeing have sold well over 5,000 of the planes. Both companies have announced increases in production as a result, and are considering further increases to lift A320 or 737 production to 50 planes a month or beyond. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier however said it was in ""no rush"" to make a further output decision. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet demand on Wednesday, citing growth in emerging markets, with China on the brink of becoming the world's aviation powerhouse. The flight went ahead in September as planners hoped after last-minute signs of concern about the engine's readiness and the recent resumption of flight tests on Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) CSeries aircraft, which uses similar Pratt & Whitney engines. An engine blowout in May had halted CSeries flight testing. The companies indicated they were convinced that the Airbus version of the engine would not be affected by the same problems and that the aircraft would enter service with the same high reliability as the existing generation of small jets. ""It is a great engine that is going to change the economics of the airline industry,"" said Alain Bellemare, chief executive of UTC Propulsion and Aerospace Systems at Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies (N:UTX). ""We are highly confident in the performance of these engines,"" he told Reuters.

He is no candidate for Safran CEO,"" Rainer Ohler, Airbus Group's head of corporate communications, said on his Twitter account.Lahoud's decision to stay out of the running is unlikely to quell speculation over who might replace aerospace engineer Jean-Paul Herteman, whose mandate at the helm of state-controlled Safran expires in 2015, a year in which he turns 65.The Airbus spokesman's intervention will also be read in France as coded reinforcement of support for Lahoud from Airbus CEO Tom Enders, following sporadic rumors of a split which resurfaced recently despite regular denials.At Safran, Herteman has so far declined to comment on whether he will seek to renew his mandate, which would need a change in the age limit at the next shareholder meeting, or seek to stay on as chairman, a role he currently combines with that of CEO.La Tribune newspaper recently named four internal executives considered ripe for the top job and said the names of two external candidates were also circulating, including those of Lahoud and Pascale Sourisse, head of international development at French defense firm Thales (PA:TCFP).While Safran insists it is carrying on business as usual, industry sources say the politically sensitive succession at Safran is likely to absorb the industry in coming months and could accelerate a reshuffling of top jobs in French defense.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by James Regan)"
345,"Sep 16, 2014 04:49AM ET",Airbus to sell off business units in defense and space review,nan,"By Sabine Siebold and Tim Hepher BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has unveiled plans to sell half a dozen businesses with combined annual revenues of around 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), simplifying its Defense and Space division to focus on warplanes, missiles, launchers and satellites. Announcing the results of a portfolio review, Europe's largest aerospace group signaled a break with previous efforts to diversify into security activities and a halt to investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals. Europe's defense industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back on military spending. EADS, later renamed Airbus, responded in 2012 by trying to merge with Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES), but the deal was blocked by Germany. That, coupled with the stronger-than-expected growth of its jetliner business, led Airbus to drop a previous goal of having broadly balanced revenues from its commercial and defense arms, and launch a reassessment of its defense and space activities. The group said on Tuesday it would sell its Professional Mobile Radio secure communications assets and confirmed plans to sell a 49-percent stake in submarine supplier Atlas Elektronik, unwinding two efforts at diversification embarked on nine years ago. It said it would also consider selling other commercial and non-governmental satellite communications activities. Also up for sale are systems and software company ESG, as earlier reported by Reuters, and three smaller units: U.S.-based environmental systems supplier Fairchild Controls, German cabin simulator maker Rostock System-Technik and AvDef, a small aviation company in southern France that trains fighter pilots. In early trading, Airbus Group shares were down 0.7 percent, in line with the broader European market (FTEU3). The move comes weeks after a reorganization of space launcher activities jointly with France's Safran (PA:SAF) and leaves Airbus Group's share of the Eurofighter and MBDA missile consortia, as well its own A400M airlifter, at the center of a non-jetliner portfolio focused on aeronautics and space. ""We came to the conclusion that our division must focus on the following core businesses: Space, Military Aircraft, Missiles, and related Systems and Services,"" Bernhard Gerwert, head of the Defense & Space business, said in a letter to staff. ""These are the key areas in which we will further invest to strengthen our leading position."" The shake-up is likely to test the group's prickly relations with the German government, following warnings from group Chief Executive Tom Enders about the impact of Berlin's stringent export controls on defense jobs and industrial investment. In an interview, Gerwert played down the row, however. ""I want to make clear that this is not just about cutting more jobs or closing more sites, quite the contrary,"" he told Reuters. ""We're focusing on certain businesses and are looking for someone who's willing to develop and invest in these businesses."" But he said Airbus would no longer invest in defense electronics and security, something it would need to do in order to reach a global position. The group is overshadowed by competitors including France's Thales (PA:TCFP), Europe's largest defense electronics firm. THYSSENKRUPP EXPLORES ATLAS BUYOUT Airbus paired its defense and space unit a year ago under the brand of its best-known civil planemaking unit and announced a review of assets. The division had proforma sales of 14.4 billion euros in 2013, of which electronics made up 9 percent and communications, intelligence and security had 18 percent. Gerwert said he aimed to get the first indications of interest for the units being sold by the end of the year and to complete the first disposals in the first half of 2015. It is too early to say how many jobs would be affected and there was no financial goal for the sale proceeds, he said. The sale of Atlas Elektronik puts a coveted slice of Germany's defense industry back on the market after Airbus Group, then known as EADS, fended off competition from Thales to buy the sonar maker from BAE Systems in 2005. German press reports have identified Thales or Germany's Rheinmetall (DE:RHMG) as possible suitors for the stake, but Gerwert said he would first talk to majority shareholder ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG). Asked whether a buyer was already in sight, he said: ""No, not yet. TKMS (ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems) has a stake of 51 percent (and) we're holding 49 percent, so initial talks will certainly be held with TKMS."" Asked whether a sale to a foreign party was possible, he said: ""Let me put it this way: nothing is inconceivable."" ThyssenKrupp said it was examining all options on whether to buy out its partner's stake. A spokesman for Thales declined comment on Atlas Elektronik as well as on separate reports it could bid for a railway business being sold by Italian aerospace firm Finmeccanica, as the rest of Europe's aerospace industry sheds non-core assets.

346,"Sep 07, 2014 02:20PM ET","Boeing, Ryanair to make major fleet announcement on Monday",nan,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N>:BA) and Ryanair Holdings PLC (I:RYA) plan to make a significant fleet announcement on Monday, following reports last Friday that the low-cost Irish airline was poised to place a $10 billion order for Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner.Boeing Chief Executive Ray Conner and Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary will make the announcement at a meeting Monday morning in New York, Boeing said on Sunday.Boeing declined to comment on details of the announcement. Ryanair declined to comment.On Friday, Reuters reported that Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, was in advanced talks to order at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliners, modified to include 11 extra seats, bringing total seating in the new plane up to 200.One source told Reuters the order could be for as many as 150 of the jets.A deal for 100 jets would be worth about $10.4 billion, at the 737 MAX 8's list price of $104 million, but airlines usually negotiate steep discounts, particularly on large orders.Ryanair's order, if confirmed, would mark another major win for Boeing's 737 MAX program, which has garnered 2,219 orders since its launch in 2011.A deal also would be the first MAX order by Ryanair, continuing Ryanair's reliance on an all-Boeing, single-aircraft fleet. The airline only flies the 737-800.Boeing also would further widen its lead over Airbus Group (PA:AIR) in the order tally so far this year if the deal is confirmed. At the end of August, Boeing had 1,004 total orders, and Airbus had 1,001.Boeing also leads Airbus in orders this year after adjusting for cancellations, with 941 net orders from Jan. 1 to Sept. 2, compared with 722 net orders between January and August for Airbus.Boeing's 737 MAX competes with Airbus' A320neo. Both jets are based on the companies' top selling single-aisle planes, fitted with next-generation engines that reduce fuel consumption significantly.Boeing says the MAX family will burn 16 percent less fuel than current competitors. Airbus has said its A320neo will provide similar savings.The promise of such fuel savings has spurred strong demand from airlines eager to cushion rising oil prices. The MAX family is powered with engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co (N:GE) and Safran SA (PA:SAF).The A320neo offers a choice of engines, made either by CFM or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).Ryanair's O'Leary has said he would put slightly less than 200 seats on board the modified 737 MAX jetliner that Ryanair is expected to purchase, known as the 737 MAX 8, to avoid staffing the plane with an extra flight attendant, since one is required for every 50 passengers.Last year Ryanair placed a $15.6 billion order for 175 Boeing 737-800 jets, and O'Leary said in July he would maintain that order, even as he studied a higher-density MAX version.(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Paul Simao)"

McGrath - American Airlines Group Inc. has picked CFM International’s LEAP-1A engine to power its new fleet of 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft, the 50-50 joint venture of the General Electric Co. and Safran SA announced Sunday. CFM pegged the value of the engine order at $2.6 billion. (Neo is an acronym for “new engine option.”)The American Airlines NASDAQ:AAL) aircraft order with the privately held Airbus SAS was first divulged in 2011, and the airline will begin taking delivery of its A320neo fleet in 2017.According to Airbus, A320neo owners can select either of two engines for their aircraft: the LEAP-1A made by CFM International or the PurePower PW1100G-JM made by the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX).The first full LEAP-1A engine began ground testing last September, launching what CFM International characterized as the most extensive ground and flight test certification program in the history of the JV founded in 1974.The total program, encompassing all three LEAP engine variants, includes 28 ground and CFM flight test engines, as well as 32 flight test engines for Airbus, the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd.During the next three years, these engines will accumulate about 40,000 engine cycles before entering service. By that time, CFM will have simulated more than 15 years of airline service with 60 different engine builds.The American General Electric (NYSE:GE) and the French Safran (PARIS:SAF) formed their CFM International JV 40 years ago. Thanks to the American Airlines and other orders, the company believes it will follow a record-setting 2013 with a record-setting 2014, the firm said Sunday.Last year, it booked orders for 2,723 engines valued at more than $31 billion. This year, it already has logged orders for 2,071 engines valued at about $25 billion."

The A320neo is due to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2015 and flight testing of the plane is due to start in September 2014, Airbus said.The American order is significant in part because the carrier has options for additional A320neos.

Thursday to an eight-week closing high, boosted by strong
results from some companies including Suez Environnement and on
hopes the U.S. central bank will support the economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
up 0.4 percent at 1,153.70 points, to close at the highest level
since early March, but volume was only 95 percent of its 90-day
average ahead of a four-day holiday weekend in the UK. The market initially got a boost after the U.S. central bank
indicated late on Wednesday it was in no rush to start to scale
back the monetary stimulus support for the economy, triggering a
fall in the dollar to a three-year low. ""European markets seem to be feeling pretty robust,"" Lex van
Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, which has $500
million assets under management. ""My view is as long as (Federal Reserve chairman) Bernanke
keeps printing money and the dollar continues to weaken, that
stocks are very well underpinned."" Positive European earnings news gave the market some
support. Out of the 53 companies on the STOXX Europe 600 that
have reported first-quarter results, 57 percent of them have
either beaten or met analysts' forecasts. The utility sector featured among the top performers, with
Suez Environnement, the world's second-largest utility, rising 4
percent after quarterly sales beat expectations. Financials were also in demand after earnings news.
Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank rose 4.8 percent after
quarterly net profit beat forecasts, while insurer Standard Life
 gained 3.2 percent after sales came in above expectations.  Elsewhere, French aerospace and defence group Safran jumped
6.2 percent after quarterly revenue grew 10.5 percent, which was
slightly above several analysts' forecasts. On the technical front, charts signalled that the Euro STOXX
50, the euro zone's blue chip index, up 0.9 percent at 3,005.33
points was expected to post further gains. Tom Pelc, head of technical strategy at RBS, said the index
may rise to 3,170 points -- the 50 percent retracement of a move
since the 2007 peak to the 2009 trough.   SAP DISAPPOINTS However, gains were limited as not all earnings news was on
the positive side. German business software maker SAP lost 5.7
percent after first-quarter earnings disappointed expectations.
 Elsewhere, the world's top magazine paper maker UPM-Kymmene
Oyj lost 7.1 percent after it made a smaller than expected
profit and warned that cost inflation this year may be worse
than previously expected. The market also briefly pared back some gains in afternoon
trade after U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product growth
came in below forecasts. Some analysts said in looking at the bigger macro economic
picture that they were cautious on earnings ahead. ""I am wary ... U.S. GDP data was poor,"" Jeremy
Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley said. ""The macro
picture is gloomy and it is going to be tough work for equities
to make significant headway."" Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was flat, Germany's DAX
 was up 1 percent and France's CAC 40 rose 0.9 percent.

company Safran  hailed the arrival of the ""weaker sex""
on the company's board on Thursday -- triggering accusations of
sexism from France's best-known shareholder activist. Francis Mer, 71, chairman of the state-controlled firm whose
engines power French nuclear missiles and the Rafale warplane,
dropped the bombshell at a shareholder meeting which agreed to
modernize the company's governance rules. ""It will not have escaped your attention that ... we will be
in a situation where the so-called weaker sex will be making a
deafening entry into our board,"" Mer told shareholders. The changes, creating a normal board out of a complex
structure inherited from a merger in 2004, will increase the
number of female board members from one to five, a figure Mer
described as ""close to the record"". ""Breaking records ... in this area is easier and less
dangerous than in aviation or safety matters,"" he said. Mer, 71, is a blunt-spoken former steelmaking CEO and
finance minister best known for his blustery approach to
full-time politicians and the press. His comments drew immediate
flak from a staunch campaigner for investor rights in France. ""I completely reject these terms, the mere use of which says
a lot about attitudes to women,"" Colette Neuville, president of
the ADAM association of minority shareholders, told Reuters. ""Coming from the head of a company which insists on
equality, they are completely unacceptable,"" she added. France has long been criticised for lagging its neighbours
in the number of women reaching the top of major business. Its
parliament voted last year to order many companies to have 40
percent of board posts occupied by women within six years. ""You can be for or against quotas - personally I am against
them -- but it is regrettable that this should be turned into a
joke, and one in very poor taste,"" Neuville said. Safran declined to comment. Mer was recruited from a steel firm to be France's finance
minister between 2002 and 2004, but got off on the wrong foot by
calling his cabinet colleagues ""you politicians,"" a gaffe he
later made the title of a book. He is expected to be named vice-chairman under a new Safran
board to be led by chief executive Jean-Paul Herteman.

consumer sentiment survey dragged European shares lower on
Friday from a one-year high. The FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.8 percent lower at
1,009.62 points after trading as high as 1,026.43 in the morning

General Electric countered the positive momentum created by IBM
 and Google's earnings figures overnight. ""The bar has been raised. You could have effectively
announced poor results in Q2 and then the stock would be up 5
percent,"" said Robert Quinn, European strategist at Standard &
Poor's equity research in London. Financials were the top losers in Europe, with Deutsche Bank
, Commerzbank, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and HSBC falling 2
to 3 percent. Bank of America posted a wider than expected third-quarter
loss as an improvement in its Merrill Lynch investment banking
unit failed to offset consumer credit woes, while General
Electric's revenue missed market expectations. A Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers report
also weighed on the market. It showed U.S. consumer sentiment
fell unexpectedly in October on persistent worries that the
""dismal"" state of personal finances would not recover quickly
from the worst recession in decades. ""Final demand within the U.S. economy and within the
European economy hasn't really caught up with expectations
pricing in the equity market,"" Quinn said. The index, which slumped 45 percent last year, is up 21.4
percent in 2009 and has surged more than 56 percent since
hitting a record low in early March, driven by low valuations
and signs of improving economic data. But the sharp rally has raised questions whether it has gone
too far, too fast, while the recovery remains patchy. ""We're still in a upside trend on the market, but it won't
last unless we see companies' revenues starting to rise again.
And it's not the case for now,"" said Jacques Henry, analyst at
Louis Capital Markets, in Paris. Concerns over corporate earnings and the strength of the
economic recovery also took the shine off mining shares as well
as raw material prices. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Vedanta
Resources and Eurasian Natural Resources lost between 0.4 and
2.4 percent.  SLICK OILS, SWEDISH MATCH UP Heavyweight oil producers held on to earlier gains, despite
crude prices reversing to trade down in the afternoon. BP, Royal

Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.5 percent. Among other individual movers, tobacco maker Swedish Match
surged 3.8 percent, with traders citing market talk of bid
interest from Philip Morris. Swedish Match declined to comment.

 (Adds detail, share price) PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French aerospace and defence group
Safranforecast a challenging 2010 as it posted flat
third-quarter revenue on Friday, pressured by underused business
jets and lower-than-expected sales of spare parts. The company, which partners General Electric in the world's
largest engine maker for civil jetliners, CFM International,
reiterated forecasts for 2009 revenue ""on the same scale"" as
2008 and an operating margin of about 6 percent. But it did not give a specific outlook for next year. ""It is too early to make detailed predictions, but 2010 will
be a challenging year and we intend to face the challenges,""
Chief Executive Jean-Paul Herteman told reporters. Safran shares were down 5.2 percent to 12.07 euros at 1016
GMT. GE is due to publish third-quarter results later on Friday,
with Wall Street expecting profit to fall over half to 20 cents
per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, with revenue
forecast to drop about 15 percent to $40 billion. Safran third-quarter sales fell 0.2 percent to 2.38 billion
euros ($3.55 billion), with core aerospace propulsion falling
1.5 percent. Analysts had predicted revenue closer to 2.5 billion euros. Natixis Securities analyst Olivier Brochet said sales of
spare parts of CFM56 engines, the workhorse of most airline
short-haul fleets, which fell 2.6 percent in dollar terms over
nine months, had fared worse than an expected decline of 2
percent. The CFM56 is the engine built and sold in a joint venture
with GE, the world's largest jet engine manufacturer. Shares in Rolls-Royce, which some analysts say is better
shielded from market variations through flexible ""TotalCare""
engine support contracts, rose around 0.4 percent on Friday. Safran said it had also been hurt by a slump in business jet
travel, hit by recent publicity over unpopular executive perks. ""Revenue was affected by the depressed market conditions in
the business aircraft segment, which account for 10 percent of
aircraft equipment business,"" the company said. Falls in the aero-engine sector were dampened by higher
defence and security spending. Engine makers clinched a wave of new orders over the summer
tied to aircraft deals negotiated before the financial crisis
exacerbated a cyclical downturn last year. But fresh demand is
waning, putting more focus on servicing older engines. Safran was created from a merger of French state engine
maker Snecma and telecoms equipment group Sagem in 2004, and has
a market value around 5 billion euros. The company is also part of a consortium building the West's
largest turbo-prop engine for the Airbus A400M military
transport plane, Europe's largest defence project, which has
been hit by both engine and software delays. Herteman said recent trials had gone smoothly and that the
engine was not standing in the way of a first flight for the
aircraft by the end of the year, as Airbus plans. Delays of up to two years in the maiden flight have caused
friction between EADS unit Airbus and its engine suppliers,
which also include Rolls-Royce and Germany's MTU. Herteman declined to comment on whether Safran would take
financial provisions for either the A400M or delays to the
Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is also two years late.

363,"Jun 19, 2009 05:57AM ET",UPDATE 3-France hopeful of sale of 60 Rafale jets to UAE,nan," * France closely following talks on sale of 60 Rafale to UAE * President Sarkozy pleased with progress of the talks * Dassault Aviation shares up 1.1 percent 
 (Adds background, details, quotes) By Matthias Blamont PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - France hailed progress on Friday
towards what could be the first sale of Dassault Aviation's
Rafale fighter jets to a foreign buyer after the United Arab
Emirates signalled it was seriously interested in the aircraft. Military authorities in the Gulf state have officially told
France the specifications it requires of the plane, marking a
step forward in what would be one of the biggest French defence
contracts in years. However, people close to the matter told Reuters that
discussions between the parties could go on for ""several months""
before any final decision is taken and the Rafale is likely to
face strong competition from rival U.S. bids. The Rafale, Dassault Aviation's newest multirole combat
aircraft, has been a flagship programme for France's arms
industry but has had problems in finding export buyers, despite
major efforts by French authorities. Friday's move by the UAE was welcomed by the Elysee Palace,
which has seen several potential Rafale deals lost in recent
years and which has been following the UAE talks closely. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who opened a French military base
in Abu Dhabi this year and who has set up a special unit at the
Elysee to support the Rafale, said the deal was moving ahead
""significantly"" but did not say when he expected a decision. ""It's progressing, they've given us all the technical
specifications they expect of the Rafale,"" he told a press
conference in Brussels where he had been attending a European
Union summit. ""It's a very important subject for France."" The UAE wish-list includes a 20 percent boost in thrust for
the twin-engine plane, which competitors say is under-powered,
and engine maker Safran has agreed to study this.  COMPETITION Analysts calculate that the sale of 60 Rafale aircraft,
which are currently only deployed by the French military, could
be worth between 6-8 billion euros and Dassault Aviation shares
were up 1.1 percent at 395 euros by 1325 GMT. Dassault has declined to confirm the figures but has said an
agreement may be reached this year. A spokesman said on Friday it was pleased ""that the talks
between our company and the Emirates authorities are
progressing. We are attentive to the demands of the client"". The UAE state news agency said the date of any deal would
""be set based on the results of the financial negotiations."". According to people familiar with the deal, these
negotiations are likely to be long and complicated and would
also include the possibility of buying back old Mirage combat
jets from the UAE or selling them on to another buyer. ""That's a variable which could change the total price of the
operation. The Dassault teams don't want the face value of the
contract to go down,"" one source said. One other person close to the deal, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Dassault would have to expect fierce
competition from its U.S. rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Despite the upbeat comments, one industry observer said the
French statement could mask some disappointment that a deal had
not been struck in time for the Paris Air Show this week.  ""The message is, air show over, see you in Dubai,"" he said,
referring to the Nov. 15-19 Dubai Air Show. Beyond the deal itself, France hopes an export win for the
Rafale could lead to other deals, notably in the Gulf, where
Qatar and Kuwait could follow if the UAE takes the first step.

 (Adds quotes, shares) By Tim Hepher and Mathias Blamont PARIS, June 8 (Reuters) - The head of French conglomerate
Safran said on Monday he was ready to step down as head of its
defence and security division after bringing it back to profit,
and rekindled interest in co-operation with Thales. Analysts have been anxious for signs that the former Sagem
unit is ready to stand on its feet and expand after internal
management disputes and losses that caused group Chief Executive
Jean-Paul Herteman to take charge and weighed on Safran shares. ""We cannot rule out that the development of the defence and
security division will mean that one person takes on a special
role for its expansion. And this may well happen in 2009,"" CEO
Herteman told Reuters in an interview. Like most defence firms, Safran has been aiming to win more
market share in the fast-growing security market in recent
months, and the French group bought GE Homeland Protection for
$580 million in April.. Herteman added that Safran could examine swapping assets
with French defence electronics group Thales. The subject has been mooted before but it is the first time
either side has commented on the possibility since Dassault
Aviation became the core industrial shareholder of Thales and
appointed a new chief executive last month. Safran is 30 percent owned by the French state, which also
has a 27 percent stake in Thales. ""We could strengthen our co-operation (with Thales) in
certain areas, set up joint ventures or swap assets,"" said
Herteman, who added that the businesses which could be impacted
in this way were worth ""several hundreds of millions of euros."" Safran shares rose 2 percent to 9.315 euros. Despite the French state's key shareholdings in both Safran
and Thales, Herteman said it was not up to the government to
tell Safran what to do over Thales. ""The state cannot impose its choice on us, but it can
encourage or aid us. Safran will make its decision based on the
interests of its key stakeholders and staff, and it's up to us
to explain what these interests are."" Herteman said Safran is studying a boost in thrust for the
M88 engine that powers the Rafale fighter plane built by
Dassault Aviation. France is trying to break a drought in export
orders for the combat jet by landing an order with the United
Arab Emirates, which has asked for an engine revamp. Herteman declined to give the cost of the increase from 7.5
tonnes to 9 tonnes but agreed it would be ""significant"".  Herteman said Safran's smart card business should produce a
an operating margin in 2009 close to the 5-6 percent targeted
for the group, which was formed in 2004 from a merger between
state engine maker Snecma and electronics firm Sagem. (Reporting by Matthias Blamont, Tim Hepher, Sudip Kar-Gupta;
