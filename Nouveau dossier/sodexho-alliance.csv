14,"Feb 27, 2019 04:12PM ET","FedEx partners with Walmart, Pizza Hut to test last-mile delivery robot",nan,"By Lisa Baertlein(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) this summer plans to begin testing a robot to handle home deliveries for partners ranging from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to Pizza Hut.Shippers, retailers and restaurants are experimenting with robots, drones and self-driving cars in a bid to use automation to drive down the high cost of delivering gadgets, groceries and even cups of coffee the ""last mile"" to consumer doorsteps.FedEx is teaming up with DEKA Development & Research Corp, whose founder Dean Kamen invented the Segway stand-up scooter and iBot stair-climbing wheelchair, for its project. The delivery company said the robots could become part of its SameDay service that operates in 1,900 cities around the world. The battery-powered robots look like coolers on wheels. Cameras and software help them detect and avoid obstacles as they roam sidewalks and roadways at a top speed of 10 miles (16 km) per hour. The project must win approval in test cities, including the shipper's hometown of Memphis, and the first deliveries will be between FedEx office stores. On average, more than 60 percent of merchants' customers live within three miles of a store location. FedEx said it is working with its partners, which also include AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), to determine if autonomous delivery to them is a viable option for fast, cheap deliveries.The ""last mile"" to the home accounts for 50 percent or more of total package delivery costs. Restaurants pay third-party delivery companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub commissions of 10-30 percent per order. Investors and companies are pouring millions of dollars into projects aimed at lowering those costs and overcoming regulatory hurdles. For safety reasons, many states want autonomous vehicles to have humans as emergency backup drivers. Starship Technologies, which has raised more than $40 million in venture funding, last year deployed robots to deliver packages in the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, it teamed up with French food service company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) to take Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Dunkin' Donuts and Blaze Pizza orders to the 40,000 students at George Mason University's Fairfax, Virginia, campus. That service costs $1.99 per order. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is testing its own delivery robot dubbed ""Scout"". FedEx rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) is not testing robots - but like FedEx and Amazon, it is experimenting with drone deliveries.Other tests include tie-ups between grocery seller Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and self-driving car startup Nuro, as well as DoorDash and General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Cruise Automation.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Jan 10, 2019 09:50AM ET",French companies bruised by 'yellow vests' protests,nan,"By Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - French companies have this week revealed some 60 million euros ($69 million) of lost business from anti-government protests rocking the country, which could augur badly for the likes of supermarket chains Casino and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Shares in retailer FNAC Darty fell on Thursday after the electronics goods retailer estimated a revenue hit of some 45 million euros from the closure of stores during the protests and fewer shoppers.With no sign of the protests ending, Air France KLM said the unrest had reduced sales by 15 million euros -- a relatively small figure for the Franco-Dutch airline but enough to push its shares down too.The ""yellow vests"" ('gilets jaunes') movement - named after the fluorescent jackets all French motorists carry in their vehicles - started in the middle of November as a protest against a fuel tax but has since grown into a broader backlash against the government. The demonstrations have been marred by violence that has led to shopping districts and tourist hotspots having to close down on some weekends.""The impact will be felt first and foremost with those companies with a physical presence on the high street, such as FNAC Darty. But others will also be impacted, such as hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) since the 'gilets jaunes' has been negative for tourism in Paris,"" said Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.Data on Wednesday showed consumer confidence last month fell to its lowest level in four years as consumer fretted about their purchasing power and ability to make large purchases - and figures later in January from Casino and Carrefour could reflect that.Confidence was also down in France's construction industry as a result of the protests, said HSBC, which said it was revisiting its valuation of Bouygues' construction related business to better reflect the global environment.""STANDSTILL""Catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) warned it had concerns for later this year. Sodexo owns Paris cabaret Le Lido, the Yachts de Paris luxury river cruising business and has the catering contract for a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.""We are more worried about the impact of the protests on the spring-summer tourism season,"" said CEO Denis Machuel.The FCD French retail association, which speaks for both supermarket retailers and upmarket department stores, estimated that there had been a revenue loss of around 2 billion euros over the course of November and December.""Needless to say, you will have similar warnings from other big Paris shops. In essence the Champs Elysees has been closed every weekend for the last two months, so outlets such as LVMH and Le Bon Marché will get hit,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Clairinvest.""The companies in Paris' CAC-40 index will get impacted to a certain extent because the 'gilets jaunes' have brought the French economy to a standstill,"" added Valahu.The signs of bruising to French companies comes after a study in financial daily Les Echos this week showed that the country's top companies had paid out dividends worth 57 billion euros last year, as President Emmanuel Macron pursued his reform drive.Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Swiss investment firm Prime Partners, said that given the risks from the protests he would favor international companies over those exposed to the domestic French economy, such as Casino and Carrefour.(GRAPHIC: Paris riots roil French equities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QgkZSn)(GRAPHIC: Protests slow French GDP - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zQhrf0)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In early dealings, it had hit its highest since Oct. 10.The leading index of euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) was flat, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) 0.2 percent higher.""It's looking less robust in general,"" as investors take a more cautious stance ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest meeting later in the day, said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at CityIndex.The banking and insurance indexes (SX7P) (SXIP) were among the top performing sectors, up 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.Italy's third-largest lender Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) jumped 8.9 percent after its third-quarter net profit beat forecasts thanks to lower costs and an asset sale that helped offset flat fees and falling interest income.Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and SocGen (PA:SOGN) were up 4 percent and 3 percent respectively after solid earnings updates.Investors shrugged off news that UBS (S:UBSG), Switzerland's largest bank, faces another potentially costly legal battle as the U.S. Department of Justice draws up civil charges over the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.The bank has said it will contest any complaint vigorously.Analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank reckon more than half of the 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) UBS has set aside for non-core legal risks was dedicated to the U.S. case. ""UBS was one of the most high profile banks that hasn't suffered from DoJ investigation. It was one of the smaller issuers, which is may be why the DoJ has probably left them til last,"" said CityIndex's Odeluga.Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was flying high after the world's second-biggest catering company's better-than-expected revenue. Shares in jumped 6.4 percent to their highest since March and on track for their best day since July.  Hikma Pharmaceuticals  (L:HIK) rallied 6.6 percent after raising its full-year revenue outlook for the injectibles division, its largest unit.It wasn't all good news though. Shares of broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 (DE:PSMGn) plunged 15 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600, hitting lowest level in more than six years after cutting its dividend and warning on its full-year outlook.  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) sank 7.1 percent after its results revealed weakness in its maritime division.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

36,"Sep 21, 2018 04:40AM ET",Australian mining's macho image worsens pain of labor shortage,nan,"By Melanie BurtonMELBOURNE (Reuters) - When the song ""Eagle Rock"" played at a bar in an outback Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie late one night, a dozen young men scattered around a pool table dropped their trousers and heartily sang along in their underwear.Later that night, they piled behind the counter of the bar attached to the Western Australian School of Mines (WASM), singing an anthem that began, ""We are engineers,"" and finished with an obscene description of how they treat women.The scenes, in the background of an industry conference, cut against a hard reality the sector faces: a dearth of skilled applicants, and a workforce hurting for diversity and struggling to hire women.""If we could attract more women, it could go a long way to helping any future skills shortage,"" said Paul Cooper, regional chief executive of mining for recruiting company Sodexo (PA:EXHO), which is a key supplier to the industry and whose workforce is almost half women. Without change, the outlook is grim. Enrolments in mining engineering courses across Australia have fallen to roughly 30 this year from more than 250 during the last boom a half decade ago. (For a graphic on 'Australian mining engineering enrollments slump' click https://reut.rs/2OVInz6)""We've solved crazier problems than this. This is seriously not hard if people have the will,"" said Sam Retallack, head of hiring at miner Independence Group. It will require a ""big philosophical shift,"" but miners must offer more flexible working conditions to attract the next generation of workers, she said. The conversation is echoing around the industry. A WASM director, just hours before the carousing in Kalgoorlie, had delivered a pointed address about how the industry must change its testosterone-charged reputation.""Mining has a dirty image,"" mining engineer Sabina Shugg of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mining Innovation Hub told a packed hall. ""You can have a lot of talk about intent, but really it's all about outcomes."" Curtin University, of which WASM is a part, said it promotes equality and diversity, and actively works to enhance opportunities for women, particularly in mining. Curtin said that it did not organize the event, did not receive any complaints and could not verify the reported behavior. ""Curtin is very disappointed to receive this report of disrespectful behavior,"" it said in a statement. (For a graphic on 'Women in Mining' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2ps0S3K)HIRING DIFFICULTIESEven top global miner BHP Billiton (LON:BLT), which has set an ""ambitious, aspirational goal"" of achieving gender balance globally by 2025, fell short of its yearly target, raising the proportion of female employees by 1.9 percent to 22.4 percent. In senior management positions, however, the proportion of women slipped by 1 percentage point.""These results show we are making progress, although we did not achieve the 3 percent annual growth to which we aspire,"" BHP said in its annual report on Tuesday. Large-scale layoffs after commodity busts in recent years and an environmentally challenged image have also harmed mining's reputation among potential hires, industry sources said. Yet miners are hiring, with a big uptick in exploration investment. The industry spent A$547 million ($391.76 million) in the three months ending in June, an increase of 6.8 percent over the previous quarter and a jump of 28.9 percent for the year, according to Australia's Bureau of Statistics.MARKETING IMAGERYPart of the issue is the industry's marketing, which appeals to masculine stereotypes, said Gabriela Love, a mining engineer at ASX-listed Newcrest and chairwoman of Women in Mining and Resources Victoria. ""Mining is marketed as dirty and dull. You think of BHP and its ads are all trucks and high-vis gear; that's painting the industry in a certain way,"" she said. ""But now we're in a digital age, with robotics, big data, high tech. Mining is all of that.""BHP declined to comment about its marketing. Mining is the most male dominated-industry in Australia, with women making up 16 percent of the sector's national workforce for the past decade, according to government data on Friday.""The sector faces an ongoing challenge to attract and retain the substantial number of additional women required to boost diversity and take advantage of a significant untapped workforce,"" the Department of Industry said in a report. Women can feel isolated in the industry and less inclined to speak up, which undermines the benefits of diversity, Love said.""When you're walking round the mess hall, it's a sea of men,"" she said. Highly specialized positions that require workers to travel to a remote location for ""fly in, fly out"" work can be more difficult for parents in particular. One geotechnical engineer, among the most sought-after specializations, was laid off from a mining major last year as she prepared to return from maternity leave.During her pregnancy, her manager had told her that if he gave her flexible working conditions, he'd have to give them to everyone.""I was a senior engineer wanting to stay involved in the industry. When I needed the support, I found myself out of a job. I felt disillusioned with the industry and the company.""Offering the option to work remotely or on secondment in consulting from a big city would benefit workers and the company, she said. To be sure, incremental changes at majors  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and BHP are rippling through the industry, particularly after the companies set up remote work centers in Perth so fewer employees needed to be at mine sites.Among other measures, Rio has also introduced a global paid parental leave standard, while BHP is moving to replace heavy physical labor with robots, and is working with suppliers to redesign equipment so it is more ergonomic for women. ""I think that the industry has a reputation that may not be well deserved in today's world,"" BHP's chief technology officer, Diane Jurgens, told Reuters. ""I think it's a lot to do with the perceptions of the industry. We need to change that,"" she said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

39,"Sep 06, 2018 05:23AM ET","European shares supported by utilities, Safran as trade woes loom",nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - European shares were buoyed on Thursday by gains among utility stocks although fresh losses in emerging markets and worries Washington will follow through on plans to levy an extra $200 billion of Chinese imports kept investors on the edge.The pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark hit its lowest level since early April in early trading but later turned slightly positive to trade up 0.1 percent by 0854 GMT.""The turmoil within emerging markets also continues, widening from Argentina and Turkey, (is) dampening global sentiment even further all the while we await the U.S. decision on additional China import tariffs,"" Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken said. A consultation period on the proposal to slap fresh tariffs on China ends on Thursday, paving the way for a decision, although it is unclear how quickly that will happen. Utilities were the strongest gainers with Italy's state-controlled  Enel  (MI:ENEI) rising 2.5 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to buy. Analysts at the U.S. bank said Enel has the capacity to buy back 10 billion euro worth of shares over the coming years. In Britain,  Centrica  (L:CNA) added 3.7 percent after the local regulator set an energy price cap that was at the lower range of analysts' expectations.Top gainer on the STOXX was  Safran  (PA:SAF) which rose to a fresh record high after a strong update. The world's No. 3 aerospace supplier raised full-year forecasts following better-than-expected results in the first half on strong demand for spares and services.Safran gained 6 percent, supporting other aerospace stocks including plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR), which rose 1.8 percent.Among top fallers was Sodexo (PA:EXHO), down 5 percent, after the French food services and facilities management group unveiled a new strategic plan that failed to dispel concerns that the road to recovery would be long. Sodexo, whose shares been hit this year after warnings mostly related to weaknesses in the North American business, said it planned to deliver revenue growth above 3 percent by fiscal year 2019/20.""Financial targets out to 2020 are relatively muted and would suggest it will take time for any material improvements to be delivered,"" RBC Capital Markets in a note. Weir Group  (L:WEIR) led fallers, down 6.3 percent after the maker of pipes for the energy and mining industries said there were initial signs of pricing pressure and flagged a softening in demand.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and AMS (S:AMS) fell 2.5 and 1.5 percent respectively with traders citing disappointing August sales unveiled by Taiwanese peer Largan Precision (TW:3008).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

52,"Jul 05, 2018 05:13AM ET",European shares advance as U.S. tariff suspension hopes boost autos,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - A strong rise across autos boosted European shares on Thursday, as hopes over a softening in U.S. trade rhetoric lifted the sector, though trading remained cautious ahead of a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.4 percent by 0859 GMT, while Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) rose 1 percent, supported by autos.European stocks have traded in a narrow range this week in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports set to go into effect on Friday.Sectors which have been particularly hit by the uncertainty over the trade rift made some headway on Thursday, with autos (SXAP) jumping 3.2 percent, while basic resources (SXPP) rose 1.3 percent and banks (SX7P) were up 1.1 percent.German autos BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_P) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were among the biggest STOXX risers, up as much as 4.7 percent following a report about a U.S. offer to suspend threats to impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union.""The damage potentially may have already been done with some of these downturns, with some of these stocks, and now is a good time to make a few value plays under the assumption that these trade tariffs might not actually come to fruition,"" Jasper Reimers, market analyst at Vertex Capital Group, said.""With the deadline tomorrow for trade tariffs, there's clearly a lot of buying into this market at the moment.""Autos have struggled in 2018 and remain down 8 percent for the year, among the worst-performing sectors in Europe.Europe's tech sector (SX8P), which came under pressure in the previous session after a Chinese court banned U.S. peer Micron (O:MU) selling chips, regained ground with a 1 percent rise.Elsewhere, company updates were in focus. Shares in France's Sodexo (PA:EXHO) were one of the biggest STOXX 600 gainers, up 5.2 percent after the food services and facilities management group maintained its full-year goals despite posting slower third-quarter sales growth.However, shares in Primark-owner Associated British Foods (L:ABF) slid around 5 percent after the company warned again on the outlook for its sugar business, though it maintained its overall guidance for the full-year. SBM Offshore (AS:SBMO) was the biggest faller, down nearly 7 percent after a Brazilian court ordered Petrobras (SA:PETR4) to provisionally withhold some payments to SBM to ensure the Dutch company paid whatever penalties it received in a corruption case.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) declined 0.8 percent, with industrials, consumer staples and financials the biggest weights.The tech sector (SX8P) dropped 1 percent, weighed by chipmakers after an overnight report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to replace Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips in Macs with its own. The index has fallen 8 percent in the past three weeks as anxiety grew over big tech companies with the focus on Facebook's use of data, and regulation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Reports of Apple increasingly going down the ""insourcing"" route have dented shares in Apple suppliers around the world, most notably Europe's Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) which has shed more than 60 percent in the past year.On Tuesday ams led the falls, down 2.8 percent, while STMicro (MI:STM) declined 2.3 percent and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell 1.7 percent. Risk appetite was poor across the board, as European investors followed U.S. and Asian investors to the exit after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs.Outside the tech sector, food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was the worst-performing on the STOXX, down 3.8 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut the stock to ""neutral"", citing competition and cost inflation.Acquisition news also continued to move the European market. Eurofins Scientific (PA:EUFI) shares fell 2.9 percent, the worst performers on the STOXX, after the firm acquired Lab Frontier in South Korea.Basic resources and oil & gas stocks were a rare bright spot, making gains as metals prices rose.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

67,"Mar 29, 2018 04:57AM ET",Cyclicals drive European shares higher as Renault M&A news boosts autos,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A recovery among cyclical sectors and a raft of M&A news helped boost European shares further on Thursday, shaking off a tech-led sell-off which had spread across global markets earlier in the week.Auto stocks (SXAP) led gains as  Renault  (PA:RENA) jumped 6.4 percent to a more than 10-year high after Bloomberg reported Nissan and Renault were in talks to merge.Hopes of dealmaking spread to other auto stocks, driving them up too.  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose 1.6 to 3.3 percent. Cyclical industrials, autos, and banking stocks drove the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.2 percent. The index was still set for its worst quarter in two years, however, suffering a 5 percent decline. Starting with a stellar rally in global equities in January, this quarter developed into a challenging one for stock markets with investors navigating a sharp spike in volatility, rumbling trade tensions and anxiety over the tech sector.In Europe, slowing macroeconomic indicators have been taken as a ""sell"" signal for the region's equities, which had enjoyed a lift most of last year as a narrative of stronger economic growth took hold. ""Support from attractive valuations and fading FX headwinds is not enough to override the signal from relative macro surprises,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) equity analysts, reaffirming their underweight position on European equities versus the U.S.M&A news was the main driver on Thursday.Besides Renault,  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) was also a top gainer, up 2.3 percent after a report that Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which has been in deal talks with the reinsurance firm, is looking to buy a 25 percent stake. [L8N1RB1CB]Meanwhile services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) sank 15 percent after cutting its full-year sales and profit margin outlook, reporting a weaker than expected second quarter.""Given management guidance, we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share price pressures, near term,"" said UBS analysts.Peers  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) and  Compass Group  (L:CPG) also declined 2.2 to 2.4 percent, making the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) the worst-performing. While cyclicals were ruling the roost on Thursday, defensive sectors have enjoyed something of a revival in recent weeks as investors rushed to the areas of the market traditionally seen as safer, with stable earnings and high dividends.""Should concerns about a trade war escalate, defensive stocks would likely outperform ... We would be wary of cyclicals, in particular international ones,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.Positioning on cyclicals is elevated,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts found.

74,"Jan 11, 2018 04:50AM ET",Results drive sharp moves in European stocks,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European share trading got off to a hesitant start on Thursday as concerns over protectionism and a bond market sell-off made the breakneck New Year rally in equities fizzle out. Results drove the bulk of stock moves, with some disappointments weighing heavily. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and euro zone equities (STOXXE) dipped 0.1 percent, recovering from sharp losses in the previous session when jitters over a report that China was considering slowing purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds spilled over into stocks.A Chinese regulator on Thursday said the report may be ""fake"".Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) meanwhile touched a fresh record, its third in as many days, before falling back to trade down 0.1 percent. UK retailers  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) were among the biggest European fallers after their Christmas trading updates disappointed, with consumers cutting down on non-essential items.Europe's retail sector (SXRP) was the worst-performing, down 0.8 percent as a result, while bank stocks (SX7P), which had jumped on Wednesday as bond yields surged, fell back 0.3 percent.Danish jewellery firm  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) dropped to the bottom of the STOXX, down 13 percent after the company said it expected profit margins to fall in the next few years and reported 2017 revenue below expectations.Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) jumped up 4.2 percent, after its CEO was cleared of insider trading charges.While it was too early in the season to fully determine what impact results were having, investors said earnings would be under particular scrutiny this year as the market hoped for another year of earnings growth. ""You didn't really have any earnings growth coming through since the euro zone crisis, it was a kind of Groundhog Day every year, but 2017 was a break from that effect,"" said Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital. ""The earnings season will be quite important. If Europe can continue demonstrating earnings growth at index level as an asset class it will be very attractive,"" he added. In other big moves, the restructuring French telecoms and cable firm Altice (AS:ATCA) tumbled 5.8 percent, extending Wednesday's slide, after its U.S. unit announced a $500 million junk bond sale.Chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) gained 3.2 percent after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) upgraded the stock to 'outperform', saying margins for the iPhone supplier would continue to expand.Sodexo (PA:EXHO) also fell victim to disappointing results, its shares down 3 percent after the firm reported a slow start to its first quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

78,"Dec 21, 2017 05:30AM ET",U.S. tax cuts mix pleasure and pain for Europe's dollar earners,nan,"By Alasdair PalLONDON (Reuters) - A slate of U.S. tax reforms could provide a lift for European companies that sell into the country. For others, it may yet turn out to be a threat. Proposals passed by lawmakers on Wednesday will see the corporate tax rate in the United States fall to 21 percent from 35 percent, a dramatic cut that is likely to boost the profits of American corporations.The change is likely to benefit some European companies, too, and investment banks have been quick to point that out: JP Morgan has introduced a basket of 41 European stocks it believes will benefit most for its clients to buy. More than a sixth of companies in the pan-European Stoxx 600 index (STOXX) derive more than a third of their revenues from North America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Thirty-one stocks generate more than half their turnover in the United States. Nineteen of those are UK-domiciled, with construction and defense companies well-represented: Ashtead (L:AHT),  Cobham  (L:COB), Ferguson (L:FERG),  Meggitt  (L:MGGT) and  Melrose  (L:MRON) are all heavily exposed, according to the data. Equipment rental firm Ashtead, whose U.S. Sunbelt arm made up 86 percent of 2016 revenues, should see a “material impact” from the tax reform, according to analysts at Liberum. The company has told analysts it expects its effective tax rate to fall from 34-35 percent to 23-25 percent -- an uplift of 15 percent to Liberum’s current profit estimates for 2020.Building and plumbing supplier Ferguson, with 78 percent of its revenues from the United States, could also benefit according to analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), though the company said in its quarterly results in early December the reduction of its tax rate would be less than four percentage points.InterContinental Hotels (L:IHG) (58 percent U.S. revenues) said on Thursday its tax rate would reduce by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points, as well as benefiting from an ""exceptional"" tax credit in the year the bill is signed. Share prices of many U.S.-exposed European companies have seen strong gains as the tax bill edged towards the finish line. But Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said analysts have been quite slow to factor it into their 2018 company earnings estimates. ""It would not be that surprising if we see that with P/E having expanded already, as those earnings upgrades come through that potentially takes (share prices) even a little bit higher,"" he said. But not all firms that earn in dollars will gain an advantage. Boeing (NYSE:BA) N>, whose main commercial planemaking rival is Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), said it would now pay tax at rates closer to those of global rivals, helping it compete better.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said French catering company Sodexo (PA:EXHO), which makes 61 percent of operating profit (EBIT) in the United States, could see 6 percent EBIT upside from the reforms, but the investment bank believes British rival Compass already has a lower U.S. tax rate than Sodexo and would see ""little benefit"". Daniel Ekstein, an analyst at UBS, said the broker has received a number of questions about whether Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) would benefit. Despite deriving 62 percent of revenues from the United States, the retailer’s tax rate is already low at around 24 percent, meaning its U.S. peers could benefit more and leading to deflation in the retail sector.“If the U.S food retail industry were to benefit from, say, an average 5 percent reduction in tax rate we believe that in the mid-term you'd see shelf-edge prices 5 percent lower, rather than margins 5 percent higher,” he said in a note to clients.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""After the recent underperformance, we should see cyclicals outperform again in the next few weeks with long-term interest rates rising and a steeper yield curve,"" he added. Investors continued to digest a raft of earnings updates, with most of the top movers reacting to results.French telecoms firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) led gains, up 4.2 percent after raising its profitability goal for the year, buoyed by a robust 37 percent jump in nine-month operating profits.Facilities and catering firm Sodexo (PA:EXHO) however fell 4 percent as traders and analysts expressed disappointment over its margin guidance and annual revenues coming in slightly below consensus forecasts. Swedish appliances maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) fell 2.9 percent despite saying it expected home appliances markets to grow in 2018.The results were overshadowed by industry data showing home appliance shipments in the United States, a major market for Electrolux, fell 1.3 percent year-on-year in October.Troubled British engineer GKN (L:GKN) sank 7.9 percent, the top faller after it announced a further write-off.Broker action was also a driver. Biotech firm  Genmab  (CO:GEN) rose 3.6 percent after Bernstein rated it an ""outperform"", while Wirecard (DE:WDIG) shares gained 3.2 percent after Berenberg recommended buying into the payments sector.Italian banks Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and BPER Banca (MI:EMII) were among the top fallers after Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) failed to clinch a cash call, reigniting fears around bad loans in the sector.European equity strategists at Bernstein said recent risk aversion created a buying opportunity as “robust” earnings outlook continued to provide fundamental support for the market.Overall the MSCI EMU index of euro zone companies is tracking earnings growth of 10.7 percent in dollar terms for the third quarter, with basic materials, financials and technology the main drivers of earnings beats. The broader MSCI Europe index is delivering 10 percent earnings growth. Investors emphasized earnings beats were not all they were looking for, saying companies this quarter had delivered slightly disappointing top line revenue growth.""Earnings are standing up better than revenues this quarter,"" said Andrew King, head of European equities strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Investment Partners.""We'd like to see a bit more top line driven profit growth going forward if we're really to get enthused about the profit recovery,"" he added.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) had fallen 1.1 percent by 1204 GMT, with all sectors trading in negative territory after the minutes. Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) also hit an 11-week low, while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell 0.8 percent.""There was nothing in the (June ECB) press conference that suggested that they talked about curtailing QE. But in fact they did,"" said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam.A series of earnings updates also grabbed the focus with  Reckitt Benckiser  and Sodexo leading fallers after both companies cut their guidance. Reckitt (L:RB) was down 2 percent, making it one of the biggest weights on the STOXX. The UK consumer goods group cut its growth forecast after a global cyber attack last month disrupted business in multiple markets. ""We would not see weakness in the share price today as a buying opportunity. Reckitt's markets are likely to have remained sluggish, with peers signaling no pick up here,"" Investec said, cutting its price target on the stock.Sodexo (PA:EXHO), the world's second-biggest catering services firm after  Compass Group  (LON:CPG), also cut its sales growth goal after weaker-than-expected third quarter results, sending its stock down 5.6 percent to a 14-week low. Compass shares were down 1.7 percent. Some earning updates struck a more positive note.Associated British Foods (L:ABF) rose 2.6 percent, among top gainers in Europe, after the company said its full-year outlook had marginally improved after a better-than-expected performance from its Primark clothing chain.""The key divisional figure in this statement, as has become the norm with ABF, is Primark sales growth,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.In the banking sector, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) was the biggest gainer, up 3.3 percent after a Bloomberg report said that buy-out firm Cerberus was considering buying a minority stake in the German lender through purchases on the market.The broader banking sector (SX7P), recently underpinned by talk of tightening monetary policy conditions, was just 0.4 percent lower following the ECB minutes.Stocks sensitive to a rise in interest rates, such as utilities (SX6P), continue to weigh, with the sector down 1.3 percent.Meanwhile Italian banks (FTIT8300) rose 0.3 percent, continuing to outperform after a series of deals in the last two weeks that have restored confidence in the sector's prospects.Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said there were no more ""brushfires"" threatening other banks after the government wound down two Veneto-based lenders last month in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects there to be “difficult discussions” even as her country’s Foreign Minister said he’s worried that Trump could “start a trade war with Europe”.In a light day for data on the European economic front, German factory orders  rose by just 1% in May, missing forecasts for a gain of 2.0%, although the rebound after the prior month’s decline bolstered hopes that April’s decrease was the result of transitory weakness.The European Central Bank (ECB) will publish the minutes from its own policy meeting at 7:30AM ET (11:30GMT).In company news, AB Foods (LON:ABF) led advancers on the Stoxx 600 with gains of nearly 5% as the British firm said strong performance in its clothing chain and a weaker sterling has improved its outlook.On the downside, Sodexo (PA:EXHO) led decliners with losses of 6% as the French catering company cut its sales guidance. Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC  (DE:RB) was also off 1% after the German consumer goods giant also cut its forecast due to last month’s cyber-attack.Meanwhile, oil prices regained ground on Thursday after an industry report on Wednesday showing a far larger than expected crude inventory drawdown.Data from industry group The American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of just 1.6 million.The Energy Information Administration was to release its inventory report at 11:00AM (15:00GMT) on Thursday, with analysts expecting a drawdown of 2.28 million barrels.Both reports come one day later than usual because of this week’s Independence Day holiday.European energy stocks traded mixed, as French oil and gas major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) lost 0.29%, but Italy’s  ENI  (MI:ENI) and Norwegian rival  Statoil  (OL:STL) gained 0.30% and 0.73%, respectively.Financial stocks were also mixed, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) dropped 0.33% but  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) inched up 0.01% while Germany’s  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) gained 0.89% and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) traded up 1.15%.Among peripheral lenders, Italian banks  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and rival Unicredit (MI:CRDI) rose 0.14% and 1.14%, respectively, while Spanish banks BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) fell 0.29% and 1.86%, respectively.In London, the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 inched up 0.01%.Shares in  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) edged forward 0.03%,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) rose 0.81%, BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) gained 1.38% and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) advanced 0.10%.Energy stocks showed mixed signs, as  BP  (LON:BP) gained 0.27% but rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) lost 0.23%.Financial stocks saw mixed trade, with shares in  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) down 0.28% and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) up 1.64%, while Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) gained 0.32% and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) rose 0.51%.In the U.S., stock futures pointed to a flat to lower open.

133,"Apr 14, 2016 05:42AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know In the Market on Thursday,nan,"Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, April 14:1. BoE to announce monetary policy decisionThe Bank of England (BoE) will announce its monetary policy decision on Thursday at 11:00AM GMT, or 7:00AM ET.Despite the fact that inflation hit a 15-month high, the low level of 0.5% implies that no changes to interest rates would be necessary and the members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) were expected to vote unanimously to keep both rates and the asset purchase program unchanged.The minutes will be closely watched to see the BoE’s concern over the current economic situation and particularly with references to the Brexit, as recent surveys have shown that the vote to leave the European Union (EU) in the June 23 referendum was on the rise.2. BoJ expected to ease by July at the latestAs the Bank of Japan (BoJ) continues to fight deflation and keeps an eye on the strength of the yen, a Reuters poll of economists showed that the monetary authority would implement further easing measures by July at the latest.Half of the 16 analysts surveyed believed a move would come at the next meeting on April 27-28, with another three forecasting action in June and the remaining five placing bets on July.3. Earnings season in focus:  Burberry  crashes; Bank of America and  Wells Fargo  on tapThe balance of earnings reports on Thursday in the European morning session was largely negative, with Burberry Group PLC (LON:BRBY) plunging 6% after the British luxury fashion brand reported a 5% drop in like-for-like sales last quarter and warning on profit.In other large moves in European trade,  Persimmon  PLC (LON:PSN), Sodexo (PA:EXHO) and  Casino  Guichard (PA:CASP) were all trading lower after reporting earnings, while Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) traded up almost 2% after confirming its outlook and reporting a 3.9% in underlying sales growth.Stateside, both Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) were scheduled to report earnings before the U.S. open on Thursday after JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) tallied gains of 4% on Wednesday after its own earnings-per-share beat consensus.4. U.S. inflation, jobless claims and Fed speakers on the docketInvestors will face a deluge of references later on Thursday as the U.S. reports both inflation data and weekly jobless claims at 12:30GMT, or 8:30AM ET.The Federal Reserve (Fed) will also be in the spotlight at 14:00GMT, or 10:00AM ET, as Fed governor Jerome Powell was scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Subcommittee on trends in fixed-income markets and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart was slated to moderate a conversation on the perspective of the U.S. monetary authority.5. Oil ticks down over doubts of a meaningful impact from any agreement in DohaOil retreated from 2016 highs on Thursday as pessimism grew over the ability of major oil producers to reach an agreement on Sunday that would be capable of reining in oversupply.Russian oil minister Alexander Novak admitted that any deal will be loosely-framed with few detailed commitments.The International Energy Agency warned Thursday that a deal is likely to have a limited impact on global supply and markets are unlikely to rebalance before 2017.U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.17% to $41.69, at 9:56AM GMT, or 5:56AM ET, while Brent oil traded down 0.29% to $44.05."
