2,"Jun 14, 2019 05:39AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 14:1. Broadcom tumbles as U.S.-China trade dispute causes chip demand slowdownShares in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) tumbled around 9% in premarket trade Friday as the company forecast a slowdown in demand for chips, blaming the trade dispute between the U.S. and China as well as the export ban on Huawei.""It is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility,"" Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a conference call with analysts.The warning caused waves across the sector dragging down European chipmakers such as Infineon (DE:IFXGn), ASML (AS:ASML) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) during their regular session, while other U.S. rivals - like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) - also fell in premarket trade.2. China industrial output growth hits 17-year low amid trade conflictChina's industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to its slowest rate in over 17 years in May, the latest sign of weakening demand in the world's second-largest economy as the U.S. ramps up trade pressure.Although hopes remain that some type of deal could be reached at an expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in two weeks, both sides show little sign of backing down.China said on Friday it was raising anti-dumping duties on certain alloy-steel seamless tubes and pipes used at utilities and imported from the United States and the European Union.3. Oil prices correct after tanker attack surge as IEA increases output forecastOil prices dropped on Friday after suspected attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman sent crude soaring a day earlier.The U.S. government showed a video of the attacks and laid the blame on Iran, although Tehran denied involvement.G20 ministers plan to hold a meeting to discuss the attacks ahead of their summit at the end of the month.Also putting downward pressure on oil, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that non-OPEC production was expected to surge by 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 while OPEC members sit on 3.2 million bpd of spare capacity.4. Retail sales, consumer sentiment data aheadOn Friday’s economic calendar, market focus will be on the state of the American consumer.The Commerce Department will release retail sales for May at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), while the University of Michigan will publish its preliminary data on consumer sentiment for June at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).Although the Fed is not expected to make any changes to interest rates at the June 18-19 policy meeting, weak numbers would support market conviction that the U.S. central bank could begin cutting rates as early as July. Fed funds futures price in the probability at 88%.5. U.S. futures dip on China worries, Chewy rounds off strong week for IPOsThe double-whammy of weak Chinese industrial production and Broadcom’s warning sent U.S. futures lower on Friday, with particular pressure on the tech sector. Dow futures dropped 30 points, or 0.1% by 5:37 AM ET (9:37 GMT), S&P 500 futures fell 6 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 47 points, or 0.6%.Outside of trade developments and economic data, traders will pay attention to the stock market debut of Petsmart’s Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), which priced its IPO above the high end of the marketing range at $22 a share.It's been a strong week for IPOs despite the steady drumbeat of negative news. Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has doubled since its debut on Wednesday, while gig economy company Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) rose 90% Thursday on its debut.Read more: Pressure Is Piling Up On Bank Stocks: Is It Time To Bail Out? - Haris Anwar-- Reuters contributed to this report."

8,"May 20, 2019 04:16AM ET","StockBeat - Infineon, STMicro Fall as Huawei Ban Roils Chip Market",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- When the elephants fight, it’s the ants that get trampled.Europe’s biggest chipmakers Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) – elephants in their own backyard – are getting a taste of life as an ant this morning as the trade dispute between China and the U.S. threatens to spiral out of control.The two companies have been put in an awkward place by last week’s executive order from the U.S. effectively banning U.S. companies dealing directly with telecoms giant Huawei without a government license. Reports over the weekend suggested that companies from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) had already stopped selling to the Chinese giant.According to a report by Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review, Germany’s Infineon has suspended sales to Huawei for fear of causing itself legal trouble in the U.S., while French-based STMicro (PA:STM) has scheduled meetings with the Chinese company for later this week to clarify its situation.As of 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), Infineon was down 3.1%, while STMicro was down 3.8%, both at the bottom of their respective indexes. Germany’s Dax and the CAC 40 were both down a little less than 0.1%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 opened the week effectively flat at 381.60.According to Nikkei, Infineon’s direct sales to Huawei are minimal – less than $100 million a year (compared to annual revenue of .7.94 billion euros. For STMicro, the direct impact would be larger as Huawei is one of its 10 biggest clients, according to regulatory filings cited by Reuters.However, it isn’t just the direct effects that the two companies need to worry about. Restrictions on sales to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors, will create yet more overcapacity headaches for the industry outside China, putting more pressure on prices and margins.It’s less than two months since Infineon was forced to cut its outlook for both revenue and profit this year due to “continued sluggishness in end markets”, while STMicro kept its guidance, but trimmed its planned capital expenditure.Even if demand does pick up, the German company said it would only slowly feed through to the bottom line because global inventories are already at high levels. Huawei has been stockpiling for months to protect itself against being cut off from western suppliers, according to various reports."

12,"May 13, 2019 04:18AM ET",StockBeat: Tariff Spotlight Shifts to European Automakers,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- The U.S. is now preparing to widen 25% tariffs on all imports from China. Will Europe be next?Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain. Parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) is at the bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5%, tiremakers Continental (DE:CONG) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) are also down sharply, and even chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are being affected by the general malaise, due to their exposure to the auto sector.All that said, the sector may get a stay of execution. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that “there are signs that (the deadline) could be extended because of the talks between the U.S. and China.”“We’re prepared for the worst,” she added, noting that the EU has drawn up a list of U.S. products that would also have tariffs imposed on them if the U.S. goes ahead with its threat"

18,"Apr 24, 2019 04:59AM ET","StockBeat - Elliott Effect Lifts SAP, as Softbank Bets on Wirecard",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- The Elliott Effect just hit SAP (DE:SAPG).The B2B software provider is at the top of the Dax and the Euro Stoxx 50 after early trading on Wednesday, after Paul Singer’s Elliott Management disclosed it has accumulated a $1.3 billion stake in the company via stock and derivatives.Normally, that could have set Germany’s most valuable company up for a potentially bruising battle with one of Wall Street’s most aggressive activist investors. However, SAP appears to have pre-empted a head-on clash by announcing new targets for profit margins and stock repurchases. They’re designed to reassure investors who have been unsettled by recent high-profile departures and by uncertain progress in migrating its core software business to a cloud-based subscription model.The new targets more than made up for a quarterly loss caused by restructuring charges and other items related to SAP's expensive-looking $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics last year. Underlying earnings rose by more than expected, while operating margins from its cloud-based business also improved.Elliott said it agrees with the strategy, according to newswire reports.The shares rose as much as 7% to a new all-time high in early trading and were up 6.6% as of 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).SAP was one of two reasons Germany’s DAX was alone in staying in the green early Wednesday, on a day when profit-taking kicked in across Asian and European markets after Wall Street hit new record highs on Tuesday. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.46 points, or 0.1%, at 390.90.The other reason for the Dax’s outperformance was payments processor Wirecard (DE:WDIG), which rose over 7% after Japan’s venture capital giant Softbank announced a $1 billion investment. That’s a huge vote of confidence in a company that has been plagued by allegations of false accounting – allegations that it has repeatedly denied.Quarterly reports from across Europe have also included some other positive surprises:  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) rose 2.6% after reporting an 8% increase in net profit in the quarter, while chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) rose 3.1% after beating expectations. Pharma giant  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) also rose 2.7% as it raised its full-year guidance for core operating profit after a strong first quarter. U.K. fast-fashion group boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) also rose 3.8% after announcing a sharp rise in full-year sales and improved profit margins."

The comparable figure for France, released earlier, had also fallen more sharply than expected to 49.8, below the 50 level that signals no change in activity. The flash reading for the euro zone fell to 47.6, well below expectations of 49.8.As such, the euro zone’s manufacturing sector appears to have contracted in the first quarter, eking out only a small gain in January and shrinking in both of the following months.At 05:00 AM ET (09:00 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 1.80 points or 0.5% at 378.90, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.6%, the French CAC 40 and the FTSE 100 were both down 0.8%.The numbers come at a bad time for sentiment, after Thursday’s EU summit greatly increased the risk of a disorderly Brexit  despite pushing back the March 29 deadline by two weeks. The brief extension still allows little time for the U.K. parliament to formulate an alternative course of action if – as is still likely – Prime Minister Theresa May fails to win approval for her Withdrawal Agreement.Among individual stocks,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had stood out before the PMIs with a trading update that forecast its first rise in revenue in years. However, it reversed after the data to be up only 0.7%.The only other outperformers of note were again chipmakers, supported by the rally in U.S. tech stocks on Friday. Infineon (DE:IFXGn) was up 0.3%, while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) was up 0.1% and U.K.-based software company  Micro Focus  (LON:MCRO) was up 1.4%"

Germany’s Dax was down 0.4% and France’s CAC 40 was flat.The only clear outperformer was the U.K. FTSE 100, up 0.4% thanks entirely to its natural resources companies. The Fed’s action has made the dollar cheaper and depressed dollar yields, and that should support global demand for commodities which are priced in dollars. It will also make it easier for emerging markets to finance their dollar-denominated debts.The news out of the Fed pushed the price of U.S. crude over $60 a barrel, and pushed the price of the international benchmark Brent as far as $68.69 – a four-month high for both blends. Consequently, oil majors  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) are up some 1%, while smaller producers such as  Lundin Petroleum  AB (ST:LUPE) and  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) are outperforming.Mining stocks are faring even better: BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB),  Glencore  (LON:GLEN),  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) are all up by over 2%. Miners and oil companies are getting a double-lift from Prime Minister Theresa May's single-handed attempts to wrestle the pound lower by threatening a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday evening.The only other outperformers of note are semiconductor stocks. That’s a result of U.S. chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) predicting an upturn in the global market in the second half of the year. Germany’s Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and France-based STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are both leading their respective indexs, up 1.3% and 2.0% respectively.Among the biggest losers –  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), both down 3.5% after strong pushback from regulators against their proposed merger."

IHS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index for the euro zone rose for the first time in four months in January, with an index reading of 51 that indicates the economy was still in expansion mode at the start of the year.At 05:00 AM ET (10.00 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.8% at 3,189.35, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.1% and the German Dax 30 up 0.9%Leading the charge are Italy’s bombed-out banks, which have been under pressure for months as the country slid back into recession, threatening to add to their mountain of bad debts. While there is no clear trigger in today’s news, there has been speculation that the recent collapse of small regional lender Carige could speed up consolidation in the sector.Later today, Intesa SanPaolo, the country’s largest bank, will report earnings for the fourth quarter that should include solid gains on its bond portfolio. Italian bonds rallied sharply in December, unnoticed by equity markets that were preoccupied with the China-U.S. trade war. Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Banco Bpm SpA (MI:BAMI) and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) have all followed Intesa higher this morning.Elsewhere,  BP  (LON:BP) led the U.K. FTSE 100 higher with a surge in profits and revenue – including a big contribution from Russian oil giant  Rosneft  (LON:ROSNq), in which it holds an 18% stake.Lagging the field are chipmakers, after a disappointing update from Germany’s Infineon (DE:IFXGn) that also weighed on its rival STMicroelectronics (PA:STM)."

51,"Jan 25, 2019 02:05PM ET",Take Five: Time for a break? World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.AND SO BEGINS THE PAUSEThe U.S. Federal Reserve convenes its first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in December. But while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019, the darkening global economic outlook, convulsing stock markets and a record-long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture.Now, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is preaching ""patience"" with regard to future rate increases, and he's been joined by two other governors and all 12 Fed regional bank presidents.But what happens after such a pause? Interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2.25-2.50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting. A year from now, a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike.Most previous Fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction. Yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid-cycle pauses.So how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period? In both the 2000-2003 and 2007-2009 cutting cycles, the Fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later. In the present one, they've managed extended pauses twice since this cycle's first December 2015 hike. A full year lapsed between the first and second hike; six months between hikes four and five.OH CHINA, WHERE ART THOU?Alarm bells from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are still ringing in investors' ears, after the Fund cut global growth forecasts, warning in particular that failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilise the world economy. So markets will focus on Chinese manufacturing data due on Thursday and Friday to glean how the world's number two economy is faring.Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will also head to the United States on Wednesday and Thursday - with a 30-member delegation - for the next round of trade negotiations. There are reasons to be hopeful of some kind of agreement even if U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the two sides were ""miles and miles"" from resolving their trade issues. He did after all admit there was a fair chance of a deal, eventually.So far there is little clarity on how bad it could get, for China's and for the world economy and how much stimulus Beijing may be happy to provide this time round. China's obsession with market stability and the quality of credit growth adds to that challenge.PLAN B FOR BREXITAnother week, another vote. On Jan 29, Britain's parliament will debate Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed next Brexit steps as well as alternative plans put forward by lawmakers, including some that seek to delay Britain's March 29 exit from the EU.Parliament won't be asked to vote to approve a revised Brexit deal and given the crushing margin by which May's 'plan A' was defeated just a week ago, that's just as well. Greater focus though is on averting a No-deal Brexit - a scenario in which the UK crashes out of the EU with no trade agreement. That looks achievable. The opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine-month extension to Brexit should a deal not be agreed by Feb. 26.Meanwhile warnings against no-deal Brexit are coming in thick and fast from finance minister Philip Hammond as well as companies such as Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Airbus. Markets are trading accordingly - sterling has just has enjoyed its best week since Sept 2017 against the dollar. Analysts reckon if May's deal or the amendment delaying Brexit pass, sterling could rally another 5-10 percent.That may sound overly optimistic, given the challenges the UK economy will still face. Risks are finely balanced though: Remember, investors have taken off some option hedges they had put on to guard against sterling downside. If the possibility of no-deal raises its head again, they may have to scurry back to safety.TORRID TECH TIMES?Results from Apple (O:AAPL) on Tuesday and Microsoft (O:MSFT) on Wednesday will be high on the agenda as global tech struggles to recover from a tumultuous end of 2018 that saw tumbling shares and sharp downgrades to earnings expectations.The updates from the two U.S. giants follows a string of dour numbers from chipmakers across the globe, signaling more gloom in coming months for the once-high-flying sector.A slowdown in China is one of the top risks with firms ranging from South Korea's SK Hynix (KS:000660) to Texas Instruments (O:TXN) flagging weakness in the world's second largest economy as a bitter trade war with Washington rages on.In the past two years, earnings growth exceeded 15 percent. Now expectations for 2019 growth in global tech have plunged to less than 2 percent from more than 10 percent seen a few months ago, illustrating the woes facing the industry.But there's also a glimmer of hope. An upbeat forecast from chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) for the second half gave a boost to a sector where a lot of negativity has already been priced in and less demanding valuations provide a cushion to selling pressure.WINDS OF CHANGEVenezuela is likely to stay in the headlines, given opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself interim head of state in the Latin American country and received swift backing from many of his compatriots, the United States, Canada and several Latin American governments, including Brazil and Colombia.Many in Venezuela, ruled by President Nicolas Maduro since 2013, will be hoping a power handover of some kind may lift the country out of its worst ever economic crisis. Despite the world's largest crude reserves, its population is suffering from food and medicine shortages; hyperinflation could reach 10 million percent this year.The events have also lifted prices in defaulted debt issued by the government and state oil company PDVSA, with many bondholders hoping they will see payday sooner than they had expected. Oil prices too inched higher on signs U.S. sanctions against Maduro may further cut Venezuelan crude outputBut if Washington and the West are backing Guaido, Maduro too has his supporters, Russia in particular. It has offered to mediate between him and Guaido and slammed what it called U.S. efforts to effect regime change in Venezuela."

56,"Jan 24, 2019 07:53AM ET",Chip results augur more tech gloom as slowing China weighs,nan,"By Cate Cadell and Ju-min ParkBEIJING/SEOUL/PARIS (Reuters) - Somber results from chipmakers  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN), on the heels of warnings from tech behemoths Samsung and Apple, indicate more gloom for the sector as China's economy slows to its weakest in decades.A raft of earnings, analyst notes and market commentary in recent weeks have confirmed that a slowdown in the world's No.2 economy, exacerbated by its crippling trade war with the United States, will continue to squeeze sales and profits at technology companies, at least in the first half of the year.Chinese woes led to South Korea's SK Hynix turning in its first quarterly profit decline in two years. The world's No.2 memory chipmaker, which depends on China for more than a third of its revenue, also said it plans to spend 40 percent less on buying chip equipment this year.Texas Instruments (TI), supplier of touchscreen controllers, power-management chips and a control device for Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhones and iPads, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its revenue missed estimates.The Dallas-based company said demand in China was weaker than other regions, especially for smartphones, including demand from Chinese smartphone makers.""We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions,"" Dave Pahl, head of TI's investor relations, said. ""We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end-demand as well as reduced exports, but we do not have the visibility to distinguish between the two.""STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), Europe's second-biggest chipmaker after Germany's Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), said it expected first-quarter sales to drop by more than a fifth from the last quarter of 2018. The Geneva-based company, which supplies sensors to Apple and the automotive industry, is suffering from weaker demand for its mass-market microcontrollers as Asian clients use current inventories rather than placing new orders. Market data indicates shipments in China, the world's largest smartphone market, fell about 12 percent last year as consumers held on to their older devices. Economic growth in the country, which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years, slowed to its weakest in nearly three decades in 2018 and is expected to ease further this year. Smartphone shipments will further dip 3 percent in 2019 to below 400 million for the first time in five years, market research firm Canalys estimates.BAD NEWSApple was the first to flag anemic Chinese demand for iPhones with a rare cut to its sales outlook earlier this month.The company, which lost its crown as the world's top-listed firm after the news, is likely to have cut planned production for the March quarter as well, Nikkei reports.Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), chip supplier to Apple and Chinese tech giant Huawei [HWT.UL], followed with more bad news - an estimated 29 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit and subdued earnings for the current quarter.""Demand in the tech industry is going to be weaker than thought in the first half,"" Seoul-based Yuanta Securities analyst Lee Jae-yun said.""Until the first half of 2018, companies were very aggressive about their investment, then that quickly turned conservative from the second half of last year and will continue throughout the first half of 2019."" The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has lost nearly a fifth of its gains since hitting a record high in March 2018, as chip prices fell due to bleak smartphone sales and a push back in spending by data center customers to cut inventories.SILVER LININGTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330), which last week forecast its sharpest quarterly revenue fall in a decade, said a sudden drop in sales of high-end smartphones has led to an inventory build-up.Still, the pushout in chip orders is generating optimism that sales will pick up towards the later half of the year.Dutch chip-tooling company ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML), which serves Samsung, TSMC and Intel (O:INTC), told Reuters that Chinese demand for chip manufacturing equipment has not waned. ASML forecast lower sales for the first quarter, but said it would pick up later.Things are also expected to get better for Samsung and Hynix, which have been plagued by weak demand from data centers.STMicro shares jumped nearly 9 percent, making them the top performer on France's CAC 40 index after its boss delivered an upbeat forecast for the second half of the year. Huawei, the world's No. 2 smartphone maker after Samsung, struck an optimistic note on Thursday, saying 2018 sales at its consumer business exceeded a record $52 billion on strong demand for its premium smartphones. The company, which is facing mounting global scrutiny of its activities, also announced its first 5G base station chipset and said it aimed to unveil its first foldable 5G smartphone next month.ASML's American rival Lam Research (O:LRCX), posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Programmable chipmaker Xilinx's (O:XLNX) results and outlook beat analysts' expectations, helped by rollouts and preparation for so-called 5G cell phone networks in South Korea and, to a lesser extent, China and North America.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

71,"Jan 03, 2019 05:12AM ET","Apple warning shakes European shares as iPhone suppliers, luxury stocks tumble",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Apple's first sales warning in nearly 12 years sent European shares sliding on Thursday, with the tech sector particularly badly bruised as chipmakers that supply the iPhone maker fell sharply. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent as Europe joined a selloff in Asia with the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warning compounding concerns about global growth. Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares (F:AAPL) fell 7.9 percent after the tech giant cut its sales forecast, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been hit by a trade war with the U.S.Germany's DAX (GDAXI), highly sensitive to Chinese growth, fell 0.9 percent.Chipmakers that supply parts to Apple were the worst hit. Shares in AMS (S:AMS), which provides the facial recognition sensors used in the latest iPhones, fell as much as 19 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) tumbled 6.7 percent, while Infineon (DE:IFXGn), ASML (AS:ASML), ASM International (AS:ASMI),  Logitech  (S:LOGN), and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) fell 4 to 7.3 percent. ""The last Apple guidance in November saw a plethora of supply chain companies come out and follow suit in the following couple of weeks. You can expect more of the same this January,"" wrote Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. ""...You can expect ongoing volatility and downside risk for the sector. It is tin-hat time.""The tech sector (SX8P) was the worst-performing, down 2.9 percent and only the telecoms and bank sectors stayed in the black. Investors have dumped risk and preferred sectors considered defensive, like telecoms, which deliver large dividends and have steady revenues, as markets have turned sour.""Globally, investors have no desire for risky assets,"" said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management in Paris. Luxury goods shares, which are also highly sensitive to signs of slowing demand in China, joined the selloff. LVMH (PA:LVMH), Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Moncler (MI:MONC),  Burberry  (L:BRBY), and Swatch (S:UHR) were down 2.2 to 3.9 percent, among the biggest fallers.Moves were exacerbated by thin volumes, with many investors still on festive holidays. Just 16 percent of the average daily volume in the STOXX 600 was traded in the first 100 minutes, usually the busiest.Among rare gainers,  Next  (L:NXT) shares topped the STOXX with a 5.1 percent rise after the clothing retailer reported a rise in sales in the run-up to Christmas in line with its expectations.Peer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) gained 2.1 percent, while Primark owner ABF (L:ABF) rose 1.7 percent and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) rose 2.1 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

77,"Dec 10, 2018 04:53AM ET","Investors ditch European stocks, BASF slides on profit warning",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Simmering U.S-Chinese trade tensions dented European shares on Monday as investors fled risk at the start of a highly uncertain week, with Britain's parliamentary vote on Brexit also looming and chemicals stocks dented by a BASF profit warning.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.9 percent to hit a fresh two-year low, with Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) down 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.8 percent at around 0930 GMT.Oil stocks (SXEP) fell 1.1 percent, erasing their 2018 gains. Oil had been the last sector holding onto gains in Europe, and all the STOXX 600 sector indices are now in the red (with falls of 26 percent for autos and banks) or flat on the year.Shaunak Mazumder, a senior fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said a combination of worries about the U.S.-China trade row and the Brexit vote was weighing on the market. ""The market is lacking proper conviction. If the U.S.-China issue blows over, that could give support to the market. But it's difficult to call,"" he added. Shares in BASF (DE:BASFn) fell 4.7 percent after the German chemicals firm slashed its forecast for 2018 profits on Friday.It said the decline was mainly due to its chemicals business, while low water levels on the Rhine and weak automotive demand especially in China were also to blame. BASF peer Symrise (DE:SY1G) also tumbled 3.1 percent, Sika (S:SIKA) fell 5.1 percent and  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) lost 5 percent, helping to drag the pan-European chemicals index (SX4P) down 2.5 percent and making it the worst-performing sector.Construction and materials stocks (SXOP), also highly sensitive to economic growth, fell 1.5 percent, while autos stocks (SXAP) declined 1.3 percent as trade tensions took their toll. Unless U.S.-China trade talks wrap up successfully by March 1, new tariffs will be imposed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday, clarifying there is a ""hard deadline"".Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) fell 2.9 to 5.1 percent as investors ditched the tech sector.Outside of trade, politics drove some of the biggest moves. French retail, hotel, and transport stocks tumbled anew after a fourth weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests which are disrupting the economy.LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among the biggest drags on the STOXX. But France's CAC 40 (FCHI) overall did not underperform European peers, down just 0.6 percent. Shares in British energy utilities  Centrica  (L:CNA) and SSE (L:SSE) fell around 3 percent as investors held their breath ahead of a crucial vote on Brexit on Tuesday. Traders said a Sunday Telegraph report flagging a risk Centrica may struggle to pay its dividend was also hurting sentiment. British housebuilders Berkeley Group (L:BKGH),  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) fell 1.5 to 2.5 percent as nerves built and Peel Hunt cut its ratings.Outside large-cap moves, shares in  Interserve  (L:IRV) plunged as much as 71 percent, last trading down 51 percent, after the embattled British outsourcer said it was in talks with debtholders and considering converting debt to equity.

81,"Dec 06, 2018 05:16AM ET",European shares hit two-year low as Huawei arrest fuels trade worries,nan,"By Danilo MasoniLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday after the arrest of a top executive at Huawei fed new worries over the Sino-U.S. trade war, hitting export-oriented tech and auto stocks.Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada and faced extradition to the United States, a development that cast doubt on a 90-day truce on trade struck between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Saturday.By 0933 GMT, the pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) index had fallen 1.8 percent to its lowest level since December 2016. The index was down for its third day in a row, after dropping earlier this week on concern over an economic slowdown in the United States.""Investors are back in risk-off mode with markets falling in the UK, mainland Europe and across Asia. Markets are worried by numerous things: global economic growth, rising interest rates and the US/China trade war,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.The export-oriented DAX  index, which has been weakened by concern trade tensions would curb growth in China's economy, fell 2.2 percent.Auto stocks (SXAP) were among those falling the most. They dropped 2.9 percent to their lowest in more than two years, led by a 3.2 percent drop in German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). Tech (SX8P) shares also fell 2.9 percent. Huawei supplier STMicro (MI:STM) lost 4.7 percent, AMS (S:AMS) 6 percent and Dialog Semi (DE:DLGS) 2.6 percent. Ericsson (ST:ERICb). and Nokia (HE:NOKIA), rival of Huawei, outperformed . A Wall Street Journal report last month said the U.S. government was trying to persuade wireless and internet providers in allied countries to avoid equipment from Huawei.BT (L:BT) said on Wednesday it was removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its 3G and 4G mobile operations and would not use the Chinese company in central parts of the next network.""These tactics could effectively create a duopoly in the Western markets for Ericsson and Nokia for 5G,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. Ericsson (ST:ERICb) rose 1.5 percent, while the Paris-listed shares of Nokia (PA:NOKIA) added 0.1 percent.Elsewhere, Diasorin (MI:DIAS) lost the most on the STOXX 600, falling 7 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the Italian biotech company to hold from buy. In France, shares that had been hit by recent protest over fuel-tax plans, such as retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), motorway operator  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), and hotel group  Accor  (PA:ACCP), fell 1.6 to 2.2 percent.President Emmanuel Macron's government said on Wednesday it was dropping further fuel-tax increases in next year's budget in the face of protests across the country. Oil stocks (SXEP) fell more than 2 percent as crude oil prices fell on fears that a meeting by producer group OPEC on Thursday would not cut production enough to ease a supply glut.No sector in Europe was trading in positive territory.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Europe's bank index (SX7P) fell 1.7 percent, while oil and mining sectors fell 1.5 percent each. (SXEP) (SXPP) ""Cyclicals are really dependent upon accelerations in growth, they're very real economy sensitive for higher revenues,"" said John Ricciardi, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Kestrel Investment Partners. The inversion of parts of the U.S. yield curve means investors are beginning to panic about future growth and inflation, Ricciardi added.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.8 percent, set for its strongest day in eight months. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a truce at the G20 meeting on Saturday, halting additional tariffs and agreeing to fresh talks aimed at reaching an agreement within 90 days.Although markets reacted positively, some investors and analysts said there remained much for the two to agree upon. ""While President Trump described the bilateral meeting with China as ""amazing and productive"", we believe the rivalry between the U.S. and China will not be easily overcome, especially over the issue of intellectual property and market access,"" said UBS Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele in a note.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said the announcement strengthened their view that ""Trump is likely to want to conclude an agreement - even if it does not include a full rollback of tariffs - well ahead of the 2020 presidential election"".Financials were the biggest driver of European shares as China-exposed bank HSBC (L:HSBA) rose and investors cheered the prospect of a end to a trade war which has dented growth.Mining stocks (SXPP) led the gains and were up 5.1 percent on the news which gives China, the world's biggest metals consumer, more wiggle room in the next few months.

Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and AMS (S:AMS) gained 5.8 to 6.7 percent.

106,"Oct 31, 2018 06:18AM ET",Relief bounce for European shares as investors find comfort in earnings,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares rallied on Wednesday as a tumultuous October drew to a close and strong results from L'Oreal, Sanofi and banks  Standard Chartered  and Santander soothed investors' nerves. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 1.5 percent by 0945 GMT, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) 1.3 percent higher.Despite gains, the STOXX 600 was on track for its worst month since January 2016 after global equity markets reeled from sudden sell-offs and a pick-up in volatility this month. The euro zone stocks index (STOXXE) remained on course for its worst month since August 2015.Analysts and investors said month-end repositioning was part of the reason for the strong bounce on Wednesday. ""Ultimately I'm still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. ""I still think there is an element of complacency, or at least a lack of sense of any real panic - particularly in retail investor sentiment,"" he added.L’Oreal (PA:OREP) shares jumped 5.9 percent after sales growth at the company, whose brands include Maybelline, picked up pace in the third quarter, driven by booming demand in Asia.This bucked the trend of results so far warning of slower Chinese growth.""Management hosted a confident conference call reiterating confidence in the goal of achieving organic sales growth ahead of global market growth in 2018,"" wrote Liberum analysts.Shares in French pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 5.2 percent after it confirmed its return to growth with higher-than-expected third-quarter profits and raised its 2018 profit target for the second time this year.Banks Santander (MC:SAN) and Standard Chartered (L:STAN) rose 3.8 and 5.7 percent respectively after both lenders reported better results, helping boost sentiment in the battered banks sector. Outside of earnings, the market was lifted by oil and gas stocks (SXEP) as crude prices jumped, and tech stocks which have been among the worst hit by this month's slide. Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) were top gainers.Earnings disappointments still took big chunks out of some stocks. Finnish tire maker Nokian (HE:NRE1V) sank 13.3 percent after it cut its profit outlook, blaming unfavorable currency moves, high inventory levels in Russia, and lower new car sales in the Nordics for a surprise fall in quarterly earnings.Nokian was the latest in the autos sector to report weaker profits due to slowing car sales.Eutelsat (PA:ETL) shares dived 10.6 percent after the satellite firm cut its revenue guidance.Drugmaker  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  (ST:SOBIV) dropped 13.6 percent after it cut its full-year outlook due to development costs, even though it lifted its sales forecast after a strong performance by haemophilia drug Elocta.M&A also drove some big moves. Shares in British gambling firm  William Hill  (L:WMH) jumped 8.3 percent after it offered to buy Swedish gaming company Mr Green (ST:MRG) for 2.82 billion crowns ($307 million).Shares in the acquisition target surged 47 percent in early deals after the offer, a near 49 percent premium to Mr Green's last closing price.Investors were licking their wounds after a testing October for global stock markets which saw U.S. stocks sell off sharply, joining in the already bearish trend of other developed markets. ""Markets are going to have to get on board with the idea (U.S.) earnings are not going to grow by 20 percent every quarter,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management. ""I suspect in a way the markets are digesting that.""($1 = 9.1815 Swedish crowns)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

112,"Oct 24, 2018 05:51PM ET",Nasdaq confirms correction while S&P 500 and Dow erase 2018 gains,nan,"By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged again on Wednesday, confirming a correction for the Nasdaq and erasing the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year, as disappointing forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data fueled jitters about economic and profit growth.The Nasdaq closed down 12.4 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high, falling 4.4 percent for the day in its biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 18, 2011.Chipmakers Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) (N:STM) warned of slowing demand. They followed disappointing forecasts on Tuesday from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and 3M (N:MMM).The forecasts gave investors further reason to pause and helped fuel the selling momentum, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.""Once a snowball like this starts, it doesn't stop until it gets to the bottom of the hill. And we don't know if we're at the bottom yet,"" Tuz said.Stocks have been punished this month by a range of worries, from rising borrowing costs and bond yields to Italy's budget and U.S. congressional elections due in less than two weeks. On Wednesday, data showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a near two-year low in September, the latest sign that rising mortgage rates and higher prices were hurting demand for housing.Adding to weaker sentiment in late trading, the Federal Reserve said in a report on the economy that U.S. factories have raised prices because of tariffs.The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, jumped 4.52 points to close at 25.23, its highest close since Feb. 12. The S&P 500 fell for a sixth consecutive day.""It looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance based in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 608.01 points, or 2.41 percent, to 24,583.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 84.59 points, or 3.09 percent, to 2,656.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 329.14 points, or 4.43 percent, to 7,108.40.Texas Instruments (O:TXN) dropped 8.2 percent, helping pull the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) down 6.6 percent in its biggest daily percentage drop since October 2014. Intel (O:INTC), due to report earnings later this week, fell 4.7 percent.The beaten-down S&P technology sector retreated (SPLRCT) another 4.4 percent.While third-quarter profit growth estimates have risen to 22.4 percent from 21.6 percent in the last 10 days, weaker forecasts have pulled down fourth-quarter growth estimates to 19.5 percent from 20 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 91 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 445 new lows.About 9.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.After the closing bell, Microsoft (O:MSFT) rose 2.7 percent following the release of its results.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

138,"Sep 14, 2018 04:58AM ET","Trade talks, autos and tech help European shares to best week since July",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Led by technology, autos and mining stocks, European benchmarks rose on Friday after Asian markets climbed overnight on hopes of new trade talks between the United States and China.The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent by 0830 GMT, set to seal its strongest weekly gains in seven weeks. It had pared its gains somewhat after rising as much as 0.5 percent in early trading.Analysts and traders saw new trade talks as a positive for the market, with some expecting U.S. President Trump to seek to seal a trade deal before mid-term elections in November, but they pointed to lingering nerves in the market.Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) managed a 0.2 percent rise, in line with the leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E).Topping the STOXX was bank and asset manager  Investec  (L:INVP) which jumped 12 percent after saying it would demerge and separately list its asset management arm.Mining stocks (SXPP) climbed 0.6 percent as copper held near a two-week peak, helped by hopes of an easing of trade war tensions.Tech stocks (SX8P) were also among top gainers, up 0.2 percent after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed further on Wall Street following Europe's close, fuelling a rebound in the tech sector. Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) were up 2.4 to 6.3 percent. STMicro (MI:STM) got an additional boost when Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts upgraded the stock to ""neutral"".""We think the shares are pricing in a significant amount of negative sentiment with regards to near term demand,"" they wrote, also reiterating ""buy"" recommendations on Infineon and ASML.Autos (SXAP) rose 0.7 percent, building on the previous session's rise as China and the United States planned a new round of trade talks to defuse a dispute that has disrupted markets.UK housebuilders  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) were the worst-performing FTSE 100 stocks. They fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned ministers that a no-deal Brexit could cause house prices to fall by 35 percent over three years, according to the Times.Investors have been shunning European stocks in favour of U.S. stocks this year, lured by significantly stronger earnings growth there. Overall the market is currently short European equities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Some $57 billion has flowed out of Eropean equity funds over the past six months, strategists at the U.S. bank said, citing EPFR data.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Autos shares (SXAP) rose 1.5 percent and mining shares (SXPP) climbed 0.7 percent after U.S. officials invited China to new trade talks, which the Chinese foreign ministry welcomed.The two sectors have been the biggest victims of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners. ""You have to be concerned about the impact [of trade tensions on autos] because the evidence is that companies are seeing pressures as a consequence,"" said Steven Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management.""But the share prices appear to be discounting a negative scenario already,"" added Magill, who holds Peugeot in his European portfolio.

""No major acquisition expected, nothing imminent at the moment, but things could always develop by the time of the special dividend,"" wrote KBW analyst Jean Pierre Lambert.Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares topped the DAX, rising 2.6 percent after UBS analysts upgraded the stock to a ""buy"". News  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is considering an overhaul to loosen the bond between its retail and investment banks, making it easier to merge some or all of the group with rival lenders, could also be supporting the stock. Recent reports have suggested mergers between the two German lenders, as well as possible deals involving Italian and French banks, but banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date.""Despite all the recent rumours around UniCredit and other European banks, cross-border banking M&A will be limited, if any, in the foreseeable future,"" said Jauke de Jong, equity analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam.Oil storage and distribution firm  Rubis  (PA:RUBF) fell as much as 14 percent, recovering to trade down 6.4 percent by mid-morning, after issues with its Iran and Turkey operations bruised first-half profit.U.S. sanctions against Iran forced Rubis to find a buyer for a recent acquisition in Iran, leading to a 15 million euro writeoff, while the firm's oil storage facility in Ceyhan, Turkey, also underperformed due to political tensions there, Berenberg analysts said. German meal delivery firm Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) also suffered a 5.8 percent drop after its first-half results. [nL5N1VZ0PV]French tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) rose 3.1 percent after it confirmed its 2018 financial outlook, saying signs of growth in Europe and North America would offset a slowdown in China. Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) shares fell 9.8 percent after the company placed 2.46 billion shares.Investors were awaiting decisions from the ECB and the BoE, as well as a Central Bank of Turkey meeting, later in the session.Neither the ECB nor the BoE was expected to hike interest rates, but the market would hone in on any comments on the pace of the ECB's planned halving of its asset purchase programme, and from BoE policymakers on the Brexit process.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

160,"Aug 03, 2018 05:38AM ET","Tech strength, bank earnings boost European shares",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Tech stocks drove European shares up on Friday at the end of a volatile week, as investors drew encouragement from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company while supportive earnings boosted banks.Apple was a driver for the broader tech sector (SX8P) in Europe, which climbed 0.9 percent with chipmakers - some of which supply the iPhone maker - the top gainers.Ams (S:AMS), BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) rose 3.9 to 4.8 percent, while ASML (AS:ASML), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) were also higher.Analysts' expectations of tech companies' earnings per share have risen to their highest since 2000, when a bubble took sector valuations to excessive levels. Tech helped push the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up 0.4 percent by 0830 GMT.Autos (SXAP) rose 1.1 percent in a relief bounce after two days of selling following a threat by U.S. President Trump to hike tariffs on Chinese imports.Financials also climbed, after France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and Britain's RBS (L:RBS) added to a slew of positive results from European lenders.Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) reported second-quarter profits ahead of estimates, sending its shares up 2 percent, while peer  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) also gained 2 percent after its second-quarter profits rose. Shares in RBS climbed 2.8 percent after the recovering state-owned bank announced its first dividend in a decade.Overall, the banking sector's profitability is up 22 percent year-on-year and credit quality is improving, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said, calling the quarter a healthy one for banks. European corporates have delivered 7.8 percent year-on-year earnings growth for the second quarter so far, up on first quarter gains, according to Thomson Reuters data.""With global growth still robust, corporates reporting generally solid earnings, and inflation and interest rates at unthreatening levels, it’s unsurprising that our portfolios are still biased toward cyclical sectors like materials and industrials,"" said Henna Hemnani, assistant multi-asset fund manager at Miton.Also reporting on Friday, German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) rose 0.7 percent after it reaffirmed it is on track to meet 2018 profit target.""The group's key business continues to demonstrate robust operating performance and solvency remains comfortably above the upper end of the group's target range,"" said Goldman Sachs analysts. London-listed South African packaging group Mondi (L:MNDI) rose 6 percent to the top of the STOXX after it reported profits up by 25 percent in the first half thanks to higher selling prices and good demand.Among fallers, Shares in Finnish refiner and biofuel producer Neste (HE:NESTE) were down 4.8 percent after it said a Chinese import tariff on U.S. soybeans could create excess capacity and weigh on the vegetable oil market, overshadowing a stronger 2018 outlook. Bookmaker  William Hill  (L:WMH) tumbled 7.3 percent after the it reported weaker UK retail profits.Airport retailer Dufry (S:DUFN) fell 5.2 percent to a four-month low after reporting lower-than-expected sales growth. Heineken  (AS:HEIN) shares rose 1.8 percent after the firm sealed a $3.1 billion tie-up with the owner of China’s largest brewer, China Resources Beer, to take a 40 percent stake in the company.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.2 percent by 0829 GMT (4.29 a.m. ET). Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.3 percent and the FTSE 100 (FTSE) 0.2 percent.Trading has been choppy before a July 6 deadline when the United States is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from China.

News a Chinese court temporarily banned Micron Technology (O:MU) from selling chips in China, the world's biggest memory chip market, hitting shares in U.S. and Asian semiconductor stocks.""The biggest risks to the technology sector are regulation and global semiconductor disruption from an escalating trade war,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said.""At this point, the probabilities for both scenarios having major impacts on the technology sector in the short term are low,"" Garnry said.Europe's tech sector (SX8P) fell 0.5 percent lower. Chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) was down 2.8 percent and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) .7 percent. Silicon wafer-maker Siltronic (DE:WAFGN) dropped 5.8 percent .Recent guidance cuts from BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) and Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) have also weighed on sentiment around the sector, which has fallen more than 9 percent since June's 17-year high.Smaller Swiss stock Comet (S:COTNE), whose business focuses on X-ray and radio frequency technology, issued a sales and profit warning for 2018 and saw its shares plunge nearly 18 percent.Elsewhere, shares in  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) were among the biggest STOXX fallers, down 3 percent. A report citing fresh data in the bank's Estonian money-laundering case suggested its extent was greater than previously reported.More broadly, gains across defensive sectors limited losses on the STOXX.

182,"Jun 25, 2018 04:44AM ET",Europe's banks and industrials stocks sink as trade dispute deepens,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - The latest episode in a trade dispute between the United States and other major economies sent European shares further into a funk on Monday with benchmarks down 0.8 to 1.2 percent and autos, basic resources and tech stocks the worst hurt. A report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block more tech exports to Beijing hit Asian stocks overnight and dented early European trading.Europe's tech sector (SX8P), which is mainly composed of hardware firms more sensitive to trade barriers, fell 1.2 percent on the news which could herald higher costs for companies.Chipmakers BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicro (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) were the biggest fallers, down 2.6 to 3.6 percent, while heavyweight software firms SAP and Micro Focus also dropped. The autos sector (SXAP), a key target for Trump who said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent, was the worst hit. It fell 1.4 percent, set for its seventh straight day of losses. Analysts have downgraded their expectations for global autos stocks earnings worldwide as the trade war deepened over the past weeks. Bank stocks (SX7P), highly sensitive to economic turmoil, were the worst-performing with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) bottom of the DAX while HSBC (L:HSBA), Santander (MC:SAN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) led Europe-wide falls.Overall, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) declined 0.7 percent while Germany's exporter- and autos-heavy index fell 0.9 percent. An Ifo survey reading showing that Germany's business morale fell in June added extra pressure on the DAX.Overall investors have grown more risk-averse due to increasing tensions over trade, driving some to reconsider their pro-cyclical positioning. ""We recommend buying into trade-newsflow-driven market weakness as the stronger growth is what should ultimately prevail,"" said JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka. He added however that further trade war escalation could jeopardize his positive position on the DAX, on cyclicals and exporters.Industrials, which need unfettered access to markets, were also selling off. Airbus (PA:AIR), ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) were among biggest drags on the STOXX.Italian cable maker  Prysmian  (MI:PRY) fell 4.3 percent, the biggest loser on the STOXX, at the open after it cut its guidance due to additional expected costs related to issues with its UK WesternLink undersea cable project.Among stand-out gainers, Danish medical equipment maker Ambu (CO:AMBUb) jumped 6.5 percent to the top of the STOXX after JP Morgan started coverage of it with an ""overweight"" rating. Telenet (BR:TNET) also gained 5 percent after starting a 300 million euro share buyback program.British mid-cap workspace group IWG (L:IWG) rose 5.2 percent after confirming it received a possible cash offer from private equity firm Terra Firma and is evaluating it.In small-cap UK stocks, Britain's biggest real estate firm Countrywide (L:CWD) sank 23.4 percent after a profit warning, the latest in a host of UK companies to signal results would be hit by adverse market conditions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Supplier  Ams AG  (SIX:AMS) dropped as much as 6.7 percent. Other European semiconductor stocks including Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), STMicroelectronics NV (PA:STM) and Infineon Technologies AG NA O.N. (DE:IFXGn) all slipped after the Nikkei said that Apple told its supply chain to prepare about 20 percent fewer components for iPhones debuting in the latter half of this year, compared with 2017’s orders, citing people in the industry it didn’t identify.Apple’s U.S. shares are up about 14 percent so far this year, while European suppliers have had mixed fortunes. Dialog Semi is down 42 percent in 2018 after Apple, its biggest customer, decided to scale back orders.Apple’s sprawling supply chain comprises hundreds of companies and it can be difficult to glean an overall picture of demand from speaking to individual firms. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has also warned investors against picking up cues from disparate data points."

200,"May 07, 2018 11:40PM ET",Memory boost: How chipmakers are weathering slowing smartphone sales,nan,"By Joyce Lee and Sayantani GhoshSEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors in global chipmakers have had a rocky ride in the last few months on worries about a slowing smartphone market, but a clamor for more video content from consumers is underpinning buoyant sales for memory-chip makers.Indeed, the earnings reports of various chipmakers and smartphone companies in the past month tell a more interesting story beyond the cooling in phone shipment volumes: smartphone makers are cramming their devices with memory to satisfy the increasing demands of consumers. A case in point is last week's quarterly report from Apple Inc (O:AAPL). The Cupertino, California-based company said the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model in the March quarter - the first cycle ever where the costliest iPhone was also the most sought after. More upbeat assessments from  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), and Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), have also eased concerns.Samsung last month forecast strong sales for ""high-density"" chips that have more processing power and bigger storage capacity - demand that will help it weather a decline in overall smartphone shipments as consumers are willing to pay for costlier and faster models that allow them to easily watch and store large amounts of video.""Even as the number of smartphone shipments slow down, each smartphone will contain memory chips with bigger capacity and better performance, which, for memory chip makers, makes up for a slowdown in the number of total smartphones,"" said Kim Rok-ho, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment.That puts into perspective a warning by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330) of softer smartphone sales, which was partly responsible for the recent selloff in Apple and other chipmakers.The broader concerns about a slowdown in the chip market appear to have eased as well. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), a proxy for global chipmakers that fell sharply from its peak in mid-March on initial iPhone sales concerns, has stabilized in the past two weeks, posting a 4.4 percent rise so far this year.PURE-PLAY MEMORY The $122 billion memory chip industry enjoyed an unprecedented boom since mid-2016, expanding nearly 70 percent in 2017 alone, thanks to robust growth of smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips that can store loads of data. The pace of growth is set to more than halve as memory-chip prices come off their highs, but the outlook remains strong for pure-play memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) and SK Hynix (KS:000660). Micron's shares have risen 18 percent this year and Hynix's stock has gained 8.5 percent. Revenue at Micron, for instance, has grown at an average rate of about 65 percent in the two quarters it has reported this year, and analysts expect it to grow at an average of 30 percent for the rest of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Micron and Hynix both trade at roughly 4 times forward 12-month earnings against a sector median of 16.7, suggesting that the stocks have room to grow. Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN), which are less leveraged to the smartphone market, including those that sell to carmakers, industrial, bitcoin, and gaming companies are well set up too.PROCESSOR CHIPS VULNERABLEAll the same, the slowdown in smartphone shipments is bad news for chipmakers that design microprocessors: each phone needs just one microprocessor chip versus rapid growth of memory content in devices. Global smartphone shipments fell 2 percent in the first quarter, following a 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics.Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors power many popular smartphone models, recently showed just how far it is willing to go to hedge against a slowdown after revenue from its key licensing business slumped 44 percent in the latest quarter.The company, which charges a fee for its chip patents based on a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone, said it would cap the phone price used to calculate that fee at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee. TSMC, whose fortunes are more closely tied with the broader smartphone industry as it is the world's largest contract chipmaker, felt the slowdown more acutely in the latest quarter.Qualcomm and TSMC stocks are down 21 percent and 2.6 percent respectively so far this year. ""The spending cycle (by chipmakers for investment) is continuing, but there may still be volatility similar to the correction in 2015,"" Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg said in a note to clients.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

214,"Apr 19, 2018 05:23AM ET",Publicis and industrials lead the pack as earnings dominate European stocks trading,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Advertising group Publicis and industrial stocks made gains on Thursday as strong results spurred them higher, while the main European indices stalled, showing signs of fatigue after a two-day rally took them to six-week highs. Earnings dominated trading, with Swiss industrial equipment maker ABB (S:ABBN) and French electric components firm Schneider (PA:SCHN) the biggest boosts to the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. ABB rose 3.9 percent after reporting its best start to the year since 2015, while Schneider's profit beat sent its shares up 2 percent. Shares in ABB rival  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also rose 1.5 percent.Advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) shone at the top of the STOXX after delivering a first-quarter sales beat helped by a rebound in North American activities.Its shares jumped 6.1 percent, boosting the media sector (SXMP) up 0.8 percent. ""The fact we have now had a second agency group [after U.S. firm Omnicom on Tuesday] report top-line positive organic revenue growth should reassure on the secular concerns,"" said Liberum analysts.Publicis' British rival WPP (L:WPP) also gained 3.4 percent as the results helped improve sentiment on agencies, which has been very negative.A surge in metals prices, after Russian sanctions sparked concerns over global supply, lifted the basic resources index (SXPP) up 0.4 percent, having soared 4.3 percent on Wednesday.Finnish steel firm Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) gained 2.8 percent, reflecting a rise in Japanese steelmakers overnight after a summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump produced no bad news on tariffs.Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) also rose 2.3 percent.Overall the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) hovered near six-week highs as a weaker healthcare sector outweighed gains in resources stocks. Novartis  (S:NOVN) shares fell 1.8 percent despite the Swiss drugmaker confirming 2018 targets. Baader Helvea analysts pointed to weaker first-quarter performance for its Sandoz drug in the U.S., and lower than expected profitability in the Innovative Medicine segment.Results from Nestle and  Unilever  reignited concerns about large consumer goods firms' pricing power. Unilever (L:ULVR) declined 2 percent after investors focused on weaker pricing which the Chief Financial Officer said was expected, due to difficulties in Brazil, North America and the UK.""We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.Nestle (S:NESN) shares barely budged despite the maker of Kit Kat chocolate confirming its outlook and saying volumes had picked up.Tech stocks also held the STOXX back with chipmakers arms (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), STMicro (MI:STM), and ASML (AS:ASML) all falling after Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) reported weaker than expected results.Merger and acquisition news also drove some big share price moves.  Weir Group  (L:WEIR) shares jumped 5.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm agreed to acquire U.S. mining tools maker ESCO for $1.05 billion.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

224,"Apr 03, 2018 03:40AM ET","Tech, trade fears weigh on European shares",nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled on Tuesday as investors entered the second quarter in a febrile atmosphere of trade tensions and mounting pressure on big technology companies. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) declined 0.8 percent, with industrials, consumer staples and financials the biggest weights.The tech sector (SX8P) dropped 1 percent, weighed by chipmakers after an overnight report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to replace Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips in Macs with its own. The index has fallen 8 percent in the past three weeks as anxiety grew over big tech companies with the focus on Facebook's use of data, and regulation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Reports of Apple increasingly going down the ""insourcing"" route have dented shares in Apple suppliers around the world, most notably Europe's Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) which has shed more than 60 percent in the past year.On Tuesday ams led the falls, down 2.8 percent, while STMicro (MI:STM) declined 2.3 percent and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell 1.7 percent. Risk appetite was poor across the board, as European investors followed U.S. and Asian investors to the exit after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs.Outside the tech sector, food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was the worst-performing on the STOXX, down 3.8 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut the stock to ""neutral"", citing competition and cost inflation.Acquisition news also continued to move the European market. Eurofins Scientific (PA:EUFI) shares fell 2.9 percent, the worst performers on the STOXX, after the firm acquired Lab Frontier in South Korea.Basic resources and oil & gas stocks were a rare bright spot, making gains as metals prices rose.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares in electric car maker Tesla (O:TSLA) fell on Tuesday after a fatal crash and fire prompted a U.S. federal field investigation, while Twitter (N:TWTR) tumbled after short-seller Citron Research called it ""most vulnerable"" to privacy rules.Meanwhile, chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) suspended self-driving car tests, a week after an Uber  autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman in Arizona.Tech was a key driver behind a rally to record highs in global equity markets and investors are concerned that an increase in regulation could spark a further sell-off.""A recent stream of negative news has acted as a trigger for the sell-off in the U.S. tech sector. But the underlying cause... is extremely stretched valuation metrics that have generated a sizeable misalignment with fundamentals, mostly for the big technology stocks,"" said UniCredit in a note. On a price to earnings basis, European and U.S. technology stocks are valued around their highest level in more than a decade. European tech stocks have fallen 9.5 percent from their end-2017 peak but remain among the best sectoral performers in the region over the last year, up 2.5 percent. Top fallers among European tech stocks were chipmakers ams (S:AMS), STMicro (MI:STM) and Infineon (DE:IFXGn).""As concerns semiconductors, the fear comes from the environment of bad news that is accumulating around the functioning and testing of autonomous vehicles,"" IG analyst Alexandre Baradez said.Among banks, big fallers included Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), which all declined by more than 1 percent, after German bond yields fell below 0.5 percent for the first time since early January.The fall in bond yields helped defensive stocks like utilities with steady dividends outperform.Europe's utilities index (SX6P) was the only sector in positive territory, up 0.2 percent, led by a 3.1 percent jump in Britain's  United Utilities  (L:UU), which was underpinned by an upgrade to hold from sell by CFRA.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

238,"Mar 20, 2018 05:48AM ET",Global stocks tread water ahead of Fed meeting,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - Global equities trod water on Tuesday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, while investors reassessed their views of tech stocks following a slump in Facebook's shares after reports of data misuse.The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat in percentage terms by 0901 GMT, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) equity index slipped 0.1 percent.Tech (SX8P) stocks underperformed in Europe as the sector fell 0.3 percent, taking its cue from Monday's falls for U.S. peers on the back of fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data.Shares in European chipmakers in particular came under pressure, with ams (S:AMS), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) all in negative territory, while Germany's SAP (DE:SAPG) declined 0.5 percent, hit by readacross from U.S. business software peer  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), whose quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates. In the U.S., Facebook (O:FB) tumbled 6.8 percent on Monday as the social media colossus faced demands for action from U.S. and European lawmakers following reports that a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign may have improperly gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.Likewise an accident involving an Uber Technologies Inc  car on Monday which resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle further weighed on sentiment around tech.""There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched ... so we're focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,"" Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said. ""We're a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,"" Bell added.Though tech was a weight, Asian shares recovered to end in positive territory thanks to a rise in health stocks.The UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) index slightly outperformed the broader European market, up 0.1 percent, as investors cheered a transition deal reached between Britain and the European Union on Monday.The British pound  was last at $1.4055.However, gains were muted as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional protectionist trade measures. ""Investors lightened their positions ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,"" said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities.In addition, worries about the potential for a trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Trump administration is also expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday.U.S. businesses were alarmed with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China.While long-term U.S. bond yields were muted, short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.857 percent (US10YT=RR), 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago.But the yield on two-year notes (US2YT=RR) hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent on Monday as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates  to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent.Still, with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike. The euro (EUR=) moderated gains, rising to $1.2341 after bouncing on Monday following a Reuters report that European Central Bank officials were shifting their debate from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rates.The yen was little changed at 106.37 per dollar , with traders wary of any new developments in a cronyism scandal that has eroded support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Oil prices edged slightly higher as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) traded at $66.47 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) were $62.66 a barrel.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The euro, whose strength had crimped stocks late last week, eased back from its highs, helping Europe's STOXX 600 index (STOXX) inch up 0.1 percent, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) stayed flat, with most of the activity under the benchmark level. Austria's AMS (S:AMS) soared 25 percent after its 2017 revenue doubled and the iPhone component supplier raised its growth forecasts far beyond analyst expectations. Peers Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), STMicro (MI:STM), and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) all rose, gaining between 1.1 and 5 percent, led by Dialog, whose shares have tumbled since late November.Sanofi (PA:SASY) muscled  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) out of the way to buy  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX), clinching a 3.9 billion euro deal for the Belgian biotech firm. The French pharma giant's shares were down 0.3 percent as traders digested the hefty price tag of 45 euros per share, against Ablynx's closing price of 39 euros on Friday. The offer was a 109 percent premium to Ablynx's share price prior to Novo Nordisk's bid on Jan 8.Ablynx shares were suspended from trading until 1030 local time (0930 GMT), the Belgian market regulator said. Shares in Swedish medical technology group Getinge (ST:GETIb) sank 8.4 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after it reported fourth-quarter profit far below market forecasts, and said 2018 results would be affected by currency transactions. Overall, European stocks kept a decisive cyclical tilt, with miners, autos, financial services and tech all gaining while utilities, food and beverage and real estate stocks slipped. Spain's  Enagas  (MC:ENAG) fell 3.8 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its target price on the stock.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

270,"Jan 11, 2018 04:50AM ET",Results drive sharp moves in European stocks,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European share trading got off to a hesitant start on Thursday as concerns over protectionism and a bond market sell-off made the breakneck New Year rally in equities fizzle out. Results drove the bulk of stock moves, with some disappointments weighing heavily. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and euro zone equities (STOXXE) dipped 0.1 percent, recovering from sharp losses in the previous session when jitters over a report that China was considering slowing purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds spilled over into stocks.A Chinese regulator on Thursday said the report may be ""fake"".Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) meanwhile touched a fresh record, its third in as many days, before falling back to trade down 0.1 percent. UK retailers  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) were among the biggest European fallers after their Christmas trading updates disappointed, with consumers cutting down on non-essential items.Europe's retail sector (SXRP) was the worst-performing, down 0.8 percent as a result, while bank stocks (SX7P), which had jumped on Wednesday as bond yields surged, fell back 0.3 percent.Danish jewellery firm  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) dropped to the bottom of the STOXX, down 13 percent after the company said it expected profit margins to fall in the next few years and reported 2017 revenue below expectations.Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) jumped up 4.2 percent, after its CEO was cleared of insider trading charges.While it was too early in the season to fully determine what impact results were having, investors said earnings would be under particular scrutiny this year as the market hoped for another year of earnings growth. ""You didn't really have any earnings growth coming through since the euro zone crisis, it was a kind of Groundhog Day every year, but 2017 was a break from that effect,"" said Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital. ""The earnings season will be quite important. If Europe can continue demonstrating earnings growth at index level as an asset class it will be very attractive,"" he added. In other big moves, the restructuring French telecoms and cable firm Altice (AS:ATCA) tumbled 5.8 percent, extending Wednesday's slide, after its U.S. unit announced a $500 million junk bond sale.Chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) gained 3.2 percent after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) upgraded the stock to 'outperform', saying margins for the iPhone supplier would continue to expand.Sodexo (PA:EXHO) also fell victim to disappointing results, its shares down 3 percent after the firm reported a slow start to its first quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) also featured among top European fallers.Despite recent weakness, tech stocks have retained a significant lead over all other sector indexes, up by about 21 percent this year. Retail stocks, meanwhile, were set to bring up the rear as the worst-performing, down 3 percent since January.Strength in commodities helped to cap losses across the major benchmarks as liquidity remained thin with many investors still on holiday.Mining stocks rose after metals prices hit 3-1/2 year highs thanks to a strong outlook for growth in China. Glencore  (L:GLEN),  Randgold Resources  (L:RRS) and  Anglo American  (L:AAL) contributed the most to index gains. Oil majors also provided support, with  Total  (PA:TOTF) up 0.6 percent and Shell (L:RDSa) rising 0.8 percent as crude prices held near 2015 highs.German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) gained 0.3 to 0.6 percent after they said late on Friday that the U.S. tax reform would boost 2017 profits to the tune of 1.55 billion euros ($1.84 billion) and 1.7 billion euros respectively.""As only net profit is benefiting and there will be no positive impact on cash flow, we see only a minor impact on valuation of both companies,"" DZ Bank equity strategists wrote in a note.Merger activity continued to spur big stock moves, with British workspace company IWG (L:IWG) leaping by 28 percent after it confirmed a bid approach from Canadian private equity firm Onex and Brookfield Asset Management.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) rose 0.2 percent.Financials contributed the most to gains, with Lloyds (L:LLOY), Santander (MC:SAN) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) rising 1.8 percent to 3.6 percent.Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 0.9 percent as sterling climbed to a two-month high against the dollar.Britain has offered to pay much of what the European Union was demanding to settle a Brexit ""divorce bill"", bringing them close to agreement on a key obstacle to opening talks on a future free trade pact, EU sources said on Tuesday.Shares in internationally exposed FTSE companies such as  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS),  Diageo  (L:DGE) and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) were down more than 2 percent.""With the chance of a soft Brexit rising, the global upturn can now begin to rub off on the UK more,"" Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said in a note.On the STOXX 600, Ocado (L:OCDO) led gains, jumping 16.2 percent and taking gains over the past two days to around 40 percent, after French supermarket Groupe  Casino  (PA:CASP) agreed to use Ocado's e-commerce platform on Tuesday.Casino shares gained a further 3.7 percent on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reiterated its ""overweight"" rating on Ocado and said that they ""remain buyers"".Tech stocks declined the most. Chipmakers STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), AMS (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) lost 3.6 percent to 7.3 percent.European tech stocks (SX8P) saw losses accelerate towards the end of the session, shrugging off a positive earnings update from U.S. peer Marvell Technology (O:MRVL) as investors in the U.S. shunned big tech in favor of financials.European tech has surged 21 percent this year, set to end the year as the region's best-performing sector.The sector was hit earlier this week after Morgan Stanley downgraded Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) on worries a memory- chip boom could peak soon. Broader market sentiment was also lifted by signs of progress on U.S. tax cuts, which offset caution following another missile test by North Korea. The STOXX 600 is still set to end November with a loss, having fallen nearly 2 percent so far this month as investors take profits and earnings growth slows compared with the previous two quarters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It posted a 10 percent drop in revenue in the third-quarter, reflecting a weak market and the effects of a major restructuring.Losses in Nokia and banks, however, were offset by gains among companies including MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn), Neste (HE:NESTE) and STMicro (PA:STM) following strong results.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index was flat at 387.19 points by 0840 GMT, while Britain's FTSE added 0.3 percent and euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) declined 0.2 percent.According to Thomson Reuters data, third quarter earning growth expectations for the STOXX 600 have declined to 3.4 percent from around 10 percent expected in July.A country breakdown shows that earnings of UK companies in the pan-European index are expected to rise 11.2 percent in the third quarter, compared to a fall of 11.8 percent seen for France and a 0.6 percent drop expected for Germany. Italy's earnings growth is seen at 35 percent. A key focus later in the day will be the ECB's policy decision. The central bank is all but certain to cut back on its bond-buying stimulus, taking its biggest step yet in unwinding years of loose monetary policy.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

314,"Oct 09, 2017 03:51PM ET",Apple praises French iPhone work before talking tax with Macron,nan,"By Mathieu RosemainPARIS (Reuters) - Apple (O:AAPL) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm involved with innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes. The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that has tested optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-range iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple's campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices. ""Bravo for your work!"", Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay more in taxes in Europe.""Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,"" Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple.CONSTRUCTIVE TALKSA French presidency official said Macron and Cook did not rake over the past and described the talks about regulating digital platforms and tax policy as constructive and forward-looking.Asked if they had discussed France's proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: ""They didn't go into specifics.""""The tone was very open. This wasn't a posturing competition."" Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added. Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world's most highly valued company. ""They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,"" said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. ""Facial recognition is one of iPhone X's differentiating features."" Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), one of Europe's larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

320,"Sep 21, 2017 11:10AM ET",Exclusive: Chipmaker GlobalFoundries asks EU to investigate bigger rival TSMC - source,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. electronic chipmaker GlobalFoundries has asked European antitrust regulators to investigate market leader TSMC (TW:2330), accusing the Taiwanese firm of unfair competition, an industry source said on Monday. GlobalFoundries is the closest challenger to Taiwan-based TSMC in the foundry, or contract market for making chips for firms without plants of their own, with slightly smaller rivals being UMC (TW:2303) of Taiwan and SMIC (HK:0981) of China.With TSMC holding 58 percent of the market in 2016, according to market research firm IC Insights, it is the world's top foundry and is also the third biggest chipmaker by sales behind Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Intel (O:INTC). GlobalFoundries has told the European Commission that TSMC is unfairly using loyalty rebates, exclusivity clauses and bundled rebates and even penalties to discourage customers from switching to rivals, the source said.The practices, which go back several years, have affected GlobalFoundries' ability to compete, the source said, adding that the tactics escalated after a key GlobalFoundries product started to win new customers.TSMC denied the allegations.""Our customers always have the freedom to choose, which we respect greatly, and they choose us because of the value we deliver toward their long-term success,"" a spokeswoman said.""Any accusation that TSMC threatens or harms customers isabsolutely baseless, and we will vigorously defend our hard-earned trust and our most valued reputation.""Ten years ago U.S. chipmaker Intel was hit with a 1.06 billion-euro fine, a record at the time, for giving rebates to PC makers in order to force out smaller competitors and GlobalFoundries' former joint owner AMD (O:AMD). Companies can be fined up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.EU authorities declined to comment on the claims.""Generally, the Commission monitors possible anti-competitive market practices and abusive conduct. This includes behavior by operators active in the semi-conductor sector,"" a spokesman said.GlobalFoundries said in a formal statement that the EU competition authority should be concerned by the existence of a few dominant players in the semiconductor industry.A spokesman said TSMC has ""a virtual lock on supply"".""It is prudent for the regulator to monitor behaviors more closely and GlobalFoundries will naturally support regulatory agencies as they take a closer look at this key industrial sector for Europe and the world.""TSMC's customers include Apple (O:AAPL), Qualcomm (O:QCOM), Intel, Huawei [HWT.UL], Sony Corp (T:6758) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN).GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Mubadala Technology, a unit of Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Development Company [MUDEV.UL], counts Qualcomm, AMD, Broadcom (O:AVGO) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) amongst its customers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Wall Street set to pull back from record highsAfter Wall Street closed the prior session at record highs, U.S. futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Wednesday as investors locked in profits. At 5:58AM ET (9:58GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures lost 21 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 futures fell 4 points, or 0.14% while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 11 points, or 0.18%.Elsewhere, European bourses showed mixed trade with the pan-European Stoxx 600 set to break a five-day winning streak Wednesday as chipmakers and miners weakened investor sentiment.At 5:59AM ET (9:59GMT), the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.14%, Germany’s DAX inched up 0.09%, while London's FTSE 100 fell 0.47%.Earlier, Asian shares closed broadly higher Wednesday, taking a cue from Wall Street’s record close. Japan’s Nikkei lead advancers ending with gains of 0.44%, while China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.14%.2. Dollar breaks 2-day winning streakThe dollar registered slight losses against major rivals on Wednesday, putting an end to two straight days of gains as investors turned their attention to upcoming U.S. economic data for fresh clues on the timing of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction and its ability to raise interest rates again this year.A report on producer prices is due at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT) Wednesday, followed by closely-watched consumer price inflation data on Thursday.Markets remain skeptical the Fed will raise rates again before the end of this year due to worries over the subdued inflation outlook, but it is widely expected to start the process of reducing its balance sheet sometime this fall.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dropped 0.05% at 91.84 by 6:00AM ET (10:00GMT).3. Apple’s “late” iPhone launch takes toll on chipmakersApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers were struggling on Wednesday after the new iPhone release disappointed with a later than expected shipping date.Apple's new $999 iPhone X will begin shipping on November 3 and there was also concern that the price tag may dent demand for the device in markets such as China.Chipmakers supplying to Apple were among the worst performers Wednesday, with Ams (SIX:AMS) down 3.9%, while Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) lost 0.9% and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) fell 1.1% by 6:01AM ET (10:01GMT).4. Jamie Dimon calls bitcoin a fraudJP Morgan chief exec Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a “fraud"" at a conference late Tuesday.""It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,"" Dimon said, adding that he would fire any of his employees trading in the cryptocurrency.“You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” he argued.Dimon's criticism added to concerns about China's banning of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and pushed the digial currency below the $4,000 level on Wednesday in what has recently be considered the most crowed trade in the market.On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin tumbled 5.33% or $221.20 to $3,928.20 by 6:02AM ET (10:02GMT).5. Oil rises on IEA forecast for strong demandOil prices were on the rise on Wednesday as the International Energy Agency predicted that global demand was set to accelerate at its fastest pace in two years and increased its 2017 growth estimates.Traders also looked ahead to official U.S. crude inventory data 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT). Analysts expect crude oil inventories rose by around 3.2 million barrels at the end of last week.If confirmed, it would mark the second weekly gain in a row.After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories increased by roughly 6.2 million barrels in the week ended September 8, beating expectations for a build of approximate 6.0 million.U.S. crude oil futures gained 1.04% to $48.73 at 6:03AM ET (10:03GMT), while Brent oil traded up 0.64% to $54.62."

[MET/L]Euro zone stocks and blue chips (STOXX50E) held steady, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), which touched its highest in nearly two months on Tuesday, fell back 0.1 percent.Chipmakers supplying to Apple (O:AAPL) were among the worst performers, with AMS (S:AMS) down 3.9 percent, while Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) slipped 1.7 percent and STMicro (MI:STM) fell 1.1 percent.Traders said their shares were under pressure due to Apple's new $999 iPhone X shipping later than expected, on November 3. The price tag could also dent demand for the device in markets such as China.""With the iPhone coming in around $1,000 it will be interesting to see how healthy demand is,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.""If it's relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and that consumers have confidence.""Chipmakers have been the best performing among Europe's tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector's outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. Richemont  (S:CFR) fell 1.6 percent despite reporting a sales beat for its first half thanks to a recovery in the Asian luxury market. UBS analysts said weaker retail growth may weigh on sentiment.Peer Swatch (S:UHR) also fell 2.5 percent, with some traders citing concerns that Apple's new watch could also dent the watchmaker's shares.The merging eyewear and lens makers  Luxottica  (MI:LUX) and Essilor (PA:ESSI) were also among the biggest fallers, down 1.9 to 2.1 percent. EU antitrust regulators were set to tell the firms of concerns they have over the merger this week.Covestro (DE:1COV) was among a handful of risers, up 2.7 percent after German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (DE:BAYGn) sold a 9.4 percent stake in the firm, in order to finance part of its acquisition of  Monsanto  (N:MON).European stocks were struggling for a further boost after sinking 7 percent over the summer months.""Our view is that European equities still have potential for upside,"" said JPMAM's Bell.""The earnings outlook is quite strong still; Europe has among the highest operating leverage of any major market so if the global economy remains strong that should drive margin expansion and earnings growth."""

334,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

335,"Aug 01, 2017 09:30AM ET",German chipmaker Infineon to supply Tesla Model 3,nan,"By Eric Auchard and Irene PreisingerFRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Infineon (DE:IFXGn) will supply parts to Tesla's upcoming mass-market Model 3 electric car, the German chipmaker said on Tuesday, after being beaten out as initial supplier by Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) for the coveted deal.Infineon, which supplies chips to control the batteries and motors in eight out of 10 of the world's top selling electric vehicles, confirmed its parts would go into the Model 3, which is now ramping up for volume production in 2018.""We do not comment on the individual models, but we will also will be present in Model 3,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss told reporters after Infineon reported third-quarter operating profit just ahead of analysts' consensus forecast. The German company's products are already in Tesla's Model S sports car, the world's top-selling electric vehicle, but the Model 3 - costing $35,000 in the United States - has the potential to significantly outsell the $60,000 Model S. STMicroelectronics was first to market with a new class of highly energy efficient 1,200-volt silicon-carbide chips, which brokerage Liberum said helped it win the initial deal to supply power chips for the Model 3. But it predicted Infineon would become a second source of such chips as volumes ramp next year. Last Friday, Tesla (O:TSLA) delivered the first 30 Model 3s to employee buyers, part of more than half a million advance reservations. (http://reut.rs/2tVmxlp)While its presence in the Model 3 could be a boost, Ploss said most of the demand for Infineon's electric vehicle parts would continue to come from Asia. ""Our success is very much dependent on Asia,"" he said.The company reaffirmed its projection for 8-11 percent revenue growth for the year ending in September, and said its annual operating profit margin, excluding certain items, would be unchanged around 17 percent. Infineon shares, which had slipped in early trading, picked up after Ploss signaled it had a renewed appetite for mergers. The stock was up 1.7 percent at 18.70 euros at 1315 GMT.Ploss said the company ""continues to explore various acquisition options"" after its agreed $850 million deal to buy the Wolfspeed power unit of Cree (O:CREE) collapsed under U.S. government scrutiny earlier this year.Ploss told reporters on a conference call that Infineon remained interested in deals in the American market, but would be sure to steer clear of technology the U.S. government considers vital to national security.Revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended in June was roughly in line with expectations, up 12.2 percent on the same period a year ago to 1.83 billion euros.Quarterly operating income, excluding certain items, rose 33 percent to 338 million euros ($400 million), compared with analysts' average forecast of 323 million in a Reuters poll.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

349,"Jun 13, 2017 04:57PM ET","Big investors, unfazed by techs' roller coaster, buy 'FANG' stocks",nan,"By David RandallNEW YORK (Reuters) - Large investors, whose high exposure to large-cap technology stocks boosted their returns during the first quarter of the year, are doubling down on their investments even as stocks like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) stumble. Fund managers such as T Rowe Price and Federated Investors, who were already overweight the sector, said they were buying beaten-down so-called 'FANG' stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - during a two-day selloff that marked the largest tech sector decline in nearly a year. Google, Apple and other large tech stocks rose modestly in morning trading Tuesday.Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund , said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy.With other secular growth stories hard to find, ""It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'"" he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines. Analysts expect the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM), which have lagged in 2017. ""This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity,"" said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc (O:MU), Applied Materials Inc (O:AMAT),  Arista Networks  Inc (N:ANET) and STMicroelectronics NV (PA:STM).In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing.COMEBACK OF THE 'TRUMP TRADE?'The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring. In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund. Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple. Momentum-based technology stocks have ""built a valuation air pocket underneath (them) creating cause for pause,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday.Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year. Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged. ""It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done,"" he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

352,"Jun 12, 2017 09:33AM ET","Tech sell-off spreads to Europe and Asia, Nasdaq seen falling further",nan,"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Technology stocks fell heavily across Europe and Asia on Monday and were set to fall again on Wall Street after the worst day for Apple (O:AAPL) shares in more than a year, while easing political tensions lifted the euro and European bonds.The tech-heavy Nasdaq was seen opening down 0.8 percent (NQc1) after an almost 2 percent drop on Friday, its third biggest one-day loss of the year. (N)""This is the nature of the tech sector. Valuations do from time to time become very stretched and they come back and anyone who has paid a very high valuation might experience some short-term pain,"" said Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital.A near 4 percent slump in Apple (O:AAPL) on Friday, along with falls in Alphabet (O:GOOGL), Facebook (O:FB) and others took a heavy toll on rivals including Samsung (KS:005930) and Europe's big chipmakers STMicro (PA:STM) and Dialog (DE:DLGS) on Monday. (EU)While year-to-date Nasdaq gains of more than 15 percent have outperformed the wider market, an ebbing of the Trump reflation trade and a slide in U.S. economic surprises deep into negative territory have prompted some investors to review the mix of their portfolios. Europe's tech index (SX8P) fell 3.5 percent to put it on track for its biggest one-day loss since Britain's Brexit vote a year ago. The index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month having soared around 40 percent over the last year.""It is pretty healthy to have some form of correction in the tech sector to distribute the flows into other sectors,"" said ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) Chief Investment Officer Didier Duret.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.8 percent, supported by modest gains in oil prices, which lifted shares in energy stocks, and by first round French parliamentary election results which look set to give President Emmanuel Macron a huge majority to push through pro-business reforms.Italy also offered some support after the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement failed to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs in local elections.Italian government bond yields fell to their lowest since January  and Portugal's to nine-month lows , while French bonds closed the gap on Germany. [GVD/EUR]""Macron doing well in the first round of the French parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank.""The fact that 5-Star did poorly in local elections in Italy also suggests a setback for populism in Europe.""The euro rose back to $1.1220  in the currency markets, where anticipation is building ahead of Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting at which the central bank is expected to nudge up U.S. interest rates.But economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump has dented confidence.Britain's sterling was in focus again as it slipped back below $1.27  [GBP/] and 88.30 pence per euro (EURGBP=) as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to prop up her position after last week's damaging election.A survey from one of the UK's biggest business groups showed confidence had been hit hard by the uncertainty left by the election ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations with the EU next week. May's plans for leaving the bloc had not changed, her spokesman said on Monday. ""It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders,"" said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors.""The consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy."" FEDS UPThe G10 economic surprise index, covering the world's 10 leading economies, has dipped below zero for the first time in 8 months.

366,"May 04, 2017 03:20AM ET",Infineon second-quarter oper profit slightly below expectations,nan,"By Harro Ten WoldeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) on Thursday stuck with its full-year guidance, which it raised in March, after reporting slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly operating profit.The maker of chips that enable cruise control in cars and warn drivers of potential collisions said operating profit excluding special items rose to 296 million euros ($322 million) in the fiscal second quarter.That was slightly below the average forecast for 299 million euros in a Reuters poll, in which individual estimates of 11 analysts ranged from 273 million euros to 303 million.Infineon said it still expected full-year revenue to rise by 8 to 11 percent, with an operating margin of around 17 percent. ""The favorable market development we saw in the first quarter of the fiscal year has continued into the second three-month period. Current order situation gives us good reason for optimism,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said in a statement.Infineon, whose customers include premium carmakers such as  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Tesla (O:TSLA) as well as automotive supplier Continental (DE:CONG), in March raised its full-year guidance on the back of strong demand from China for its automotive chips.Since that announcement, Infineon's shares have gained more than 10 percent and hover around a 15-year high.Sales at Infineon's automotive unit grew by 11 percent to 783 million euros in the second quarter, accounting for 44 percent of group sales.""The increase was attributable to growing demand in all product areas, particularly also for components installed in driver assistance systems as well as hybrid and electric vehicles,"" the company said.Just like other chipmakers, Infineon is benefiting from a rise in automakers' spending on electric and self-driving cars as they feel the pressure from new competitors from outside the sector such as Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google and Apple (O:AAPL).Earlier STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN) reported a rise in profits on the back of spending on chips which enable all kinds of devices and cars to connect to the Internet.Infineon shares are indicated to open 1.3 percent lower, according to pre-market date of brokerage Lang & Schwarz, at the bottom of the German blue chip index (GDAXI), which is expected to open 0.2 percent higher.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

375,"Apr 11, 2017 10:56AM ET","Apple may ditch Dialog, analyst says, hitting chipmaker's shares",nan,"By Eric Auchard and Harro Ten WoldeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) risks losing a crucial supply deal with Apple Inc (O:AAPL), according to a financial analyst who cut his rating on the stock on Tuesday, sending the Anglo-German chipmaker's shares down by as much as one-third.Bankhaus Lampe reduced its rating on Dialog to ""sell"" from ""hold"" as it argued that Apple was working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone that could replace Dialog's power management integrated circuits (PMIC) as early as 2019.Apple accounted for more than 70 percent of Dialog's 2016 sales, analysts estimate. The German company says it is the world's top maker of power management chips used in smartphones with roughly 20 percent of the market.Shares in Dialog fell as much as 36 percent on Tuesday to a seven-month low. They had more than doubled in the second half of 2016 on rising expectations for the iPhone 8 due out later in 2017. Dialog said it saw no business reason for the share drop and that it remained comfortable with its financial outlook for ""good revenue growth"" in 2017, which would mark a recovery from a 12-percent decline last year.""The company notes the level of visibility into the design cycle of its leading customers remains unchanged and the business relationships are in line with the normal course of business,"" it said in a statement.By 1340 GMT, the Dialog shares had pared losses and were 15 percent lower at 40.49 euros ($42.97).Apple's suppliers are in the spotlight after  Imagination Technologies  (L:IMG) last week revealed Apple's plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house, sending shudders through Apple's global supply chain. Imagination's stock plunged 70 percent.Bankhaus Lampe cited unnamed industry sources as saying that Apple was setting up power management design centers both in Munich and California and said Apple already had around 80 engineers working on a power management chip of its own.""In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen said, referring to power management chips.Lampe's Iltgen is a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Dialog and ranks sixth among 16 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data.A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Apple was recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich. ""They are poaching like crazy,"" the person said.Apple declines to comment on matters involving its supplier relationships and did not respond to a request for comment for this story.A trader with brokerage Exane, who said he had been in contact with Dialog management, said investors were overreacting to speculation that Dialog might lose Apple's business.He said Dialog has completed designs for chips that Apple plans to use in 2017 and 2018 iPhone models while it continues to discuss with Apple using its parts in 2019 phones.The trader also said Apple would need to hire more than 1,000 engineers to completely replace the power management chips supplied by Dialog.HIGHLY DEPENDENTThe downside of having Apple as a customer is that smaller suppliers can become dependent on its business due to the huge sales volumes generated by new iPhone contracts.Dialog has made several attempts to diversify beyond Apple and other smartphone customers in the past few years. In 2014, merger talks between Dialog and Austrian sensor chip maker  Ams AG  (S:AMS) fell apart after they failed to come to terms. Its plans to buy U.S.-based Atmel in 2015 were derailed after Microchip (O:MCHP) swooped in with a higher bid.Apple has outsourced production of its hardware products to an extended network of suppliers, large and small, while it has moved over the past decade to design its own central processors and added functions like fingerprint recognition since then.Over the past dozen years, Apple suppliers CSR, PortalPlayer, Sigmatel and Wolfson have been replaced, pushing them eventually to merge with more diversified players.But Apple still relies on key suppliers to develop innovations ranging from image and motion sensors to power management. Other chip suppliers for the current iPhone 7 include, but are not limited to, Cirrus Logic (O:CRUS), NXP (O:NXPI), Qualcomm (O:QCOM), Skyworks (O:SWKS), STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), according to an analysis by TechInsights in September.Shares in highly diversified chipmaker STMicro, which analysts believe supplies light sensors for iPhones, fell 3.6 percent, weighing on the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 Technology (SX8P) index, which was down 1.5 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

378,"Mar 31, 2017 05:01AM ET",Investors bet on a quiet tech revolution in Europe,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - It's not banking or mining shares, but rather technology stocks, that have come up trumps in Europe this year and are poised to end the first quarter as the best-performing sector.European tech companies often pale in comparison to the glamor of peers across the pond such as Facebook (O:FB),  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and Amazon (O:AMZN), and are dwarfed in terms of market value. The U.S. sector, at $4.3 trillion, is worth more than eight times Europe's. Investors, however, have been quietly buying into a European industry they see as being at the heart of disruptive digital developments across a slew of sectors.Tech stocks (SX8P) in Europe have risen nearly 12 percent in the first quarter, outstripping the broader market (STOXX), which is up 4.8 percent, and also their performance in the first three months of last year when they fell 5.4 percent.Driverless cars, iris-scanning technology and augmented reality are just a handful of the themes at play globally in which European companies such as STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), Infineon Technologies  and SAP (DE:SAPG) are involved. Many European software firms are involved in corporate back-offices, keeping systems efficient and running - a less headline-grabbing side of the tech sector but one that can be important for companies across all industries looking to cut costs.""Every consumer is exposed to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), or Facebook, or Twitter ... something like SAP, which actually is in most corporations, is less visible to the end consumer,"" said Marcus Morris-Eyton, European equities portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. Tech now accounts for nearly a quarter of Morris-Eyton's portfolio, and SAP is his biggest position. AUTOMATIONThe mining sector was the standout performer in Europe over the course of 2016, gaining 61.9 percent, followed by oil stocks which rose 22.9 percent - far ahead of technology firm shares which were up 3.4 percent. Banking stocks endured a turbulent first half, dragged down by problems in the Italian sector, but after hitting a low in July they rallied almost 47 percent to the end of the year.These trends were expected to continue into 2017, but so far banks are only up 4.6 percent in the first quarter, miners are up 6.2 percent and oil stocks are down more than 3 percent.Like many sectors, the commodities and financial industries have since last week been hit by investor concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump may not be able to deliver on all his tax and infrastructure pledges, after his healthcare plans were blocked.Tech is less exposed to immediate political and economic developments, according to analysts, and are more governed by long-term global trends in technologies such as automation, driverless cars and augmented reality.""(In tech) there's always this level of innovation that keeps people engaged and keeps people investing for those opportunities almost irrespective of the economic cycle,"" said Steve Sherman, senior portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).Flows into tech have been strong globally, with tech sector-focused funds seeing the biggest inflows year-to-date since 2009, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).Likewise Europe-listed robotics and automation exchange-traded fund (ETF) ROBO (ROBOT) hit a new record high last week and saw record monthly inflows in February of $80.6 million. ABB (S:ABBN) and  Krones  (DE:KRNG) are among its top 10 holdings. TIME OF FLIGHTThe move toward digitization across industries has market participants particularly excited. Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts highlighted SAP's S/4 HANA enterprise cloud software which helps integrate data and applications, and also its new product line for the ""internet of things"" (IOT) - where everyday objects are connected to networks to send and receive data.At Evenlode, one of Britain's best-performing investment funds last year, portfolio manager Hugh Yarrow holds stocks such as Sage (L:SGE) and Relx (L:REL) whose digital analytics are being increasingly used in law, accountancy and finance.In more traditional sectors of tech, chip makers such as Infineon , STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) are closely linked to Apple (O:AAPL) and the iPhone cycle. Infineon shares have surged to a record high.Stuart Mitchell, manager of the SWMC European Fund at S.W. Mitchell, is betting big on STMicro. The stock, up 33 percent this year, is the fund's biggest holding.Mitchell said that he became interested in the stock when its share price fell after its loss-making set-top boxes business went belly up last year.He reckons STMicro's role in the auto industry with its car chip business and time of flight (TOF) technology - which is used in sensors - means it will surprise with its quick growth. Neil Campling, global head of TMT Research at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets, said he expected opportunities in areas such as semiconductors, automated vehicles, sensors and virtual and augmented reality. ""The tech industry in Europe may not be as big in terms of revenue ... as the U.S. is, but it has a critical role to play in basically what is, without doubt, a digital revolution that is global in nature,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

382,"Mar 24, 2017 12:00PM ET",Infineon raises 2017 outlook on stronger automotive orders,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) raised its outlook for the second quarter and for its 2017 financial year, citing better-than-expected orders for the chips it makes for cars.Infineon said it expected 2017 revenue to rise by between 8 and 11 percent, with an operating margin of around 17 percent. Its chips manage functions such as enabling airbags and managing car power supplies.It said in February it expected revenue to rise around 6 percent, with an operating margin of around 16 percent. Analysts said at the time the outlook was conservative, especially given its strong position in the automotive sector.Chips made by Infineon are used by carmakers including Tesla (O:TSLA) and Hyundai (KS:005380) as well as auto parts suppliers Continental (DE:CONG) and Bosch [ROBG.UL] to enable cruise control and cut emissions.Infineon is the world's second largest semiconductor supplier to the car sector, with a market share of 10.4 percent according to Strategy Analytics, behind NXP (O:NXPI) with 14.2 percent.The automotive unit accounts for more than 40 percent of revenues at Infineon.""Due to the stronger than expected development of revenues and order entry, higher investments in property, plant and equipment will be required,"" the company said in a statement on Friday.Investments are expected to rise to 1.05 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in the fiscal 2017 year, up from a previously expected 950 million euros.Like its peers NXP, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), Renesas (T:6723) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN), Infineon is riding the automotive wave as carmakers rush to develop electric and self-driving cars, pushed by tougher anti-pollution rules and the emergence of new competitors from the technology sector such Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google.Infineon shares extended gains after the statement, hitting a 15-year high of 18.71 euros. They were up 8.5 percent by 1445 GMT (10:45 a.m. ET), at the top of the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 Technology (SX8P) index, which was up 1.1 percent.Last month the chipmaker had give up trying to buy Wolfspeed Power, a unit of U.S. LED lighting maker Cree (O:CREE), after the U.S. government voiced security concerns over the acquisition.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

410,"Dec 02, 2016 06:32PM ET",Obama bars China's Fujian from buying Aixtron's U.S. business,nan,"By Matthias Inverardi and Diane BartzFRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama blocked a Chinese investment fund from acquiring the U.S. business of German semiconductor equipment maker  Aixtron  (DE:AIXGn) because the deal posed a risk to American national security, the Treasury Department said on Friday.Obama's executive order barring China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of a German company with American assets was one of few such instances in which a U.S. president has blocked a transaction due to national security concerns. His action appeared to be based on concerns about China gaining access to the secrets of producing a material called gallium nitride used in military equipment.In 2012, Obama ordered Ralls Corp, owned by China's Sany Group, to sell its interest in wind farms near sensitive U.S. naval installations in Oregon.An Aixtron spokesman said the FGC deal would be called off if Obama took such action. Aixtron has said scrapping the proposed deal would mean it would have to take action to balance income and costs, including potential job cuts.The Treasury Department said Obama was blocking the deal following an assessment by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency task force that the department leads. ""The national security risk posed by the transaction relates, among other things, to the military applications of the overall technical body of knowledge and experience of Aixtron, a producer and innovator of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and technology,"" the department said.Gallium nitride, a powdery yellow compound used in light-emitting diodes (LED), radar, antennas and lasers, is grown using Aixtron-manufactured technology, which has in the past been sold to U.S. military equipment maker  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC).The Treasury Department, in announcing the order, noted that Aixtron makes equipment for the semiconductor industry, including Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems used to grow crystalline layers for semiconductors, especially those based on gallium nitride.Gallium nitride technology can boost the power and sensitivity of weapons systems while cutting their cost because it needs less electricity. The technology is being used to upgrade the radars of both American and foreign-owned Patriot missile defense systems.CFIUS never gives reasons for its decisions. But sources have previously told Reuters it blocked the $3.3 billion sale of Philips' (AS:PHG) lighting business, Lumileds, to a consortium of Chinese investors last January over gallium nitride concerns.AIXTRON'S FUTUREChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday that the deal was ""normal commercial activity"" and that China hoped the world would not interfere politically.The German Economy Ministry withdrew its approval for the deal in October and is now doing its own review of the transaction. It said the German process was independent of the U.S. scrutiny.Analysts have said Aixtron has a bleak future as a stand-alone company as it struggles with market overcapacity. Aixtron had 713 employees at the end of the third quarter, 5 percent less than a year ago.A fall in Aixtron's shares took them below Grand Chip Investment's offer price of 6.00 euros per share. The stock is hovering around a nine-month low.Bigger chipmakers such as Germany's Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and French-Italian STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) were also slightly lower, shrugging off fears of an M&A slowdown following two years of consolidation of the global semiconductor industry.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

411,"Dec 02, 2016 12:30PM ET","Aixtron will have to cut costs, jobs if U.S. blocks China deal",nan,"By Matthias Inverardi and Harro Ten WoldeFRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Aixtron  (DE:AIXGn) will have to take action to balance income and costs, including potential job cuts, if U.S. President Barack Obama blocks its takeover by China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC).Shares in the German semiconductor equipment maker fell more than 5 percent on Friday following a report by Bloomberg, citing sources, that said Obama was poised to block the deal.An Aixtron spokesman said it had not received a ruling, but that the deal would be called off if Obama formally blocked it.Last month, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) recommended that Aixtron's sale to the Chinese investment fund be stopped due to security concerns. ""After the decision in the U.S. management will have to put their heads together. Costs and income need to be balanced again,"" the spokesman said. Loss-making Aixtron has said it would have to cut jobs and scale down if the transaction fails. Aixtron had 713 employees at the end of the third quarter, 5 percent less than a year ago.Analysts consider Aixtron has a bleak future as a stand-alone company as it struggles with market overcapacity.Tim Wunderlich, analyst at German brokerage Hauck & Aufhaeuser, said last month when it became clear the deal might be blocked that Aixtron needed a white knight from Europe or the United States to have a viable future.The fall in Aixtron's shares took them below Grand Chip Investment's offer price of 6.00 euros per share. The stock is hovering around a nine-month low and was the biggest faller in the STOXX Europe 600 Technology (SX8P), which was down 1.7 percent.Other semiconductor companies in Europe were hit. ASML (AS:ASML), the second most valuable European tech stock, fell 2.4 percent. The Dutch company had also come up against national security hurdles with SIFIUS 15 years ago, but eventually succeeded in buying U.S. based rival Silicon Valley Group.Midcap European chipmakers, seen as possible M&A targets, were also down, including Anglo-German Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), down 4.4 percent, Austria's AMS (S:AMS), down 3.3 percent and BE Semiconductor, down 2.6 percent.But analysts and traders said a report that Apple Inc (O:AAPL) was cutting orders for iPhone 7 components could also have put pressure on Dialog and AMS shares.Bigger chipmakers such as Germany's Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and French-Italian STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) were only slightly lower, shrugging off fears of an M&A slowdown following two years of consolidation of the global semiconductor industry.GALLIUM NITRIDE AND NANOTUBEU.S. concerns over China gaining access to the production of gallium nitride - a powdery yellow compound used in light-emitting diodes (LED), radar, antennas and lasers which is made using Aixtron-manufactured technology - was the main reason for the U.S. block, security sources said.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday that the deal was ""normal commercial activity"" and that China hoped the world would not interfere politically.CFIUS never gives reasons for its decisions. But sources have previously told Reuters it blocked the $3.3 billion sale of Philips' (AS:PHG) lighting business, Lumileds, to a consortium of Chinese investors last January over gallium nitride concerns.Another source told Reuters that Aixtron's nanotube technology acquired through its 2007 acquisition of a Cambridge-based company Nanoinstruments was a concern too. Their products also have military applications.The German Economy Ministry, which withdrew its approval for the deal in October and is now doing its own review of the transaction, said the German process was independent of the U.S. scrutiny.(additional reporting by Anneli Palmen in Duesseldorf, Eric Auchard in Frankfurt, Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Michael Martina in Beijing)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

425,"Oct 11, 2016 07:20AM ET",Infineon buys Dutch firm in push to control driverless cars,nan,"By Eric AuchardFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Infineon Technologies AG (DE:IFXGn) has acquired Dutch electronics company Innoluce BV, a designer of miniature ""lidar"" laser-scanning modules that the German chip giant says can help it develop affordable sensor systems for driverless cars.The German firm's head of its automotive business said on Tuesday the acquisition of Innoluce will help it drive down the cost of light detection and ranging sensors (lidar) for use in guidance systems for mass-market vehicles.""We intend to make lidar an affordable feature for every new-built car worldwide,"" Peter Schiefer said in a statement.Lidar employs laser beams to measure the distance to objects near a vehicle, enabling car control systems to identify road ways, traffic signs, pavement markings, and overhead bridges and other potential obstacles.But early versions of the sensor devices developed by Silicon Valley-based firm Velodyne lidar that were used by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its self-driving car project cost $75,000 per vehicle.Newer versions of lidar sensors cost just one-tenth of that price and Velodyne and rivals such as Quanergy are aiming to drive the cost down to hundreds of dollars per unit by miniaturizing the bulky roof-top devices.Innoluce produces the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) modules that incorporate tiny mirrors controlled by a computer chip that can be used to direct laser beams in the sensor systems.Financial terms of the purchase of Innoluce, a spin-off from the electronics group Philips (AS:PHG), were not disclosed. The company was founded in 2010 and is based in Nijmegen, on the Dutch-German border.Infineon's biggest rivals in the car market are also racing to develop chips to control and drive the sensors required for autonomous driving, including NXP (O:NXPI) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The tie-up is likely to focus on technology being developed by Mobileye (N:MBLY) to give computer-driven vehicles better reflexes without driver input, ushering in an era of self-driving cars early in the next decade, analysts said.The three companies said they would hold a joint news conference on Friday, without giving details. It will be attended by BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger, Intel (O:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich and Mobileye Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Amnon Shashua, they said.Automakers and technology firms are striking new alliances to commercialize self-driving cars after being caught off guard by big investments by Silicon Valley companies such as Google (O:GOOGL), Tesla (O:TSLA) and Apple (O:AAPL) into the field.This week German carmakers, auto-suppliers and map makers HERE and TomTom (AS:TOM2) agreed a standard that would govern how road and vehicle performance data is transmitted from Internet-connected cars to cloud-based online services, enabling more automated traffic management and car management services.Earlier in June, BMW, the world's largest luxury carmaker by sales, said it would launch a new flagship model with autonomous driving capability in 2021. (http://reut.rs/2861tb5)""We anticipate that Intel has been tapped to provide the (central processor unit) needed at the vehicle level, the computer that coordinates the myriad components of the car in combination with Mobileye's ... software,"" Evercore financial analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in note to clients. Intel is the world's biggest computer chipmaker and has been seeking to break into the market for automotive chips where rivals NXP (O:NXPI), Renesas (T:6723), Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) have long held sway.Mobileye is the top supplier of camera-based sensor systems used in driver assistance systems in the latest generation of vehicles. These systems are used for changing lanes and to detect other cars or pedestrians but are expected to evolve to include mapping and automated decision-making features.AUTONOMOUS DRIVING ALLIANCESTerms of the three-way deal are not yet known, nor is it clear how the pact between Intel and Mobileye might affect the Israeli firm's long-standing partnership with French-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), which manufactures Mobileye sensor systems.A spokesman for STMicroelectronics declined to comment.In May, Mobileye and STMicro said they had agreed to extend a 12-year-old partnership to develop a fifth-generation Mobileye system, which they said would provide fully autonomous driving features for cars due to hit the road around 2020.These new systems will revolve around a computer chip, or central processing unit, that controls some 20 sensors throughout each vehicle, including the windshield and car bumpers, connected to radar systems, Mobileye and STMicro said.BMW, which has been a key customer of Mobileye systems dating back to its first-generation of sensors in 2007, is one of five automakers expected to deploy Mobileye's fourth-generation safety systems for new cars beginning in 2018, which primarily focus on object detection as cars move down the road.Citi said in a research note that a BMW-Intel-Mobileye tie-up was likely to focus on Mobileye's fifth-generation chips, dubbed EyeQ5, which move beyond safety features to offer real-time road mapping and driving policy, which dictates how a vehicle interacts with other cars or roadside objects.In recent months, Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (N:GM) and Nissan (T:7201) agreed to use EyeQ5 systems in future car fleets and  Tesla Motors  has re-committed to using Mobileye technology for hands-free driving in its electric cars.Speaking at a William Blair investor conference in mid-June, Mobileye Chief Financial Officer Ofer Maharshak said his company would have more customers for these new systems to announce in coming months. ""You know three are already engaged, Nissan, VW, and GM. We are going to have four or five - between four to five others in the next months, up to the beginning of 2017,"" he said.""First full autonomous car on the roads, 2021 timeframe. It's going to be probably announced in the coming weeks,"" Maharshak declared.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

468,"Nov 18, 2015 12:05PM ET",Power chip maker ON Semi to buy Fairchild to head off competition,nan,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Lehar Maan(Reuters) -  ON Semiconductor  Corp (O:ON) is to buy Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc (O:FCS) for $2.4 billion to bolster its business of making power-management chips, the latest in a rapidly consolidating industry.Semiconductor M&A globally has topped $80 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, as companies seek to cut costs, meet demand for cheaper chips and diversify portfolios.While ON Semi rival STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) has said it has no M&A plans for now, Infineon's (DE:IFXGn) acquisition of International Rectifier in January was the most recent deal that posed a direct competitive threat for ON Semi. Analysts said ON Semi's move for Fairchild was most likely to keep it out of the hands of a competitor, including China's Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd, which aims to be the world's No.3 chipmaker.FBR's Christopher Rolland said Tsinghua would ""probably be top of the list"" of firms that ON Semi's move aimed to thwart.Fairchild's shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to $19.56, below the offer price of $20. ON Semi's shares fell as much as 11.3 percent. The company plans to take on $2.4 billion in new debt to fund the deal, nearly tripling its debt load.The combined company will have annual revenue of $5 billion, with revenue overlap of less than $100 million and little product overlap, said Keith Jackson, chief executive of ON Semi, which had revenue of $3.16 billion in 2014. ON Semi and its rivals' power-management circuits are used in everything from aircraft to home appliances and automobiles to computers.Fairchild, an industry pioneer, has been struggling to boost revenue growth recently due to slowing demand – a story not too different from that of other chipmakers.Jackson said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further consolidation in the industry.Recent deals have spanned various sectors:  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) moved for  Altera Corp  (O:ALTR) to boost its data center business, while Avago (O:AVGO) targeted  Broadcom Corp  (O:BRCM) to expand its wireless chip business.China's Tsinghua has spent more than $9.4 billion in two years, including on buying a stake in U.S. data storage company  Western Digital  Corp (O:WDC), and it plans to invest $47 billion over the next five years.Tsinghua's chairman told Reuters on Monday the state-backed firm was in talks with a U.S.-based company involved in the chip industry.Deutsche Bank and BofA Merrill Lynch are ON Semi's financial advisers and Morrison & Foerster its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is advising Fairchild and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is its legal counsel.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

469,"Nov 11, 2015 10:10AM ET",STMicro has no plans for M&A until growth revives: CEO,nan,"By Eric AuchardBARCELONA (Reuters) - Europe's largest chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) reiterated on Wednesday that mergers and acquisitions were not a priority for now as its focuses on boosting sales and restructuring its digital products division.Speaking at the annual  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) TMT conference in Barcelona, Spain, ST Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti said he could not rule out M&A becoming important for ST in the future, but it is ""not on the table today"".""Our priority is No. 1: growth, and No. 2: resolve the problem in our digital products group,"" Bozotti said.The Franco-Italian chipmaker has refrained from taking part in a global consolidation wave in the semiconductor industry over the past year that continues at a breathless pace. It's two biggest rivals in Europe, Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and NXP (O:NXPI), have both agreed deals. Germany's Infineon closed its biggest merger earlier this year, while Dutch chipmaker NXP is set to overtake ST as Europe's biggest chipmaker once it completes a deal to buy Freescale (N:FSL).Instead, ST, whose products are used in everything from car parts to phones, has throttled back production and slashed new capacity amid an industry-wide business slowdown which began in China and has spread to other regions. ST reported a 6.5 percent decline in third-quarter net revenue, well below already muted analyst expectations.Bozotti said on Wednesday the company saw no improvement in customer bookings during October, the first month of its fourth quarter. It has forecast fourth-quarter revenue will decline by 6 percent, plus or minus 3.5 percent, which would result in revenue of about $1.65 billion, far below the $1.83 billion analysts had previously predicted.ST has signaled that the declines could drag on into the first quarter of next year. The company postponed spelling out plans for its struggling digital products group until early next year, saying only that it had narrowed its options to include job cuts or the sale of the business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

483,"Jul 22, 2015 10:56AM ET",$5.7 billion wiped off European tech shares after Apple outlook disappoints,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Top European technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value on Wednesday, with suppliers for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the top fallers after the tech giant's revenue forecasts fell short of expectations.While the worst hit were the handful with 20-70 percent direct exposure, the whole sector suffered as investors cautioned against frothy valuations, with the STOXX Europe 600 tech index (SX8P) trading well above its historical average.The European technology index lost 5.7 billion dollars of market capitalization, led lower by a 6.5 percent slump in Germany's Dialog Semiconductors and a 5.1 percent fall in British-listed ARM Holdings (L:ARM).Apple orders accounted for around 70-75 percent of Dialog's total revenue, industry experts said, while Apple accounted for 20-25 percent of ARM's processor royalties last year.While Apple's biggest suppliers, such as Intel (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), are American, Apple is a large customer of many smaller European companies.Dialog, which makes chips for Apple, lost $287 million, while ARM, which licenses chip designs for use in Apple products, saw $1.7 billion knocked off its value.Dialog remains up 67 percent so far this year, and trades at valuations over 15 percent higher than its historical averages.""We have nothing against Apple, but expectations on that side of the market are a little bit too high and that the reason we now don't have any Apple-related stocks,"" said Anko Beldsnijder, managing director of MainFirst Asset Management.Austria's Ams AG fell 2.9 percent. Its technology is used in the Apple watch, though in June a Swiss newspaper reported it would miss out on a valuable new Apple contract.Shares in European companies with smaller direct exposure to Apple such as Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) also fell by around 5 percent, with investors saying sentiment around technology stocks in general had turned negative.The STOXX Europe tech index trades at a price of 18.7 times its 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of 16.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. It trades at a premium to every other sector apart from telecoms and healthcare stocks.Tech consultancy Gartner said in April it forecast a 4 percent rise in semiconductor sales worldwide in 2015 but warned that stronger dollar, excess inventories and end of PC upgrade cycle were seeing ""mounting concerns"".ARM's drop came as the chip-designer's reported results that were broadly in line with expectations, saying that Apple's outlook would not change its view of second half trading.Veronika Pechlaner, fund manager at Ashburton, said the resilience of royalties from Apple last quarter was a good sign, and that ARM had enough other diverse streams of revenue to withstand a slight Apple slowdown.""Looking at the share price now, we could be nearing a buying opportunity. We still like ARM in the longer term, even in the context of weaker Apple earnings, as there are lots of opportunities outside handheld devices,"" Pechlaner said.She added that Dialog would be more sensitive to Apple sales, and that after today's fall investors would reconsider their position in the stock in the coming days.""We still own it, it's a question of whether we still want to continue to own it, whether we add to it here, or if the Apple concentration is a problem in the longer term. It's definitely a stock to revisit after this."""

492,"May 29, 2015 01:47PM ET",Apple buys German augmented-reality software maker Metaio,nan,"By Harro Ten WoldeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) has acquired Metaio, a German company whose technology melds real-world imagery and computer-generated elements into moving video presentations, according to a corporate filing. The terms were not disclosed. Metaio's previous investors included Westcott LLC, the investment vehicle of entrepreneur Carl Westcott, the founder of floral delivery firm 1-800-Flowers (O:FLWS), and Atlantic Bridge, a Silicon Valley-based growth equity technology fund.A document filed with a Munich court showed that Apple is now the company's sole shareholder. Metaio's augmented-reality software is used in applications in retail, industrial and automotive markets. Metaio technology is used to create virtual product showrooms and by retailers such as IKEA [IKEA.UL]. It has also created visual manuals for repairing complex industrial or automotive equipment.Augmented reality is software that overlays text or graphics on real-life images and objects, typically in video. The result can be viewed on TV displays, smartphones, tablets or dedicated eye-goggles. It differs from virtual reality, which replaces real-world views with more or less completely simulated ones.Steffen Sorrell, an analyst with technology market research firm Juniper Research, said Apple, which builds custom computer chips it uses in a range of products, could incorporate Metaio's intellectual property to differentiate its products.This could give Apple a jump on rivals who are working to develop augmented reality semiconductors but remain at least 18 to 24 months away from delivery, the analyst said. This technology was co-developed with ST-Ericsson, the former joint venture between mobile network equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM). Potential applications using Metaio's low-power consumption technology could include mobile handsets and or smart-glasses, Sorrell speculated. In mobile phones, the Apple-Metaio combination could pose a challenge to current market leader Qualcomm (O:QCOM), which owns augmented reality maker Vuforia. Metaio executives didn't respond to requests for comment and Apple issued a statement but provided no details. ""Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not comment on our purpose or plans,"" the statement said.Westcott and Atlantic Bridge were not immediately available to comment.The roots of Munich-based Metaio go back to German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), where Thomas Alt, its co-founder and chief executive, began developing augmented-reality applications in 2000.Jupiter estimates that augmented-reality technology used in enterprises will increase tenfold to $2.4 billion from $247 million last year. Other companies in the emerging field include France's Total Immersion and UK-based Blippar, which last year bought Layar from the Netherlands.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

510,"Oct 10, 2014 09:08AM ET",Warnings from chipmakers point to wider economic slowdown ,nan,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Demand for electronics devices is weakening, according to circuit makers at the base of the industry's food chain, suggesting a long-predicted slowdown in global economic growth may be coming to pass.September, the peak month for shipping tiny chips used to build everything from appliances to cars to phones and office equipment if they are to reach consumers and businesses by year end, has not seen its typical pickup after the summer holidays.In recent weeks, a series of U.S. semiconductor makers with global operations have begun to paint a worrying picture of a broad-based slow down in markets including autos and network equipment in regions ranging from Asia to Europe.The weakness is centered in China, which functions as the electronics workshop for many finished products destined to ship worldwide. It may also be a sign of how pessimistic Europe's retailers are feeling ahead of the key Christmas trading season, with the euro zone in danger of sliding back into recession.On Thursday came the remarkably blunt warning from diversified chipmaker Microchip (O:MCHP) of a broad-based industry downturn, or correction, suggesting worse may be in store as the latest corporate earnings season gets underway.""We believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future,"" Microchip Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said of the sales fall-off in its latest quarter.Semiconductor analysts struggle to find chipmakers which might be insulated from signs of a wider economic downturn.""Any place to hide?"" asked BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava in a note to clients. ""For the time, it appears not.""INVENTORY WORRIESShares in major European chipmakers suffered sharp declines on Friday, led by Germany's Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), which was off 5.8 percent. STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) lost 5.4 percent and ASML Holding (AS:ASML) gave up 3.5 percent.Meanwhile, financial analysts who track inventory levels up and down the electronics industry supply chain have grown concerned by signs of a year-over-year build-up in inventories among sales distributors, contract and component manufacturers.While some stockpiling is inevitable in the current busy manufacturing season, the worry among investors is that this may be disguising even weaker demand for finished products.Warnings have also come from niche semiconductor companies including EZchip Semiconductor, which cited weak orders from telecom equipment maker customers, and O2 Micro, which said several of its notebook PC customers were suffering weak demand.Microchip is considered a proxy for broader demand across the global semiconductor industry because it is a highly diversified supplier of electronic components to some 80,000 customers, which in turn use its digital and analogue devices in finished products.The company is also an early indicator because it recognizes revenue when its distributors book sales to customers rather than simply when Microchip itself ships its products, meaning there is less lag in seeing fundamental shifts in market demand.China suffered a sales decline during the last three months where normally it would enjoy strong sequential growth compared with the June quarter, Microchip said in a statement.Microchip responded by cutting back production levels in its wafer fabrication and test and assembly facilities, it said.The company expects to return to sequential revenue growth in two quarters, assuming that the current imbalance in supply and demand follow normal industry recovery patterns, it said.Ahead of Microchip's warning late on Thursday, the semiconductor industry was enjoying an upbeat year, overall. The 30-stock Philadelphia Semiconductor Index had gained 13.8 percent in the year to date.(Editing by Mark Potter)"
